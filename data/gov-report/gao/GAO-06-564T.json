When considering complementary programs, projected investment costs for FCS are estimated to be on the order of $200 billion. FCS's cost is of concern given that developing and producing new weapon systems is among the largest investments the government makes, and FCS adds significantly to that total. Over the last 5 years, the Department of Defense (DOD) doubled its planned investments in such systems from $700 billion in 2001 to $1.4 trillion in 2006. At the same time, research and development costs on new weapons continue to grow on the order of 30 to 40 percent. FCS will be competing for significant funds at a time when federal fiscal imbalances are exerting great pressures on discretionary spending. In the absence of more money being available, FCS and other programs must be executable within projected resources. Today, I would like to discuss (1) the business case needed for FCS to be successful and (2) our recent recommendations to DOD and matters for congressional consideration regarding the FCS program."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["There are a number of compelling aspects of the FCS program, and it is hard to argue with the program's goals. However, the elements of a sound business case for such an acquisition program--firm requirements, mature technologies, a knowledge-based acquisition strategy, a realistic cost estimate, and sufficient funding--are not yet present. FCS began product development prematurely in 2003. Since then, the Army has made several changes to improve its approach for acquiring FCS. Yet today, the program remains a long way from having the level of knowledge it should have had before starting product development. FCS has all the markers for risks that would be difficult to accept for any single system, much less a complex, multiprogram effort. These challenges are even more daunting in the case of FCS not only because there are so many of them but because FCS represents a new concept of operations that is predicated on technological breakthroughs. Thus, technical problems, which accompany immaturity, not only pose traditional risks to cost, schedule, and performance; they pose risks to the new fighting concepts envisioned by the Army. Last month, we made recommendations to the Secretary of Defense to take several actions, prior to DOD's long-term commitment to the program, to improve the FCS business case and establish knowledge-based measures to guide oversight of FCS progress. These recommendations detailed specific steps DOD should take leading up to a major milestone review of the program in 2008 when the program is expected to have achieved the level of knowledge it should have had in 2003. We believe it is at this point the program should be reviewed as to whether it has established enough of a solid business case to continue. While DOD concurred with the intent of our recommendations, it did not agree to limit its commitment to the FCS program or to do much beyond what it had already planned to do. This concerns us. As a result, we have also raised to Congress several matters for consideration to ensure that FCS has a sound business case before future funding commitments are made. We believe the actions we have recommended to DOD and the matters for consideration we have presented to Congress are necessary to improve the prospects for FCS success and to protect the government's ability to change course if the program does not progress as the Army plans."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss the Department of the Army\u2019s  Future Combat System (FCS), a networked family of weapons and other  systems.

Fiscal imbalances faced by the federal government will continue to  constrain discretionary spending. One of the single largest investments the  government makes is the development and production of new weapon  systems. Over the last 5 years, the Department of Defense (DOD) has  doubled its planned investments in new weapon systems from about $700  billion in 2001 to nearly $1.4 trillion in 2006.

The Army is reorganizing its current forces into  modular brigade combat teams, meaning troops can be deployed on  different rotational cycles as a single team or as a cluster of teams. The  Future Force is designed to transform the Army into a more rapidly  deployable and responsive force and to enable the Army to move away  from the large division-centric structure of the past. Each brigade combat  team is expected to be highly survivable and the most lethal brigade-sized  unit the Army has ever fielded. The Army expects FCS-equipped brigade  combat teams to provide significant warfighting capabilities to DOD\u2019s  overall joint military operations. The Army is implementing its  transformation plans at a time when current U.S. ground forces are playing  a critical role in the ongoing conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.", "The FCS family of weapons includes 18 manned and unmanned ground  vehicles, air vehicles, sensors, and munitions linked by an information  network. These vehicles, weapons, and equipment will constitute the  majority of the equipment needed for a brigade combat team. The Army  plans to buy 15 brigades\u2019 worth of FCS equipment by 2025. See figure 1 for  the various elements of the FCS program.", "If successful, the FCS system-of-systems concept will leverage individual  capabilities of weapons and platforms and will facilitate interoperability  and open system designs. This would be a significant improvement over  the traditional approach of building superior individual weapons that must  be retrofitted and netted together after the fact. This transformation, in  terms of both operations and equipment, is under way with the full  cooperation of the Army warfighter community. In fact, the development  and acquisition of FCS is being accomplished using a uniquely  collaborative relationship among the Army\u2019s developers, the participating  contractors, and the warfighter community."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "FCS Restructures the Program and Changes Contracting Approach", "paragraphs": ["As a key element of its efforts to transform itself, the Army has recognized  FCS from its outset as the greatest technology and integration challenge it  has ever undertaken. In May 2003, DOD approved the FCS program to  begin the system development and demonstration phase, a milestone that  ideally marks the completion of technology development and the start of  product development. However, FCS\u2019s entry into this phase was  premature given the program had failed to satisfy basic tenets of DOD  acquisition policy. We have reported that, as FCS started product  development, it did not have mature technologies or adequately defined  requirements.", "Responding to direction from the Army Chief of Staff, the Army  announced in July 2004 its plans to restructure the FCS program. The  Army added 4 years to develop and mature the manned ground vehicles,  added more demonstrations and experiments, and established an  evaluation unit to demonstrate FCS capabilities. The restructuring  reintroduced 4 systems that previously had been left unfunded, raising the  total number of FCS-related systems to 18. The restructure also included  plans to spin off mature FCS capabilities as they become available to  current force units. With the restructuring, the FCS program now plans to  achieve initial operational capability in fiscal year 2015 and full  operational capability in fiscal year 2017. FCS low-rate production is  expected to start in fiscal year 2012, and full-rate production in fiscal year  2016. The Army intends to continue FCS procurement through fiscal year  2025, eventually equipping 15 brigade combat teams.", "The restructuring was not the only major modification to the FCS  program. Because of congressional concerns that the Army\u2019s contracting  approach incorporated insufficient safeguards to protect the government\u2019s  interests, the Army is preparing a new contract that is to be completed and  finalized in late March 2006 and is based on the Federal Acquisition  Regulation, which governs acquisitions within the federal government. The  new contract will incorporate standard Federal Acquisition Regulation  clauses such as those relating to procurement integrity, Truth in  Negotiations, and Cost Accounting Standards. Previously, the lead systems  integrator had been performing FCS work for the Army under a  contractual instrument called an \u201cother transaction agreement\u201d that was  not subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulation. The other transaction  agreement gave the Army considerable flexibility to negotiate the terms  and conditions for contractors involved in FCS development. The Army\u2019s  purpose for using such an agreement was to encourage innovation and to  use its wide latitude in tailoring business, organizational, and technical  relationships to achieve the program goals. In April 2005, the Army  decided to incorporate into its agreement the procurement integrity, Truth  in Negotiations, and Cost Accounting Standards clauses from the  regulation.", "After Congress raised questions about the Army using an other transaction  agreement for the development of a program as large and risky as FCS and  about the Army\u2019s choice not to include standard Federal Acquisition  Regulation clauses in the agreement, the Secretary of the Army directed  that the other transaction agreement be converted to a Federal Acquisition  Regulation-based contract. All of the work performed under the product  development phase as of September 2005 will be accounted for under the  prior other transaction agreement, and all work after September 2005 will  be performed under the new contract. The Army expects the content of  the program\u2014its statement of work\u2014will remain largely the same, and it  does not expect the cost, schedule, and performance of the overall  development effort to change materially."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Elements of a Business Case", "paragraphs": ["We have frequently reported on the importance of using a solid,  executable business case before committing resources to a new product  development.

In essence, knowledge supplants risk over time.  This building of knowledge can be described as three levels, or knowledge  points, that should be attained over the course of a program:    First, at program start, the customer\u2019s needs should match the  developer\u2019s available resources\u2014mature technologies, time, and  funding. An indication of this match is the demonstrated maturity of  the technologies needed to meet customer needs.", "Second, about midway through development, the product\u2019s design  should be stable and demonstrate it is capable of meeting performance  requirements. The critical design review takes place at that point of  time because it generally signifies when the program is ready to start  building production-representative prototypes.", "Third, by the time of the production decision, the product must be  shown to be producible within cost, schedule, and quality targets and  have demonstrated its reliability, and the design must demonstrate that  it performs as needed through realistic system-level testing.", "The three knowledge points are related in that a delay in attaining one  delays the points that follow.

Given that, an improved business case for the FCS program is essential to  help ensure the program is successful in the long run.

Now  the Army and its contractors are working to complete the definition of  system-level requirements, and the challenge is in determining if those  requirements are technically feasible and affordable. Army officials say it  is almost certain some FCS system-level requirements will have to be  modified, reduced, or eliminated; the only uncertainty is by how much. We  have previously reported unstable requirements can lead to cost, schedule,  and performance shortfalls. Once the Army gains a better understanding of  the technical feasibility and affordability of the system-level requirements,  trade-offs between the developer and the warfighter will have to be made,  and the ripple effect of such trade-offs on key program goals will have to  be reassessed.

Some of FCS\u2019s critical technologies may not  reach a high level of maturity until the final major phase of acquisition, the  start of production. The Army considers a lower level of demonstration as  acceptable maturity, but even against this standard, only about one-third  of the technologies are mature. We have reported going forward into  product development without demonstrating mature technologies  increases the risk of cost growth and schedule delays throughout the life  of the program. The Army is also facing challenges with several of the  complementary programs considered essential for meeting FCS\u2019s  requirements. Some are experiencing technology difficulties, and some  have not been fully funded. These difficulties underscore the gap between  requirements and available resources that must be closed if the FCS  business case is to be executable.", "Technology readiness levels (TRL) are measures pioneered by the  National Aeronautics and Space Administration and adopted by DOD to  determine whether technologies are sufficiently mature to be incorporated  into a weapon system. Our prior work has found TRLs to be a valuable  decision-making tool because they can presage the likely consequences of  incorporating a technology at a given level of maturity into a product  development. The maturity levels range from paper studies (level 1), to  prototypes tested in a realistic environment (level 7), to an actual system  proven in mission operations (level 9). Successful DOD programs have  shown critical technologies should be mature to at least a TRL 7 before the  start of product development.", "Table 1 shows that in the latest independent FCS technology assessment,  none of the critical technologies are at TRL 7, and only 18 of the 49  technologies currently rated have demonstrated TRL 6, defined as  prototype demonstration in a relevant environment. None of the critical  technologies may reach TRL 7 until the production decision in fiscal year  2012, according to Army officials. Projected dates for FCS technologies to  reach TRL 6 have slipped significantly since the start of the program. In  the 2003 technology assessment, 87 percent of FCS\u2019s critical technologies  were projected to be mature to a TRL 6 by 2005.

Review at this point can help reveal key technical  and engineering challenges and can help determine if a mismatch exists  between what the customer wants and what the product developer can  deliver. An early preliminary design review is intended to help stabilize  cost, schedule, and performance expectations. The critical design review  ideally occurs midway into the product development phase. The critical  design review should confirm the system design is stable enough to build  production-representative prototypes for testing.", "The FCS acquisition schedule indicates several key issues:    The program did not have the basic knowledge needed for program  start in 2003.

Because uncertainties remain regarding FCS\u2019s requirements and the Army  faces significant challenges in technology and design maturity, we believe  the Army\u2019s latest cost estimate still lacks a firm knowledge base.  Furthermore, this latest estimate does not include complementary  programs that are essential for FCS to perform as intended, or the  necessary funding for spin-outs. The Army has taken some steps to help  manage the growing cost of FCS, including establishing cost ceilings or  targets for development and production. However, program officials told  us that setting cost limits may result in accepting lower capabilities. As  FCS\u2019s higher costs are recognized, it remains unclear whether the Army  will have the ability to fully fund the planned annual procurement costs for  the FCS current program of record. FCS affordability depends on the  accuracy of the cost estimate, the overall level of development and  procurement funding available to the Army, and the level of competing  demands.", "At the start of product development, FCS program officials estimated that  the program would require about $20 billion in then-year dollars for  research, development, testing, and evaluation and about $72 billion to  procure the FCS systems to equip 15 brigade combat teams. At that time,  program officials could only derive the cost estimate on the basis of what  they knew then\u2014requirements were still undefined and technologies were  immature. The total FCS program is now expected to cost $160.7 billion in  then-year dollars, a 76 percent increase. Table 2 summarizes the growth of  the FCS cost estimate.", "According to the Army, the current cost estimate is more realistic, better  informed, and based on a more reasonable schedule. The estimate  accounts for the restructure of the FCS program and its increased scope,  the 4-year extension to the product development schedule, the  reintroduction of four systems that had been previously deferred, and the  addition of a spin-out concept whereby mature FCS capabilities would be  provided, as they become available, to current Army forces. The estimate  also reflects a rate of production reduced from an average of 2 brigade  combat teams per year to an average of 1.5 brigades per year. Instead of  completing all 15 brigades by 2020, the Army would complete production  in 2025. This cost estimate has also benefited from progress made in  defining system-of-systems requirements.", "Figure 3 compares the funding profiles for the original program and for the  latest restructured program.", "The current funding profile is lower than the original through fiscal year  2013, but is substantially higher than the original after fiscal year 2013. It  still calls for making substantial investments before key knowledge has  been demonstrated. Stretching out FCS development by 4 years freed up  about $9 billion in funding through fiscal year 2011 for allocation to other  Army initiatives. Originally, FCS annual funding was not to exceed $10  billion in any 1 year. Now, the cost estimate is expected to exceed $10  billion in each of 9 years. While it is a more accurate reflection of program  costs than the original estimate, the latest estimate is still based on a low  level of knowledge about whether FCS will work as intended. The cost  estimate has not been independently validated, as called for by DOD\u2019s  acquisition policy. The Cost Analysis Improvement Group will not release  its updated independent estimate until spring 2006, after the planned  Defense Acquisition Board review of the FCS program.", "The latest cost estimate does not include all the costs that will be needed  to field FCS capabilities. For instance,    Costs for the 52 essential complementary programs are separate, and  some of those costs could be substantial. For example, the costs of the  Joint Tactical Radio System Clusters 1 and 5 programs were expected  to be about $32.6 billion (then-year dollars).", "Some complementary programs, such as the Mid-Range Munition and  Javelin Block II, are currently not funded for their full development.  These and other unfunded programs would have to compete for  already tight funding.", "Procurement of the spin-outs from the FCS program to current Army  forces is not yet entirely funded. Procuring the FCS items expected to  be spun out to current forces is expected to cost about $19 billion, and  the needed installation kits may add $4 billion. Adding these items  brings the total required FCS investment to the $200 billion range.", "Through fiscal year 2006, the Army will have budgeted over $8 billion for  FCS development. Through fiscal year 2008, when the preliminary design  review is held, the amount budgeted for FCS will total over $15 billion. By  the time the critical design review is held in 2010, about $22 billion will  have been budgeted. By the time of the production decision in 2012, about  $27 billion will have been budgeted.", "The affordability of the FCS program depends on several key assumptions.  First, the program must proceed without exceeding its currently projected  costs. Second, the Army\u2019s annual procurement budget\u2014not including  funds specifically allocated for the modularity initiative\u2014is expected to  grow from about $11 billion in fiscal year 2006 to at least $20 billion by  fiscal year 2011. Even if this optimistic projection comes to pass, FCS  annual procurement costs will dominate the Army procurement funding. If  the Army budget remains at fiscal year 2011 levels, FCS procurement will  represent about 60 to 70 percent of Army procurement from fiscal years  2014 to 2022. With the remainder, the Army will have to address current  force upgrades, including spin-outs from FCS, the procurement of FCS  complementary programs, aviation procurement, trucks, ammunition, and  other equipment.

As it prepares the next defense plan, the  Army will face the challenge of allocating sufficient funding to meet the  increasing needs for FCS procurement in fiscal years 2012 and 2013.  According to an Army official, if all the needed funding cannot be  identified, the Army will consider reducing the FCS procurement rate or  delaying or reducing items to be spun out to current Army forces.
