Over the 3 years, more than 1.6 million beneficiaries will have had to switch to a different plan, or the fee-for-service program, because the plan in which they were enrolled no longer serves their geographic area.", "These withdrawals are of special concern to policymakers not only because of the disruptions they cause for beneficiaries, but because the Medicare+Choice program, created by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA), was designed to expand beneficiaries\u2019 health plan options. The act included payment changes and other provisions to encourage the wider availability of health maintenance organizations (HMO) and permitted other types of health plans, such as preferred provider organizations, to participate in Medicare.", "The Medicare+Choice program was also expected to improve Medicare\u2019s financial posture by better controlling spending growth. Before the BBA\u2019s enactment, a number of studies\u2014conducted by us and other government and independent researchers\u2014concluded that Medicare spent more on beneficiaries enrolled in managed care plans than it would have spent if these individuals had received care through traditional, fee-for-service (FFS) Medicare.The reason was that Medicare\u2019s payment method\u2014which provides plans a fixed, per-enrollee payment, regardless of the enrollee\u2019s actual health care costs\u2014did not adequately account for the fact that health plans tended to attract a disproportionate number of healthier-than- average beneficiaries with lower-than-average health care costs.Accordingly, the BBA contained provisions to adjust plan payments to better reflect the expected health care utilization of Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in plans.", "Industry representatives believe that the earlier studies\u2019 findings are no longer valid because the mix of beneficiaries enrolled in plans has changed. They claim that as Medicare\u2019s managed care program matured and more beneficiaries enrolled in plans, the health status differences between FFS beneficiaries and plan enrollees that may have previously existed largely disappeared\u2014particularly in areas where a relatively high percentage of beneficiaries are enrolled in plans. Industry representatives contend that the BBA\u2019s payment rate changes were so severe that Medicare is no longer a sufficiently profitable line of business for many plans. They also have stated that the payment changes have caused many plans to reduce coverage for non-Medicare services, such as outpatient prescription drugs, that help attract beneficiaries to plans. Consequently, industry officials argue, Medicare must increase payments to maintain plan participation in the Medicare+Choice program.", "To assist congressional deliberations on Medicare+Choice payment issues, you asked us to determine (1) whether program spending for Medicare+Choice plan enrollees has exceeded what Medicare-covered care for these beneficiaries would have cost in the FFS program and (2) the extent to which payments to individual plans differ from expected FFS costs. To conduct our study, we analyzed FFS and Medicare+Choice payment data maintained by the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), the agency that administers Medicare. Specifically, we analyzed the 1997 FFS claims history of nearly 800,000 beneficiaries who enrolled in a plan for the first time in 1998\u2014the most recent years for which complete data were available. We adjusted these costs to reflect the fact that over time enrollees\u2019 FFS costs likely approach the average cost of demographically similar FFS beneficiaries. Finally, we compared these estimated costs with the actual capitation payment the plans received, and developed plan-specific and aggregate measures of excess payments or underpayments. Our study included 210 of the 346 Medicare+Choice plans that were in operation in 1998.These plans enrolled 87 percent of all beneficiaries in Medicare+Choice plans. Our work was done from September 1999 to July 2000 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

Policymakers have therefore looked to managed care plans to curb unnecessary spending. Plans have a financial incentive to provide care efficiently because they receive a fixed monthly amount for each beneficiary, regardless of what the individual enrollee\u2019s care actually costs. These potential efficiencies cannot result in actual savings for Medicare if plan payments are higher than beneficiaries\u2019 expected FFS costs. Before 1998, plan payment rates were based on average local FFS spending. Although payments were adjusted for certain beneficiary characteristics such as age and sex, this adjustment did not adequately account for differences in enrollees\u2019 health and expected health care costs. The BBA changed how plan payments were calculated beginning in 1998 and, beginning in 2000, required adjustments to make payment rates better reflect differences in beneficiary health status."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Medicare+Choice Payment Method Built on Experience With Risk Contract HMO Payments", "paragraphs": ["Before 1998, Medicare\u2019s HMO capitation rates, established separately for each county, were set at 95 percent of the estimated average cost of care for the FFS population. The rates were discounted 5 percent under the assumption that the managed care plans provided care more efficiently than the less-restrictive FFS program and that the government should share in the savings. Under this methodology, county rates varied widely because they reflected the substantial differences in FFS per-beneficiary spending among counties. In 1997, for example, county rates ranged from a low of $221 per month in Arthur County, Nebraska, to a high of $767 in Richmond County (Staten Island), New York. The rates paid to plans for enrollees were also adjusted up or down in an attempt to account for estimated cost differences among beneficiaries due to variations in health care needs\u2014a refinement known as risk adjustment.", "Risk adjustment is necessary because individuals differ in the extent to which they use various health care services and their health care costs vary accordingly. Medicare\u2019s risk adjuster has relied on beneficiary age, sex, and other demographic factors to predict expected health care utilization. This demographic-based risk adjuster could reflect only gross differences\u2014 such as the lower expected health care costs of 65-year-olds relative to 80- year-olds. If two individuals shared the same demographic characteristics, Medicare paid plans the same amount for both of them, even if one was in poor health and required extensive medical care while the other was in excellent health and rarely needed to see a physician.", "Consequently, if a plan attracted a disproportionate share of beneficiaries in better-than-average health, an outcome known as favorable selection, Medicare\u2019s payments to the plan would exceed the expected FFS cost of providing Medicare-covered benefits to the plan\u2019s enrollees.Our 1997 study of Medicare payments to California HMOs found that, on average, payments exceeded the expected FFS costs of the plans\u2019 enrollees by approximately 19 percent in 1995.Other studies have also found substantial excess plan payments.", "A 1996 survey of Medicare beneficiaries also indicated that plans likely experienced favorable selection (see table 1). Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in plans were more likely than beneficiaries in the FFS program to report that they were in good or excellent health. Moreover, these health status differences translate into cost differences. For example, in 1996, average per-person Medicare FFS spending for beneficiaries who reported they were in excellent health was approximately $2,100, whereas for beneficiaries reporting poor health the average was about $11,700."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The BBA Changed Payment Methodology and Required Improved Risk Adjustment", "paragraphs": ["In establishing the Medicare+Choice program, the BBA also changed the methodology used to set plan payments. Although 1997 county rates formed the foundation for county rates in 1998 and subsequent years, annual rate increases were no longer tied to changes in local FFS spending. Specifically, each county\u2019s rate was to be set at the highest of a minimum amount, or \u201cfloor,\u201d set at $367 in 1998 and increased an amount 2 percent higher than the previous year\u2019s county rate; or an amount reflecting a blend or weighted average of the county rate and a price-adjusted national rate.", "The floor was meant to encourage plans to offer services in areas that historically had low payment rates and few if any participating plans\u2014 primarily rural counties. The blended rate\u2014which is to be phased-in over 6 years\u2014was designed to reduce the geographic variation in rates that had resulted from tying county rates to local FFS. The blending mechanism moves all county rates closer to the national average by assigning above- average payment rate increases to low-payment-rate areas, and below- average payment rate increases to high-payment-rate areas.", "The BBA also sought to reduce the excess in Medicare\u2019s managed care payments by holding down per capita rate increases for 5 years. Specifically, the BBA set the annual factor used to update floor and blended payment rates equal to the projected national growth in per capita Medicare spending minus a specified percent: 0.8 percent in 1998 and 0.5 percent in each of the following 4 years.", "In 1998, 1999, and 2001 no county received a blended rate.Instead, counties were either assigned the floor payment rate or the 2-percent minimum increase. This occurred because of a budget neutrality provision in the BBA. The law specified that estimated total Medicare+Choice payments should equal the amount that would have been spent if 1997 county rates had been trended forward by the national annual update factor. However, national per capita spending grew relatively slowly and the guaranteed 2-percent increase and floor payments pushed total estimated Medicare+Choice spending above the budget neutrality amount in these 3 years. The blending provision could not be implemented because doing so would have further increased spending.If low-payment-rate counties received higher than average payment rate increases, the additional spending could not be offset by lowering the increases in the high-payment-rate counties because those counties were guaranteed a 2- percent minimum increase.", "The BBA required HCFA to develop and implement a health-based risk adjuster by January 1, 2000.The law authorized HCFA initially to collect hospital inpatient data from plans and later to collect more comprehensive medical encounter data to use in developing the risk adjuster. HCFA announced a phase-in schedule that called for gradually applying an interim risk adjuster, based on hospital admissions data only, first to a fraction (10 percent) of a plan\u2019s Medicare payments and then to greater shares each year.", "HCFA proposed to apply an improved risk adjuster, based on a more comprehensive set of medical services, to 100 percent of payments by 2004.

Approximately $3.2 billion of the $5.2 billion difference was the result of inadequate risk adjustment. That is, Medicare payments were not adjusted sufficiently to account for the generally better health, and lower expected costs, of plan enrollees.Excess payments due to inadequate risk adjustment will persist as long as there is favorable selection and plan payment rates do not sufficiently account for beneficiary health status. The remaining $2 billion resulted from errors in the Medicare spending forecasts used to establish the 1998 county payment rates.

Our analysis suggests beneficiaries who have been plan members for several years continue to use fewer health care services than FFS beneficiaries, although the gap is much narrower.", "Medicare\u2019s risk adjustment methodology, unchanged in 1998 from previous years, did not adequately address differences in beneficiary health status. While health plans tended to enroll less-expensive beneficiaries, Medicare\u2019s payments were too generous because they were based on the expected costs of enrollees in average health.Consequently, we estimate that in 1998 Medicare paid plans an average of 13.2 percent more than it would have spent if the plans\u2019 enrollees had received care under the traditional FFS arrangement.

The first year of plan-submitted data on beneficiaries\u2019 service use indicates that full implementation of the interim risk adjuster would have reduced plan payments by about 5.9 percent in 2000.Its failure to eliminate more of the excess payments may be due to its reliance on limited data. The interim risk adjuster uses only certain hospital inpatient data to measure beneficiary health status because those are the only service-level data plans provide to HCFA. Although it represents a significant improvement over the previous methodology based strictly on demographic data, a risk adjuster that used more complete beneficiary data could set payments that better reflect beneficiaries\u2019 expected health care costs.

The BBA\u2019s guaranteed 2-percent minimum annual increase and other payment provisions can also cause payment rates to deviate from expected per capita FFS spending. Our analysis indicates that the combination of a spending forecast error and the BBA payment provisions resulted in aggregate plan payments that exceeded enrollees\u2019 estimated FFS costs by approximately 8 percent, or $2 billion, in 1998.", "HCFA estimates that the 1997 county rates were set too high and overstated average FFS spending by about 3 percent. Prior to the BBA, this error would have had a limited effect on future county rates because rates in each subsequent year were based on spending forecasts that were corrected for previous errors.In establishing the Medicare+Choice program, however, the BBA specified that 1997 county rates be used as the basis for all future county rates and did not allow an adjustment for prior forecasting errors.", "Under the prior methodology, HCFA would have increased average 1998 rates by approximately 1 percent. Instead, nearly all Medicare+Choice plans received the BBA\u2019s 2-percent minimum payment rate increase in 1998. Plans that served beneficiaries living in counties subject to the floor rate received higher rate increases. In contrast to the payment rate increases received by plans, per capita FFS spending on the aged actually declined by about 3 percent between 1997 and 1998. Thus, even without considering the effects of favorable selection, the combination of the forecast error in the 1997 rates and the minimum annual rate increase resulted in $2 billion in excess payments to Medicare+Choice plans in 1998.", "Although it may take more than 5 years, the effect of the 1997 forecast error will be largely mitigated by the BBA provision that slows Medicare+Choice rate increases relative to the growth in FFS spending between 1998 and 2002. Furthermore, the BBA does allow HCFA to correct post-1997 forecast errors when setting 1999 and later county rates. However, the agency\u2019s actions are constrained by the law\u2019s minimum payment provisions. For example, 2001 payment rates would be lowered by more than 1 percent if HCFA fully corrected the 1998, 1999, and 2000 FFS spending estimates and applied the reduced update factor.

Medicare+Choice plans must, at a minimum, provide all of the services available to beneficiaries under the traditional FFS program. However, plans have typically provided substantial additional benefits, such as reduced beneficiary cost sharing, coverage for outpatient prescription drugs, dental care, and routine vision care, while charging modest or no premiums. Plans offered some of these additional benefits to fulfill Medicare requirements. If a plan projects that its Medicare revenues will be higher than the projected cost of providing basic Medicare services, the plan must contract to deliver additional benefits at no additional cost to beneficiaries. Many plans, however, exceeded these minimum requirements and voluntarily provided extra benefits in an effort to retain existing members and attract new ones. Based on data submitted by plans, HCFA estimates that Medicare+Choice plans are using 22 percent of their Medicare revenues to provide additional benefits in 2000.

The vast majority of plans in our study (201 out of 210) served beneficiaries who tended to be healthier than FFS beneficiaries and thus received payments that exceeded their enrollees\u2019 expected FFS costs. Nine plans, however, served beneficiaries who were generally less healthy than FFS beneficiaries. Medicare paid these plans less than it would have spent to serve these plans\u2019 members in the FFS program.Nevertheless, the widespread finding of excess payments counters claims that favorable selection is not a problem in markets with substantial Medicare+Choice enrollment.", "A few plans had an excess payment rate above 30 percent, but the median excess payment rate was approximately 12 percent. Among the nine plans in our study that were disadvantaged because their enrollees tended to be in below-average health, Medicare\u2019s payments were as much as 10.6 percent below enrollees\u2019 expected heath care costs (see fig. 1).", "The amount of excess payment that plans received depends upon both the degree to which they experience favorable selection and the number of Medicare beneficiaries they served. In 1998, 40 plans each received more than $20 million in excess payments due to inadequate risk adjustment. The largest estimated excess payment to an individual plan totaled $334 million, or 40 percent more than Medicare would have spent if the plan\u2019s enrollees had been covered under FFS. Among the nine plans that were paid less than their enrollees\u2019 estimated FFS costs, the largest difference between estimated costs and payments was $8.4 million (see table 3). However, when excess payments due to forecast error are included, only 2 plans were paid less ($1.7 million and $175,000) than their enrollees\u2019 expected costs.", "While the lack of an adequate risk adjuster can lead to excess payments, it can also result in plans being penalized if they serve a disproportionate share of Medicare beneficiaries with expensive health care needs. This can discourage a plan from seeking to enroll those beneficiaries, or developing programs that would foster a reputation for effectively treating certain costly diseases.", "Some analysts have suggested that favorable selection might diminish over time. They hypothesize that health status differences between beneficiaries in health plans and beneficiaries in FFS could disappear as plan enrollment grows. However, our results indicate that this is not likely. Most plans that were well-established, enrolled a substantial number of beneficiaries, and were located in areas with relatively high rates of Medicare managed care enrollment experienced some level of favorable selection and therefore received excess payments. For example, a plan in our sample had an estimated excess payment rate of 18.5 percent and received more than $100 million in excess payments, even though it had been serving Medicare beneficiaries for more than a decade, had well over 200,000 enrollees in 1998, and was a dominant plan located in an area where over 33 percent of the Medicare beneficiaries were enrolled in Medicare+Choice plans.", "Excess payments persisted, in part, because total enrollment in managed care plans continued to grow and because many of the new enrollees were in relatively good health. In 1998, about 15 percent of all enrollees in our sample had been in FFS the previous year. On average, these beneficiaries used about 30 percent less Medicare services (in dollar terms) in the year before they switched from FFS to managed care than demographically similar beneficiaries who remained in FFS.", "The difference between the health care needs of plan beneficiaries and FFS beneficiaries is smaller for beneficiaries who have been plan members for several years. However, our analysis indicates that for up to 8 years, plan beneficiaries continue to have somewhat lower expected costs than their demographic counterparts who remained in FFS.

The seeming paradox between our findings and the industry\u2019s position is resolvable. Medicare+Choice plans are being paid too much for what was originally intended\u2014providing beneficiaries the package of Medicare-covered services at less cost than the traditional FFS program. However, Medicare+Choice plans may not be paid enough for what they have been offering to attract beneficiaries\u2014a more comprehensive benefit package beyond that covered for FFS beneficiaries for only modest or no premiums.", "The problem of excess payments can be addressed in part by better adjusting payments for the actual health status of enrollees. Such a step would also protect those plans that attract sicker-than-average enrollees. This year, HCFA began to implement a new risk adjuster that does a better job of calibrating payments to reflect differences in beneficiary health status.

Adjusting plan payments so that the program pays no more for a Medicare+Choice enrollee than for a traditional Medicare beneficiary with equivalent health status is going to mean smaller payments and most likely lower profits for plans, fewer plans participating, and less-generous extra benefits for enrollees. These consequences raise for the Congress the question of whether payments should be modified to protect plans and the fraction of the Medicare beneficiary population enrolled\u2014even if that protection results in Medicare spending more on the Medicare+Choice enrollee than for the traditional FFS Medicare beneficiary and increases the difficulty of financially sustaining the Medicare program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["In commenting on our report, HCFA agreed that Medicare spends more on Medicare+Choice enrollees than it would have spent if those enrollees had received services through the traditional FFS program.

We began with the 1997 county per capita costs, which represent HCFA\u2019s estimated cost of providing Medicare-covered services to the average FFS beneficiary in each county.However, these rates reflect the cost experience of a county\u2019s entire FFS population and thus include the typically high costs associated with persons who died during the year.To estimate the cost of survivors only, we used the fact that each county\u2019s per capita costs can be expressed as a weighted average of the per capita costs of survivors and the per capita costs of decedents. That is, We then used the CMHS to estimate a national death factor that measures the difference in costs between persons who die and those who survive during the calendar year.Separate death factors were estimated for the aged and disabled Medicare populations.As shown in table 4, the cost of aged decedents is approximately 4 times the cost of aged survivors while the cost of disabled decedents is nearly 5 times the cost of disabled survivors.", "Average decedent costs could then be expressed as the product of the death factor and average survivor costs in equation 1. We combined terms and rearranged equation 1 to solve for average survivor costs in terms of the county per capita costs, proportions of survivors and decedents, and the national death factor.This yielded equation 2: Because the demographic mix of survivors varies among counties, we then adjusted each county\u2019s costs using the average demographic factor for FFS survivors in that county. The result is our estimate of the base cost in each county.2. ComputeajoinercostratioforeachplanthatmeasurespriorFFS spendingonthatplan\u2019snewenrolleesrelativetoaverageFFSspendingon demographicallysimilarbeneficiariesinthesamecounty. We computed 1997 Medicare spending on each beneficiary who left FFS and joined a plan in 1998 (these beneficiaries were termed joiners).We then compared that spending to the base rate for demographically similar beneficiaries in the joiner\u2019s county of residence.The ratio of aggregate FFS spending on each plan\u2019s joiners to the spending of demographically similar beneficiaries is the plan\u2019s joiner cost ratio. For example, a joiner cost ratio of 0.75 indicates that a plan\u2019s joiners had costs that were three-fourths of those of demographically comparable FFS beneficiaries in the year before enrollment. In our study, the weighted average joiner cost ratio was 0.67, and 93 percent of plans had a ratio of 0.80 or lower.", "The joiner cost ratio did not vary substantially with the number of years since the start of a plan\u2019s Medicare contract or the size of a plan, but tended to be slightly higher among plans operating in markets with relatively high percentages of beneficiaries enrolled in plans (see table 5).However, even in those areas where Medicare managed care has a significant presence, beneficiaries who join plans generally have costs that are substantially below those of comparable FFS beneficiaries. 3. Computeasetofregression-toward-the-mean(RTM)factorsforeach planthatindicatehowlonger-termmembers\u2019FFScostscomparetojoiners\u2019 costs. The RTM factors account for the tendency of individual enrollee costs to converge toward the group mean over time. Beneficiaries who had lower-than-average costs before enrollment in a plan may incur increased costs in subsequent years. Conversely, beneficiaries who had higher-than- average costs before enrollment may experience reduced costs. That is, enrollees\u2019 costs tend to regress toward the mean the longer they remain plan members.The RTM factors specify the degree to which enrollees\u2019 estimated FFS costs differ from the pre-enrollment FFS costs of new enrollees.", "We used CMHS data to analyze how FFS costs changed for a sample of beneficiaries over a 5-year period.We grouped beneficiaries into eight cost cohorts based on their 1993 FFS costs relative to the overall sample mean cost in that year ($2,575).We then computed average FFS spending for each cohort relative to the sample mean FFS costs in each of the following 4 years. For example, among beneficiaries who had the lowest FFS costs in 1993, the average cost was 3 percent of the sample mean. (Many beneficiaries in this group had no Medicare costs.) In 1994, FFS costs for the same individuals averaged 44 percent of that year\u2019s sample mean. By 1997, the group\u2019s FFS costs averaged 59 percent of the year\u2019s sample mean. In contrast, average spending on the group of beneficiaries who were most expensive in 1993 dropped from 1,678 percent of the sample mean in 1993 to 317 percent of the sample mean in 1997. We then extrapolated the CMHS cost trends to impute an additional 4 years of relative spending for each cost cohort.", "We then computed plan-specific joiner cost ratios from the CMHS cost trends and estimated each enrollee\u2019s 1998 FFS costs relative to the average cost of a demographically similar beneficiary in FFS. An average cost trend for each plan was computed by using the distribution of its joiners\u2019 1997 FFS costs to weight the eight CMHS cost trends. Each enrollee was then assigned a plan-specific RTM factor based on the number of years he or she had been a plan member.These factors express the relationship between estimated relative FFS costs and the plan\u2019s joiner cost ratio. For example, figure 2 illustrates the estimated RTM for beneficiaries enrolled in a hypothetical plan Z, which has a joiner ratio and RTM factors typical of an average plan in our sample. Joiners to the plan had 1997 FFS costs that equaled 67 percent of the average FFS cost for demographically similar beneficiaries who did not enroll in a plan. However, the CMHS cost trends indicate that in 1998\u2014during their first year of plan membership\u2014plan joiners\u2019 FFS costs would have increased to 85 percent of average FFS costs. Thus the RTM factor for plan Z enrollees in their first year of membership is 1.27 (0.67 x 1.27 = 0.85). We similarly estimated relative FFS costs for enrollees with 8 or fewer years of plan membership. We assumed that there was no difference between plan enrollees\u2019 costs and FFS beneficiaries\u2019 costs for enrollees who had 9 or more years of plan membership.4. Computeanationalupdatefactorthatadjustsestimated1997spending to1998levels. As a result of BBA, HCFA no longer calculates AAPCC rates. Therefore, we multiplied 1997 FFS spending by the ratio of 1997 national per capita spending to 1998 national per capita spending to estimate 1998 spending. Because per capita FFS spending fell between 1997 and 1998, the update factor was 0.97 for aged beneficiaries and 0.96 for disabled beneficiaries.", "After we completed the preceding subtasks, imputing the 1998 FFS cost of each survivor enrolled in a plan involved multiplying a series of terms. Essentially, for each month in which a surviving beneficiary was enrolled in a plan, we began with the 1997 base rate multiplied by the beneficiary\u2019s risk adjustment factor to obtain the expected average cost of a demographically comparable FFS beneficiary who was alive for the entire preceding year. We then multiplied that amount by the plan\u2019s joiner cost ratio and the RTM factor applicable for the beneficiary\u2019s tenure in a Medicare plan. Finally, we updated the resulting estimate to account for the change in the base rate between 1997 and 1998. This process is illustrated for one survivor by equation 3.", "Our approach assumes that when longer-term plan members first enrolled in a plan, they had FFS spending that was similar to the spending for current joiners. That is, we assume that a plan that experienced favorable or adverse selection of enrollees (healthier or sicker than average) in 1998 experienced similar favorable or adverse selection in previous years. This approach allows us to estimate costs for all plan enrollees based on the subset of enrollees who had FFS costs in the prior year.Some plan representatives have indicated that new enrollees in recent years have been less healthy and more costly compared to new enrollees in earlier years. To the extent this is true, our joiner ratios will overestimate what was spent on long-term enrollees when they were last in FFS and result in an underestimate of excess payments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Methodology to Estimate FFS Costs of Enrollees Who Died During 1998", "paragraphs": ["We assumed that decedents in plans have the same costs as decedents in FFS and that these costs can be expressed as a fixed ratio, referred to as a death factor, of the average annual cost of FFS survivors.
