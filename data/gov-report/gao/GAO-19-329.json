These data were contained in defense acquisition  executive summary reports, selected acquisition reports, and program  briefings provided by the program office and Sikorsky Aircraft  Corporation, a Lockheed Martin Company (the prime contractor for the  program). We also examined and analyzed key acquisition documents  including contractor monthly status reports, earned value management  data, and Defense Contract Management Agency reports to determine  the performance and cost status of the development effort. We reviewed  the program\u2019s Integrated Master Schedule (IMS) and compared it against  best practices criteria in the GAO Schedule Assessment Guide and discussed the results of our schedule assessment with VH-92A program  officials. To understand potential program challenges facing the program  in system development and steps taken to address those challenges, we  interviewed program officials from the Navy\u2019s Presidential Helicopter  Program Office, as well as officials from the Defense Contract  Management Agency and from the offices of the Director, Operational  Testing and Evaluation, and Department of Defense (DOD),  Developmental Test and Evaluation to better understand the test and  evaluation aspects of the program.

These aircraft have been in service for decades. In  April 2002, the Navy began development of a replacement helicopter later  identified as the VH-71 program. By 2009, schedule delays, performance  issues, and a doubling of cost estimates, from $6.5 billion in 2005 to $13  billion in 2009, prompted the Navy to terminate the program.", "The need for a replacement helicopter remained, and by April 2012, the  Office of the Secretary of Defense approved the Navy\u2019s current  acquisition approach. The Navy\u2019s approach is based on the modification  of an in-production aircraft to replace the legacy aircraft, by incorporating  an executive cabin interior and unique mission equipment such as  communications and mission systems, and limiting modifications to the  aircraft to avoid a costly airworthiness recertification.", "In May 2014, the Navy awarded a fixed-price incentive (firm target)  contract to Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation, a Lockheed Martin Company,  for an Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase. The  contract includes options for production quantities. The VH-92A  presidential helicopter is based on Sikorsky\u2019s S-92A commercial  helicopter. The fixed- price incentive contract includes a ceiling price of  $1.3 billion that limits the maximum amount that the Navy may have to  pay the contractor under the contract subject to other contract terms.  The VH-92A is expected to provide improved performance, survivability,  and communications capabilities, while offering increased passenger  capacity when compared to the current helicopters.", "Sikorsky is taking S-92A aircraft from an active production line (at the  Sikorsky plant in Coatesville, Pennsylvania) to a dedicated VH-92A  modification facility for subsystem integration at its plant in Stratford,  Connecticut. When the aircraft arrives from Coatesville, some  components, such as circuit breaker panels, engines, and main and tail  rotor blades are removed. After airframe modifications are done, the  aircraft is then transferred to the Sikorsky facility in Owego, New York,  where integration of the mission communications system, painting, and  contractor-led testing, installation of the executive cabin interior, and the  delivery of the aircraft will take place. See figure 1 for a depiction of  modification of the commercial S-92A aircraft to the VH-92A presidential  helicopter.", "The VH-92A development program includes delivery of two Engineering  Development Model (EDM) test aircraft and four System Demonstration  Test Article (SDTA) aircraft. The first flight of the first EDM aircraft took  place in July 2017 and the second EDM aircraft\u2019s first flight occurred in  November 2017. The two EDM aircraft are currently undergoing  government-led integrated testing, at Naval Air Station Patuxent River,  Maryland, and were used to conduct an operational assessment in March  2019 to support a decision on whether to enter low-rate initial production.  The four SDTA aircraft, now in the modification stages, are production  representative aircraft being built under the development contract. These  aircraft are to be used in the VH-92A\u2019s initial operational test and  evaluation, which is planned to begin in March 2020.

Contractor officials attribute that the estimated  decline in cost is due to stable requirements, a low number of design  changes, and streamlined processes and reviews. The program has  incurred delays of about 5 months to the start of its operational  assessment due to parts shortages and early integration problems during  product development. Program officials told us they have adjusted  schedule milestones accordingly and now project that the VH-92A is on  track to meet its key performance parameters, including providing a fully  interoperable mission communications system (MCS) in time for initial  operational test and evaluation in 2020."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Cost Estimates Have Declined Due to Stable Requirements and Efficiency Gains", "paragraphs": ["The Navy continues to reduce its acquisition cost estimate for the VH-92A  program.

The  total program acquisition unit costs have decreased by the same  percentage. According to the program office, this decrease is comprised,  in part, by reductions of approximately: $36 million for lower than expected inflation rates, $88 million for efficiencies gained during development, and $103 million for revised spare parts cost and equipment production  list.", "A key factor in controlling total program acquisition cost has been  performance requirements stability. The Navy has not added any key  performance requirements to the fixed-price contract, thereby limiting cost  growth. In addition, the Navy and the contractor have been able to limit  the number of necessary design changes that require modifications to  aircraft. These modifications are now being incorporated into the four  production representative aircraft. The Navy is using an existing basic  ordering agreement with Sikorsky, separate from the VH-92A contract, for  two additional design changes that are not part of the baseline program.  These changes are to allow for improved visibility from the aircraft\u2019s  forward door and the addition of a fifth multi-functional display in the  cockpit (which is identical to the existing four displays) to improve  situational awareness. The program office is working with the contractor  to determine the best time to make these modifications to the aircraft in  order to minimize the effect on the production schedule. The final costs  are still being negotiated; however, the program office expects the cost of  implementing these two engineering changes to be minimal relative to the  program\u2019s total acquisition cost.", "The Navy and contractor have also taken advantage of other cost saving  measures including streamlining some work processes and revised  testing approach for some components; they are also sharing secure  facilities used in support of the current presidential helicopter. In addition,  they eliminated activities deemed redundant to the Federal Aviation  Administration VH-92A airworthiness certification and plan to use a  streamlined reporting process for the March 2019 operational  assessment.

As of February 2019, the contractor estimates it would have completed  nearly all of its activities necessary to demonstrate performance  specification compliance per the contract, by February 2019, and the  Navy is now more than halfway through its ground and flight testing  requirements needed to a support Milestone C, the decision point for  entering into low-rate initial production. The program has addressed  delays resulting from technical challenges and new discoveries during  development by delaying the start dates for the operational assessment,  the low-rate initial production decision, and initial operational test and  evaluation by 5 months each. The milestone start dates still meet the  baseline schedule thresholds.", "As we found in the past, part shortages and the integration and assembly  effort taking longer than planned have all contributed to delays early in  the development of the two engineering development model aircraft. The  overall effect has been between 3 and 5 months of schedule delays. In  addition, some work initially allocated to the contractor\u2019s site will now be  completed at the Naval Air Station, Patuxent River, Maryland. This is a  result of the contractor\u2019s inability to get some parts when needed to  maintain the planned build schedule. According to the program office, the  Navy has implemented a number of mitigation strategies to reduce the  effect of the schedule slip, including leasing a commercial S-92A for pilot  training, reducing the duration of some future activities, adjusting the  program\u2019s schedule, and reexamining and optimizing some work  processes to maintain the approved program baseline schedule.", "We also found that the program\u2019s integrated master schedule met the  best practices for a reliable schedule compared against best practices  criteria in the GAO Schedule Assessment Guide. The success of  programs depend, in part, on having an integrated and reliable master  schedule that defines when and how long work will occur and how each  activity is related to the others. Such a schedule is necessary for  government acquisition programs for many reasons. It provides not only a  road map for systematic project execution but also the means by which to  gauge progress, identify and resolve potential problems, and promote  accountability at all levels of the program. An IMS provides a time  sequence for the duration of a program\u2019s activities and helps everyone  understand both the dates for major milestones and the activities that  drive the schedule. A program\u2019s IMS is also a vehicle for developing a  time-phased budget baseline. Moreover, it is an essential basis for  managing tradeoffs between cost, schedule, and scope. Among other  things, scheduling allows program management to decide between  possible sequences of activities, determine the flexibility of the schedule  according to available resources, predict the consequences of managerial  action or inaction on events, and allocate contingency plans to mitigate  risks. Our research has identified 10 best practices associated with  effective schedule estimating that can be collapsed into 4 general  characteristics (comprehensive, well-constructed, credible, and  controlled) for sound schedule estimating. Overall, we found the  program\u2019s IMS fully met one and substantially met three of the four  characteristics for sound schedule estimating.", "Table 2 provides a comparison of the planned timeframe for key events at  development start to the current estimated schedule.", "The Navy\u2019s operational assessment began in March 2019 and ended  about 30 days later; this is nearly 2 months prior to the Milestone C  review, which will authorize low-rate initial production. The contractor\u2019s  delivery of the first engineering development model aircraft to the  government was about a month late. A Developmental Test and  Evaluation official stated that this reduced the already short window of  time between the end of development testing and start of the operational  assessment. A Director, Operational Test and Evaluation official  responsible for monitoring the program expressed concern that there is  little time to address any new discoveries found during the operational  assessment.
