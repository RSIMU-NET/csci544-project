According to prior GAO work, this information could help decision makers identify significant climate risks as an initial step toward managing them.", "The federal government faces fiscal exposure from climate change risks in several areas, including:", "Disaster aid: due to the rising number of natural disasters and increasing reliance on federal assistance. GAO has previously reported that the federal government's fragmented and reactive approach to funding disaster resilience presented challenges to effective reduction of climate-related risks. GAO has also reported that, due to an artificially low indicator for determining a jurisdiction's ability to respond to disasters that was set in 1986, the Federal Emergency Management Agency risks recommending federal assistance for jurisdictions that could recover on their own.", "Federal insurance for property and crops: due, in part, to the vulnerability of insured property and crops to climate change impacts. Federal flood and crop insurance programs were not designed to generate sufficient funds to fully cover all losses and expenses. The flood insurance program, for example, was about $21 billion in debt to the Treasury as of April 2019. Further, the Congressional Budget Office estimated in May 2019 that federal crop insurance would cost the federal government an average of about $8 billion annually from 2019 through 2029.", "Operation and management of federal property and lands: due to the hundreds of thousands of federal facilities and millions of acres of land that could be affected by a changing climate and more frequent extreme events. For example, in 2018, Hurricane Michael devastated Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida, with a preliminary repair estimate of $3 billion.", "As we reported in October 2019, our past work shows an absence of government-wide strategic planning for climate change. Specifically, our past work has identified limitations related to strategic planning for climate change that includes a lack of coordination, prioritization, and consolidation of strategic priorities.

As GAO has reported, enhancing resilience can reduce fiscal exposure by reducing or eliminating long-term risk to people and property from natural hazards. For example, a 2018 interim report by the National Institute of Building Sciences estimated approximate benefits to society in excess of costs for several types of resilience projects. While precise benefits are uncertain, the report estimated that for every dollar invested in designing new buildings to particular design standards, society could accrue benefits amounting to about $11 on average.", "GAO's March 2019 High-Risk report identified a number of recommendations GAO has made related to fiscal exposure to climate change. The federal government could reduce its fiscal exposure by implementing these recommendations. Among GAO's key government-wide recommendations are:", "Entities within the Executive Office of the President (EOP) should work with partners to establish federal strategic climate change priorities that reflect the full range of climate-related federal activities;", "Entities within EOP should use information on potential economic effects from climate change to help identify significant climate risks and craft appropriate federal responses;", "Entities within EOP should designate a federal entity to develop and update a set of authoritative climate observations and projections for use in federal decision making, and create a national climate information system with defined roles for federal agencies and certain nonfederal entities; and", "The Department of Commerce should convene federal agencies to provide the best-available forward-looking climate information to organizations that develop standards and building codes to enhance infrastructure resilience.", "Further, in October 2019, GAO reported that Congress could consider establishing a federal organizational arrangement to periodically identify and prioritize climate resilience projects for federal investment.

Addressing climate change risks requires advanced planning and  investment to reduce the need for far more costly steps in the decades to  come, which, as we have previously reported, the federal government is  not well organized to do. The costs associated with recent disasters have  illustrated the need for such planning and investment. In 2018 alone,  there were 14 separate billion-dollar weather and climate disaster events  across the United States, with a total cost of at least $91 billion, according  to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

These changes include the rise in vulnerability to drought,  lengthening wildfire seasons, and potential for extremely heavy rainfall  becoming more common in some regions.

We also reported that according  to the two national-scale studies available at the time that examined the  economic effects of climate change across U.S. sectors, potential  economic effects could be significant and these effects will likely increase  over time for most of the sectors analyzed. For example, for 2020  through 2039, one of the studies estimated from $4 billion to $6 billion in  annual coastal property damages from sea level rise and more frequent  and intense storms.", "In addition, the national-scale studies we reviewed and several experts  we interviewed for the September 2017 report suggested that potential  economic effects could be unevenly distributed across sectors and  regions. For example, one of the studies estimated that the Southeast,  Midwest, and Great Plains regions will likely experience greater combined  economic effects than other regions, largely because of coastal property  damage in the Southeast and changes in crop yields in the Midwest and Great Plains (see fig. 1). This is consistent with the findings of the  Fourth National Climate Assessment.

According to several experts and our prior work, this  information could help federal decision makers identify significant climate  priorities as an initial step toward managing climate risks. Such a first  step is consistent with leading practices for climate risk management and  federal standards for internal control. For example, leading practices  from the National Academies call for climate change risk management  efforts that focus on where immediate attention is needed. As noted in  our September 2017 report, according to a 2010 National Academies  report, other literature we reviewed, and several experts we interviewed,  to make informed choices, decision makers need more comprehensive  information on economic effects to better understand the potential costs  of climate change to society and begin to develop an understanding of the  benefits and costs of different options for managing climate risks."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Federal Government Faces Fiscal Exposure from Climate Change Risks, but Our Past Work Shows an Absence of Government-Wide Strategic Planning", "paragraphs": ["The federal government faces fiscal exposure from climate change risks  in a number of areas, and this exposure will likely increase over time, as  we concluded in September 2017. In the March 2019 update to our  High-Risk List, we summarized our previous work that identified several  of these areas across the federal government, including programs related  to the following:", "Disaster aid. The rising number of natural disasters and increasing  reliance on federal assistance are a key source of federal fiscal  exposure, and this exposure will likely continue to rise. Since 2005,  federal funding for disaster assistance has been at least $450  billion. In September 2018, we reported that four hurricane and  wildfire disasters in 2017 created an unprecedented demand for  federal disaster resources and that Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and  Maria ranked among the top five costliest hurricanes on record.  Subsequently, the fall of 2018 brought additional catastrophic  disasters such as Hurricanes Florence and Michael and devastating  California wildfires, with further needs for federal disaster assistance.  Disaster costs are projected to increase as certain extreme weather  events become more frequent and intense due to climate change\u2014as  USGCRP observed and projected. We reported in July 2015 that the  federal government\u2019s fragmented and reactive approach to funding  disaster resilience presented challenges to effective reduction of  climate-related risks. In addition, our prior work found that the  Federal Emergency Management Agency\u2019s (FEMA) primary indicator  for determining whether to recommend that a jurisdiction receive  disaster assistance\u2014which was set in 1986\u2014is artificially low  because it does not accurately reflect the ability of state and local  governments to respond to disasters. Without an accurate  assessment of a jurisdiction\u2019s capability to respond to a disaster  without federal assistance, we found that FEMA runs the risk of  recommending that the President award federal assistance to  jurisdictions that have the capability to respond and recover on their  own.", "Federal insurance for property and crops. The National Flood  Insurance Program (NFIP) and the Federal Crop Insurance  Corporation are sources of federal fiscal exposure due, in part, to the  vulnerability of insured property and crops to climate change. These  programs provide coverage where private markets for insurance do  not exist, typically because the risk associated with the property or  crops is too great to privately insure at a cost that buyers are willing to  accept. From 2013 to 2017, losses paid under NFIP and the federal  crop insurance program totaled $51.3 billion. Federal flood and crop  insurance programs were not designed to generate sufficient funds to  fully cover all losses and expenses, which means the programs need  budget authority from Congress to operate. NFIP, for example, was  about $21 billion in debt to the Department of the Treasury as of April  2019. Further, the Congressional Budget Office estimated in May  2019 that federal crop insurance would cost the federal government  an average of about $8 billion annually from 2019 through 2029.", "Operation and management of federal property and lands. The  federal government owns and operates hundreds of thousands of  facilities and manages millions of acres of land that could be affected  by a changing climate and represent a significant federal fiscal  exposure. For example, the Department of Defense (DOD) owns and  operates domestic and overseas infrastructure with an estimated  replacement value of about $1 trillion. In September 2018, Hurricane  Florence damaged Camp Lejeune and other Marine Corps facilities in  North Carolina, resulting in a preliminary Marine Corps repair estimate  of $3.6 billion. One month later, Hurricane Michael devastated Tyndall  Air Force Base in Florida, resulting in a preliminary Air Force repair  estimate of $3 billion and upwards of 5 years to complete the work. In  addition, we recently reported that the federal government manages  about 650 million acres of land in the United States that could be  vulnerable to climate change, including the possibility of more  frequent and severe droughts and wildfires. Appropriations for  federal wildland fire management activities have increased  considerably since the 1990s, as we and the Congressional Research  Service have reported.", "As we reported in October 2019, our past work shows an absence of  government-wide strategic planning for climate change. Specifically, our  past work identifies limitations related to strategic planning for climate  change that include a lack of coordination, prioritization, and consolidation  of strategic priorities. For example, we reported in October 2009 that the  federal government\u2019s emerging climate resilience activities were carried  out in an ad hoc manner and were not well coordinated across federal  agencies. In May 2011, we reported that federal officials did not have a  shared understanding of strategic government-wide priorities related to  climate change. In the same report, we found that there was not a  consolidated set of strategic priorities integrating climate change  programs and activities across the federal government.", "In our March 2019 High-Risk Update, we reported that one area of  government-wide action needed to reduce federal fiscal exposure is in the  federal government\u2019s role as the leader of a strategic plan that  coordinates federal efforts and informs state, local, and private sector  action. For our 2019 High-Risk Update, we assessed the federal  government\u2019s progress since 2017 related to climate change strategic  planning against five criteria and found that the federal government had  not met any of the criteria for removal from the high-risk list. Specifically,  since our 2017 high-risk update, four ratings regressed to \u201cnot met\u201d and  one remained unchanged as \u201cnot met.\u201d (See fig. 2.)

One way to reduce federal fiscal exposure is to enhance resilience by  reducing or eliminating long-term risk to people and property from natural  hazards. For example, in September 2018 we reported that elevated  homes and strengthened building codes in Texas and Florida prevented  greater damages during the 2017 hurricane season. In addition, one  company participating in a 2014 forum we held on preparing for climate- related risks noted that for every dollar it invested in resilience efforts, the  company could prevent $5 in potential losses. Finally, a 2018 interim  report by the National Institute of Building Sciences examined a sample of  federal grants for hazard mitigation. The interim report estimated  approximate benefits to society (i.e., homeowners and communities) in  excess of costs for several types of resilience projects through the  protection of lives and property, and prevention of other losses, though  precise benefits are uncertain. According to the interim report, for every grant dollar the federal government spent on resilience projects, over  time, society is estimated to accrue benefits amounting to the following:", "About $3 on average from projects addressing the effects of fire in the  wildland urban interface, with most benefits (approximately 70  percent) coming from the protection of property (i.e., avoiding property  losses).", "About $5 on average from projects to address hurricane-force and  tornado-force winds, with most benefits (approximately 90 percent)  coming from the protection of lives. This includes avoiding deaths,  nonfatal injuries, and causes of posttraumatic stress.", "About $7 on average from projects that buy out buildings prone to  riverine flooding, with most benefits (approximately 65 percent)  coming from the protection of property.", "The interim report also projected that society could accrue benefits  amounting to about $11 on average for every dollar invested in designing  new buildings to meet the 2018 International Building Code and the 2018  International Residential Code\u2014the model building codes that the  International Code Council developed\u2014with most benefits (46 percent)  coming from the protection of property.", "We reported in October 2009 that the federal government\u2019s activities to  build resilience to climate change were carried out in an ad hoc manner  and were not well coordinated across federal agencies. We reported  similar findings in October 2019. Federal agencies have included some  of these activities within existing programs and operations\u2014a concept  known as mainstreaming. For example, the Fourth National Climate  Assessment reported that the U.S. military integrates climate risks into its  analysis, plans, and programs, with particular attention paid to climate  effects on force readiness, military bases, and training ranges.  However, according to the Fourth National Climate Assessment, while a  significant portion of climate risk can be addressed by mainstreaming, the  practice may reduce the visibility of climate resilience relative to  dedicated, stand-alone approaches and may prove insufficient to address  the full range of climate risks.", "In addition, as we reported in March 2019, the Disaster Recovery Reform  Act of 2018 (DRRA) was enacted in October 2018 and could improve  state and local resilience to disasters. DRRA, among other things, allows  the President to set aside, with respect to each major disaster, a  percentage of the estimated aggregate amount of certain grants to use for  predisaster hazard mitigation and makes federal assistance available to  state and local governments for building code administration and  enforcement. However, it is too early to tell what impact implementing  the act will have on state and local resilience.", "The federal government has made some limited investments in resilience,  and DRRA could enable additional improvements at the state and local  levels. However, we reported in October 2019 that the federal  government does not have a strategic approach for investing in climate  resilience projects\u2014that is, an intentional, crosscutting approach in which  the federal government identifies and prioritizes projects for the purpose  of enhancing climate resilience. Federal agencies may take actions to  invest in projects with potential climate resilience benefits related to their  own mission areas using funds from federal programs designed for other  purposes. In addition, the National Climate Assessment provides high- level information on what is known about observed and projected climate  risks in the United States. However, no federal entity looks holistically at  the federal government\u2019s investments to strategically prioritize projects to  ensure that they address the nation\u2019s most significant climate risks and  provide the highest net benefits relative to other potential projects.", "Further, we reported in September 2017 that the federal government had  not undertaken strategic government-wide planning to manage significant  climate risks before they become fiscal exposures. As an initial step in  managing climate risks, most of the experts we interviewed for the  September 2017 report told us that federal decision makers should  prioritize risk management efforts on significant climate risks that create  the greatest fiscal exposure.", "Moreover, several stakeholders told us that the federal government\u2019s  emphasis has been on funding postdisaster efforts instead of funding  resilience projects before a disaster occurs. This is consistent with  findings from our July 2015 report that most federal funding for hazard  mitigation is only available after a disaster. In addition, according to  FEMA officials, some of the agency\u2019s hazard mitigation programs are  designed to empower state and local governments to determine their  mitigation funding priorities, and these state and local priorities may or  may not align with the federal interest.", "Finally, although we did not identify a government-wide strategic  approach specifically for investing in climate resilience projects, the  National Mitigation Investment Strategy\u2014a national effort under way to  plan for predisaster resilience investments\u2014represents a potential cross- agency vehicle for climate resilience planning.

However, the federal government is currently not well organized  to address the fiscal exposure presented by climate change, partly  because of the inherently complicated and crosscutting nature of the  issue. We have made a total of 62 recommendations related to limiting  the federal government\u2019s fiscal exposure to climate change over the  years, 12 of which have been made since February 2017. As of  December 2018, 25 of these recommendations remained open. In  describing what needs to be done to reduce federal fiscal exposure to  climate change, our March 2019 High-Risk Report discusses many of the  open recommendations.Implementing these recommendations could  help reduce federal fiscal exposure. Several of them, including those  highlighted below, identify key government-wide efforts needed to help  plan for and manage climate risks and direct federal efforts toward  common goals, such as improving resilience.", "Develop a national strategic plan: In May 2011, we recommended  that appropriate entities within the Executive Office of the President  (EOP), including the Office of Management and Budget, work with  agencies and interagency coordinating bodies to establish federal  strategic climate change priorities that reflect the full range of climate- related federal activities, including roles and responsibilities of key  federal entities.", "Use economic information to identify and respond to significant  climate risks: In September 2017, we recommended that the  appropriate entities within EOP use information on the potential  economic effects of climate change to help identify significant climate  risks facing the federal government and craft appropriate federal  responses. Such federal responses could include establishing a  strategy to identify, prioritize, and guide federal investments to  enhance resilience against future disasters.", "Provide decision makers with the best-available climate  information: In November 2015, we reported that federal efforts to  provide information about climate change impacts did not fully meet  the climate information needs of federal, state, local, and private  sector decision makers, which hindered their efforts to plan for climate  change risks. We reported that these decision makers would benefit  from a national climate information system that would develop and  update authoritative climate observations and projections specifically  for use in decision-making. As a result, we recommended that EOP  (1) designate a federal entity to develop and periodically update a set  of authoritative climate observations and projections for use in federal  decision-making, which other decision makers could also access, and  (2) designate a federal entity to create a national climate information  system with defined roles for federal agencies and nonfederal entities  with existing statutory authority.", "Consider climate information in design standards: In November  2016, we reported that design standards, building codes, and  voluntary certifications established by standards-developing  organizations play a role in ensuring the resilience of infrastructure to  the effects of natural disasters. However, we reported that these  organizations faced challenges in using forward-looking climate  information that could help enhance the resilience of infrastructure. As  a result, we recommended in the November 2016 report that the  Department of Commerce (Commerce), acting through the National  Institute of Standards and Technology\u2014which is responsible for  coordinating federal participation in standards organizations\u2014 convene federal agencies for an ongoing government-wide effort to  provide the best-available forward-looking climate information to  standards-developing organizations for their consideration in the  development of design standards, building codes, and voluntary  certifications.", "In addition, in October 2019, we recommended that Congress consider  establishing a federal organizational arrangement to periodically identify  and prioritize climate resilience projects for federal investment. We also  identified six key steps the federal government could use to prioritize  climate resilience investments and opportunities to increase the climate  resilience impacts of federal funding options that Congress could use in  designing the arrangement.", "In October 2019 we also issued the Disaster Resilience Framework to  serve as a guide for analysis of federal action to facilitate and promote  resilience to natural disasters. The framework identifies three key  principles that can help federal efforts to promote disaster resilience,  including building resilience to climate change. First, authoritative and  understandable information can help decision makers identify current and  future risks and the impact of risk-reduction strategies. Second, integrated  analysis and strategic planning can help decision makers take coherent  and coordinated resilience actions. Third, financial and nonfinancial  incentives can help make long-term, forward-looking risk-reduction  investments more viable and attractive among competing priorities.", "In conclusion, the effects of climate change have already posed and will  continue to pose risks that can create fiscal exposure across the federal  government, and this exposure will continue to increase. The federal  government does not generally account for such fiscal exposure to  programs in the budget process, and it has not undertaken strategic  efforts to manage significant climate risks that could reduce the need for  far more costly steps in the decades to come. To reduce its fiscal  exposure, the federal government needs a cohesive strategic approach  with strong leadership and the authority to manage risks across the entire  range of related federal activities.
