The acts\u2019 objectives are to prevent anticompetitive behavior and preserve and promote competition in the marketplace. The Division generally shares responsibility for enforcing federal antitrust laws with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and state attorneys general. Both the Division and FTC are responsible for enforcing the premerger notification provisions of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act (HSR Act), which requires parties to notify the Division and FTC of certain proposed mergers and to observe a waiting period before merging. During fiscal year 1999, the Division handled over 4,900 matters, of which 4,642 (about 95 percent) were potential mergers filed under the notification provisions of the HSR Act.", "This report responds to a request from Senator Grassley, as the former Chairman of the Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts, Senate Committee on the Judiciary, that we obtain information on the Division\u2019s overall policies and procedures for carrying out its statutory responsibilities, particularly as they apply to the Division\u2019s enforcement activities in the agriculture industry. Specifically, as agreed with Senator Grassley\u2019s office, our objectives were to   describe the Division\u2019s interaction with FTC and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) with regard to antitrust matters in the agriculture industry;   provide information on the number of complaints and leads in the agriculture industry received by the Division for fiscal years 1997 through 1999; and   provide information on the number and type (such as mergers) of closed matters in the agriculture industry for fiscal years 1997 through 1999.", "As also agreed, in appendix III, we describe the Division\u2019s policies and procedures for investigating potential antitrust violations."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Division is responsible for promoting and maintaining competition in the American economy by enforcing the federal antitrust laws. To accomplish its mission, the Division has 16 sections in headquarters and 7 field offices located throughout the United States. As of July 21, 2000, the Division had 561 full-time staff and 237 part-time staff onboard; about 29 percent of the full-time staff and about 21 percent of the part-time staff were assigned to the field offices (see app. II for a breakdown of staffing by sections and field offices). The Division\u2019s budget authority for fiscal year 2000 was $114.4 million, about a 16-percent increase, in nonconstant dollars, over fiscal year 1999 funding of $98.3 million. The Division\u2019s appropriations are offset by the fees companies are required to pay when they file premerger notifications under the HSR Act.", "The Division is responsible for enforcing the antitrust laws throughout the economy, including industries, such as computers, health care, telecommunications, transportation, and agriculture. Overall, the Division handled over 4,900 matters during fiscal year 1999, 4,642 (about 95 percent) of which were proposed mergers for which notice was filed under the HSR Act. For fiscal year 1999, agricultural industry matters\u2014 both mergers and nonmergers\u2014represented about 8 percent (395) of the Division\u2019s total workload.", "As previously noted, the basic federal antitrust statutes are the Sherman Act and the Clayton Act. Section 1 of the Sherman Act makes illegal any contract, combination, or conspiracy that results in a \u201crestraint of trade.\u201d The courts have construed the term to cover a variety of horizontal and vertical trade restraining agreements. Horizontal restraints are agreements among competitors at the same level of the production, distribution, or marketing process. Vertical restraints are arrangements among persons or firms operating at different levels of the manufacturing- distribution-marketing chain that restrict the conditions under which firms may purchase, sell, or resell. Section 2 of the Sherman Act prohibits monopolization, as well as attempts, combinations, or conspiracies to monopolize. Although the Sherman Act is both a criminal and civil statute, it is the Division\u2019s policy to criminally prosecute only what the Division considers to be the most egregious per se Sherman Act violations.However, in some situations the Division may not deem criminal investigation or prosecution to be appropriate, even though the conduct may appear to be a per se violation of the law. As examples, the Antitrust Division manual, which outlines the Division\u2019s formal internal practices and procedures, cites situations in which (1) there is confusion in the law; (2) there are novel issues of law or fact presented; (3) confusion reasonably may have been caused by past prosecutorial decisions; or (4) there is clear evidence that the subjects of the investigation were not aware of, or did not appreciate, the consequences of their actions.", "Section 7 of the Clayton Act prohibits mergers and acquisitions that may substantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in any market. The HSR Act added section 7A to the Clayton Act, which requires premerger notification of proposed mergers to assist the Division and FTC in investigating whether they would be anticompetitive.", "The Division generally shares responsibility for enforcing federal antitrust laws with FTC and state attorneys general. With the exception of criminal enforcement of the Sherman Act, which the Division has sole authority for, the \u201cunfair methods of competition\u201d clause of section 5 of the FTC Act generally allows FTC to reach the same conduct as prohibited by the Sherman Act. Both the Division and FTC are responsible for enforcing Sections 7 and 7A of the Clayton Act, with the exception of certain industries in which FTC\u2019s jurisdiction is limited by statute. For example, Section 5 (a) (2) of the Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914 generally excludes from its coverage activities subject to the Packers and Stockyards Act. FTC also enforces the Robinson-Patman Act, which governs price discrimination in interstate commerce, and section 8 of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 19), which governs interlocking directorates.", "As previously noted, the Division is responsible for enforcing the antitrust laws in a broad range of industries. The antitrust laws apply generally throughout the economy, and the Division exercises prosecutorial discretion to determine which matters warrant investigation or enforcement action. According to Division officials, their principal expertise is in antitrust laws, not in specific industries. Some industries also are regulated by government agencies under statutes that go beyond the antitrust laws to establish additional, industry-specific regulatory requirements and standards. For example, USDA\u2019s Grain Inspection, Packers, and Stockyards Administration (GIPSA) regulates sales in the livestock and meat-packing industries. GIPSA generally has the authority to prohibit unfair trade primarily within the livestock industry.", "The Division\u2019s policies and procedures manual outlines the processes for investigating potential antitrust violations. Depending on the conduct alleged, the Division can initiate either civil or criminal investigations of these potential violations. The Division may identify possible antitrust violations or proposed mergers through a variety of sources. The Division is made aware of many proposed mergers through filings required of the merging parties by the HSR Act. The Division may learn of a possible antitrust violation from a confidential informant, individuals, or corporations applying for amnesty; complaints and referrals from other government departments or agencies; anonymous tips; or through reviews of newspapers, journals, and trade publications. It may develop information about potential criminal violations through grand jury proceedings.

To obtain an estimate of the number of agriculture-related complaints and leads received in fiscal years 1997 through 1999, we interviewed the section or field office chief, assistant section chief, and other knowledgeable Division officials for each of the five legal sections and seven field offices that potentially handle matters in the agriculture industry during this period. These officials provided information on the number of complaints and leads received and the methods they used to record and track them.", "To gather information on the number and type of matters closed in the agriculture industry in fiscal years 1997 through 1999, we obtained data on the characteristics of the matters for selected SIC codes and for the relevant time period from the Division\u2019s MTS. However, some of the data in MTS were not accurate and reliable. For example, actions were shown as being taken on matters after the matter had been recorded as closed, or links were not being established between related matters. We also reviewed opening and closing memorandums for matters that were closed without the filing of a complaint to determine the reasons for closing the matters. We did not attempt to determine the appropriateness of the Division\u2019s prosecutorial decisions.", "More detailed information about our scope and methodology can be found in appendix I.

Officials from the Division, FTC, and USDA said that their agencies maintain a cooperative working relationship with regard to anticompetitive matters in the agriculture industry. According to Division and FTC officials, their agencies\u2019 interactions with respect to specific matters generally occur during the clearance process established between them to determine which agency will investigate potential antitrust violations for which they have joint jurisdiction.

Division, FTC, and USDA officials described the MOU as memorializing a long- standing, cooperative working relationship between the agencies. Under the MOU, each agency agreed to designate a primary contact person to facilitate communication among agency officials. The Division\u2019s designated contact is an attorney-advisor in the Legal Policy Section. However, in practice, this responsibility is shared with the Division\u2019s Special Counsel for Agriculture. FTC\u2019s contact is the Deputy Director in the Bureau of Competition; and USDA\u2019s contact is the Assistant General Counsel, Trade Practices Division. The officials in the three agencies could not determine whether there has been any change in the purpose or frequency of contact since the MOU was signed because they have not tracked, nor do they currently track, communications, coordination, or consultations between the agencies.", "To avoid duplication of effort in areas of antitrust enforcement in which FTC and the Division share enforcement jurisdiction, the agencies issued joint clearance procedures, most recently revised in December 1993, to determine which agency will pursue an investigation. According to Division officials, the agencies interact on specific matters mainly around these procedures. Appendix III provides, among other things, information on the clearance procedures.", "According to Division officials, the August 1999 MOU is the only formal procedure relating to the interaction between the Division and USDA. FTC has had a formal agreement with USDA since at least 1958 regarding investigations in the wholesale or retail food industry.", "According to Division and USDA officials, USDA provides the Division with useful information about agricultural markets that the Division uses in its economic analysis of a particular industry. Additionally, when USDA uncovers conduct that it believes may violate antitrust laws, it has the authority to refer the matter to the Division for possible investigation and enforcement action. Our review of 64 matters that the Division closed after conducting a preliminary investigation (PI) during fiscal years 1997 through 1999 revealed that 1 matter was referred from USDA.

As a result, the Division did not know how many complaints it had received nor did it have complete data on their characteristics. Such problems continued during the period of our review, fiscal years 1997 through 1999. High-level Division officials were not aware of a policy requiring staff to document all complaints and leads from the public, and the Division did not have a uniform database to provide divisionwide information on complaints and leads. During the course of our review, the Division took steps to improve its documentation of complaints and leads. If fully implemented, these steps should move the Division in a positive direction toward addressing the deficiencies we identified. However, the improvements do not allow the Division to track complaints and leads by industry classifications, and on the basis of past history, the information may still be collected inconsistently by the sections and field offices. Thus, better guidance and closer management attention to monitoring the documentation of complaints and leads will be necessary.", "We met with high-level Division officials, including the Chief of the Legal Policy Section and an attorney-advisor in that section; the Special Counsel for Agriculture; and the attorney who, according to Division officials, handles the largest number of the complaints and leads in the agriculture industry. We asked them whether the 1980 policy cited in our 1991 report was still in effect. Initially, the officials were not aware of whether such a policy was still in effect. According to the officials, the Division could provide only an estimate of the number of complaints and leads received in the agriculture industry.", "On February 29, 2000, the Division\u2019s Chief of Staff issued a memorandum to all section and field office chiefs stating that the Attorney General wanted to ensure that the Department of Justice was answering all of its mail and telephone inquiries in a timely and effective way. The memorandum required all sections and field offices to use the Division\u2019s CCTS to track inquiries from the public to help ensure that the Division was responsive to incoming inquiries. However, in June and July 2000 when we conducted our structured interviews with section and field office staff responsible for documenting and tracking complaints and leads, they were not all using CCTS, and two told us they had never heard of CCTS.", "When the Division began implementing CCTS in 1997, the Division encouraged, but did not require, the sections and field offices to use CCTS for general and telephone correspondence. CCTS was designed primarily to record information on controlled correspondence (e.g., correspondence received from the White House; Congress; and federal, state, and local agencies). CCTS includes such information as the complainant\u2019s name, address, phone number, position, and organization; the date received, date assigned, section name, staff assigned, response due date, and date completed; and a description of the complaint and keywords. CCTS does not include specific fields to capture information on SIC codes or related industries or the final outcome of complaints and leads received from the public. Additionally, CCTS is not linked to the Division\u2019s MTS. As a result, CCTS does not have the information needed to analyze patterns of potential anticompetitive behavior that might emerge from complaints and leads related to specific industries or to track the ultimate outcome of a complaint or lead.", "Subsequent to our interviews with the five legal sections and seven field offices that would potentially handle complaints and leads related to the agriculture industry, Division officials determined that the July 2, 1980, directive requiring staff to document all complaints and leads was still in effect. The 1980 directive outlined the Division\u2019s policies and procedures for handling all unsolicited contacts of a routine and nonsensitive nature from the general public, whether by letter, telephone call, or personal visit. The directive required that staff   ensure that unsolicited public contacts are assigned promptly to the appropriate staff member(s); log basic information about each contact;  mail written responses, if warranted, within 20 working days of the date the inquiry was received by the Division;   maintain a central file in each section and office of all correspondence and notes on telephone calls and visits; and   make all logs and files described in the directive available for review by Division officials."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Reported Data on Number of Complaints and Leads Received", "paragraphs": ["In the absence of a central source of uniform, complete, and reliable data on complaints and leads, the Division agreed to let us contact officials in five legal sections and seven field offices to obtain any available data on complaints and leads received in those sections and field offices.According to the data provided, the Division received 165 agriculture- related complaints and leads in fiscal years 1997 through 1999, 14 of which resulted in a PI being initiated (see table 1).

We did not verify the accuracy or completeness of the information provided. Officials in Transportation, Energy and Agriculture (TEA), which received the largest number of complaints and leads reported to us, indicated that the numbers for fiscal years 1997 and 1998 did not, to their knowledge, include complaints received by phone and that the 1999 data were based on information from the two section attorneys who received \u201cmost\u201d of the complaints and leads for the section.", "According to Division officials, the Division receives many complaints reporting conduct that is unrelated to antitrust. In these instances, they said that a complaint might be referred to an appropriate federal, state, or local agency. For example, 4 of the 165 complaints and leads the Division received during fiscal years 1997 through 1999 were referred to FTC. On some occasions, they said the Division section may refer an antitrust- related complaint or lead to another Division section, to FTC, or to the appropriate state attorney general\u2019s office. If a Division attorney determines that there are sufficient indications of an antitrust violation to open an investigation beyond discussions with the complainant, he or she is to draft a PI request memorandum.", "According to Division officials, staff can generally determine whether the information provided by a complainant merits further investigation. The Division may respond to a complainant by telephone or in writing. Division officials also said that many complaints in the agriculture industry are general in nature, with no information useful for an investigation, and that the Division\u2019s response to such a general complaint typically   attempts to educate the complainant on antitrust laws and the Division\u2019s role in enforcing them,   describes the type of evidence needed to open an investigation or bring a case, and invites the complainant to come back to the Division with more specific information that might indicate a possible antitrust violation.", "On October 24, 2000, the Division rescinded the 1980 policy and issued a new directive requiring all of its sections and offices to (1) use the Division\u2019s CCTS to document and track all unsolicited public contacts (such as complaints and leads) and (2) maintain a central file of these contacts. This directive made section and field office chiefs responsible for ensuring that the procedures are routinely followed. The October 2000 directive was replaced with a November 27, 2000, directive. The only difference between the two directives was that the November directive made reference to an optional word perfect form that staff could use\u2014in addition to CCTS, not in lieu of it\u2014to document information for the section\u2019s or office\u2019s own central file. Consistent with the 1980 directive, neither the October 24, 2000, directive nor the November 27, 2000, directive provided guidance on the information that staff are required to document on each contact.

We encountered several problems with the MTS data, including inconsistencies on matter status and type. For example, there were many matters for which the final disposition was unclear according to our review of the MTS data. For some of the matters we reviewed, the MTS data indicated that actions had been taken on matters after the matters had been recorded as closed.  In addition, the dispositions for some of the matters were not appropriate for the particular phase of the matters. We worked with Division officials to resolve these issues wherever possible. Recognizing its limitations, we believe the adjusted MTS data we used can provide a general profile of agriculture-related matters closed by the Division during fiscal years 1997- 1999. We used the MTS data because there is no other comprehensive listing of the Division\u2019s matters and their status.", "According to Division officials, there were several causes for the MTS data problems we encountered. Some of the matters we reviewed were entered into the Division\u2019s older system, the Antitrust Management Information System (AMIS), and were incorporated into MTS without change. A 1991 GAO report reported that there were inaccuracies and inconsistencies in the AMIS data. Concerning the matters for which MTS incorrectly indicated that the matter was closed following the PI, Division officials said it is possible to have further action after a matter is closed. Occasionally, evidence associated with a particular investigation would initially prove inadequate for further prosecutorial action. However, several months or years later, evidence may become available, and instead of opening a new PI, the Division would reopen the original investigation. We did not test the MTS data to determine the full nature or extent of the data reliability problems. However, with the corrections made with the assistance of Division officials, the MTS data we used can provide a general profile of the status of agriculture-related matters closed by the Division in fiscal years 1997 through 1999."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Most Closed Matters Involved Hart-Scott- Rodino Filings and Were Not Pursued", "paragraphs": ["MTS data showed that the Division closed 1,050 matters involving mergers and potential antitrust violations in the agricultural industry during fiscal years 1997 through 1999.

As previously noted, the majority of the 1,050 matters closed by the Division during this period were filings submitted under the premerger notification provisions of the HSR Act. In about 88 percent of these filings, the Division did not initiate any formal investigative inquiries because it concluded that the matters did not appear to raise significant competitive concerns warranting a more thorough review. These matters were closed without further action on or before the expiration of the initial 30-day HSR waiting period expired. Table 4 shows the number of matters closed by the Division by the last phase of inquiry or action taken in the matter. The categories are listed in the general order of resources expended on the matter. For example, HSR filings that expired within the initial 30-day waiting period or that were cleared to FTC would not generally result in a preliminary inquiry. Conversely, a civil investigative demand (CID) would generally be issued following a preliminary inquiry.", "To determine any differences among various agriculture-related industries, we arrayed the inquiry phases in table 4 by primary SIC category.

The officials indicated that the Division initiated a PI memorandum but that a PI was not conducted for one matter; and the Division had considered opening a PI for another, but then decided not to after gathering additional information about the matter. They indicated that the remaining 11 matters involved Division activities that do not require that a PI be opened\u20145 involved the Division\u2019s responsibilities for granting an export trade certificate, 2 involved judgment enforcement actions, 2 involved judgment modification actions, 1 was a business review letter, and 1 was an internal matter\u2014one field office reviewing another office\u2019s files for ideas on how to approach a possible investigation.", "According to Division officials, the 12 matters for which a PI had been opened, a CID issued, a grand jury convened, or a case filed in court should all have been linked in MTS to other matters in the database. They said that the links apparently had not been made in the database and believed that including these matters in our profile would, therefore, be double-counting. As previously noted, we based our profile on the information that was available in the MTS database. Although we understand the Division\u2019s concern about double-counting, we have not dropped these matters from our analysis for mainly two reasons. First, we do not know whether there were additional cases for which the MTS database was missing appropriate links. It is possible that additional case file review and analysis would have resulted in alterations to the MTS data for other matters. Second, removing these 25 matters from our profile would afford them preferential treatment based on detailed Division research and analyses that were not conducted for all agriculture-related matters in the database. Moreover, the fact that the Division had to conduct additional review on these matters to clarify their status further illustrates that the information in the database is not wholly reliable. Given the problems we encountered with the database throughout this assignment, we believe that the data available from MTS cannot be used without the type of time-consuming checking and scrutiny that the Division and we performed.

The Division\u2019s new policy requiring staff to document all complaints and leads in CCTS is a step in the right direction. However, given our 1991 finding that the 1980 policy was not being followed by all sections and field offices and given the findings of our current review, we believe that better guidance and closer management attention will be needed to ensure compliance with whatever policy is in place.", "However, even if the new policy is implemented consistently, the CCTS system is inadequate for providing the information needed to assess patterns in complaints and leads by industry or track and analyze the results of complaints and leads. CCTS does not include specific fields for SIC code or the final outcome of complaints and leads received from the public. Furthermore, the Division\u2019s primary management information system for tracking matters, MTS, does not include information on the source of a matter, nor is it linked to CCTS. As a result, Division officials may not have readily available information on the source of matters and the specific industries about which the Division is receiving complaints.", "The data in the Division\u2019s MTS, which are used for developing management and budget reports, are not totally accurate and reliable. Errors have been identified that have not been corrected. For example, links were not consistently established between related matters, and actions were recorded after matters had reportedly been closed. Given the problems we encountered with the MTS database throughout this assignment, we believe that MTS information should be used with caution and that an accurate, detailed picture of the Division\u2019s workload cannot readily be determined until the Division corrects the errors that have been identified and verifies that all MTS data are accurate and reliable."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["To ensure that (1) all complaints and leads are documented as required by the Division policy; (2) data are readily available on the final outcome of complaints and leads, the source of matters, referrals of matters to other agencies, and the specific industries in which the Division receives complaints and leads; and (3) the Division has an accurate and reliable database that can be used to prepare meaningful management and budget reports, we recommend that the Attorney General direct the Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust to   modify CCTS to capture the related SIC code(s);   monitor compliance with the November 27, 2000, policy regarding documenting and tracking public inquiries; link CCTS to MTS to provide a mechanism to determine the source of the matter and the ultimate outcome of a complaint; and   correct the errors that have been identified in MTS as a result of our work and verify that the MTS data are accurate and reliable."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["Justice\u2019s Antitrust Division provided written comments on a draft of this report. In its comments, which are included as appendix V, the Division stated that our recommendation to incorporate a data field for SIC codes into CCTS was reasonable and that it would also consider our recommendation to link CCTS to MTS to enable the Division to track the results of citizens\u2019 complaints.  The Division was silent on our recommendation that it monitor compliance with the November 27, 2000, policy regarding documenting and tracking public inquiries.", "The Division took issue with our recommendation to correct errors and improve the accuracy and reliability of MTS data. The Division stated that although data linkages can be improved and data coding reviewed to ensure consistency, MTS is soundly structured, logically presented, and contains fully reliable data.  The Division contended that we based our conclusion concerning the reliability of MTS data largely on the results of 25 of 1,050 agriculture-related matters.", "We continue to believe that the Division needs to take steps to improve the accuracy and reliability of MTS data.  Contrary to the Division\u2019s assertions, the basis for our conclusion goes beyond the 25 matters highlighted in the report.  On numerous occasions during our review, we had to ask officials for clarification about data issues because the information as presented was not clear or appeared to be in error.  For example, there were many matters for which we could not determine the final disposition on the basis of the data recorded.  Division officials needed to devote considerable time and effort to respond to questions and issues we raised. MTS data should not require repeated reviews and refinements to produce accurate data on simple frequency counts of the number of matters closed. The finding of missing database links for 12 of the 25 matters further illustrates the difficulty of creating accurate frequency counts using the MTS database without careful and time-consuming review of the data, sometimes requiring a review of the case files. The Division acknowledged in its letter that it is currently reviewing how best to ensure that any similar linkage issues are identified and corrected, and it is updating MTS as new information becomes available and inaccuracies or gaps are discovered. These statements show that the Division recognizes that information in the MTS database needs improvement.", "In connection with its discussion on data reliability problems, the Division mistakenly stated that we found that its reopening of previously closed matters was an indication of incorrect closures.  We recognize that closed matters are sometimes reopened in light of new evidence and do not object to the Division doing so.  Our point was that the database does not accurately portray this activity, and we noted this as another example of MTS failing to accurately represent Division activity.  However, we modified the language in our report to clarify this issue.", "The Division also commented on four other items discussed in our report. First, the Division stated that contrary to our assertion, it could report direct labor costs for matters but not from one central data source. During our review a high-level Division official stated that although it is true that MTS does not contain accurate data on direct labor costs for specific matters, such data would be available through various other sources. However, at a meeting to discuss direct labor costs, among other things, this official told us that although the Division could provide us with these data with considerable effort, the data would be incomplete and lack credibility.", "Second, the Division indicated that its efforts to improve its documentation of complaints and leads began well before we initiated our review.  However, the Division\u2019s response ignores the fact that the problems we identified in tracking complaints and leads were also identified in our 1991 report.  Thus, any corrective actions taken over the last 10 years were insufficient to address the deficiencies identified in that report.  As noted in our report, at the beginning of our review Division officials were unsure whether the 1980 policy to document and track complaints and leads was still in effect.  Further, at the beginning of our review the Division\u2019s sections and offices were not using a uniform system to document and track complaints and leads.  The Division issued a memorandum in February 2000 that instructed the legal sections and field offices to use CCTS to track all public inquiries and ensure that they were addressed in a timely manner.  In June 2000, we found that 7 out of the 12 sections and field offices were not using CCTS to document and track complaints and leads.  Of the five that were using CCTS, three had begun using it only after March 2000.  In October 2000, the Division issued a directive requiring all sections and field offices to (1) use the CCTS to document and track all unsolicited pubic contacts and (2) maintain a central file of these contacts.", "Third, the Division stated that the draft report gave the impression that if a merger filing under the HSR process did not result in a PI being opened, the Division had taken no action.  It was not our intent to give this impression.  Our report states that the Division took no formal action in these filings.  Further, our report states that it is a normal outcome that PIs are not initiated for the majority of HSR mergers and that such mergers are permitted to proceed at the end of the required waiting period after the Division has concluded that they should be permitted to proceed. However, we modified the language in our report to clarify this issue.", "Fourth, the Division commented on the definition of \u201cagriculture\u201d used to determine which matters to include in our review, intimating perhaps that this was a shortcoming of the Division.  We did not take issue with the Division\u2019s lack of a working definition of agriculture.  We merely stated that because there was no set definition, we needed to determine one to define the constraints of our review.  Furthermore, we relied on the Division\u2019s judgment in this matter and accepted its definition as given.  In fact, the definition the Division provided was the same one that it used in its April 2000 response to Senator Lugar on another agriculture-related antitrust matter.", "The Division also offered technical comments on the draft, which we incorporated where appropriate.  However, we disagree with the Division\u2019s characterization of our description of the antitrust legal framework and antitrust enforcement, as the vast majority of its comments were technical suggestions or editorial preferences and not substantive.  Moreover, in some cases, the Division\u2019s suggested changes altered wording taken directly from the Division\u2019s written policies and procedures. In such cases, we generally retained the wording from the Division\u2019s official documentation.", "We also requested comments from FTC and USDA officials with whom we had met during this review.  Both agencies provided technical comments, which we incorporated where appropriate.", "We will send copies of this report to Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Chairman, and Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Ranking Member, Senate Committee on the Judiciary; Representative Jim Sensenbrenner, Jr., Chairman, and Representative John Conyers, Jr., Ranking Minority Member, House Committee on the Judiciary; the Honorable John D.

To define what complaints, leads, matters, and cases were related to agriculture, we met with the Division and requestor staff to identify the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes that would encompass agriculture. The Division assigns each matter or case one or more SIC codes. As agreed with Senator Grassley\u2019s office, we used the Division\u2019s selected SIC codes to define the agriculture-related activities. The Division\u2019s selected SIC codes used to define the agriculture industry included those specifically related to plant and animal products that originate on land and are commercially cultivated or raised for human or animal consumption, meaning oral ingestion. If any identified complaint, lead, matter, or case included one of these SIC codes, we included it in our analysis. The SIC codes the Division included in its definition for the agricultural industry, as well as the way we grouped them for analysis purposes, are shown in table 6.", "To obtain information on the Division\u2019s interaction with the FTC and USDA, in each of the three agencies, we relied primarily on interviews with key officials in the Division, FTC, and USDA. We relied on these officials\u2019 representation of the agencies\u2019 interaction. We also reviewed the Division\u2019s policies and procedures for interacting with other agencies and relevant interagency agreements, including the 1999 Memorandum of Understanding that addresses cooperation among the Division, FTC, and USDA for monitoring competitive conditions in the agricultural marketplace. In addition, we reviewed Division testimonies, speeches, and press statements that addressed the interaction among the agencies. With regard to merger investigations, we reviewed agreements between the Division and FTC for cases that fell within the joint antitrust jurisdiction of both agencies. These included a 1993 agreement that established clearance procedures for investigations and a 1995 agreement in which the agencies agreed to specific time frames for deciding which agency should investigate a matter.", "Because the Division had not collected consistent, divisionwide information on complaints and leads, we relied on data provided by Division officials to obtain information about the agriculture-related complaints and leads the Division received by mail, telephone, facsimile, e-mail, or personal visit during fiscal years 1997 through 1999. To obtain information on the policies and procedures for documenting and tracking complaints and leads, we interviewed the Director of Legal Policy; the Chief of the Legislative Unit; the Executive Officer; the Special Counsel for Agriculture; and the Directors of Criminal Enforcement, Civil Merger Enforcement, and Civil Nonmerger Enforcement. In addition, we reviewed the Division\u2019s directives for tracking complaints and leads. We also held structured interviews with Division officials representing the five headquarters sections or task forces\u2014Civil Task Force; Litigation I section; Litigation II section; Transportation, Energy and Agriculture section, and Merger Task Force\u2014and the seven field offices\u2014Atlanta, Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas, New York, Philadelphia, and San Francisco\u2014 that Division officials said would most likely have reviewed anticompetitive matters in the agriculture industry for the period we reviewed. We asked them to describe their policies and procedures for documenting and tracking complaints and leads. We provided them with the agriculture-related SIC codes, and we asked them to provide us with data on, among other things, the total number of agriculture-related complaints and leads received by SIC code for each fiscal year 1997 through 1999 and the outcome of the complaint or lead. Because of the variety of methods used to track complaints and leads within the Division, we could not verify the accuracy or completeness of the data provided to us.", "To summarize and describe the matters that were closed during fiscal year 1997 through 1999, we analyzed data from the Division\u2019s Matter Tracking System (MTS). MTS contains information on all civil merger, civil nonmerger, and criminal matters handled by the Division. As each matter goes through various phases in the enforcement process, MTS is to capture each phase and its related disposition. MTS is designed and used primarily for Division management purposes.", "We obtained data on the characteristics of the matters for those agriculture-related SIC codes for fiscal years 1997 through 1999. To understand the data elements in MTS and how the Division systematically maintains information on matters during its review of potential anticompetitive conduct, we reviewed the Antitrust Division Manual and the Division\u2019s MTS data dictionary, and we met with officials from the Division\u2019s Information Systems Support Group.", "We defined a closed matter as any effort (e.g., a case, an investigation, an inquiry, etc.) in the database that the Division closed during fiscal years 1997, 1998, or 1999. The database defines matters by use of a unique identification number, which tracks efforts that may span multiple years and/or contain multiple phases. We used this number to identify each individual matter.", "To provide a profile, we categorized the closed matters in the agriculture industry into the following groups: 1.  Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) matters that expired by the 30-day limit (under Division purview), 2.  HSR matters that were cleared to FTC, 3.  non-HSR matters on which a formal PI was not opened (under Division 4.  non-HSR matters that were cleared to FTC, 5.  matters in which a PI was opened but no further action was taken by 6.  matters on which a civil investigation was conducted or a grand jury 7.  matters for which a civil or criminal case was filed in court, or 8.  business review matters.", "The groups were defined on the basis of the last phase recorded in the database for the matter. A matter in group (7), for example, might have originated as an HSR filing; but it was assigned to group (7) because the last phase recorded either indicated that a case was filed, or it gave the outcome (e.g., \u201cwon\u201d) of the case.", "To augment MTS information for our profile of closed matters, we reviewed Antitrust Division memorandums for matters for which a PI was conducted but no further actions were taken by the Division. Our data collection instrument included the dates that the investigation was authorized to be opened and closed, the type of matter, statute and potential antitrust conduct violated, geographic market, amount of commerce affected, SIC code(s), section assigned to review the matter, reason for closing the investigation, and whether or not there was economic analysis group concurrence.", "For those matters for which we were unable to understand the information provided in the memoranda, we spoke with a Division official to clarify the information.

Where it is unclear whether the conduct in question would be a civil or criminal violation, the Division\u2019s policy is usually to open a civil investigation.

Generally, staff should decide within 5 business days of receipt of an HSR filing (3 days in the case of a cash tender offer or a bankruptcy filing) whether the filing raises competitive issues that need to be investigated.

According to Division officials, the Division\u2019s and FTC\u2019s joint Horizontal Merger Guidelines are a reasonably accurate portrayal of how the Division and FTC generally conduct their analyses of proposed mergers. The guidelines were originally developed in 1982 and were updated in 1992. In 1997, the efficiencies section of the guidelines was expanded. The unifying theme of the guidelines is that mergers should not be permitted to create or enhance market power or facilitate its exercise. The guidelines define a seller\u2019s market power as the ability to profitably maintain selling prices above competitive levels for a significant period of time. Similarly, a buyer\u2019s market power is defined as the ability to profitably maintain buying prices below competitive levels for a significant period of time.", "The guidelines outline the five-step analytical process the Division is to use to determine whether a merger is likely to substantially lessen competition and, ultimately, whether to challenge a merger. The Division is to (1) delineate the relevant market and assess whether the merger would significantly increase concentration and result in a concentrated market; (2) identify the market participants, assign shares, and assess whether increased market concentration from the proposed merger raises concern about potential adverse competitive effects; (3) assess whether entry into the market would be timely, likely and sufficient either to deter or to counteract the competitive effects of concern; (4) assess any efficiency gains that cannot be reasonably achieved by the parties absent the proposed merger; and (5) determine whether, but for the merger, either party to the transaction would be likely to fail and exit the market.", "A post-merger HHI between 1,000 and 1,800 indicates moderate concentration. Mergers producing an increase in the HHI of less than 100 points in moderately concentrated markets postmerger are unlikely to have adverse competitive effects and generally require no further analysis. Mergers resulting in an increase in the HHI of more than 100 points in moderately concentrated markets postmerger potentially raise significant competitive concerns. A postmerger HHI above 1,800 indicates a highly concentrated market. Mergers producing an increase in the HHI of less than 50 points even in highly concentrated markets postmerger are unlikely to have adverse competitive consequences and ordinarily require no further analysis.  Mergers resulting in an increase in the HHI of more than 50 points in highly concentrated markets postmerger potentially raise significant competitive concerns.", "When the postmerger HHI exceeds 1,800, the Division assumes that mergers producing an increase in the HHI of more than 100 points are likely to create or enhance market power or facilitate its exercise.
