All 50 civilian agency contractors we investigated had abusive and potentially criminal activity. For example, businesses with employees did not forward payroll taxes withheld from their employees to IRS. Willful failure to remit payroll taxes is a felony under U.S. law. Further, several individuals own multiple businesses with unpaid federal taxes--one individual owns about 20 businesses that did not fully pay taxes related to over 300 returns. Some contractors purchased or owned millions of dollars of property while they did not remit payroll taxes. These activities were identified for contractors at the Departments of Justice, Homeland Security, and Veterans Affairs; the National Aeronautics and Space Administration; and others agencies. GAO's analysis indicates that if all tax debts owed by, and all payments made to, the 33,000 contractors were included in the FPLP, FMS could have collected hundreds of millions of dollars in fiscal year 2004. However, because only a fraction of all unpaid taxes and a portion of FMS payments are subjected to the levy program, FMS actually collected only $16 million from civilian contractors. For example, about $171 billion of unpaid federal taxes were not sent to the levy program to be offset against payments because of specific statutory requirements or IRS policy exclusions, such as debtors' claims of financial hardship or bankruptcy. Tens of billions of dollars in federal payments were not compared against tax debts for potential levy because FMS did not proactively manage and oversee the levy program. Until we brought it to FMS's attention, FMS did not know that it did not submit $40 billion of contractor payments from some civilian agencies for potential levy. FMS also did not identify payment files that did not contain contractor tax identification numbers, names, or both, resulting in $21 billion in payments to contractors that could not be levied. FMS also excluded billions of dollars from levy because of what it considered programming limitations without taking proactive steps to overcome those limitations. Further, civilian agency purchase card payments to contractors totaling $10 billion could not be levied. Improvements at FMS could result in tens of millions of dollars of additional levies annually."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The success of our tax system hinges on the public\u2019s perception of its  fairness, including the extent to which taxpayers believe their friends,  neighbors, and business competitors are complying with the tax laws and  are actually paying their taxes. The Internal Revenue Service\u2019s (IRS) own  data in this regard are not encouraging. IRS reported that the federal  government does not receive hundreds of billions of dollars in taxes owed  annually. Recent IRS data, released in March 2005, showed that the  estimated net annual tax gap\u2014the difference between what taxpayers  should pay on a timely basis and what IRS collected through voluntary  compliance and enforcement activities\u2014ranged from $250 billion to nearly  $300 billion.", "A portion of the tax gap is owed by contractors receiving payments from  the federal government. For example, in February 2004, we reported that  some Department of Defense (DOD) contractors abuse the federal tax  system with little consequence. In our report and during a related  congressional hearing, we pointed out that based on our analysis of a  limited number of DOD disbursement systems, more than 27,000 DOD  contractors owed nearly $3 billion in unpaid federal taxes. We also  reported that some of these contractors were engaged in abusive and potentially criminal activities. Due to the significance of the issues raised  at that hearing, you asked us to provide additional information about  whether contractors for other federal agencies were engaged in similar tax  abuses and to provide recommendations to increase the effectiveness and  efficiency of tax revenue collections from federal contractors under the  Federal Payment Levy Program (FPLP).", "This is the first in a series of reports to respond to your request.

To identify the extent  of such activities, we analyzed the tax debt and activity of entities with  either the same owners or officers, common taxpayer identification  numbers (TIN) or addresses, or other relationships as a group to identify  patterns of abusive or potentially criminal activities. We will address issues  surrounding the amount of tax debt IRS sends to the FPLP in subsequent  reports.", "To meet our first two objectives, we (1) identified civilian agency  contractors receiving federal payments that owe taxes by comparing the  database of FMS contractor payments with the IRS database of unpaid  taxes, (2) estimated the potential dollar amount that could be collected if  all unpaid taxes owed by civilian contractors and all FMS payments to  civilian contractors were subject to the FPLP, (3) reviewed major federal  laws and regulations and FMS policies on the FPLP, and (4) interviewed  FMS and IRS officials on processes and procedures related to the FPLP. To  avoid overstating the tax debt and potential levy amount, we limited the  population of tax debts from which we performed our analysis to tax debts  that have been agreed to by the taxpayers or confirmed by the courts, tax  debts for periods prior to calendar year 2004, tax debts of more than $100,  and fiscal year 2004 civilian contractor payments paid through FMS of  more than $100.

Specifically, FMS was unable to provide us with electronic disbursement  data related to payments made to contractors through Fedwire, a large  system used for payments requiring same-day settlement. Further, IRS\u2019s  databases do not identify all unpaid federal taxes caused by a contractors\u2019  underreporting of income or failure to file taxes. Because of these  problems, the FMS and IRS data we used will likely understate the  magnitude of contractors with unpaid federal taxes and the potential levy  collection.

For  statutory and logistical reasons, a limited number of other governmental  agencies, such as DOD and the U.S. Postal Service, have their own  authority to disburse funds. Those agencies that have the authority to  disburse federal funds are referred to as Non-Treasury Disbursing Offices.", "Although FMS is the disbursing agent for most of the federal government,  that is, it physically writes the checks or sends the electronic payments, it  does so on the behalf of, and at the direction of, the various federal  agencies. Federal agencies may have multiple offices or locations that  perform accounting for and preparation of payment information, referred  to by FMS as agency locations or paying stations. To generate a payment,  an agency payment location sends FMS a payment file, along with an  accompanying payment certification requesting that FMS disburse funds.  Agencies typically send the certification and detailed payment information  in an automated form, and FMS loads the payment data into its payment  system. Once loaded, FMS verifies that all payment requests were properly  authorized and certified and that the amount on the payment file agrees  with the certification amount before processing the payments for  disbursement.", "FMS disburses federal funds via three main mechanisms: electronic funds  transfer (EFT) via Automated Clearing House (ACH), Fedwire, and checks.

The continuous levy program, now referred to as FPLP, was implemented  in July 2000. The FPLP provides for the levy of various federal payments,  including federal employee retirement payments, certain Social Security  payments, selected federal salaries, and contractor payments. For  payments disbursed by FMS on behalf of most federal agencies, the amount  to be levied and credited to IRS is deducted before FMS disburses the  payment.

Because some unpaid federal taxes are  excluded due to statutory requirements, IRS and FMS would never be able  to collect the entire amount. Over half of the $3.3 billion in tax debt was  coded by IRS as being excluded from the levy program for statutory  reasons, including contractors being in bankruptcy, having installment  payment agreements, or awaiting the completion of the required legal  notifications regarding the tax debt. However, many improvements can be  made to lessen the tax levy collection gap. As will be discussed later in the  report, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 increased the maximum  levy to 100 percent of any specified payments to contractors for goods and  services provided the federal government.

One IRS official  acknowledged that frequently small businesses are undercapitalized and  use the tax money as operating capital. However, employers are subject to  civil and criminal penalties if they do not remit payroll taxes to the federal  government. When an employer withholds taxes from an employee\u2019s  wages, the employer is deemed to have a responsibility to deposit in a  separate bank account these amounts held \u201cin trust\u201d for the federal  government until making a federal tax deposit in that amount. To the  extent these withheld amounts are not forwarded to the federal  government, the employer is liable for these amounts, as well as the  employer\u2019s matching Social Security contributions. Individuals within the  business (e.g., corporate officers) may be held personally liable for the  withheld amounts not forwarded, and they can be assessed a civil  monetary penalty known as a trust fund recovery penalty (TFRP).", "Willful failure to remit payroll taxes is a criminal felony offense  punishable by imprisonment of not more than 5 years, while the failure to  properly segregate payroll taxes can be a criminal misdemeanor offense  punishable by imprisonment of up to a year. The employee is not  responsible for the employer\u2019s failure to remit payroll taxes since the  employer is responsible for submitting the amounts withheld. The Social  Security and Medicare trust funds are subsidized or made whole for unpaid  payroll taxes by the general fund, as we discussed in previous reports.  Over time, the amount of this subsidy is significant.", "As shown in figure 2, over a third of the total tax amount owed by civilian  contractors was for unpaid payroll taxes and over 40 percent was for  corporate income taxes. The remainder consisted of individual income  taxes, and other taxes.

As  reflected in figure 3, over half of the unpaid taxes owed by civilian  contractors were for tax periods prior to calendar year 2000.", "Prompt collection of unpaid taxes is vital because, as our previous work  has shown, as unpaid taxes age, the likelihood of collecting all or a portion  of the amount owed decreases. This is due, in part, to the continued accrual  of interest and penalties on the outstanding federal taxes, which, over time,  can dwarf the original tax obligation. The amount of unpaid federal taxes  reported above does not include all tax debts owed by the civilian agency  contractors due to statutory provisions that give IRS a finite period under  which it can seek to collect on unpaid taxes. Generally, there is a 10-year  statutory collection period beyond which IRS is prohibited from attempting  to collect tax debt.  Consequently, if the contractors owe federal taxes beyond the 10-year statutory collection period, the older tax debt may have  been removed from IRS\u2019s records.

The IRS  database does not reflect amounts owed by businesses and individuals  that have not filed tax returns and for which IRS has not assessed tax  amounts due.", "To avoid overestimating the amount owed by government contractors, we  took a number of steps to exclude unpaid federal taxes that federal  contractors recently incurred or that are not individually significant. For  example, some recently assessed tax debts that appear as unpaid taxes  through a matching of PACER and IRS records may involve matters that are  routinely resolved between the taxpayer and IRS, with the taxes paid,  abated, or both within a short period. We attempted to eliminate these  types of debt by focusing on unpaid federal taxes for tax periods prior to  calendar year 2004 and eliminating tax debt of $100 or less. We also  eliminated all tax debt identified by IRS as not being agreed to by the  contractor. Additionally, we eliminated contractors with tax debt that  received payments of $100 or less during fiscal year 2004.", "Regarding the completeness of FMS disbursement information, we found  that some contractors paid through FMS could not be identified due to  blank or obviously erroneous TINs, such as TINs made up of all zeros or all  nines. The lack of TINs prevented us from determining whether  contractors had unpaid federal taxes and, if so, the amount of unpaid taxes  owed by the contractors. Additionally, as will be discussed in more detail in  a later section of this report, FMS does not maintain detailed electronic  payment information for a large disbursement system\u2014Fedwire\u2014that also  makes disbursements to contractors, and thus the value of unpaid taxes  associated with contractors paid through that system could not be  determined.", "As we have previously reported, IRS records contain errors that affect the  accuracy of taxpayer account information. Consequently, some of the  $3.3 billion may not reflect true unpaid taxes, although we cannot quantify  this amount. Nonetheless, we believe the $3.3 billion represents a  conservative estimate of unpaid federal taxes owed by civilian contractors  paid through FMS.", "Also limiting the completeness of our estimate of the unpaid federal taxes  of civilian contractors is the fact that the IRS tax database reflects only the  amount of unpaid taxes either reported by the contractor on a tax return or  assessed by IRS through its various enforcement programs. The IRS  database does not reflect amounts owed by businesses and individuals that  have not filed tax returns and for which IRS has not assessed tax amounts  due. During our review, we identified instances in which civilian  contractors failed to file tax returns for a particular tax period and,  therefore, were listed in IRS records as having no unpaid taxes for that  period. Further, our analysis did not attempt to account for businesses or  individuals that purposely underreported income and were not specifically  identified by IRS. According to IRS, underreporting of income is the largest  component of the roughly $300 billion tax gap.

Therefore, the effective management of these codes is critical  because if these exclusion codes (such as codes identifying a contractor as  being in bankruptcy or having an installment agreement) remain in the  system for long periods, either because IRS delays processing taxpayer  agreements or because IRS fails to input or reverse codes after processing  is complete, cases may be needlessly excluded from the levy program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Most Tax Debt IRS Submits to the Levy Program Is Not Legally Ready for Levy", "paragraphs": ["FMS records indicate that as of September 30, 2004, about 70 percent of the  tax debt IRS sent to the levy program is not available for immediate levy  because IRS has not completed all the necessary legal notifications before  the levying of payments can begin. In addition to the initial series of notice  letters that are sent out at the beginning of IRS\u2019s collection efforts, IRS is  required to send the debtor an additional notice of intent to levy that  includes information regarding the tax debtor\u2019s right to a hearing prior to  levy action\u2014also referred to as a collection due process notice. Although  the tax debtor has up to 30 days to respond to this notice under the law,  IRS has chosen to wait 10 weeks before proceeding with collection actions,  such as levying. Until the due process notification and waiting period have  been completed, a tax debt may be submitted to TOP but is not subject to  immediate levy. For civilian contractors, IRS generally does not initiate the  collection due process notifications until FMS identifies that the contractor  is to receive a federal payment.", "Once the debtor receives the notice of impending levy, IRS gives the debtor  up to 10 weeks to respond to the notice. As in the initial notice process, the  debtor can respond to IRS by disagreeing with IRS\u2019s assessment (in this  case, filing for a due process hearing), negotiating with IRS to set up an  alternative payment arrangement, applying for a hardship determination, or  making payment in full. If a tax debtor does not respond to IRS and take  advantage of those options within the notification period, IRS will instruct  FMS to start levying future payments. The tax debt in the levy program is  then coded for immediate levy. For future payments, FMS will proceed with  the continuous levy by reducing each scheduled payment to the tax debtor  by 15 percent\u2014or the exact amount of tax owed if it is less than 15 percent  of the payment\u2014until the tax debt is satisfied.", "Not having tax debt ready for levy results in the loss of millions of dollars  of tax revenue for the federal government. For example, for our 50 case  studies we identified payments totaling $1.6 million in which the TIN of the  contractor matched an IRS tax debt, but no levy was taken because IRS had  not yet completed the collection due process activities. This situation  contributes to these contractors facing little or no consequences for their  abuse of the federal tax system. IRS has an automated process in place by  which, once a match is made against a tax debt in the levy program, a due  process notice is automatically sent to the contractor. However, the  payments made between the time of the initial match and when IRS  completes its due process notification process\u2014usually 10 weeks\u2014cannot  be levied and the potential collections are lost to the federal government.  Additionally, if the tax debtor files for a due process hearing once it  receives the notice, the tax debt will continue to be excluded from levy  until the process\u2014which could take months\u2014is complete.", "Prior to 1998, IRS was authorized to levy a payment immediately upon  matching a tax debt with a federal payment so long as the collection due  process notice had been sent. At that time, IRS did not have to wait before  proceeding with the levy. This allowed the levy program to capture the  payment before it was made to preserve the government\u2019s right to the  payment while providing the contractor a postlevy due process. However,  the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998 requires that debtors be  afforded an opportunity for a collection due process hearing before a levy  action can take place. To comply with this provision, IRS has chosen to  wait a minimum of 10 weeks for the tax debtor to respond to the collection  due process notice. However, IRS\u2019s 10-week waiting period causes the  federal government to miss levying some contractor payments.", "IRS has acknowledged that the delay in initiating the due process notice  can result in lost collections and is investigating ways to begin the process  earlier. The joint task force established after our previous audit has  supported making the due process for the FPLP a postlevy process. This  would allow IRS to levy payments when first identified and provide  contractors with procedural due process remedies afterwards. To expedite  the notification, IRS officials stated that they had begun matching new  DOD contracts valued at over $25,000 against tax debt and sending out  collection due process notifications at that time rather than waiting until  payments are made. To address this same issue, the task force is also  exploring avenues to combine the collection due process notice with the  last of its initial notification letters sent to tax debtors. This would allow  IRS to have all tax debt legally ready for levy prior to it being sent to TOP to  be matched against federal payments.

Civilian  agencies operate throughout the country and in more than 250 foreign  countries, carrying out a multitude of missions and programs. Because  civilian agencies contract for a large variety of goods and services to carry  out functions as diverse as guarding the nation\u2019s borders, providing medical  benefits to veterans, administering justice, and exploring space, it is not  surprising that civilian agency contractors with unpaid taxes operate in a  large number of industries.

All 48 of the contractors in our case studies that file business tax  returns had tax periods in which the contractors withheld taxes from their  employees\u2019 paychecks but did not remit them to IRS. Rather, these  companies diverted the money to fund business operations, for personal  gain, or for other purposes. As discussed earlier in this report, businesses  with employees are required by law to remit employment taxes to IRS or  face potential civil or potential criminal penalties. Specifically, the act of  willfully failing to collect or pay any tax is a felony while the failure to  comply with certain requirements for the separate accounting and deposit  of withheld income and employment taxes is a misdemeanor.", "Six of the case study businesses involved owners or officers who were  \u201cmultiple abusers,\u201d those involved with a group of related companies that  owed taxes. The owners or operators of some of these businesses not only  failed to have their businesses pay taxes, but several also failed to pay  their own individual income taxes, with three individuals having more  than $100,000 in unpaid individual income taxes. The related businesses  involving these multiple abusers repeatedly failed to pay taxes. For  example, several groups of related businesses owed taxes for more than  50 tax periods\u2014one group of about 20 businesses owed taxes for over  300 tax periods. One case study business owner (whose businesses  received more than $1 million in federal payments in fiscal year 2004) has a  pattern of opening a business, failing to remit at least some payroll taxes,  closing the business, and then opening a new business to repeat the same  pattern. The owner repeated this pattern for at least three businesses over  nearly 20 years.", "Table 3 highlights 10 case studies with unpaid payroll tax debts. Nine of the  10 cases have unpaid payroll taxes of 10 tax periods or more. The amount  of unpaid taxes associated with these 10 cases ranged from nearly  $400,000 to $18 million\u20146 businesses owed more that $1 million in unpaid  federal taxes. Our investigations revealed that some owners have  substantial personal assets\u2014including commercial real estate, a sports  team, or multiple luxury vehicles\u2014yet their businesses fail to remit the  payroll taxes withheld from employees\u2019 salaries. Several owners owned  homes worth over $1 million\u2014one owner had over $3 million and another  had over $30 million in real estate holdings. Others informed our agents  that they diverted payroll taxes they did not remit to IRS for personal gain  or to fund their business, while others were engaged in activities that  indicated potential diversion of payroll taxes for personal gain. For  example, one owner transferred the payroll taxes he withheld from  employees to a foreign bank account and was using the money to build a  home in that country, while another contractor doubled the salary of an  officer in a 5-year period to over $750,000 at the same time that the  business failed to remit payroll taxes and declared losses of more than  $2 million. Another purchased a number of multimillion-dollar properties  and an unrelated business at the same time that his many businesses owed  taxes, while yet another owner purchased, within a 2-year period, four  vehicles totaling nearly $200,000 after the owner\u2019s business started  accumulating unpaid tax debts.", "IRS has taken some collection actions against the contractors in our case  studies, but has not been successful at collecting the unpaid taxes. For  example, we found that in all 10 cases shown in table 3, IRS has assessed  trust fund penalties on the owners or officers for willful failure to remit to  the government amounts they withheld from their employees\u2019 salaries.  However, as we have previously reported, IRS seldom collects on trust fund  penalties. As of September 30, 2004, the balance on the trust fund penalties  owed by the owners or officers of the 10 case studies was over $19 million.  IRS has also taken some collection actions against all 10 contractors, such  as placing liens on the assets of the companies or owners. Although some  of the owner/officers had substantial assets, including expensive homes  and luxury automobiles, the information we reviewed did not identify  that IRS has performed seizures of these assets. However, we identified  that 3 of the 10 owners or officers had been convicted or indicted for  non-tax-related offenses or were under active IRS investigation for  tax-related offenses.", "The following provides illustrative detailed information on several of  these cases.", "Case 1: This case includes many related companies that provide health  care services to the Department of Veterans Affairs, for which they  received over $300,000 in payments during fiscal year 2004. The related  companies have different names, operate in a number of different  locations, and use at least several other TINs. However, they share a  common owner and contact address. The businesses collectively owed  more than $18 million in tax debts\u2014of which nearly $17 million is  unpaid federal payroll taxes dating back to the mid-1990s. IRS has  assessed a multimillion-dollar trust fund penalty for willful failure to  remit payroll taxes on each of two officers. During the early 2000s, at the  time when the owner\u2019s business and related companies were still  incurring payroll tax debts, the owner purchased a number of  multimillion-dollar properties, an unrelated business, and a number of  luxury vehicles. Our investigation also determined that real estate  holdings registered to the owner totaled more than $30 million.", "Case 2: This case comprises a number of related entities, all of which  provide waste collection and recycling services. These entities received  fiscal year 2004 payments from the Department of Justice totaling over  $700,000, about half of which is from purchase card payments, while  owing in aggregate over $2 million in tax debt. These taxes date to the  late 1990s and consist primarily of payroll taxes. Despite the fact that  the company reportedly used legally available means to repeatedly  block federal efforts to file liens against the company, liens totaling  more than $1 million exist against the company. IRS has also assessed  trust fund penalties against the two officers. At the same time that the  entities were incurring the tax debt, cash withdrawals totaling millions  of dollars were made against the business\u2019s bank account. Further, since  the company started owing taxes, the owner had sold real estate valued  at over $1 million. The executives of these entities also drive late-model  luxury or antique automobiles. Recently, the company started to make  payments on its taxes.", "Case 3: This case includes several nursing care facilities, three of which  owed taxes\u2014primarily payroll\u2014totaling nearly $9 million. In addition,  an owner\u2019s individual income tax debt totaled more than $400,000. One  business provides nursing care services to the Department of Veterans  Affairs, for which it was paid over $200,000 during fiscal year 2004. An  officer of the company has been assessed a multimillion-dollar trust  fund penalty for willful failure to remit payroll taxes and was recently  arrested on fraud charges. Our investigative work indicates that an  owner of the company made multiple cash withdrawals, each valued at  tens of thousands of dollars, in the early 2000s while owing payroll  taxes, and that those cash withdrawals were used for gambling. We  further determined that cash transfers totaling over $7 million were  made in a 7-month period in the early 2000s.", "Case 7: This contractor provided guard and armed security services to  the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Veterans  Affairs, for which it was paid over $200,000 during fiscal year 2004. This  business has a history of noncompliance with federal tax laws.  Specifically, the business was consistently delinquent in paying its taxes  since the late 1990s and has not filed all its income and payroll tax  returns for a number of years in the late 1990s. The owner of this  business also has not filed individual income tax returns for a number  of years since the late 1990s. In the last 1-year period that the business  made payroll tax deposits, the business reported that it owed nearly  $80,000 in payroll taxes but made payments totaling less than $4,000\u2014 about one-twentieth of the taxes owed. At the same time that the owner  withheld but failed to remit payroll taxes, the owner diverted the money  into a foreign bank account to build a house overseas.", "Case 8: During fiscal year 2004, this company provided consulting  services to the Smithsonian Institution, for which it received over  $200,000. Starting in the late 1990s, the company did not remit to the  government all the money it withheld from its employees\u2019 salaries.  However, at about the time the company was failing to remit the taxes, it  nearly doubled one officer\u2019s salary to over $750,000.

One case study contractor in  particular illustrated the problems associated with the levy program that  we discussed earlier in this report. This contractor received $4 million  during fiscal year 2004, but only about $600,000 of those payments were  levied. Of the remaining $3.4 million that was not levied, about two-thirds  was not levied because the tax debt was either not referred to TOP or it  was referred to TOP but it was still in the notice process during the first 7  months of fiscal year 2004. The remaining one-third was not levied because  the name provided in the payment files did not match the IRS control name  in TOP or because payments were made using one of its specialized  mechanisms. We estimate that if all the tax debt and all of the payments of  the 50 case studies were subjected to a levy of 15 percent, FMS could have  collected about $3.8 million in unpaid federal taxes in fiscal year 2004.

The levy program has thus far been  inhibited from achieving its potential primarily because substantial tax  debt is not subject to levy and because FMS, the nation\u2019s debt collector, has  exercised ineffective oversight and management of the program.", "Further, by failing to pay taxes on their income or diverting the payroll  taxes withheld from their employees\u2019 salaries to fund business operations  or their own personal lifestyles, contractors with unpaid tax debts  effectively decrease their operating costs. The lower operating costs  provide these individuals and their companies with an unfair competitive  advantage over the vast majority of companies that pay their fair share of  taxes. Federal contractors should be held to a higher degree of  responsibility to pay their fair share of taxes owed because they are being  paid by the government, and the failure to effectively enforce the tax laws  against them encourages noncompliance among other contractors as well.

IRS noted that it had taken  or was taking a number of actions toward this goal. For example, IRS  stated that it had begun, with DOD\u2019s assistance, to issue collection due  process notices to DOD contractors at the time of contract award rather  than after a contract payment is made, thereby allowing IRS to levy more  DOD contractor payments without delay. IRS stated that it planned to  expand this process to contractors at other agencies later in 2005. IRS also  stated that it is working to change its notice process so that more debts can  be ready for levy at the time of inclusion in TOP. IRS reiterated the progress  it has made to remove systematic exclusions, resulting in an additional  $28 billion in tax debts being included in the FPLP, which we noted in our  report. These actions have resulted in the federal government collecting, in  the first 7 months of fiscal year 2005, $12.2 million in unpaid tax debts from  civilian contractors\u2014a nearly threefold increase from the same period in  fiscal year 2004. IRS further stated that it would continuously evaluate its  policies so that it does not unnecessarily exclude tax debts from the  levy program.", "IRS concurred with our finding that the matching of the TIN and name of  contractor payments against records of unpaid federal taxes could be  improved, and stated that it will begin sending a greater number of control  names\u2014up to 10 variations of the contractor\u2019s name as recorded in IRS\u2019s  files\u2014to FMS to match against FMS\u2019s payment data. IRS also stated that it  was working to develop a consent-based TIN verification system for  contractors doing business with the federal government and that it  anticipated implementation of this system later this year. We believe that  the completion of these actions can significantly improve collections of  outstanding federal tax debt through the levy program.", "With respect to the report\u2019s recommendations, IRS agreed to work with  FMS and other agencies through the Federal Contractor Tax Compliance  Task Force (FCTC) to conduct further analysis of the significant challenge  presented by contractors paid with purchase cards. IRS also stated that as  of April 2005, the 100 percent levy provision had been implemented with  respect to DOD contractors paid through DOD\u2019s largest payment system,  and that IRS was working with Treasury on a technical correction to allow  the 100 percent levy on all federal contractors. Finally, IRS agreed with our  recommendation to review the 50 contractors discussed in our report to  determine what additional actions are warranted."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Response from FMS and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In its response to a draft of our report, FMS generally agreed with many of  our findings and recommendations. However, FMS stated that we  mischaracterized its role in the levy process, and that primary  responsibility rests with IRS. FMS also did not concur with our conclusions  that its oversight and management of the program were ineffective.  Additionally, FMS disagreed that it had not fully implemented the  legislatively authorized increase in the maximum amount of contractor  payments subject to levy. FMS also stated that it disagreed with our  recommendation that it withhold payments that do not include a valid  name and stated that it was not in a position to implement our  recommendations with respect to working with IRS regarding issues  associated with collecting outstanding federal tax debt from purchase card  payments. Finally, FMS stated that the numbers and potential levy  collection amounts presented in the report were confusing and could be  misleading.", "We do not believe we mischaracterized FMS\u2019s role in the levy process. On  its Web site, FMS states that it \u201cserves as the government\u2019s central debt  collection agency, managing the government\u2019s delinquent debt portfolio.\u201d In  our opinion, the agency that is responsible for managing the government\u2019s  delinquent debt portfolio needs to do so in a proactive manner, which we  did not always find to be the case. While we agree that IRS has a key role in  the levy process, many of the issues in our report touch at the heart of  FMS\u2019s debt collection responsibilities and most of the weaknesses and  challenges discussed in this report can only be addressed by FMS. For  example, it was FMS that did not send billions of dollars of payments to the  levy program because it had no monitoring mechanism in place to  determine that over 100 agency paying locations created since the late  1990s were not included in the levy program. Further, it was FMS that did  not identify and inform agencies to correct payment information for tens  of billion of dollars in payments that did not have the basic information  necessary for the payments to be matched against outstanding federal tax  debt for potential levy. These findings form the basis of our conclusion that  FMS has not exercised effective oversight and management of the levy  program.", "Despite the issues raised in our report, which FMS did not dispute, it  disagreed that its management of the program was ineffective. FMS  pointed to increased collections from the levy program in fiscal years 2003,  2004, and 2005, to date, as evidence of excellent leadership and program  management. However, the recent increase in collections in the levy  program is primarily the result of actions stemming from the formation of  the FCTC, which was created in response to issues we raised in our  February 2004 report on DOD contractors that abused the tax system.  Further, the actions that have led to the increased collections were taken  by DOD and IRS. Finally, while collections have increased in the last  3 years, the annual totals to date have not been significant given the  potential of the program and, in the context of the program\u2019s 8-year life, the  annual increases have come about only very recently.", "In its response, FMS stated that it is not normally in a position to mandate  changes to agencies. We disagree. FMS is in a unique position to identify  and help correct many of the issues we identified in the program, some of  which are relatively simple and could be quickly addressed. For example, it  took the Department of State (State) about a month to correct the problem  we identified with respect to missing names in the payment file it had been  submitting to FMS for payment once we brought the matter to the  department\u2019s attention. A programming error appears to have resulted in  the names not being in the disbursement files sent to FMS. According to a  State official, the department has likely had names of its payment files  since the 1980s, and it did not know that the names were not getting to  FMS. Because of State\u2019s responsiveness to our finding, FMS is now levying  payments from State\u2019s contractors with unpaid taxes. Had FMS provided  effective oversight and management of the debt collection program, it  could have detected the problem years ago and worked with the State  Department to correct it long before our audit. While we agree that  agencies should be responsible for the completeness and accuracy of the  payment files they send to FMS, we believe FMS should take a more  proactive role in identifying issues that impede the program\u2019s ability to  maximize collections and work with agencies to resolve such issues.", "In responding to our report, FMS disagreed with our conclusion that it had  not implemented the provision of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004  authorizing an increase in the maximum amount of contractor payments  subject to levy of up to 100 percent. FMS noted that it had made the  changes necessary in the levy program to allow for levying at 100 percent,  but that it was unable to implement the provision because civilian agencies\u2019  payment records do not separately identify real estate transactions\u2014which  are not subject to the 100 percent levy\u2014from other contractor payments.  Our report clearly indicates that the 100 percent levy provision had not yet  been fully implemented because of a number of challenges, including the  determination by IRS that real estate transactions are not subject to the  100 percent levy provision, and that agency pay systems are presently  unable to identify real estate transactions from other contractor payments.  We also acknowledged in our report that a legislative change is being  sought to subject real estate payments to the 100 percent levy provision.  Our report describes this issue not as a weakness in the program but,  rather, as another challenge that FMS faces in maximizing collections  under the levy program. Our report also acknowledges that certain DOD  payments are already being levied at the 100 percent maximum.", "FMS also did not concur with our recommendation to withhold payments  that do not include a valid name in the payment record. However, FMS said  it would improve monitoring and ensure agencies\u2019 compliance with the  requirement to include names, TINs, and payment types on certified  vouchers. This is in line with our recommendation, and we commend FMS  for its willingness to increase efforts to enforce the requirements. As the  State Department\u2019s prompt response to our findings indicates, when  weaknesses are identified, such as records without payee names, agencies  can take corrective actions, thereby making it unnecessary to withhold  payments. However, FMS has had many years to require agencies to  improve the data in their payment records but has, until now, not done so.  As we point out in the report, in 1997 FMS proposed a rule that would  require disbursing officials to reject agency payment requests that do not  contain TINs (that is, withhold the payment), yet later rescinded the  proposed rule and instead required agencies to submit to FMS  implementation plans to achieve compliance with the TIN requirement.  Although FMS requested the implementation plans in 1997, it has not been  successful in gaining agency compliance. We believe that if FMS had been  more proactive, the intervening years since 1997 would have provided FMS  and the agencies ample opportunities to take corrective action. As such, we  continue to believe FMS needs to take stronger leadership in enforcing the  requirements with respect to the completeness and accuracy of  information in agency-submitted payment files.", "In its response, FMS accurately summarizes some of the challenges that we  described in the draft report regarding levying government purchase card  payments. These challenges are precisely why we recommended that FMS  work with IRS and arrive at a solution to subjecting to potential levy or  other form of collection the roughly $10 billion in annual purchase card  payments made to civilian agency contractors. However, FMS suggested  that we instead redirect the recommendation to have GSA work with IRS.  In addition, FMS pointed out that the FCTC could also provide valuable  assistance in determining the most efficient and effective means of  addressing contractors that have unpaid taxes and are being paid via  government purchase cards. While we agree that GSA could assist FMS  and IRS with this challenge, at the same time, we believe that as the  government\u2019s central debt collector, FMS should assume a leadership role  in emerging issues such as the rise in purchase card payments, as it has  significant implications with respect to its debt collection responsibilities.  In our opinion, FMS is the only federal entity with the ability to identify  which contractors that are receiving federal payments have leviable tax  debt. This is a role FMS plays when it compares the TIN and the name on  FMS payments to the list of contractors with unpaid taxes to determine  whether the payment should be levied. If FMS worked with the five banks  that currently issue government purchase cards to routinely obtain  electronic files listing the contractors being paid with purchase cards,  FMS could determine which government contractors that are paid with a  government purchase card have unpaid taxes. Consequently, we continue  to believe that FMS, in conjunction with IRS, would be in the best position  to monitor purchase card payments and assess the extent to which  contractors paid with purchase cards have unpaid federal taxes, and then  to identify solutions to the challenges presented by purchase card  payments.", "Finally, in its response, FMS stated that the numbers and potential levy  collection amounts presented in the report are confusing and potentially  misleading. Specifically, FMS stated that our reporting of the levy  collection gap of $350 million was misleading as it suggested that FMS  would be able to collect that amount through the levy program. In our  report, we have taken care to clearly note that the levy collection gap is an  indicator of the amount of tax debt civilian contractors owe that could be  levied from the payments they get from the federal government if all  payments for which we have information could be levied against all  outstanding federal tax debt. We further note throughout the report that  because some tax debts are excluded due to specific statutory  requirements, IRS and FMS are presently restricted by law from collecting  a significant portion of this estimated amount. We do, however, clearly  identify that a portion of the levy collection gap\u2014at least $50 million\u2014that  is directly attributable to weaknesses in internal controls and lack of  proactive management at FMS. This amount is understated due to the  unavailability of Fedwire information at FMS and because we were unable  to estimate collections against many payments that did not contain valid  TINs and payment types. FMS\u2019s response does not recognize that although  IRS has a key responsibility to refer tax debts, FMS has an equally key  responsibility\u2014to make all payments available for levy.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you announce the contents of this  report earlier, we will not distribute it until 30 days after its date.

To identify taxes owed, we obtained IRS\u2019s unpaid  assessment database as of September 30, 2004. To identify disbursements  FMS made to contractors, we obtained from FMS extracts of the Payments,  Claims, and Enhanced Reconciliation (PACER) database containing data  on payments FMS made to contractors via Automated Clearing House  (ACH) and by check during fiscal year 2004. PACER contains information  such as payee and payment amount for disbursements FMS makes on  behalf of federal agencies. To determine the amount of levies that have  been collected and the amount of tax debt that has been referred to the  Treasury Offset Program (TOP), we obtained from FMS the TOP database  as of September 30, 2004. As discussed later in this appendix, we first  performed work to assess the reliability of the data provided.", "To determine the value of unpaid taxes owed by contractors, we matched  PACER disbursements coded as \u201cvendor\u201d to the IRS unpaid assessment  database using the tax identification number (TIN) field in both databases.  This match resulted in the identification of about 63,000 contractors with  more than $5.4 billion in unpaid federal taxes. To avoid overestimating the  amount owed by contractors with unpaid tax debts and to capture only  significant tax debts, we excluded from our analysis tax debts and  payments meeting specific criteria to establish a minimum threshold in the  amount of tax debt and in the amount of payments to be considered when  determining whether a tax debt is significant. The criteria we used to  exclude tax debts and payments are as follows:  tax debts that IRS classified as compliance assessments or memo  accounts for financial reporting,  tax debts from calendar year 2004 tax periods,  contractors with total unpaid taxes of $100 or less, and  contractors with cumulative fiscal year 2004 payments of $100 or less.", "The criteria above were used to exclude tax debts that might be under  dispute or generally duplicative or invalid, tax debts that are recently  incurred, and tax debts and payments that are insignificant for the Federal  Payment Levy Program (FPLP). Specifically, compliance assessments or  memo accounts were excluded because these taxes have neither been  agreed to by the taxpayers nor affirmed by the court, or these taxes could  be invalid or duplicative of other taxes already reported. We excluded  calendar year 2004 tax debts to eliminate tax debt that may involve matters  that are routinely resolved between the taxpayer and IRS, with the taxes  paid or abated within a short period. We further excluded tax debts and  cumulative fiscal year 2004 payments of $100 or less because they are  insignificant for the purpose of calculating potential levy collection. Using  the above criteria, we identified about 33,000 contractors with over  $3.3 billion in unpaid taxes as of September 30, 2004.", "To determine the potential fiscal year 2004 levy collections, we used  15 percent of the payment or total tax debt amount, whichever is less. Our  analysis was performed as if (1) all unpaid federal taxes were referred to  FMS for inclusion in the TOP database and (2) all fiscal year 2004  disbursements for which FMS maintained detailed information were  included in TOP for potential levy. Because some tax debts are excluded  from the FPLP due to statutory exclusions, a gap will continue to exist  between what could be collected and the maximum levy amount  calculated. However, as discussed in the body of the report, the potential  levy collection amount of $350 million may be understated because we  excluded, by design, specific tax debts and payment amounts from the  calculation of levy, and missing data in FMS\u2019s disbursement information  prevented us from providing the full magnitude of tax debts and potential  levy collection. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 provided for a  100 percent levy on vendor payments for goods or services sold or leased  to the federal government, effective October 2004. If unpaid tax debts and  payments to contractors in future years remain consistent with fiscal year  2004 patterns, we determined a potential future levy amount based on a  levy ratio of 100 percent of payments or total tax debt amount, whichever is  less.", "To determine the effect of IRS and FMS policies and procedures on the  amounts actually collected through the FPLP, we conducted work at both  agencies related to their respective roles in the implementation of the  FPLP. At IRS, we interviewed agency officials and obtained documentation  that detailed the statutory requirements and policy and administrative  decisions that exclude certain tax debts from the FPLP. We did not evaluate  the accuracy and reasonableness of these exclusions, which will be  examined in detail in a later report. At FMS, we reviewed documentation  and interviewed agency officials to obtain an understanding of FMS\u2019s FPLP  policies, implementing guidance, operating procedures, and internal  controls related to the TOP and disbursement operations. We also visited  the San Francisco Regional Finance Center where we observed work flow  processes. We obtained a copy of the TOP database as of September 30,  2004. The TOP database contains all debt, including tax debt, referred to it  by federal agencies, including IRS. FMS uses the TOP database for levying  contractor payments. As discussed later, we performed work to assess the  reliability of data in TOP.", "To identify payments to contractors disbursed through the government  purchase card, we obtained from the Bank of America the database of  purchase card payments made by the National Aeronautics and Space  Administration (NASA). We reconciled control totals for this data with  Bank of America and the General Services Administration. We restricted  purchase card data to one agency to demonstrate the magnitude and effect  of issues surrounding levying purchase card payments.", "To identify indications of abuse or potential criminal activity, we selected  50 civilian contractors for a detailed audit and investigation. The 50  contractors were chosen using a nonprobability selection approach based  on our judgment, data mining, and a number of other criteria. Specifically,  we narrowed the 33,000 contractors with unpaid taxes based on the  amount of unpaid taxes, number of unpaid tax periods, amount of FMS  payments, indications that owner(s) might be involved in multiple  companies with tax debts, and representation of these contractors across  government. We specifically included contractors from NASA and the Departments of Homeland Security (Transportation Security  Administration), Justice, State, and Veterans Affairs. These agencies were  selected based on a number of criteria: national security concerns; amount  of payments to contractors, especially those with tax debts; amount of  payments made without TINs, names, or both; amount of levy collected;  and amount of payments made with blank pay types. The reliability of TINs  and contractor names, and whether the agencies\u2019 payment systems are  sufficiently integrated to maximize levy collection, will also be covered in  later work.", "We obtained copies of automated tax transcripts and other tax records  (e.g., revenue officer\u2019s notes) from IRS as of December 2004 and reviewed  these records to exclude contractors that had recently paid off their unpaid  tax balances and considered other factors before reducing the number of  businesses to 50 case studies. We performed additional searches of  criminal, financial, and public records. In cases where record searches and  IRS tax transcripts indicate that the owners or officers of a business are  involved in other related entities that have unpaid federal taxes, we  performed detailed audit and investigation on the related entities and the  owner(s) or officer(s), and not just the original business we identified. In  instances where related entities exist, we defined a case study to include all  the related entities, and reported on the combined unpaid taxes and  combined fiscal year 2004 payments for the original business and all the  related entities. We identified civilian agency contract awards using the  Federal Procurement Data System. Our investigators contacted some  contractors and performed interviews.", "In addition, while assessing the reliability of the data provided by FMS, we  identified nearly $17 billion in payments that contain either no TIN or an  obviously inaccurate TIN. To determine whether contractors with no TINs  or obviously inaccurate TINs had tax debts, we used investigative  techniques to identify some of those contractors\u2019 TINs and, through  comparison with the IRS records of unpaid taxes, we determined whether  those contractors owed tax debts.", "On May 9, 2005, we requested comments on a draft of comments on a draft  of this report from the Commissioner for Internal Revenue or his designee  and from the Commissioner of the Financial Management Service or his  designee. We received written comments from Commissioner of Internal  Revenue dated May 27, 2005, and from the Commissioner of the Financial  Management Service dated May 25, 2005, and reprinted those comments in  appendixes III and IV of this report.
