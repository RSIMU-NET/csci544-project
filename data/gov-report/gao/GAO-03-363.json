Under an administrative receivership, HUD appoints either a contractor or a HUD employee to take over the housing authority's management. Because receiverships generally involve the complete takeover of a housing authority's management and operations, HUD views receiverships as a last resort when other interventions such as technical assistance or sanctions have failed. HUD has made these decisions on a case-by-case basis. In four cases, decisions to appoint receivers were made by courts. These judicial receiverships stemmed from lawsuits filed against housing authorities because of poor living conditions in public housing. Administrative and judicial receiverships have operated similarly, and all of the receivers have had the same authority to make necessary changes. The specific corrective actions receivers have taken depended on the problems at the individual housing authority. Most receivers have found it necessary to oversee the complete reorganization of the housing authority's management and operations, develop and enforce policies and procedures, and improve physical conditions. In some cases, receivers have had to desegregate public housing to address fair housing violations. Whether under administrative or judicial receivers, nearly all of the 15 authorities showed improvement during their years of receivership. The four housing authorities under judicial receiverships generally have continued to demonstrate strong performance; for example, performance scores have improved and have generally remained high. While housing authorities under administrative receiverships have also made improvements, some still demonstrated a significant problem with housing units in very poor physical condition. According to HUD officials, HUD ends administrative receiverships when it is clear not only that conditions at the housing authority have improved but also that the authority's management can sustain the improvements. The decisions to end judicial receiverships are made by judges. To date, four administrative and two judicial receiverships have been terminated."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["About 3,000 public housing authorities\u2014state, county, and municipal  agencies\u2014develop and manage low-income housing in cooperation with  the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).

For  8 of the authorities, we obtained and analyzed HUD\u2019s performance scores  during the periods before and after receivers were appointed; these scores  were unavailable for the other 7 authorities because their receivership  predated HUD\u2019s scoring system or for other reasons. While we report  changes in HUD\u2019s scores for these authorities, the small number of  receiverships of each type preclude using the scores to statistically identify  possible distinctions between administrative and judicial receiverships.

Congress annually appropriates funds for the program and  HUD allocates them to public housing authorities (PHA). PHAs are  typically created under state law, and a locally appointed board of  commissioners approves their decisions. HUD and the PHAs have an  annual contributions contract\u2014a written contract under which HUD  agrees to make payments to the PHA and the PHA agrees to administer the  housing program in accordance with HUD regulations and requirements.  HUD provides the housing authorities with several types of assistance  including  operating subsidies to cover the difference between rent payments and   capital funds to improve the physical condition of properties and  upgrade the management and operation of existing public housing  developments; and   HOPE VI grants, on a competitive basis, to revitalize severely distressed  public housing. These grants fund the capital costs of improvements  such as major rehabilitation and new construction, the demolition of  severely distressed public housing, and community and support services  for residents.", "In fiscal year 2000, HUD began implementing the Public Housing  Assessment System (PHAS) to improve the department\u2019s ability to measure  PHAs\u2019 performance. From 1991 until 2001, HUD had used the Public  Housing Management Assessment Program (PHMAP) to evaluate public  housing authorities. Both systems measure the same basic elements, but  the earlier system is based on self-certified information from the housing  authorities and does not include an independent physical inspection or  input from the public housing residents\u2014both integral parts of the new  assessment system. The new system has three major indicators as follows:  The physical inspection indicator determines whether the housing  authority is providing decent, safe, and sanitary housing to its residents.", "The financial condition indicator determines whether the PHA has  sufficient financial resources and is capable of effectively managing  those resources.", "The management operations indicator measures PHAs\u2019 management  performance.", "Finally, a survey measures residents\u2019 satisfaction with their living  conditions. While this performance system has not yet been fully  implemented, we concluded in our March 2002 report that it has the  potential to provide a more reliable basis for evaluating housing  authorities\u2019 performance than the previous system.", "If a housing authority receives an overall score of less than 60 percent  under the Public Housing Assessment System, or a score of less than 60  percent of the available points under more than one of the three major  indicators (physical, financial, and managerial), it is designated as a  \u201ctroubled\u201d PHA. HUD assigns a recovery team to each troubled PHA and  develops a plan to remedy the problems. Initially, HUD may offer technical  assistance and training to a troubled authority. HUD may also sanction an  authority, for example, by withholding funding. In some cases, HUD has  entered into special agreements with PHAs that allow them flexibility in  addressing unusual challenges. For example, at the Chicago Housing  Authority, HUD waived some of its regulations for 10 years and allowed the  authority to consolidate its capital and operating funds into a single block  grant. The housing authority was thus able to undertake a large-scale  redevelopment project to replace or redevelop most of its public housing.", "Finally, HUD may place a housing authority under an administrative  receivership. The department has the authority to take possession of all or  part of the PHAs operation and management. Generally, the receiver  replaces the top management of the housing authority and dissolves the  board of commissioners\u2014the body that approves housing authority  management decisions. Typically, HUD will assign one of its employees or  hire a contractor to act as the board while the housing authority is under  receivership. HUD will then develop a plan for improvement based on what  needs to be done at the housing authority. Since 1985, HUD has placed 11  housing authorities under administrative receivership; these are listed in  table 1. Additionally, judges have placed 4 housing authorities under  judicial receivership since 1979; these are in table 2.", "The Quality Housing and Work Responsibility Act of 1998 requires that  HUD place poorly performing housing authorities under receivership if  they are not able to substantially improve their performance\u2014that is, to  improve their scores under the new assessment system to 60\u2014within 2  years.   The act directs HUD to take over all or part of the operations of  PHAs with fewer than 1,250 units or to seek a court-appointed receiver. For  PHAs with 1,250 or more units, HUD must seek a court-appointed receiver.  However, HUD is still making adjustments to the new scoring system and  has not fully implemented it. Thus, no PHAs have been placed in  receivership on the basis of their performance scores alone.", "The following tables show the status of housing authorities under  receivership as of December 2002. The tables show the primary problems  that prompted the housing authorities placement under receivers,  according to HUD and housing authority data.

HUD has placed housing authorities under  receivership after long-standing and severe problems that have not  responded to other HUD interventions, such as training or sanctions. HUD  has also taken over PHAs that were violating fair housing requirements by  maintaining segregated public housing developments, where the  segregation could not be addressed by other means.", "Management difficulties are typically the cause of persistent problems at  PHAs, according to HUD and housing authority officials. Managers may  lack experience or may refuse to comply with HUD\u2019s requirements. For  example, HUD determined that the St. James Parish Housing Authority in  Louisiana could not fulfill its mission because of ineffective management.  According to HUD officials, the public housing units at St. James were in  deplorable condition and were deteriorating \u201cat an alarming rate.\u201d   HUD  also cited high turnover rates among managers and insufficient training as  the reasons the Housing Authority of New Orleans was unable to manage  its maintenance and modernization programs. Eight of the 11  administrative receiverships involved PHAs that had problems with the  physical condition of their units. For example, the Camden Housing  Authority, the Housing Authority of New Orleans, the St. James Parish  Housing Authority, and the Wellston Housing Authority were not  completing routine maintenance on their public housing units before going  into receivership. At the Chicago Housing Authority, most of the public  housing had been poorly designed, was old, and was deteriorating.", "At three PHAs, HUD took control of the management and operations  primarily to address racial segregation in the public housing developments.  HUD placed the Beaumont, Lafayette, and Orange County Housing  Authorities under receivership in order to desegregate the public housing  developments. At the Beaumont and the Orange County housing  authorities, HUD is under court order (Young v. Martinez) to take actions  to facilitate desegregation. When the PHAs failed to desegregate the  developments, HUD decided to place both under receivership. HUD took  over the Lafayette Housing Authority because the management was  maintaining its public housing waiting lists based on race, ensuring that its  developments were segregated.", "In one case, HUD assumed control of a single program without placing the  entire housing authority in receivership. According to HUD officials, the  Puerto Rico Public Housing Administration lacked the capacity to manage  its HOPE VI program. HUD hired a contractor to help manage the projects  and provide technical assistance, but the housing authority was not  properly overseeing the program. A report issued by HUD\u2019s Inspector  General in March of 2001 reported a total breakdown of the housing  authority\u2019s ability to administer its HOPE VI project. According to the  report, the authority lacked effective management and accounting controls  over its federal funds and did not effectively monitor the activities of the  contracted project manager.

Besides the poor condition  of the occupied public housing units, the housing authorities had high  vacancy rates because units had been deemed uninhabitable. As a result,  those on waiting lists for public housing could not obtain housing, the  neighborhoods surrounding the empty units deteriorated, and crime near  the abandoned housing rose. According to HUD and PHA officials, poor  management, corruption, and local political interference were the  underlying causes of the problems at these housing authorities.", "When residents in Kansas City, Missouri, filed suit against the housing  authority, the judge ordered the PHA to rehabilitate or repair all housing  developments in poor condition. When it failed to comply with the order,  the judge ordered the PHA into receivership and named a receiver to  oversee the redevelopment of public housing in the city. In Boston,  according to a PHA official and the former receiver, the housing authority  had lost control of its public housing developments before it went into  receivership. Criminals controlled the developments, the PHA had stopped  trying to maintain occupied units, and it failed to board up vacant units.  Finally, residents filed suit, and the judge ordered the receivership. At the  Chester Housing Authority, the judge made the decision to place the PHA in  receivership after touring the developments and witnessing the poor living  conditions and the drug dealing that went on in front of them, according to  the attorney for the case.
