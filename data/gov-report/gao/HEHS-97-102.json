The DI program, authorized in 1956 under title II of the Social Security Act, provides monthly cash insurance benefits to insured, severely disabled workers. The SSI program, authorized in 1972 under title XVI, provides monthly cash payments to aged, blind, or disabled people whose income and resources fall below a certain threshold. About 2.5 million people apply to the Social Security Administration (SSA) each year for disability benefits.", "Between 1985 and 1995, the number of DI beneficiaries increased about 53 percent to about 5.0 million, and the number of working-age SSI recipients increased 81 percent to 2.4 million. In 1995, SSA distributed about $61 billion to these and other disability beneficiaries and spent $3 billion on program administration, which accounted for more than half of SSA\u2019s total administrative expenses.", "Both the DI and SSI programs are administered by SSA and state disability determination services (DDS), which determine benefit eligibility. DDSs award benefits to about 35 percent of applicants. Denied applicants may appeal to an administrative law judge (ALJ) in SSA\u2019s Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA). About a third of all applicants found not disabled by DDSs appeal to an ALJ, and almost two-thirds of claimants who appeal to an ALJ are subsequently found disabled.", "Cases appealed to ALJs add considerably to SSA\u2019s administrative expense and increase the time claimants must wait for a decision. The average initial DDS decision in DI cases costs about $540, while a hearing can cost an additional $1,200. In addition, appeals can add an average of 378 days to the length of time that an applicant must wait for a final decision. Moreover, because ALJs award a high percentage of appealed cases that have already been denied twice by the DDS, the integrity of the process is called into question."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Claimants May Pursue Several Levels of Appeal", "paragraphs": ["Claimants apply for DI and SSI disability benefits in SSA field offices, which forward these applications, along with any supporting medical evidence, to the appropriate state DDS. A DDS adjudication team, consisting of a disability examiner and a medical or psychological consultant, makes the initial decision on each claim. If the DDS denies a claim, the claimant may ask for reconsideration. For the reconsideration review, a new team of DDS adjudicators makes an independent decision on the basis of its own evaluation of all the evidence, including any new evidence the claimant might submit.", "If, after reconsideration, a DDS denies benefits, the claimant may pursue several levels of appeal (see table 1.1) and may introduce new evidence at almost every level. First, the claimant has the right to request a hearing before an ALJ. Before the hearing, the ALJ may obtain further medical evidence, for example, from the claimant\u2019s own physician or by hiring a consultative physician to examine the claimant. The hearing before the ALJ is the first time that a claimant has an opportunity for a face-to-face meeting with an adjudicator. SSA hearings are informal and nonadversarial; SSA does not challenge a claimant\u2019s case.", "The claimant and witnesses\u2014who may include medical or vocational experts\u2014testify at the hearing. The ALJ asks about the issues, receives relevant documents into evidence, and allows the claimant or the claimant\u2019s representative to present arguments and examine witnesses. If necessary, the ALJ may further update the evidence after the hearing. When this is completed, the ALJ assesses the effects of the claimant\u2019s medical impairment on capacity to function at work. The ALJ then issues a decision based on his or her assessment of the evidence in the case and is generally authorized to do so without seeking input from a medical professional.", "If an ALJ denies an appealed claim, the claimant may request that SSA\u2019s Appeals Council review the case. The Appeals Council may deny or dismiss the request, or it may grant the request and either remand the case to the ALJ for further action or issue a new decision. The Appeals Council\u2019s decision, or the decision of the ALJ if the Appeals Council denies or dismisses the request for review, becomes SSA\u2019s final decision.

For example, ALJ pay is determined by the Office of Personnel Management independently of SSA recommendations or ratings, and ALJs are not subject to statutory performance appraisal requirements. Such safeguards help ensure that ALJ judgments are independent and that ALJs would not be paid, promoted, or discharged arbitrarily or for political reasons by an agency.", "ALJs operate under rules that differ from those of appellate courts.

Our review of over 40 internal and external studies of the disability determination and appeals process, several of which were completed more than 20 years ago, led us to this conclusion. In the early 1990s, as part of its efforts to develop a number of strategic priority goals, SSA reviewed many of the same studies and identified inconsistent decisions as a critical issue affecting SSA\u2019s ability to improve its service to the public.", "Inconsistent decisions have been evident in program data for many years. For example, since 1986, DDS award rates have ranged from 31 to 43 percent, whereas ALJ award rates have ranged from 60 to 75 percent.

Although many hypotheses for inconsistent decisions have been discussed, explanations for the high rate of ALJ awards have been inadequate or unavailable. In early 1979, congressional hearings focused on high ALJ award rates, and, in 1980, the Congress passed legislation aimed at promoting greater consistency and accuracy of ALJ decision-making. This legislation required SSA to establish a system of reviewing ALJ decisions to ensure that they comply with laws, regulations, and SSA rulings. In January 1982, SSA submitted to the Congress the results of a study on progress made in reviewing ALJ decisions, including the possible causes for ALJ reversals.", "Soon after SSA started to perform the quality reviews required by legislation, the Association of ALJs filed suit in federal court. The lawsuit challenged SSA\u2019s plans to target these reviews to judges with high award rates on the grounds that such reviews threatened ALJs\u2019 decision-making independence. The court never ruled on this issue because SSA decided to rescind targeted reviews. ALJ award rates fell temporarily from 62 percent in 1981 to 55 percent in 1983 when SSA was performing its targeted reviews, although other factors could explain the decline. When targeted reviews ended in 1984, however, ALJ award rates started to increase again and have remained at high levels ever since."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Decision-making Process Yields Much Inconsistency Between DDSs and ALJs", "paragraphs": ["Not only do award rates between DDSs and ALJs differ, but the rates also differ by impairment type and other factors.

This study analyzed the reasons for high ALJ award rates. SSA has issued two reports based on this study, which is ongoing.", "Realizing that the inconsistency between DDS and ALJ decisions and the length and complexity of the decision-making process compromised the integrity of disability determinations, SSA began redesigning the process in 1993.

To direct the redesign effort, SSA created a management team assisted by top SSA management, various task teams, and state and federal employees involved with disability determinations.", "To address inconsistent decisions as a part of redesign, the agency established a process unification task team. This team included a diverse group of 29 SSA and DDS employees who, in addition to their own expertise, sought information from other sources and reviewed data from SSA\u2019s DHQRP study of the appeals process. In November 1995, the task team issued its final report.

For example, the Social Security Independence and Program Improvements Act of 1994 and the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 require hundreds of thousands more continuing disability reviews (CDR) to ensure that beneficiaries are still eligible for benefits. By law, SSA must conduct CDRs for at least 100,000 more SSI beneficiaries annually through fiscal year 1998. In 1996, the Congress increased CDR requirements for children on SSI, requiring CDRs at least every 3 years for children under age 18 who are likely to improve and for all low birth weight babies in the first year of life. In addition, SSA is required to redetermine, using criteria for adults, the eligibility of all 18-year-olds on SSI beginning on their 18th birthdays and to readjudicate 332,000 childhood disability cases by August 1997.

Such determinations may involve not only residual functional capacity (RFC) assessments, but consideration of these assessments along with the claimant\u2019s age, education, and skill levels.", "To reduce the amount of judgment involved, SSA has developed medical- vocational rules. In general, the older, less educated, and less skilled the claimant, the more likely these rules will direct the adjudicator to award benefits. For claimants with functional and vocational profiles that do not fit the rules, however, adjudicator decision-making is less prescribed.

At step 2, adjudicators further screen applicants by assessing whether they have a severe impairment, defined by the regulations as an impairment that has more than a minimal effect on the applicant\u2019s ability to perform basic work tasks. For those whose impairments have more than a minimal effect on ability to work, adjudicators then begin determining whether the applicant\u2019s impairments are severe enough to qualify for disability benefits."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Does the Applicant Qualify Under SSA\u2019s Listing of Impairments?", "paragraphs": ["In step 3 of the sequential evaluation process, adjudicators compare the applicant\u2019s medical condition with medical criteria found in SSA\u2019s Listing of Impairments\u2014referred to as \u201cthe medical listings\u201d\u2014which are published in SSA\u2019s regulations. The listings delineate over 150 categories of medical conditions (physical and mental) that, according to SSA, are presumed to be severe enough to ordinarily prevent an individual from engaging in any gainful activity. For example, corrected vision of 20/200 or less, amputation of both hands, or an intelligence quotient of 59 or less would ordinarily qualify an individual for benefits.", "An applicant may automatically qualify for benefits if the adjudicator concludes that the laboratory findings, medical signs, and symptoms of one of the applicant\u2019s impairments meet the specific criteria for medical severity cited in the listings for that impairment and the applicant is not engaging in substantial gainful activity. If an applicant\u2019s medical condition does not meet the listed criteria or if the impairment is not listed, then the adjudicator must determine whether the applicant\u2019s impairment is the medical equivalent of one in the listings.", "The medical severity criteria for listed mental impairments are generally more subjective than those for physical impairments. For most mental impairments in the listings, many of the severity criteria are defined by functional limitations. Determining whether a mental impairment meets or equals the listed criteria often requires subjective evaluations about (1) restrictions of daily activities; (2) difficulties in maintaining social functioning; (3) deficiencies in concentration, persistence, or pace that result in failure to complete tasks in a timely manner; and (4) episodes of deterioration in work settings that cause the individual to withdraw or have exacerbated signs and symptoms. For example, adjudicators must decide whether the impairment has any impact at all on activities of daily living or on social functioning, and, if so, rate the impact as slight, moderate, marked, or extreme.", "By contrast, the listed criteria for physical impairments generally are more objective, relating to medical diagnosis and prognosis, rather than the assessment of functional limitations in the mental listings. Determining whether the medical findings for a physical impairment meet or equal these criteria is a matter of documentation and is often more a question of medical fact than opinion. In some instances, however, the criteria for physical impairments also require that adjudicators assess functional limitations. For example, for applicants with human immunodeficiency virus, adjudicators assess their symptoms or signs, such as fatigue, fever, malaise, weight loss, pain, and night sweats as well as their subsequent effect on activities of daily living and social functioning. For musculoskeletal and other impairments, adjudicators assess the importance of pain in causing functional loss when it is associated with relevant abnormal signs and laboratory findings.

In considering medical evidence, adjudicators must evaluate medical source opinions and judge the weight to be given to each opinion. Adjudicators also often evaluate issues involving pain or other symptoms and judge whether the applicant\u2019s impairment could reasonably be expected to produce the applicant\u2019s symptoms.", "Assessing physical RFC requires adjudicators to judge individuals\u2019 ability to physically exert themselves in activities such as sitting, standing, walking, lifting, carrying, pushing, and pulling. Adjudicators also assess the effect of the individual\u2019s physical impairment on manipulative or postural functions such as reaching, handling, stooping, or crouching. Assessing mental RFC requires adjudicators to judge the individual\u2019s functional abilities such as understanding, remembering, carrying out instructions, and responding appropriately to supervision, coworkers, and work pressures.", "After assessing an applicant\u2019s RFC, the adjudicator compares it with the demands of the applicant\u2019s prior work.

For this evaluation, SSA places a claimant into one of five categories of physical exertion\u2014sedentary, light, medium, heavy, and very heavy\u2014with sedentary work requiring the least physical exertion of the five levels (see table 2.2). On the basis of an applicant\u2019s RFC, adjudicators must judge which of the five exertional categories is the most physically demanding work the individual can perform. For an applicant whose maximum physical ability matches one of the five exertional categories of work, SSA provides medical-vocational rules that direct the adjudicator\u2019s decision on the basis of the claimant\u2019s age, education, and skill levels of prior work experience.", "Table 2.3 shows how the medical-vocational rules direct decisions for people aged 50 or older who are limited to sedentary work.", "In general, the older a person is, the more likely SSA\u2019s medical-vocational rules direct adjudicators to award benefits. For example, under the rules for those whose maximum physical capacity limits them to performing sedentary work, applicants aged 50 or older qualify for benefits under four of the scenarios shown in table 2.3. Those aged 45 through 49, however, qualify under only one scenario; applicants aged 18 through 44 qualify under no scenario (see table 2.4).", "Although SSA\u2019s medical-vocational rules reduce the degree of judgment that adjudicators must use in many cases, SSA has no rules to direct adjudicators\u2019 decisions for other cases. These include cases in which (1) the applicant\u2019s maximum strength capability does not match any of the five exertional levels or (2) the applicant\u2019s primary limitations are nonexertional (or unrelated to the physical strength demands required for sitting, standing, walking, lifting, carrying, pushing, and pulling). In such cases, the medical-vocational rules can provide a guide for evaluating an applicant\u2019s ability to do other work, but the regulations instruct adjudicators to base their decisions on the principles in the appropriate sections of the regulations, giving consideration to the medical-vocational rules for specific case situations. For example, an applicant may be restricted to unskilled sedentary jobs because of a severe cardiovascular impairment. If a permanent injury of the right hand also limits the applicant to only those sedentary jobs that do not require bilateral manual dexterity, then the applicant\u2019s work capacity is limited to less than the full range of sedentary work. The ability to do less than the full range of sedentary work is not one of the five exertional levels defined in SSA\u2019s regulations; therefore, no medical-vocational rules would direct the adjudicator\u2019s decision.", "On the basis of Department of Labor data, SSA estimates that approximately 200 unskilled occupations exist, each representing many jobs that can be performed by people whose limitations restrict them to the full range of sedentary work. But, if an applicant is limited to less than the full range of sedentary work, the adjudicator must determine the extent to which the exertional and nonexertional limitations reduce the occupational base of jobs, considering the applicant\u2019s age, education, and work experience, including any transferable skills or education providing for direct entry into skilled work. The mere inability to perform all sedentary unskilled jobs is not sufficient basis for a finding of disability.

In addition, adjudicators may develop new medical evidence obtained from consulting sources. Medical evidence includes (1) medical history; (2) clinical findings, such as the results of physical or mental status examinations; (3) laboratory findings, such as blood pressure and X rays; (4) statement of the diagnosis of the disease or injury based on its signs and symptoms; and (5) treatment prescribed and prognosis. Medical evidence also includes statements from treating physicians or other medical sources describing work-related activities, such as sitting, standing, walking, and lifting, that the applicant can still do despite his or her impairments. In the case of mental impairments, statements should describe the applicant\u2019s ability to understand, carry out, and remember instructions and respond appropriately to supervision, coworkers, and work pressures. In making a decision, an adjudicator must assess how much weight to give to each medical source\u2019s statement of opinion. Table 2.5 describes the factors to be considered in weighing opinions.", "Adjudicators also must evaluate whether an applicant\u2019s impairment could reasonably be expected to produce the reported symptoms\u2014such as pain, fatigue, shortness of breath, weakness, and nervousness.

Instead, if reviewers return a case to a DDS because of other types of errors, such as inadequate evidence to support the decision, the returned case would include comments on inadequate RFC explanations by DDS medical consultants, according to SSA officials. Otherwise, the only way that reviewers might provide feedback on inadequate RFC explanations is during periodic visits to DDSs. Consequently, SSA lacks a routine, systematic mechanism for giving DDSs timely information on the adequacy of their RFC explanations.", "Likewise, Appeals Council reviews have not emphasized ALJs\u2019 consideration of DDS medical consultants\u2019 opinions. First, the Appeals Council samples few ALJ awards for review. Such reviews could identify differences between the DDS medical consultant\u2019s opinion and the ALJ view. Second, even if the Appeals Council might want to consider the views of DDS medical consultants, the lack of explanation gives the Council little to review.", "In addition, SSA\u2019s quality reviews of DDSs\u2019 performance accuracy do not focus on weaknesses in DDS evidence gathering from the standpoint of whether the evidence could later contribute to ALJ reversals. Instead, reviewers of DDS decisions focus on whether the evidence in the file supports the DDS\u2019s own decision. They do not consider whether gaps in evidence may become significant in a later appeal. For example, if the file indicates that the claimant has a treating physician, but the treating physician\u2019s report is missing from the file, quality reviewers do not automatically cite this as a performance accuracy error. Instead, they determine whether the totality of evidence in the file supports the DDS\u2019s decision. If the decision is supported adequately\u2014despite the missing evidence\u2014the reviewers do not charge the DDS with a performance accuracy error, though this lack of evidence could become significant at the ALJ level. Although the DDS decision may be technically accurate, it may also be vulnerable to reversal on appeal, a factor that the current quality assurance system does not consider in assessing the overall quality of DDS decisions.", "In keeping with procedures, DDS reviewers also determine whether the DDS has made a reasonable effort to obtain the evidence. In assessing the reasonableness of the effort, however, the DDS reviewers again do not focus on the potential impact of the missing information if the case were to be appealed. Such a focus would be necessary for both identifying and reconciling differences in decisions."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "SSA Has Plans to Improve Quality Reviews", "paragraphs": ["SSA has taken or planned several actions to reduce decisional inconsistency, including addressing factors that we identified as important contributors to the inconsistency. First, the agency has started to systematically gather information on this subject. In 1992, SSA established the Disability Hearings and Quality Review Process (DHQRP), which collects data on ALJ decisions and on the DDS reconsideration denial decisions that preceded them. DHQRP provides a data-driven foundation to identify inconsistency issues and focus on strategies for resolution. According to quality reviewers, SSA has continued this process and anticipates issuing more reports in the future.", "In addition, SSA is completing work on a notice of proposed rulemaking, with a target issue date of August 1997 for a final regulation to establish the basis for reviewing ALJ awards, which would require ALJs to take corrective action on remand orders from the Appeals Council before benefits are paid. As envisioned, disability examiners and physician consultants as well as reviewing judges will review ALJ awards. In November 1996, SSA began an initial start-up period for this effort and after the regulation is issued plans to target about 10,000 cases for review during the first year.", "Unlike existing quality reviews, the new process aims to identify and reconcile factors that contribute to differences between DDS and ALJ decisions. When the reviewers find ALJ awards they believe are unsupported, they send these cases to the Appeals Council. If the Appeals Council disagrees with the conclusions of the quality reviewers, the case is referred to a panel of SSA disability adjudicators from various SSA units. This review process can reveal significant policy issues because the panel will receive cases in which the reviewing Appeals Council judge disagrees with the reviewing examiner and medical consultant. On the basis of issues identified, SSA could issue new or clarified policies or provide adjudicators with additional training. In addition, SSA\u2019s process unification effort calls for returning certain cases to the DDS when new evidence is provided at the hearing level.", "In the longer term, SSA envisions instituting a new quality review system that will systematically review decision-making at all levels. One focus of the new system is making the right decision the first time. SSA estimates this new system will help reduce the percentage of awards made by ALJs, while increasing the percentage made by DDSs. Under SSA\u2019s model, when this redesign is fully implemented, the percentage of all awards made by ALJs would decline from around 29 to 17 percent, and the percentage made by DDSs would increase from 71 to 83 percent. The agency has not explicitly established this as a goal, however."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions, Recommendations, Agency Comments, and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Inconsistent decisions between DDSs and ALJs are a long-standing problem for SSA management with implications for the fairness, integrity, and costs of both the decision-making process and the program overall. The award rate of appeals raises questions about the fairness of the process because many claimants are awarded benefits only after a lengthy appeal. Moreover, persistent inconsistencies between the two levels can undermine confidence in the integrity of the decision-making process. Furthermore, the later the case is finally decided in the appeals process, the more expensive it is to adjudicate.", "SSA can make more progress than it has in the past by unifying the decision-making process at both the DDS and ALJ levels. Meanwhile, reducing inconsistent decisions will be limited to some extent by factors inherent in the program. Disability decisions are inherently complex and require adjudicators to exercise judgment on a range of issues. As a result, expectations about the level of agreement possible in such a program should acknowledge this reality. Moreover, the process involves large numbers of decisionmakers with more than 15,000 adjudicators, quality reviewers, and others, including over 1,000 ALJs, making these complex decisions nationwide.", "SSA has developed process unification initiatives that, if implemented, could significantly improve the consistency of decisions. Competing workloads at all levels of adjudication, however, could jeopardize progress in this important area. SSA should capitalize on the momentum it has recently gained and give consistency of decisions the sustained attention it requires as an essential part of redesign. For example, the agency has ongoing data gathering and review mechanisms in place that could produce real progress in this area. SSA has not established explicit outcome-oriented goals or measures, however, to assess its progress in achieving consistent decisions. We believe the strategic planning process required under the Government Performance and Results Act can be a useful vehicle to help focus management attention on the results SSA hopes to achieve through process unification and to monitor its progress toward reaching these results. In this context, SSA needs to establish performance goals to measure its progress in shifting the proportion of cases awarded from the ALJ to the DDS level. SSA could then monitor its progress and make corrections if its actions do not achieve the desired results. Using quantifiable performance goals to measure results would place a high priority on this issue and bolster public confidence in SSA\u2019s commitment to achieve more consistency in DDS and ALJ decision-making.", "Under process unification, SSA plans to ensure that the DDS decisions are better explained and thus more useful to ALJs. Workload pressures at the DDSs, however, may make full and thoughtful explanations of their decisions difficult. SSA will need to consider ways to reduce these pressures if the agency\u2019s plans are to be effective. At the ALJ level, SSA\u2019s plans to return cases to the DDSs are important, given the significance of new evidence as a possible reason for awards. SSA\u2019s decision to limit such returns to about 20 percent of cases, however, could reduce the effectiveness of this initiative.", "In addition, SSA plans to improve its quality reviews but could move more quickly to implement these plans. Historically, SSA has never had a unified system of quality reviews, despite studies documenting inconsistent decisions. Specifically, in 1982, the Bellmon Report identified problems in the consistency of less-than-sedentary residual functional capacity (RFC) assessments, and the Disability Hearings Quality Review Process (DHQRP) reinforced this finding in 1994. However, SSA has not effectively used its quality reviews to focus on this problem or taken action to resolve it. Similarly, DHQRP identified problems with DDS rationales, but no systematic feedback has been provided on this issue. The DHQRP results give SSA an adequate foundation and an ongoing review mechanism to begin unifying quality reviews between the DDSs and ALJs without further delay. SSA could, for example, use the DHQRP findings on less-than-sedentary awards to sharpen and focus current Appeals Council reviews. The agency could also focus on the adequacy of DDS decision explanations in its unified quality review program.", "We are also concerned that, without adequate planning and evaluation, some redesign initiatives could have unintended consequences. For example, under redesign, SSA intends to develop new, more valid, and reliable functional assessment/evaluation instruments that are relevant to today\u2019s work environment. The agency intends to rely heavily on these instruments in decision-making. But, because differences in RFC assessments are the main reason for ALJ awards, SSA should proceed cautiously. As such, it should test any new decision methods to determine their effects on consistency as well as on award rates before widespread implementation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["SSA is beginning to implement initiatives to reduce inconsistent decisions between DDSs and ALJs, realizing that the lengthy and complicated decision-making process and inconsistent decisions between adjudicative levels compromise the integrity of disability determinations. We support these initiatives and recommend that SSA take immediate steps and be accountable for ensuring that they are implemented as quickly as feasible. For example, using available quality assurance systems, SSA should move quickly ahead to improve feedback to adjudicators at all levels. In addition, to better ensure that adjudicators review the same record, the agency should increase the number of cases it plans to return to DDSs when new evidence is submitted on appeal.", "In addition, we recommend that, given the magnitude and seriousness of the problem, the Commissioner should, under the Results Act, articulate the process unification results that the agency hopes to achieve and establish a performance goal by which it could measure and report its progress in shifting the proportion of cases awarded from the ALJ to the DDS level."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "SSA\u2019s Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["SSA officials generally agreed with the conclusions and recommendations in this report and stated that the report would be useful to SSA in its efforts to reduce inconsistent decisions between DDSs and ALJs.

But SSA disagreed about taking steps to be accountable for attaining this goal. Agency officials believed that the natural outcome of SSA\u2019s process unification initiatives would effect an increase in DDS awards and a decrease in ALJ awards. Because process unification is the linchpin of the disability determination process, however, not just disability redesign, we continue to believe that SSA needs to establish a performance goal for achieving process unification and that the Results Act is the appropriate mechanism to do this.", "SSA took exception to our remarks suggesting that its proposal for a new decision methodology could exacerbate inconsistent decisions. We do not agree. Under redesign, SSA plans to reduce medical determinations to a relatively small number of claims, while expanding the functional component of the decision-making process. Because it is unlikely that the new decision methodology will eliminate all adjudicator judgment needed in making functional determinations, we continue to believe that SSA should proceed cautiously and test any new decision methods to determine their effects on consistency as well as award rates. In its comments, SSA stated that it is committed to using research results to dictate which, if any, changes will be made in the decision methodology. We support this commitment.", "The full text of SSA\u2019s comments and our response appear in appendix III.
