The President delegated authority to review foreign investment transactions to an interagency group, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS).", "As requested, we examined CFIUS implementation of the Exon-Florio legislation and related amendments. Specifically, we focused on (1) the characteristics of foreign investments and the extent to which these investments are reported to CFIUS and (2) the factors CFIUS considers in making decisions on whether the foreign investment would result in foreign companies\u2019 control of U.S. companies, whether the acquiring company is controlled by a foreign government, and whether there are associated national security risks.

Previous products on this subject are listed on the last page of the report."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Preserving U.S. industrial capabilities in sectors critical to national security has been a traditional U.S. policy goal. An important concern in the debate on foreign investment in the United States is the possibility that key segments of industries critical to the national security could come under foreign control through foreign investments. Because U.S. defense strategy relies on the deterrent effects of technological rather than numerical superiority, concern about foreign investment focuses on the U.S. government\u2019s ability to identify technologies crucial to defense systems and to act to preserve and promote U.S. leadership in them.", "The United States does not screen inward investment but relies on certain laws or regulations to ensure that foreign investment does not assume forms harmful to the nation\u2019s interests. For example, specific restrictions are in place to protect classified defense information from foreign access and to ensure U.S. production of vital defense goods in the event of a crisis. Foreign investments in U.S. firms performing classified defense work are monitored under the National Industrial Security Program. Restrictions under this program provide authority to restrict or deny foreign access to classified information. Although they do not authorize denials of foreign investments, they can, in effect, deter potential investors who are seeking access to classified information. The U.S. government, in addition, restricts foreign investment in certain sectors, such as energy resources, coastal and domestic shipping, and air transport.", "To counter the loss of leading-edge or highly advanced technology and processes that are important to the country\u2019s security through the acquisition of U.S. companies by foreign investors, Congress passed the Exon-Florio legislation in 1988. Congress was concerned that foreign takeovers of U.S. firms that harmed U.S. security could not be stopped unless the President declared a national emergency or regulators invoked Federal antitrust, environmental, or securities laws. The Exon-Florio legislation grants the President the authority to take appropriate action to suspend or prohibit foreign acquisitions, mergers, or takeovers of U.S. businesses that threaten to impair the national security. To exercise this authority, the President must find that (1) credible evidence exists that the foreign interest might take action that threatens to impair national security and (2) provisions of law, other than the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, do not provide adequate and appropriate authority to protect the national security. However, Congress did not intend for the legislation to raise obstacles to foreign investment.", "The President designated CFIUS as responsible for reviewing transactions. CFIUS is an existing Committee comprised of representatives from  11 agencies or offices. The Secretary of the Treasury chairs the Committee and the Departments of State, Commerce, and Defense are among the agencies represented. The Defense Technology Security Administration coordinates the positions of various Department of Defense (DOD) components and provides the final DOD position for CFIUS reviews.", "Notification to CFIUS of an acquisition is voluntary. However, it is in the interest of foreign investors to do so because CFIUS retains the right to review in the future any acquisition not notified to the Committee. The Exon-Florio regulations also permit a Committee member to submit a notice of a proposed or completed acquisition for a national security review.", "The CFIUS review process serves both to protect national security and to minimize any potential adverse effect of the Exon-Florio legislation on foreign investment in the United States. CFIUS determination that there are no national security issues essentially eliminates the risk that the President will at a later time block the transaction or order a divestiture.", "Once it is notified, CFIUS has an initial 30-day review period to determine if the transaction involves foreign control and whether there are national security concerns that warrant further investigation. If CFIUS decides that there will be foreign control and that potentially serious national security concerns are present, the Committee initiates a 45-day investigation. It then submits a report and recommendation to the President. The President has 15 days to decide whether or not to take appropriate action. The President may exercise the authority conferred by the Exon-Florio legislation, however, only if there is credible evidence that a foreign controlling interest might threaten national security and that other legislation cannot provide adequate protection.", "As shown in table 1, between October 1988 and December 1994, CFIUS received 918 voluntary notifications. Of these, 15 involved 45-day investigations with recommendations to the President. In 5 of the  15 investigations, the companies voluntarily withdrew their investment offers. Of the remaining 10 investigations, the President decided not to intervene in 9 transactions and ordered divestiture in 1 case involving a Chinese company\u2019s acquisition of a U.S. aircraft parts company.", "In 1992, Thomson-CSF, a French government-owned company, attempted to acquire the LTV Corporation\u2019s Missile Division, which prompted legislation aimed at strengthening Exon-Florio. One provision made a distinction between foreign control and foreign government control and mandated 45-day investigations when the acquiring company is controlled by or acting on behalf of a foreign government and the acquisition could result in foreign government control that could affect the national security. Another provision required intelligence agency assessments of the risk of diversion of a defense critical technology when the U.S. company is engaged in the development of such a technology or is otherwise important to the defense industrial and technology base."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Characteristics of Investments Reported and Not Reported to CFIUS", "paragraphs": ["Our analysis of data on CFIUS cases from October 1988 through May 1994 showed that about two-thirds of the filings involved high-technology industries in which there could be potential national security concerns.Among these industries are computers and semiconductors, electronics, aerospace, advanced materials, chemicals, biotechnology, and telecommunications. About one-third of the notifications to CFIUS involved industries in which national security concerns would be unlikely to arise. Examples of these industries include mining, plastics and rubber, construction, retailing, real estate, and entertainment. (App. III contains additional information on the industries with foreign investments that were reported to CFIUS.)", "Companies from Japan, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany accounted for over 65 percent of the notifications to CFIUS since 1988. Japanese companies were the leading investors notifying CFIUS, primarily on investments in computers and semiconductors. British companies were the second most active investors filing with CFIUS, most frequently on investments in advanced materials and electronics. French companies most frequently notified CFIUS of investments in aerospace, computers, and telecommunications companies, while German companies filed with CFIUS for investments in chemicals, industrial controls, equipment and machinery, and energy industries. Our comparison of CFIUS data with two private sector databases on foreign investments showed somewhat comparable investment concentrations by country and by industry. (Details on the four countries\u2019 CFIUS filings by industry are in app. IV.)", "The 1992 legislation required the President to report on various aspects of foreign investment in U.S. critical-technology companies. The National Economic Council formed a working group to respond to the requirement and reported its findings in 1994. The group found no credible evidence that a country or private companies had a coordinated strategy to acquire U.S. critical-technology companies. It also noted that the absence of credible evidence demonstrating a coordinated strategy should not be viewed as conclusive proof that a coordinated strategy does not exist. The report also indicated that foreign governments, including those of France, Germany, and Japan, provide indirect assistance and guidance to their companies regarding foreign investments in high-technology U.S. firms."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Investments Not Reported to CFIUS", "paragraphs": ["The Exon-Florio legislation and implementing regulations do not define which investments are important to review for national security reasons. Moreover, notification to CFIUS is voluntary. CFIUS officials believe that the Committee has been notified of most foreign investments in key or high-technology companies that could affect national security. CFIUS officials pointed out that investors have a strong inducement to notify CFIUS and seek its prior approval because the President retains the authority to order divestitures of transactions not cleared by CFIUS. However, we found that many foreign investments occur in high-technology or defense-related industries that were not reported to CFIUS. While the significance of the gap is unclear, it does suggest that the CFIUS process alone cannot be relied on to surface transactions posing potential national security concerns.", "Our comparison of two private databases on foreign investment in the United States with CFIUS data showed that many transactions occurred in high-technology industries that were not filed with CFIUS. Among these industries were telecommunications, advanced materials, biotechnology, electronics, computers, and aerospace. We verified selected transactions and determined that an acquisition of a U.S. aircraft parts manufacturer and investments in biotechnology and chemical companies occurred without being reported to CFIUS. However, these databases do not contain sufficient information to establish a link to national security, since they do not contain information on, for example, whether the acquired company had DOD contracts or produced products subject to U.S. export controls. (See app. I for an explanation of our comparison and app. II for details on transactions not notified to CFIUS, according to these private databases.) Furthermore, because Exon-Florio was never intended to be a comprehensive foreign investment review act, it is to be expected that there would be foreign investments that are not notified to CFIUS."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "CFIUS Decisions on Foreign Companies\u2019 Control and Foreign Governments\u2019 Control Over Acquiring Companies", "paragraphs": ["Under the Exon-Florio legislation, CFIUS has considerable flexibility to decide if a transaction results in foreign company control over a U.S. firm or if a foreign government has control over an acquiring company. The implementing regulations do not specify that a given percentage of foreign ownership automatically results in control because minority owners can exercise control under various conditions. For example, a minority owner might hold board membership and have special voting rights over certain company actions. For this reason, the regulations broadly define control to mean having the power to directly or indirectly effect key company decisions and actions. CFIUS generally relies on a company\u2019s stated intentions regarding the structure of the investment and the decision-making framework of the corporation. While decisions about foreign control are straightforward in complete acquisitions and majority investments, such decisions can be complicated and difficult in minority investment cases. Also, deciding foreign government control over the acquiring company can be difficult and involves a high degree of judgment."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Decisions on Foreign Control", "paragraphs": ["Of the 16 cases we reviewed, 12 involved majority investments or 100 percent acquisitions, and 4 involved minority investments. In two of the minority investment cases, CFIUS found foreign control and in two cases it determined there was no foreign control.", "A British company notified CFIUS of its intention to acquire 20 percent of a U.S. company. The U.S. company had classified contracts and provided a critical U.S. government emergency service. The acquisition would give the British company 3 of the 15 seats on the company\u2019s board of directors and certain \u201cconsent rights\u201d that would enable the British company to block several corporate actions. CFIUS found that foreign control would result on the basis of the British company\u2019s right to veto certain acquisitions, joint ventures, and asset sales as well as any company charter amendment adversely affecting the British company. CFIUS conducted a 30-day review. However, this review determined that national security concerns were not sufficient to warrant an investigation.", "A German company notified CFIUS of its intention to purchase 12.25 percent of the common stock of a U.S. company. The U.S. parent company controlled 51 percent of the stock, and three European companies controlled the remaining 49 percent. The proposed investment would redistribute the stock among the foreign owners, leaving the U.S. majority ownership intact. The U.S. company had classified DOD and other U.S. government contracts that were protected by facility security clearances. CFIUS determined that the purchase of 12.25 percent of the company\u2019s voting stock constituted foreign control because of several minority veto rights. These rights included the ability of any single foreign director to block decisions such as the adoption of a strategic plan or annual budget or the development of a new product that varies from the types of business stated in the strategic plan. CFIUS reviewed the company\u2019s notification for national security concerns and decided to proceed with a 45-day investigation. During the investigation, CFIUS addressed issues relating to DOD\u2019s ability to mitigate foreign control and influence over the company under the existing security agreement. As required, CFIUS prepared a report to the President. The transaction was not blocked.", "A Singaporean company proposed acquiring 22.8 percent of the voting stock in an investor group formed to acquire all of a U.S. company. A majority of the investor group\u2019s voting stock was held by U.S. entities. The Singaporean company was indirectly owned by a holding company that was 99.9 percent owned by the Singapore Ministry of Finance. The U.S. company had classified contracts with DOD, necessitating a security agreement protecting classified information and technologies. CFIUS based its finding that the foreign company would not have control partly on the minority investor\u2019s willingness to execute a proxy agreement under industrial security regulations that would give the minority investor\u2019s voting rights to two U.S citizens. (The minority foreign investor later entered into a security agreement that would allow the foreign investor to gain board membership.) In our discussions on this case, CFIUS officials agreed that a proposed security agreement should not be used to determine foreign control. The Exon-Florio control standards are not comparable to the control issues under the industrial security regulations, which intend to isolate foreign control and influence over certain aspects of the business, not to determine whether the entire company will become foreign controlled. Although CFIUS\u2019s letter to the company notifying it of its decision referenced the proxy agreement, CFIUS officials stated the finding of no foreign control was based on other factors, including a requirement for a two-thirds stockholder majority for certain decisions. Because CFIUS found no foreign control, it did not review the transaction for national security concerns.", "Two Israeli companies acquired a total of 35.6 percent of the outstanding stock of a U.S. company. One of the Israeli companies increased its ownership from 10.5 percent of the outstanding stock to 17.4 percent, while the second company acquired 18.2 percent of the outstanding stock. The notification to CFIUS stated that the two companies were considering entering into a shareholders\u2019 agreement to vote their respective shares in concert. In subsequent correspondence, CFIUS was informed that the two Israeli companies had not concluded a shareholders\u2019 agreement. CFIUS found that there was no foreign control because the two firms were not acting together and did not either individually or collectively have the ability to control the U.S. company. Because CFIUS found no foreign control, it did not review the transaction for national security concerns."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Decisions on Foreign Government Control", "paragraphs": ["The 1992 legislation required mandatory investigations of CFIUS cases in which the foreign company proposing an investment is controlled by a foreign government and the transaction could result in foreign control that \u201ccould affect the national security.\u201d As a result, CFIUS also reviews cases for foreign government control. Of the 174 cases reviewed between October 1992 and December 1994, CFIUS found foreign government control in 18 cases. None of these cases resulted in investigations. CFIUS found the national security concerns in these cases were not sufficient to warrant investigations. In implementing the legislative requirement, CFIUS has determined that even when there is foreign government control, the provision does not mandate an investigation for a notification that does not pose a credible threat to the national security.", "Of the 16 cases we reviewed, 13 occurred after the 1992 legislation. Six cases involved some level of foreign government ownership of or participation in the acquiring companies. In two of these cases, CFIUS determined there was foreign government control.", "A subsidiary of a German company proposed acquiring a U.S. manufacturer of large machine tools. The U.S. company had unclassified contracts with DOD, and its products were subject to export controls applying to dual-use products, but it did not possess unique capabilities, and its technology was not considered defense critical. About one-third of the German company was indirectly owned by one German state government and two German city governments. Under German law, this level of ownership gave the government-owned entities the power to block certain decisions, such as the acquisition or closing down of businesses. The government-owned entities offered to abstain on shareholder decisions affecting the U.S. company. CFIUS found that there was foreign control because the acquiring company was German-owned and planned to purchase substantially all the assets of the U.S. company. Because the government entities had the power to block certain decisions, CFIUS determined there was foreign government control. CFIUS also concluded that there were not sufficient national security concerns to warrant an investigation.", "A subsidiary of a French company proposed purchasing a U.S. developer and manufacturer of software tools. The U.S. company had unclassified contracts with DOD and other U.S. government entities, but the technology was not militarily sensitive. The ultimate parent of the acquiring company is 100 percent owned by the French government. CFIUS determined that the acquiring company was foreign owned and that the outright acquisition of the U.S. company would result in foreign control. Because the buyer was owned by the French government, CFIUS decided that foreign government control would result from this acquisition. CFIUS also concluded that there were not sufficient national security concerns to warrant an investigation.", "In the other four cases, CFIUS determined that there was no foreign government control. Two of these cases are discussed below for illustrative purposes. In the other two cases, CFIUS decided there was no foreign government control because either multiple intervening layers of ownership diluted government control or the foreign government could not appoint board members.", "A South Korean company notified CFIUS of its intent to acquire a U.S. designer and manufacturer of semiconductor devices. The U.S. company was a defense subcontractor engaged in a defense-critical but not state-of-the-art technology. The foreign buyer indicated its intention to transfer the U.S. company\u2019s technology to Korea and establish a production facility there. The foreign buyer received a small proportion of its total assets from two banks owned by the Korean government. Because this was a 100-percent acquisition by a Korean-owned company, CFIUS made a determination of foreign control. Although the foreign buyer had financing arrangements with the government-owned banks, CFIUS determined the amount of capital provided was not sufficient to constitute foreign government control. CFIUS also determined that there were not sufficient national security concerns to warrant a 45-day investigation.", "A British company notified CFIUS of its intention to acquire 20 percent of a U.S. company. The U.S. company had classified contracts and provided a critical U.S. government emergency service. Although the British government owned only 1.5 percent of the acquiring company\u2019s issued shares, it retained special powers over the acquiring company. These powers included requiring the government shareholder\u2019s written consent to alter certain sections of the foreign buyer\u2019s articles of incorporation. For example, consent must be obtained when there are changes in the limit of any single shareholder owning more than 15 percent. The British government could also appoint two directors. As discussed on page 8, CFIUS determined that the minority investment would result in foreign control. CFIUS decided that there was no foreign government control because the government owned only a small amount of stock, had not recently appointed directors to the board, and had no significant consent rights over the acquiring company.

However, officials from other CFIUS agencies stated that they look to DOD to make key judgments regarding the national security risks of a transaction. DOD considers, among numerous factors, whether (1) the technologies and products involved are critical to the national security, (2) the firm being acquired is a sole-source supplier to DOD, and (3) the U.S. company has classified contracts with the U.S. government. In addition, DOD reviews and analyzes information from the intelligence community regarding the foreign buyer\u2019s past record of compliance with export controls, proliferation of sensitive weapons-related technologies, and other matters.", "Our sample included some cases involving intelligence information on the acquiring company or its government\u2019s practices, including violations of U.N. sanctions and transfers of U.S. technology to proscribed countries; for most of these cases, DOD did not recommend a 45-day investigation. According to Defense Technology Security Administration officials, this information alone did not provide sufficient grounds to warrant investigations.

These assessments are to be shared with all the Committee members, according to CFIUS officials. The Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Economic Security found that 9 of the 174 CFIUS cases reviewed between October 1992 and December 1994 required a risk of diversion assessment. The responsible DOD official noted that the legislation requires a risk of diversion assessment only when the company is involved in the development, not the application, of a critical technology or is otherwise important to the defense industrial base.

The ESI database tracks foreign investments in and acquisitions of U.S. companies involved in high, key, or critical technologies. These technology categories are developed by consultation with technical experts and generally follow broad standard technology categories. The SDC tracks investments, acquisitions, and mergers worldwide, but we obtained selected data on foreign investment in the United States in technology areas comparable to those tracked by ESI. SDC categorizes the technology sector by ascertaining the primary business of each company and by identifying pertinent standard industrial classification codes.
