Thirty-three states exempted some or all vehicles in the determination of food stamp eligibility.

Almost all states used at least one option or waiver to change the reporting methods required of food stamp household earnings. The most frequently used reporting waivers exempted recipients from reporting changes in earned income of $25 or more per month. States used these options and waivers to simplify paperwork requirements for both the food stamp recipient and eligibility worker. Although few states were using the new option to provide food stamp benefits to families leaving TANF, 20 other states planned to implement the option. No state was implementing or planning to implement all aspects of the simplified program option, which allows states to merge their TANF and Food Stamp Program for families receiving both types of assistance. States told GAO that the simplified program option would make administering the programs more difficult because it creates a separate program, covering only a subset of food stamp recipients.

Despite the large number of people served, participation in the Food Stamp Program by eligible individuals has declined significantly since 1994. USDA\u2019s Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) estimates that at least 60 percent of the overall decline in food stamp participation involved recipients receiving welfare benefits.", "Data showing that former welfare families leave the Food Stamp Program at rates higher than their nonwelfare counterparts has raised concerns that the federal rules and regulations under which states administer their Food Stamp Programs do not facilitate participation by low-income working families who were affected by welfare reform. While states continue to administer their Food Stamp Programs under these federal rules and regulations, welfare reform enacted in 1996 gave states flexibility to administer their welfare programs through Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grants.", "To help states address barriers to participation, and to help them administer their Food Stamp Programs, FNS offers some flexibility by providing options and waivers to program rules and regulations. In light of the reauthorization of the Food Stamp Program in 2002, you asked us to examine states\u2019 use of certain federal food stamp options and waivers. Most of the options and waivers we looked at were offered to states since welfare reform. We assessed the extent to which states used specific program options and waivers related to: (1) determining food stamp eligibility, (2) reporting changes in household circumstances that may affect eligibility and benefit amounts, (3) providing food stamps to households leaving TANF, and (4) aligning food stamp and TANF program rules for families receiving both types of assistance.", "Our review is based on telephone interviews that we conducted during  September and October 2001 with officials in 50 states, including food  stamp directors, and policy and quality control officials.

FNS regulations require that states certify  household eligibility at least annually and establish requirements for  households to report changes that occur after they are certified. Recently,  FNS introduced several options and waivers to food stamp rules and  regulations in order to increase program access and reduce the reporting  burden on working families while minimizing the potential for payment  errors. These include options and waivers related to program eligibility,  reporting requirements, extending food stamp benefits to households  leaving TANF, and options related to TANF recipients.

To be eligible for benefits, a household\u2019s gross  income may not exceed 130 percent of the federal poverty level and the  value of its assets may not exceed $2,000.

In the wake of welfare reform, many needy families that are no longer  receiving TANF cash assistance may receive other TANF- funded services  or benefits. FNS gave states the option to extend categorical eligibility to  families receiving TANF-funded benefits or services. States can determine  which TANF-funded services or benefits confer categorical eligibility to  food stamps.", "FNS offers two options that states can use to allow households to own a  vehicle worth more than the amount allowed in current regulations and  remain eligible for food stamp benefits. One option allows states to  replace the federal food stamp vehicle asset rule with the vehicle asset  rule from any TANF assistance program, as long as the rule is more liberal  than the federal rule. States adopting the rule of a TANF-funded program  must apply it to all applicants for food stamp benefits. States can also use  the categorical eligibility option as a way to exclude all vehicles, as well as  other assets the family may have, from the determination of eligibility for  food stamps.

The length of the certification period  depends on household circumstances, but only households in which all  members are elderly or disabled can be certified for more than 12 months.  Once the certification period ends, households must reapply for benefits,  at which time eligibility and benefit levels are re-determined. Households  with stable income are generally given longer certification periods than  households with fluctuating income. Prior to welfare reform, federal  regulations required households to have a face-to-face interview with an  agency worker at each re-certification. Current regulations give states the  option to require only one face-to-face interview a year regardless of the  length of the certification period.", "Between certification periods, households must report changes in their  circumstances\u2014such as household composition, income, and expenses\u2014  that may affect their eligibility or benefit amounts. States determine how  frequently households must file reports.

The Transitional Benefit Alternative,  introduced in November 2000, gives states the option to continue to  provide families with their same food stamp benefit amount for 3 months  after they leave welfare. As part of its deliberations on food stamp  reauthorization, the Congress is considering extending the transitional  benefit to 6 months.", "Finally, recognizing that TANF and the Food Stamp Program generally are  administered by the same agency at the local level, the 1996 welfare  reform legislation provided an option for states to merge their TANF and  Food Stamp Program rules into a single set of eligibility and benefit  requirements for households receiving both TANF and food stamps. This  option, called the Simplified Food Stamp Program, allows states to align  all of their TANF and Food Stamp Program rules.

The states review case  information and make home visits to determine whether households were  eligible for benefits and received the correct benefit payment. FNS  regional offices validate the results by reviewing a subset of each state\u2019s  sample to determine its accuracy and make adjustments to the state\u2019s  overpayment and underpayment errors as necessary. States are penalized  if their payment error rate is higher than the national average, which was  8.9 percent in fiscal year 2000.", "Food Stamp Program payment errors occur for a variety of reasons.  Overpayments can be caused by inadvertent or intentional errors made by  recipients and caseworkers. According to FNS\u2019 quality control system, the  states overpaid food stamp recipients about $976 million in fiscal year  2000 and underpaid recipients about $360 million. A little over half of these  errors occurred when state food stamp workers made mistakes, such as  misapplying complex food stamp rules in calculating benefits. The  remaining errors occurred because participants, either inadvertently or  deliberately, did not provide accurate information to state food stamp  offices.", "According to USDA, about half of all payment errors are due to an  incorrect determination of the household\u2019s income. In 1999, every state  except one had a higher payment error rate among households with  earnings as compared with households without earnings. Because their  hours of work per week vary and they change jobs frequently, low-wage  workers often have fluctuating incomes. Recipients are required to report  these income changes, and eligibility workers must adjust their food stamp  benefits correctly to avoid payment errors.

Many states  conferred categorical eligibility only to households receiving TANF-funded  benefits such as emergency assistance and childcare; while some states  conferred categorical eligibility to food stamp applicants simply by  providing them with information and referral services paid for with TANF  funds. For example, during the food stamp application process, clients  who may be financially ineligible for food stamps could become  categorically eligible for benefits by virtue of having received a referral to  a specific TANF-funded program.", "Although the primary reason states gave for conferring categorical  eligibility was to increase access to food stamps by making households  who are eligible for a TANF-funded service automatically eligible for food  stamps, states cited other benefits of this option. For example, by  eliminating the need to calculate the value of a food stamp applicant\u2019s  assets, the eligibility worker\u2019s administrative burden is reduced.  Furthermore, five states noted that conferring categorical eligibility for  food stamps makes children eligible for the school lunch program, even if  the household does not actually qualify for a food stamp benefit. (See fig.  1.)", "While about two-thirds of the states used the categorical eligibility option,  some states pointed out difficulties that the option created. For example,  many individuals made categorically eligible for food stamps through  receipt of a pamphlet or referral to a service may in fact not actually  qualify for a food stamp benefit, possibly increasing the administrative  burden on food stamp workers. In addition, several officials said they  would like the food stamp rules pertaining to categorical eligibility  simplified. They noted that categorical eligibility is determined in part by  the source of the funding for the program under which the household  receives noncash benefits or services. Because many programs have  multiple funding sources, it can be difficult to determine whether a  particular program meets the TANF funding requirements. Another official  said that categorical eligibility is difficult to explain to staff. Other officials  noted problems tied to the variation from state to state that the option  creates. One official commented that allowing states to determine which  of their welfare-funded services to use in granting categorical eligibility for  food stamps could create a great deal of national variation in who can  access this federal entitlement program.

Many states  told us that they used reporting options and waivers to reduce their  payment errors, to ease program administration, and to simplify  paperwork requirements for households.

Eighteen states chose a waiver allowing households to report  changes in employment status, which includes changes in wage rates,  number of hours worked in a week, and a move from part-time to full-time  employment or vice-versa. Seventeen states chose the waiver to require  recipients to report only changes in income that exceeded $80 or $100.  (See fig. 4.)", "States are allowed to use more than one reporting option or waiver.  Thirteen states used two or more alternatives.

States are held responsible only for errors  resulting from miscalculating benefits at certification, or if income  exceeds 130 percent of poverty and the change is not reported. State  agencies are not held responsible for errors if the household experienced a  change in its circumstances that the household did not report if the state\u2019s  policies do not require the household to report the change. States selecting  the semiannual reporting requirement must certify households for at least  a 6-month period, and they have the option to eliminate every other face- to-face interview because of the new rule requiring only one face-to-face  interview a year.", "Although the semiannual reporting option provides states with an  opportunity to reduce the reporting burden on working families with some  impunity from payment errors, some states want to adjust the food stamp  benefit in response to all reported changes in household income. Half of  the states using the semiannual option requested and received a waiver  allowing them to adjust benefits based on all changes reported by families.  State officials gave various reasons for requesting this waiver to  semiannual reporting. In some states, the Food Stamp Program shared the  same computer system and database used for determining eligibility for  other programs, such as TANF and Medicaid. Since these states link their  programs, changes that families report to one program often automatically  change the food stamp data, and states wanted the ability to adjust  benefits according to this new information. Other states said that the  waiver was useful because their food stamp workers have always adjusted  food stamps based on reported changes; not to do so for all food stamp  recipients would be confusing.", "Officials in 28 states said they are considering the semiannual reporting  option. Nine states would implement the option only with the waiver  allowing them to act on all reported changes in part because of computer  integration issues. Others would consider the option with a waiver  allowing them to apply it to all food stamp households, not just  households with earnings. Twelve states are not using or considering the  semiannual reporting option. Officials in these states told us the option is  either too burdensome to implement, the rules are too complicated, or that  it might increase payment errors.", "Officials from 38 states said that additional changes to the reporting  requirements were needed. Some noted that states should be allowed to  use the same reporting requirements for all households, not just  households with earnings.", "Although states told us that a primary reason they used reporting options  and waivers was to minimize the payment error associated with earnings,  concern over payment accuracy affected states\u2019 decisions regarding other  options and waivers as well. For example, although FNS gave states the  option to limit face-to-face interviews to once a year, some states continue  to require households with earnings to come in more frequently because of  concerns over payment accuracy. Officials in 45 states told us that the  effect on their payment error rate was either the most important factor or  a contributing factor in their decision to use particular options and  waivers. As a result, officials in many states said that USDA\u2019s quality  control program should not focus solely on payment accuracy. State  officials also suggested changes in the way that payment errors are  calculated.

Twenty-seven states said they would implement  the proposed 6-month Transitional Benefit Alternative if it became  available.", "The primary reason that states would provide a transitional benefit is to  support working families. Many states said that the option helped with the  transition from welfare to work by stabilizing the families after they leave  welfare by guaranteeing a fixed food stamp benefit regardless of how their  income fluctuates during the transitional benefit period. (See fig. 5.) Some  states that would use the 6-month option but not the 3-month option said  that the additional 3 months of support to families making the transition  from welfare to work would make the implementation costs worthwhile.", "The 12 states that had decided not to use transitional benefits said they  were concerned about the implementation costs.

However, as we reported earlier, since not all  needy households receive both TANF and food stamps, the states selecting  the simplified program option would, in effect, be operating three  programs: one program for TANF recipients following state TANF rules;  one program for food stamp recipients following federal food stamp  regulations; and the simplified program for recipients of both food stamps  and TANF. Furthermore, to whatever extent the states use the simplified  program, they must also have demonstrated that total federal costs would  not be more than the costs incurred under the regular Food Stamp  Program\u2014that is, the program has to be \u201ccost neutral.\u201d Figure 8 shows the  reasons states gave for not choosing the option.
