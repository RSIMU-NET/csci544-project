In producing this report, GAO identified coal operators that filed for bankruptcy from 2014 through 2016. GAO analyzed information on commercially-insured and self-insured coal operators, and examined workers' compensation insurance practices in four of the nation's top five coal producing states. GAO also interviewed DOL officials, coal mine operators, and insurance company representatives, among others."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Coal mine operator bankruptcies have led to the transfer of about $865 million in estimated benefit responsibility to the federal government's Black Lung Disability Trust Fund (Trust Fund), according to DOL estimates. The Trust Fund pays benefits when no responsible operator is identified, or when the liable operator does not pay. GAO previously testified in June 2019 that it had identified three bankrupt, self-insured operators for which benefit responsibility was transferred to the Trust Fund. Since that time, DOL's estimate of the transferred benefit responsibility has grown\u2014from a prior range of $313 million to $325 million to the more recent $865 million estimate provided to GAO in January 2020. According to DOL, this escalation was due, in part, to recent increases in black lung benefit award rates and higher medical treatment costs, and to an underestimate of one company's (Patriot Coal) future benefit claims.", "Trust Fund, Filed from 2014 through 2016", "DOL's limited oversight of coal mine operator insurance has exposed the Trust Fund to financial risk, though recent changes, if implemented effectively, can help address these risks. In overseeing self-insurance in the past, DOL did not: estimate future benefit liability when setting the amount of collateral required to self-insure; regularly review operators to assess whether the required amount of collateral should change; or always take action to protect the Trust Fund by revoking an operators' ability to self-insure as appropriate. In July 2019, DOL began implementing a new self-insurance process that could help address past deficiencies in estimating collateral and regularly reviewing self-insured operators. However, DOL's new process still lacks procedures for its planned annual renewal of self-insured operators and for resolving coal operator appeals should operators dispute DOL collateral requirements. This could hinder DOL from revoking operators' ability to self-insure should they not comply with DOL requirements. Further, for those operators that do not self-insure, DOL does not monitor them to ensure they maintain adequate and continuous commercial coverage as appropriate. As a result, the Trust Fund may in some instances assume responsibility for paying benefits that otherwise would have been paid by insurers."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO made three recommendations to DOL to establish procedures for self-insurance renewals and coal operator appeals, and to develop a process to monitor whether commercially-insured operators maintain adequate and continuous coverage.

The federal government\u2019s Black Lung Disability Trust Fund  (Trust Fund) finances medical and cash assistance to certain coal miners  who have been totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis (also known as  black lung disease). Black lung benefits are generally to be paid by  responsible coal mine operators. However, the Trust Fund pays benefits  in certain circumstances, including in cases where no responsible mine  operator can be identified or when the liable mine operator does not pay.", "As we reported in May 2018, the Trust Fund faces financial challenges.  Its expenditures have consistently exceeded revenue and the Trust Fund  has essentially borrowed with interest from the Department of the  Treasury\u2019s (Treasury) general fund almost every year since 1979, which  was its first complete fiscal year. In fiscal year 2019, the Trust Fund  borrowed about $1.9 billion to cover its expenditures, according to  Department of Labor (DOL) officials.", "In June 2019, we reported preliminary observations to this committee that  coal operator bankruptcies were further straining Trust Fund finances  because, in some cases, responsibility for benefit payments was  transferred from the bankrupt operator to the Trust Fund. This may  occur, for instance, when the amount of collateral the Department of  Labor (DOL) requires from a self-insured coal operator does not fully  cover the operator\u2019s benefit responsibility should the operator become  insolvent.", "Trust Fund revenue is primarily obtained through a tax on coal produced  and sold domestically, which we refer to in this report as the coal tax.  The coal tax rate has varied over the years. From 1986 through 2018, the  coal tax rate was $1.10 per ton of underground-mined coal and $0.55 per  ton of surface-mined coal, up to 4.4 percent of the sales price. In 2019,  the rate of the coal tax decreased to $0.50 cents and $0.25 cents per ton  of underground-mined and surface-mined coal, respectively, up to 2  percent of the sales price. In 2020, the rate of the coal tax increased to  pre-2019 levels. However, it is scheduled to decrease again beginning in  2021. With less revenue from the coal tax, the Trust Fund will likely need  to borrow more from Treasury\u2019s general fund.", "My statement summarizes the findings from the report we are releasing  today, which addresses: (1) how coal mine operator bankruptcies have  affected the Trust Fund, and (2) how DOL managed coal mine operator  insurance to limit financial risk to the Trust Fund.

Figure 1 shows how many  operators were self-insured or commercially insured at the time of  bankruptcy, and if responsibility for benefits was shifted from the bankrupt  operator to the Trust Fund. Federal law generally requires coal mine  operators to secure their black lung benefit liability. A self-insured coal  mine operator assumes the financial responsibility for providing black lung  benefits to its eligible employees by paying claims as they are incurred.  Operators are allowed to self-insure if they meet certain DOL conditions.  For instance, operators applying to self-insure must obtain collateral in  the form of an indemnity bond, deposit or trust, or letter of credit in an  amount deemed necessary and sufficient by DOL to secure their  liability. Operators that do not self-insure are generally required to  obtain coverage from commercial insurance companies, state workers\u2019  compensation insurance funds, or other entities authorized under state  law to insure workers\u2019 compensation.", "From 2014 through 2016, three self-insured coal mine operator  bankruptcies resulted in a transfer of $865 million of benefit liabilities from  the coal operators to the Trust Fund, according to DOL estimates (see  table 1). DOL estimates for how these bankruptcies will affect the Trust  Fund have considerably increased from what DOL had previously  reported. In June 2019, we reported that DOL estimated that between  $313 million to $325 million in benefit liabilities would transfer to the Trust  Fund as a result of these bankruptcies. In January 2020, however, DOL provided updated estimates stating that $865 million in benefit liabilities  would transfer to the Trust Fund as a result of these bankruptcies.  According to DOL, their estimates increased, among other reasons, to  account for higher black lung benefit award rates that occurred from fiscal  years 2016 through 2019, and higher medical treatment cost inflation in  recent years. Additionally, DOL\u2019s prior estimate for the Patriot Coal  (Patriot) bankruptcy did not account for future claims and their effect on  the Trust Fund. The amount of collateral DOL required from these  operators to self-insure did not fully cover their estimated benefit  liabilities. When this occurs, benefit liabilities in excess of the collateral  can be transferred to the Trust Fund. For example, the collateral DOL  required from Alpha Natural Resources (Alpha) was about $12 million and  approximately $494 million of estimated benefit liability transferred to the  Trust Fund, according to DOL.", "The three other self-insured coal mine operator bankruptcies we identified  did not affect the Trust Fund. Specifically, Arch Coal, Peabody Energy,  and Walter Energy were also self-insured operators, but DOL officials  said that their federal black lung benefit liabilities were assumed by a  reorganized company or by a purchaser, and therefore did not transfer to  the Trust Fund.", "Insurance contracts or policies to secure operators\u2019 benefit liabilities are  required by law to include a provision that insolvency or bankruptcy of an  operator does not release the insurer from the obligation to make benefit  payments. Additionally, state insurance regulation, insurer underwriting, risk management practices, and state guaranty funds help to protect the  Trust Fund from having to assume responsibility for paying black lung  benefits on behalf of bankrupt coal operators. Thus, by being  commercially insured, the two operators we identified that filed for  bankruptcy between 2014 and 2016\u2014Energy Future Holdings and  Xinergy Ltd\u2014did not affect the Trust Fund, according to DOL (see fig. 1).", "Since 2016, several other self-insured operators have also filed for  bankruptcy, according to DOL officials, including Cambrian Coal, Cloud  Peak Energy, Murray Energy, and Westmoreland Coal. DOL officials said  that about $17.4 million in estimated black lung benefit liability will transfer  to the Trust Fund as a result of Westmoreland Coal\u2019s bankruptcy. Given  the uncertainty of the bankruptcy process in terms of whether liabilities  will or will not transfer to the Trust Fund, however, DOL officials said that  they could not speculate on how these other bankruptcies may affect the  Trust Fund."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOL\u2019s Limited Oversight Has Exposed the Trust Fund to Financial Risk, and Its New Self-Insurance Process Lacks Enforcement Procedures", "paragraphs": ["In overseeing coal mine operator self-insurance in the past, DOL did not  estimate future benefit liability when setting collateral or regularly review  operators to monitor their changing financial conditions. DOL regulations  require that collateral be obtained from operators in an amount deemed  necessary and sufficient to secure the payment of the operators\u2019 liability.  To determine collateral amounts under the former process, agency  procedures stated that an operator\u2019s net worth be assessed by reviewing,  among other factors, the operator\u2019s audited financial statements and  black lung claims information. The amount of collateral was to be equal to  3, 5, or 10 years of the operator\u2019s annual black lung benefit payments  made at the time of a coal operator\u2019s self-insurance application  depending on its net worth. Specifically, if net worth was $1 billion or  greater, agency procedures set collateral equal to 3 years of benefit  payments. If net worth ranged from $500 million to $1 billion, collateral  was equal to 5 years of benefit payments. If net worth ranged from $10  million to $500 million, DOL set collateral equal to 10 years of benefit  payments. Agency procedures did not permit operators with net worth  less than $10 million to self-insure.", "DOL\u2019s former process for determining collateral did not routinely consider  potential future claims for which an operator could be responsible. The  agency periodically reauthorized coal operators to self-insure by  reviewing an operator\u2019s most recent audited financial statement and  claims information, among other things. DOL prepared memos  documenting these reviews, and communicated with coal operators about  whether their financial circumstances warranted increasing or decreasing  their collateral.", "Regulations state that DOL may adjust the amount of collateral required  from self-insured operators when experience or changed conditions so  warrant, but regular monitoring of self-insured operators was not  conducted. In reviewing the most recent reauthorization memos for each  of the self-insured operators, we found that while some of these operators  had been reauthorized more recently, others had not been in decades.  One operator in particular had not been reauthorized since 1988. There  were no written procedures that specified how often reauthorizations  should occur after an operator\u2019s initial 18-month reauthorization.", "DOL has other tools available to mitigate financial losses to the Trust  Fund. These include revoking an operator\u2019s ability to self-insure; fining  mine operators for operating without insurance; and placing liens on  operator assets. Based on our review of agency documentation,  however, we found instances when officials did not use these tools to  protect the Trust Fund, or were hindered from doing so because of an  operator\u2019s ongoing appeal or bankruptcy.", "James River. In September 2001, DOL required $5 million in  additional collateral from James River Coal (James River), which  would have increased its collateral from $0.4 million to $5.4 million.  Although DOL did not receive the additional collateral, it did not  revoke the operator\u2019s authority to self-insure, which is a potential  option under agency regulations. Further, DOL had not reauthorized  James River at any point from August 2001 until it filed for bankruptcy  in April 2014. If James River\u2019s ability to self-insure had been revoked,  DOL could have potentially prevented the Trust Fund from being  responsible for claims based on a miner\u2019s employment from 2001  through 2016, when James River liquidated. Additionally, if the  operator had been unable to obtain commercial insurance, the agency  could have potentially fined the operator for each day it operated  without insurance. Instead, no action was taken during these years  and estimated benefit liability of $141 million was shifted to the Trust  Fund, according to DOL. DOL officials stated that they do not have  records explaining why James River did not provide the additional  collateral or why they did not revoke its authority to self-insure.", "Patriot. In August 2014, DOL required an additional $65 million in  collateral from Patriot, increasing its collateral from $15 million to $80  million. Patriot appealed this decision and, in the 8 months that  followed before Patriot filed for bankruptcy in May 2015, DOL did not  obtain additional collateral, or revoke Patriot\u2019s ability to self-insure  because the appeal was still pending. DOL officials said they would  not typically revoke an operator\u2019s authority to self-insure during an  ongoing appeal. As a result, DOL was hindered from using this  enforcement tool.", "Liens on operator assets can be an effective tool to protect the Trust  Fund if an operator defaults on its benefit liability, but DOL officials said  they are hindered from using this tool if an operator files for bankruptcy.  DOL can place a lien on a coal operator\u2019s assets under federal law if they  refuse the demand to pay the black lung benefit payments for which they  are liable. In the event of bankruptcy or insolvency, federal law states  that the lien imposed shall be treated in the same manner as a lien for  taxes due and owing to the United States under certain laws. However,  DOL officials said that operators rarely stop paying benefits until after  they file for bankruptcy. Once a bankruptcy occurs, DOL officials said that  they are generally prevented by the court from placing a lien and taking  an operator\u2019s assets in lieu of payment of current and future benefit  liability. Under bankruptcy law, DOL officials said that they have no  special status over other creditors with outstanding financial claims. DOL  officials said that obtaining sufficient collateral is a better way to protect  the Trust Fund."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "DOL\u2019s New Self-Insurance Process May Help Address Problems, but Key Enforcement Procedures Are Needed", "paragraphs": ["In July 2019, DOL began implementing a new process for coal mine  operator self-insurance that may help to address some past deficiencies,  if implemented effectively. Among other things, DOL will require operators  to periodically submit financial and claims information, including an  actuarial estimate of the operator\u2019s current and future benefit liability. DOL  plans to use this information to assess the insolvency risk of each  operator. Depending on the results of their analysis, DOL plans to  categorize the risk-level of each applicant as low, medium, or high. DOL  will then set the amount of collateral required to self-insure by linking the  operator\u2019s risk category to a corresponding percentage of the operator\u2019s  actuarial estimated benefit liability. DOL policies state that they would  require a high-risk operator to secure with collateral 90 percent of  estimated benefit liability, a medium-risk operator to secure 45 percent,  and a low-risk operator to secure 15 percent. However, in February 2020,  DOL officials said they plan to revise these percentages to 100 percent,  85 percent, and 70 percent for high-risk, medium-risk, and low-risk  operators, respectively.", "Coal mine operators that are already authorized to self-insure will be  required to submit, among other things, an annual renewal application.  DOL plans to use this information to update their insolvency risk analysis.  If an operator\u2019s risk category changes (e.g., from low-to medium-risk),  DOL plans to send a form to the operator requiring an additional amount  or type of collateral. Upon receiving the completed form, and proof that  the collateral has been obtained, DOL stated that they will notify the  operator that its authority to self-insure has been reauthorized.", "DOL\u2019s new self-insurance process made important changes, but  overlooked other key internal control improvements that are needed to  protect the financial interests of the Trust Fund. DOL\u2019s new requirements  for setting collateral and for the more frequent review of self-insured  operators are key components of internal controls, which call for agency  management to implement control activities through policy. However,  DOL\u2019s new self-insurance procedures do not specify (1) the duration of an  operator\u2019s self-insurance authority, (2) the time frames for submitting  renewal applications and supporting documentation, and (3) the  conditions under which an operator\u2019s self-insurance authority would not  be renewed. Our report recommends that DOL implement procedures for  coal mine operator self-insurance renewal that clarifies how long an  operator is authorized to self-insure; when an operator must submit its  renewal application and supporting documentation; and the conditions  under which an operator\u2019s self-insurance authority would not be renewed.  DOL agreed with this recommendation and stated that it will ensure  letters granting or renewing self-insurance authority will inform operators  that their authorization expires in one year and that they must submit  renewal information three months in advance of the expiration date.", "DOL staff are hindered from taking enforcement action during an  operator\u2019s ongoing appeal, as previously mentioned. DOL policies state  that an operator may request reconsideration if its self-insurance  application has been denied or if it believes the collateral required by DOL  is too high to secure its benefit liability. However, DOL lacks procedures  that specify, among other things, the length of time that operators have to  submit supporting information. Further, DOL does not specify a goal for  how much time DOL appeals decisions should take. For example, in  October 2015, DOL recommended revoking Murray Energy\u2019s (Murray)  authority to self-insure due to deteriorating financial conditions. Murray  appealed this decision, and DOL officials said they postponed responding  to the appeal until their new self-insurance process was implemented.  However, Murray filed for bankruptcy in October 2019 and DOL had not  revoked its authority to self-insure or requested additional collateral  because Murray\u2019s appeal was still pending and DOL was still evaluating  how much collateral it would require from the operator under its new self- insurance process.", "Our report recommends that DOL develop and implement procedures for  self-insured coal mine operator appeals that identify time lines for self- insured operators to submit documentation supporting their appeals and  that identify a goal for how much time DOL should take to make appeals  decisions. DOL agreed with this recommendation and stated that they will  ensure letters denying self-insurance will inform operators that they have  a 30-day appeal period (limited to one extension), and that DOL has set a  goal of resolving all appeals within 90 days of the denial letter."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Commercial Insurance Oversight Improvements Are Needed", "paragraphs": ["We found that DOL does not monitor coal mine operators that do not self- insure and, thus, must commercially insure their federal black lung  liabilities to make certain they maintain adequate and continuous  coverage as required by law. In the absence of effective DOL monitoring,  we evaluated the potential risk that uninsured operators could pose to the  Trust Fund. Specifically, in examining the 13 largest coal mine operators  that do not self-insure, we found that some insurers erred in reporting  black lung policies and in one instance an operator did not have adequate  coverage.", "We found six operators (parent or subsidiary) that were not insured for  the entire 3-year period from 2016 through 2018, according to our  review of DOL data. When we discussed our findings with DOL,  agency officials had to research each operator individually and in  some cases contact the operator or their insurer to find out whether or  not they had been covered. DOL concluded that these entities were  insured. However, the insurers had not properly reported the federal  black lung endorsement on new policies or subsequent renewals, in  addition to other reporting issues.", "One of these six operators also had, inadvertently, not maintained  adequate commercial coverage for its mining operations in Texas,  and had not self-insured those operations. In this instance, the  operator obtained an excess loss policy that only pays claims once  they exceed a high threshold and, therefore, is not sufficient by itself  to secure the payment of the operator\u2019s benefit liability.", "Designing processes to achieve agency objectives and respond to risks is  a principle of effective internal controls. Without a process to monitor  operator compliance with program insurance requirements, DOL risks not  identifying a lapse or cancellation of operator coverage. This could result  in the Trust Fund having to assume responsibility for paying benefits that  would otherwise have been paid by an insurer.", "Our report recommends that DOL should develop and implement a  process to monitor operator compliance with commercial insurance  requirements and periodically evaluate the effectiveness of this process.
