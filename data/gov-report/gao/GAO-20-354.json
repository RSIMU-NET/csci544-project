This report examines: (1) the costs, revenues, and other benefits associated with USPS's retail facilities; (2) USPS's nonpostal efforts since 2008 at retail facilities and the outcomes; and (3) considerations of new nonpostal efforts at retail facilities. GAO analyzed USPS retail facility costs and revenue data from fiscal years 2017 and 2018 (the only years available); reviewed relevant documents and reports from USPS and others; conducted a non-generalizable survey of USPS postmasters who managed rural, suburban, and urban retail facilities; and interviewed USPS officials, and stakeholders, including postal employee unions, industry and consumer groups, and federal agencies that partner with USPS to obtain views on current and potential nonpostal efforts.", "GAO is making no recommendations.

While such facilities accounted for about 15 percent of USPS's total fiscal year 2018 revenues, and about 7 percent of its total costs, stakeholders identified other benefits that retail facilities provide for communities\u2014particularly in rural areas\u2014such as local access to government information and services.", "Since 2008, USPS has offered a variety of nonpostal products and services at its retail facilities that have generated some revenue and other benefits. USPS data show that the nonpostal products and services for which USPS captures revenue data, such as money orders, generated about $431 million in total revenue in fiscal year 2018 and were profitable overall. Stakeholders said many of these nonpostal products and services also provided other benefits, such as enhanced convenience for customers, and postmasters GAO surveyed said some offerings, such as passport services, were highly valued in their communities.", "Offering additional nonpostal products and services at USPS retail facilities could provide consumer, government, or community benefits, but viability may be limited. Stakeholders said new offerings, such as expanded financial products or government services could, for example, enhance consumers' access and government efficiencies. In particular, some noted that USPS could provide a viable banking alternative for those lacking banking services. However, USPS officials, postmasters GAO surveyed, and stakeholders GAO interviewed said that additional offerings may generate minimal revenue and that USPS may face factors limiting the viability of these offerings. For example, groups representing states' licensing agencies said offering state hunting and fishing licenses could be problematic given different state requirements. Also, stakeholders said USPS may not have the expertise nor the required capital to enter the market of some of these new offerings. Given such concerns, USPS and policy makers need to carefully weigh costs, benefits, and limitations of any new offerings."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The United States Postal Service\u2019s (USPS) network of over 31,000 retail  facilities, such as post offices, reaches into almost every community in the  country and includes about as many outlets as McDonald\u2019s, Starbucks,  and Walmart combined. This network is central to USPS\u2019s fulfilling its  mission to provide prompt, reliable, and efficient postal services.  However, this mission continues to be at risk because USPS\u2019s revenues  do not cover its expenses. As demand for traditional postal services has  declined, USPS has struggled to operate as a self-financing entity and  has experienced significant losses\u2014$78 billion from fiscal years 2007  through 2019. As a result, USPS\u2019s financial viability has been on our list  of high-risk areas since 2009.", "Given the ubiquity of USPS\u2019s retail facilities and the costs to maintain  them, postal stakeholders, such as the Task Force on the United States  Postal System, have suggested that USPS could be authorized to offer  additional products and services through its retail facilities in order to  generate revenue and provide benefits to consumers, other government  entities, and communities. The Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act (PAEA) generally prohibits USPS from providing new types of  nonpostal products and services.

This  report examines:  the costs, revenues, and non-revenue benefits associated with  USPS\u2019s retail facilities;  the nonpostal efforts USPS has conducted since 2008 to increase  revenues and non-revenue benefits from its retail facilities, and the  costs, revenues, non-revenue benefits, and challenges associated  with such efforts; and  the key considerations for additional nonpostal efforts USPS could  pursue to increase revenues and non-revenue benefits from its retail  facilities.", "For this report, we focused on USPS-managed retail facilities including  USPS-operated post offices, postal stations, branches, and carrier  annexes, as defined in USPS\u2019s Annual Reports to Congress.", "To describe the costs, revenues, and non-revenue benefits associated  with USPS\u2019s retail facilities, we reviewed USPS\u2019s financial analysis of its  retail network for fiscal years 2017 and 2018, the only years USPS  conducted such analysis. Based on USPS documents we reviewed and  interviews with USPS officials, we determined these analyses were  sufficiently reliable to describe costs and revenues of retail facilities. We  used these analyses to identify the sources and amounts of retail facility  costs (e.g., personnel) and revenues (e.g., stamp sales) for most retail  facilities and facilities where revenues may not cover costs. We then  compared these amounts with USPS\u2019s total costs and revenues to  determine how much retail facilities contribute to them. For this  comparison, we made certain adjustments to USPS\u2019s total operating  expenses as stated in its Reports on Form 10-K by excluding certain  components of workers\u2019 compensation and retirement benefits expenses  that did not relate to active employees\u2019 costs, because those costs are  related to service performed in the past and thus do not reflect the impact  of operational changes.", "To identify non-revenue benefits of USPS\u2019s retail facility network, we  reviewed publications and studies, such as those conducted by USPS,  USPS\u2019s Office of Inspector General (OIG), and USPS\u2019s oversight body,  the Postal Regulatory Commission (PRC).

We selected 2008 to begin our analysis because that  was when new restrictions on nonpostal services took effect. To identify  the revenues generated by the nonpostal products and services we  identified, we reviewed data from USPS\u2019s retail network financial  analyses for fiscal years 2017 and 2018, the only years USPS conducted  such analyses. To identify the costs incurred by nonpostal products and  services, for which information was available, we reviewed USPS\u2019s fiscal  year 2018 Annual Compliance Report, PRC\u2019s fiscal year 2018 Annual  Compliance Determination Report, and non-public data provided to us by  USPS. To obtain stakeholder views on the non-revenue benefits of  USPS\u2019s nonpostal efforts, we interviewed officials from six federal  government entities that had partnerships with USPS as well as  representatives from APWU, UPMA, and two consumer groups.", "As one of the nonpostal efforts USPS can currently offer includes leasing  space, we reviewed USPS\u2019s data on the amount of vacant rentable space  for fiscal years 2017 and 2018 (the only available years), on tenants at  its facilities as of January 2020, and on the amount of revenue USPS  collected from leased space for fiscal year 2018. Based on interviews with  USPS officials and USPS documents we reviewed, we determined these  data were sufficiently reliable to describe the results of leasing excess  space at retail facilities. We also interviewed officials from the General  Services Administration (GSA), which leases space from USPS on behalf  of other federal government entities, and the Association of United States  Postal Lessors, which represents entities that lease space to USPS.", "To assess the key considerations for offering additional nonpostal efforts  at USPS retail facilities, we reviewed prior GAO reports and USPS OIG  studies; interviewed USPS officials and postal experts\u2014such as postal  groups, selected based on prior work\u2014to provide a range of views on  potential offerings; and attended a forum exploring community use and  adaptation of USPS\u2019s delivery infrastructure, including retail facilities. To  obtain stakeholder views on the potential benefits and limitations of these  offerings, we interviewed representatives from the two consumer groups  previously mentioned and eight industry and state licensing groups, which  we selected because of their potential to be affected by USPS offering  additional nonpostal products and services. We also interviewed  officials from the six federal entities that had or currently have  partnerships with USPS and an additional six federal government entities  that could potentially benefit from additional or new partnerships.

The retail portion of these facilities includes  public areas where USPS provides customers with retail services. The  public areas can include full service counters where employees assist  customers, self-service areas, and post office boxes. The non-public  portions include features such as workrooms, where mail processing  occurs, and employee support areas, such as lunch tables and lockers.", "Although USPS data show that customer visits and transactions have  declined over the past 5 years, the size of USPS\u2019s retail network has  remained largely unchanged during that period (see fig. 1).", "We have previously reported that USPS has made some efforts to reduce  the number of its retail facilities to align with the significant decline in mail  volume and address rising costs. Several factors, however, have limited  USPS\u2019s ability to make further reductions. For example, in 2011 USPS  moved to evaluate the potential closure of almost 3,700 retail facilities but  abandoned their effort due to stakeholder concerns. Instead, USPS  explored options to adjust its retail service without closing offices. Legal  restrictions also limit USPS\u2019s ability to close retail facilities. For example,  USPS cannot close a small post office solely for operating at a deficit. If  USPS wishes to close a retail facility, among other steps, it must take into  consideration not only the economic savings but also the effects on the  communities served, its employees, and the services provided, and it  must provide customers with at least 60 days\u2019 notice before the proposed  closure date.", "Federal statute defines the types of services that USPS may and may not  provide. As previously noted, PAEA placed limitations on the nonpostal  products and services USPS could provide. In particular, it allowed USPS  to continue to provide nonpostal products and services that were both  offered as of January 1, 2006, and were permitted by PRC to continue.  While PAEA generally prohibits USPS from initiating new nonpostal  services, USPS uses a separate statutory authority to provide such  services to federal executive agencies. If a nonpostal service is to be  provided to a federal executive agency, generally, USPS and the parties  must specify the terms and conditions of their collaboration, including the  activities to be performed by USPS and the terms of reimbursement, if  applicable. USPS is currently not authorized to provide nonpostal  services to state or local entities.", "USPS may also lease excess space at retail facilities\u2014including parking,  office space, and roof areas\u2014to other entities at both the facilities that  USPS owns and those it leases from other entities. USPS officials said  some leases give them the right to sublease space at leased facilities, but  the officials did not know how many facilities where USPS had such  rights. USPS collaborates with the GSA, which is the nation\u2019s largest  public real-estate organization, to lease space to other federal  government entities.

According to USPS as of January 2020, USPS was leasing space in 232  facilities (about 3 percent) of its 8,362 owned facilities to federal and local  government and private entities. USPS generated about $29 million  from its leases in fiscal year 2018. USPS officials told us they are  currently researching the feasibility and benefits of leasing space to  entities to place automated teller machines in retail facility lobbies and  parking lots as a way to generate revenue. Stakeholders we interviewed  and USPS OIG have said leasing space may also result in non-revenue  benefits for USPS and consumers. For example, a postmaster who  managed a retail facility said that leasing office space to two local  government entities likely increased foot traffic in the facility and  increased community access to government services provided by the  tenants.", "USPS, however, has little additional vacant rentable space. As of  September 2018, USPS reported that it had vacant rentable space  available in 307 (about 4 percent) of its 8,362 owned facilities. In 2018,  USPS OIG reported that USPS faced unique challenges in leasing such  excess space, including poor condition and limited size, lack of handicap  accessibility, limited parking, lack of accessibility without interfering with  USPS operations, and lack of a separate restroom. According to GSA  officials, some available space is small\u2014USPS reported that about 9  percent of available space is less than 500 square feet\u2014and may require  significant investment from GSA or the potential tenant agency to be  suitable for occupancy (see fig. 7). GSA officials said it has been difficult  to find federal government entities willing to lease retail facility space from  USPS. For example, officials from the Census Bureau told us that they  leased some space at two USPS facilities to support 2010 Census  activities, such as to support hiring personnel and a location for training.  However, they were not able to lease as much as they would have liked  because there was very little available space that met Census  requirements, and the space that was available would have required  costly modifications prior to use. In addition, USPS officials told us there  can be costs related to leasing space, such as USPS\u2019s making needed  renovations.", "USPS does not track the extent to which space at retail facilities, such as  lobbies and parking lots, is shared with other entities without any  payment. However, USPS officials told us that while community groups  have asked to use retail facility space and parking lots, these requests do  not happen frequently. Only two of the 149 postmasters we surveyed  (about 1 percent) indicated that the selected retail facility they oversaw  shared space with other entities at no charge."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Additional Nonpostal Efforts at Retail Facilities Could Offer Some Benefits but May Generate Little Revenue and Have Other Limitations Additional Nonpostal Products and Services Could Provide Non- Revenue Benefits", "paragraphs": ["Studies we reviewed and postal experts and stakeholders we interviewed  have suggested that USPS may be well positioned to offer additional  nonpostal products and services due to its trusted brand, vast retail  facility network, and experience with other nonpostal efforts.

Examples of some of the  suggested types of non-revenue benefits are shown in table 4.", "However, most of these additional nonpostal products and services would  not increase revenues or greatly benefit their communities, according to  the postmasters we surveyed. Specifically, a majority of postmasters did  not think any of the nine additional nonpostal products and services we  asked about would increase revenues or benefit the community to a great  or very great extent. However, postmasters indicated that some potential  services were more promising than others. In particular, about 40 percent  (59 of 149) of postmasters indicated that notary services would increase  revenues or benefit the community to a great or very great extent, while  36 percent (53 of 149) of postmasters indicated that driver\u2019s license and  other state license services would increase revenues or benefit the  community to a great or very great extent.

They, as well  as studies we reviewed, indicated a variety of reasons why USPS might  not generate significant net revenue from the additional nonpostal  products and services we identified.", "Low potential for a significant market share. USPS officials and  stakeholders told us USPS could face challenges gaining enough of a  market share for some of the additional nonpostal products and  services to make a profit. For example, USPS officials said if they  offered notary services, they would likely gain only a small share of  the market because other retailers, such as banks, already offer these  services for free. Also, representatives from four financial associations  said they believed consumer demand for financial products and  services was already being met or would best be met by existing  financial entities, and that many consumers may not likely obtain  these services from USPS. In addition, representatives from two  financial associations said serving underbanked populations would  likely result in limited profits because these tend to be riskier  customers who may default more often, and the services they use  result in slim profits for current providers.", "High operational costs. USPS OIG has reported that USPS incurs  low customer foot traffic and high labor costs compared to other retail  facilities. According to USPS officials, these factors make it difficult  to compete on a cost-per-transaction basis for nonpostal products and  services and make leasing space in owned facilities and subleasing  space at USPS\u2019s leased retail facilities attractive, because leasing and  subleasing would not incur personnel costs.", "Additionally, USPS officials told us that offering some of the additional  nonpostal products and services could require significant investment  costs\u2014such as major technology investments and additional training  for mail clerks\u2014further reducing USPS\u2019s ability to make a profit. For  example, USPS OIG estimated in 2015 that USPS could generate  $1.1 billion annually after a 5-year ramp up from expanding the  financial products it already offered. USPS officials, however, said  that expanding such offerings at retail facilities would likely require  extensive investments in physical and information technology security  and incur ongoing costs. Accounting for these sorts of costs would  mean USPS would likely generate about $100 million to $200 million  in net revenue as opposed to $1.1 billion. In addition, representatives  from the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators and  the Maryland Motor Vehicle Association told us that if USPS were to  offer state driver\u2019s license services, it would need to invest in  equipment and training. Specifically, USPS would need to purchase  secure computer systems that require multiple electronic interfaces  and train mail clerks to handle complex document verification for  issuing state driver\u2019s licenses in order to meet requirements set by the  REAL ID Act of 2005, among other concerns.", "Limitations on amounts charged. USPS officials and other  stakeholders indicated that the fees charged for some of the  additional nonpostal products and services would be too low to result  in high revenues. For example, USPS officials found there would be  little potential revenue from providing photocopying services or  placing vending machines in retail facilities. Also, NPS officials and  representatives from AFWA told us that current providers of National  Parks and Federal Recreational Lands Passes and state hunting and  fishing licenses generally do not generate much revenue due to the  fee structure. In addition, USPS may or may not charge other entities  a fee for sharing information at retail facilities. For example, USPS\u2019s  partnerships to share information on other government entities\u2019 behalf,  such as providing selective service registration forms and displaying  information for DOJ\u2019s National Crime Victims\u2019 Rights week, do not  generate revenue. Last, any effort to expand community services  would not be intended to generate revenue.", "We have previously reported that foreign posts began offering nonpostal  products and services to increase revenues, such as offering banking or  financial services and making additional government services available in  their retail facilities, but these efforts have had mixed results. Some  foreign postal operators have expanded their financial offerings at retail  facilities and have generated significant revenue from these efforts.

Officials from The Post Office told us this  agreement has not only generated income, but also increased foot  traffic to their retail locations.", "France\u2019s postal operator, La Poste, established a bank in 2005 to  provide a full range of banking products and services through its retail  facilities. According to La Poste, its banking services generated net  revenues of \u20ac5.5 billion in 2018, which was down from \u20ac5.6 billion in  net revenue in 2017.", "However, USPS officials and representatives from banking associations  cautioned that the financial and regulatory infrastructures of other  countries are too different from those of the United States to suggest that  USPS could achieve similar results. In addition, foreign postal operators  are starting to sell their banks or have a franchise model with relatively  lower-paid staff."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Views Varied on Demand and Feasibility; Other Limitations Affect Viability of Nonpostal Services and Products", "paragraphs": ["There were mixed views on whether there would be demand for any or all  of these nonpostal products and services. On the one hand, USPS  officials, officials from other federal government entities, postmasters we  surveyed, and stakeholders generally said that there was little demand for  many of the additional nonpostal products and services USPS could offer  at its facilities. In particular, postmasters did not indicate very high  demand for any of the nine additional nonpostal products or services we  asked about in our survey. The highest response for products and  services in demand was only about 36 percent (53 of 149) of postmasters  who said there was demand for notary services, and the next highest was  about 33 percent (49 of 149) of postmasters who said there was demand  for printing and photocopying services. Also, officials from the 12 federal  government entities noted that while they were open to new partnerships  in which mail clerks perform transactions on their behalf or in which the  entities would have access to retail facility space, officials did not identify many specific examples of a need for such services. None of the  postmasters we surveyed reported that they had been approached by  community members in the last 10 years to share or lease space at their  retail facility.", "On the other hand, based on studies we reviewed and interviews with  representatives from consumer groups, there may be demand for certain  offerings at retail facilities, such as check cashing and payday loan  services, particularly if offered at a lower price than competitors. For  example, in 2014, the Pew Charitable Trusts conducted a nationally  representative survey of 1,626 adults and estimated that only around a  quarter of American adults would be very likely or likely to use certain  financial products, including check cashing, prepaid cards, bill pay, and  small-dollar loans, if offered at USPS retail facilities. However, for those  surveyed who were already using such services, respondents indicated  they would likely obtain these at USPS retail facilities if offered at a lower  price.", "Regarding feasibility, stakeholders and postmasters identified various  issues related to what types of nonpostal products and services made  sense to them. Postmasters indicated that displaying information about  government programs and printing and photocopying services were the  most feasible potential service, about 64 percent (95 of 149) and about 63  percent (96 of 149), respectively. In contrast, postmasters thought  grocery pick-up and public wifi services were the least feasible, with about  78 percent (116 of 149) and 64 percent (96 of 149) of postmasters,  respectively, indicating that they were not feasible. A representative from  one of the employee unions told us that the success of additional  nonpostal efforts would depend on the retail locations\u2019 having adequate  staffing levels. The representative also said that any nonpostal efforts  should be designed to align with community needs and the work that  retail facility employees already conduct. Officials from the Federal  Communications Commission and representatives from a  telecommunications association told us telecommunications companies  may consider leasing space at USPS\u2019s retail facilities that are suitable for  wireless antennas to help build out 5G networks, subject to network  design and business needs. In addition, representatives from one state  motor vehicle administrator told us state motor vehicle administrations  may consider partnering with USPS to provide state vehicle tag and title  services on their behalf, such services, would not require substantial  investment for USPS to undertake.", "Finally, USPS officials, federal government entities, and postmasters we  surveyed, and stakeholders identified a variety of other limitations that  would affect the viability of nonpostal products and services. We found  that these limitations included limited interest for partnerships from other  federal government entities, the size and unfavorable characteristics of  retail facility space, complexities related to existing regulatory structures  and entering into new markets, and personnel concerns. Examples of  these limitations are described in table 5. Moreover, we also asked  postmasters what challenges would prevent their selected retail facility  from offering these additional nonpostal products and services. The most  commonly cited challenges were insufficient staff or the need for  additional staff training, particularly for notary services, driver\u2019s license or  other state license services, financial services, and banking services.", "As discussed above, given that these potential nonpostal products and  services may have benefits but face concerns about their viability, USPS  and policy makers need to consider the benefits, costs, and limitations of  potential nonpostal efforts before introducing new efforts. In particular,  though some efforts could create benefits like enhanced access for  consumers, a variety of challenges may limit revenue generation in such  a way that the potential offerings are unlikely to significantly improve  USPS\u2019s financial condition.

We also  used the term \u201cnonpostal\u201d to refer to activities that are not directly related  to mail delivery. We selected 2008 to begin our analysis because that  was when new restrictions on nonpostal services took effect.", "To describe the costs, revenues, and non-revenue benefits of USPS\u2019s  retail facilities, we reviewed USPS\u2019s financial analyses of its retail network  from fiscal years 2017 and 2018, the only years USPS conducted such  analyses at the time we published this report. For these analyses, USPS  identified the sources and amounts of retail facility costs (e.g., personnel,  rent, and utilities) and revenues (e.g., stamp sales and post office box  rental fees) for most of USPS\u2019s retail facilities. Because some retail  facility costs USPS identified (e.g., rent and personnel) also support non- retail functions, USPS used models to distribute such costs across each  retail facility. USPS\u2019s analyses also calculated the net revenues  (revenues minus costs) for those retail facilities included in its analysis.  Further, USPS examined characteristics of retail facilities, such as the  facilities\u2019 surrounding population densities, to describe factors that may be  related to retail facilities that did or did not achieve positive net revenues.  Based on interviews with USPS officials and USPS documents we  reviewed, we determined the reliability of these analyses were sufficient  to describe costs and revenues of retail facilities. We compared retail  facility costs and revenues with USPS\u2019s total costs and revenues to  determine how much retail facilities contribute to total costs and  revenues. In addition, we identified the number of retail facilities located  in urban, suburban, or rural areas where the revenues did and did not  cover costs. We defined these geographic categories using USPS\u2019s  definitions in its retail facility cost and revenue analysis.", "We also interviewed USPS officials to describe why revenue at retail  facilities may not cover costs. To describe non-revenue benefits of  USPS\u2019s retail facility network, we reviewed relevant publications and  studies, such as those conducted by USPS, USPS\u2019s Office of Inspector  General (OIG), and USPS\u2019s oversight body, the Postal Regulatory  Commission (PRC). We also examined 2018 data from USPS on the  number of customer visits at the retail facilities for which data were  available. Additionally, we interviewed representatives from two  consumer groups, which we selected based on their ability to provide us  with consumer viewpoints on retail facilities and their offerings, and two  organizations representing USPS workers at retail facilities: American  Postal Workers Union (APWU) and United Postmasters and Managers of  America (UPMA).", "To examine the nonpostal efforts USPS has conducted to increase  revenues and non-revenue benefits from its facilities since 2008 and their  results, we first identified nonpostal products and services offered at  USPS\u2019s retail facilities through interviews with USPS officials and reviews  of relevant publications, such as PRC\u2019s report on USPS\u2019s product  offerings and USPS OIG reports. See table 6 for a complete list of USPS  OIG reports we reviewed. We also identified the number of retail facilities  that offered each identified nonpostal product and service, where data  was available, using USPS\u2019s facility data from November 2019, as well as  information from USPS\u2019s Inspection Service on facilities that participated  in the Department of Justice\u2019s Office of Victim\u2019s National Crime Victims\u2019  Rights week. Because USPS\u2019s facility data included facilities without retail  functions, we merged these with data from USPS\u2019s fiscal year 2018  financial analysis of its retail network to ensure we included only facilities  with retail functions. To describe the revenues of the nonpostal products  and services we identified, we reviewed data from USPS\u2019s fiscal year  2018 financial analysis of its retail network. We also reviewed USPS  OIG reports to identify indirect ways that nonpostal products and services  can contribute to revenue at retail facilities.", "To identify the costs of these activities, for which information was  available, we reviewed USPS\u2019s fiscal year 2018 Annual Compliance  Report, PRC\u2019s fiscal year 2018 Annual Compliance Determination  Report, and non-public data provided to us by USPS. From these  reports, we also determined whether the revenue USPS generated from  these nonpostal efforts did or did not exceed costs. We reviewed only  fiscal year 2018\u2019s revenue and costs because we did not have revenue  data prior to fiscal year 2017 and USPS was unable to provide  information on trends.", "As one of the nonpostal efforts USPS can currently take at its retail  facilities includes leasing space for revenue, we reviewed USPS\u2019s data on  the amount of vacant rentable space for fiscal years 2017 and 2018 (the  only available years), on tenants at its facilities as of January 2020, and  on the amount of revenue USPS collected from its leased space from  2018. Based on interviews with USPS officials and USPS documents we  reviewed, we determined the reliability of these data were sufficient to  describe USPS\u2019s efforts and results of leasing excess space at retail  facilities. To obtain stakeholder views on USPS\u2019s nonpostal efforts,  including the costs, revenues, non-revenue benefits, and challenges of  these efforts, we interviewed officials from six federal government entities  that partnered with USPS on initiatives as well as representatives from  APWU, UPMA, and two consumer groups. See table 7 for a complete  listing of the entities we interviewed. We also interviewed officials from  the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA), which leases space on  behalf of USPS to other federal government entities, and the Association  of United States Postal Lessors, which represents entities that lease  space to USPS. We also interviewed postal stakeholders at three retail  facilities that had vacant leasable space, leased space to other entities, or  offered nonpostal products and services. We selected these locations to  obtain information on a variety of USPS\u2019s current nonpostal efforts.", "To examine the benefits and key considerations of offering additional  nonpostal efforts at USPS retail facilities, we interviewed USPS officials,  postal stakeholders, and postal experts, selected based on prior work;  reviewed prior GAO reports and relevant USPS OIG studies; and  attended a forum exploring community use of USPS\u2019s delivery  infrastructure, including retail facilities. From the studies we reviewed and  stakeholder suggestions, we selected and categorized examples of  nonpostal efforts that were mentioned at least twice. To obtain  stakeholder views on the potential benefits and limitations of such  offerings, we interviewed representatives from consumer, industry, and  state licensing groups. We selected these entities because of their  potential to be affected by USPS offering additional nonpostal products  and services. We also interviewed officials from the six federal entities  that have partnered with USPS on initiatives and an additional six federal  government entities that could potentially establish expanded or new  partnerships with USPS. See table 7 above for a complete listing of the  entities we interviewed. We also interviewed two foreign postal  operators\u2014France\u2019s La Poste and the United Kingdom\u2019s Post Office\u2014 that have experience with nonpostal products and services similar to  those we reviewed and reviewed relevant documentation, such as their  annual fiscal year 2018 financial reports. We selected these postal  operators based on prior work and other studies and to provide us with  insight into their experiences. Finally, we reviewed statutes, including the  Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act (PAEA); regulations; and  legal rulings, to evaluate USPS\u2019s current legal authority to provide these  services.

Specifically, we conducted a non-generalizable,  web-based survey of postmasters who managed retail facilities located in  urban, suburban, and rural areas from August to September 2019. We  defined these geographic categories using USPS\u2019s definitions, as  described above. Using the dataset of facilities from the USPS revenue  study, we removed all facilities that were located in an overseas American  territory, any facility missing a geographic category code, and certain  kinds of facilities that were not relevant to the survey. Using these filters  we identified a sample frame of 26,600 retail facilities. We randomly  sorted the facilities within each of the three geographic categories and  took the first 150 from each random sort. We then matched the selected  USPS facilities with the postmaster responsible for them, using USPS\u2019s  postmaster data provided to us in May of 2019. Because postmasters  may manage more than one retail facility, we capped the number of  surveys an individual postmaster could receive at one. If a postmaster  already selected in the random sort occurred again the selected facility  was omitted from the sample. We restricted the total sample size to no  more than 100 unique postmasters within each stratum. The sample is  comprised of 83 postmasters who oversee an urban retail facility, 100  postmasters who oversee a suburban retail facility, and 100 postmasters  who oversee a rural retail facility. Approximately 52 percent of our  sample\u2014or 146 postmasters\u2014completed the survey.

To help reduce measurement error, we consulted an  experienced former postmaster for input on the development of the  survey instrument, and also conducted pretests of the draft questionnaire  with four postmasters drawn from the intended survey population. The  questionnaire was modified throughout development and pretesting to  improve clarity of the questions, and we removed questions when our  modifications were unable to remedy observed difficulties in  interpretation.
