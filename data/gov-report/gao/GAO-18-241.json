The project has faced persistent challenges, including quality assurance problems that have delayed it by decades and more than tripled its costs, to nearly $17 billion. DOE's quality assurance framework aims to ensure that all problems are identified and do not recur.", "Senate Report 114-49 accompanying the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 included a provision for GAO to carry out an ongoing evaluation of the WTP. This first report examines (1) the actions DOE has taken to identify and address WTP quality assurance problems, (2) the extent to which DOE has ensured that quality assurance problems have been identified and do not recur, and (3) the extent to which DOE's organizational structure at ORP provides the Quality Assurance Division with independence to effectively oversee the contractor's quality assurance program. GAO reviewed DOE documents and obtained the insights of ORP's internal experts on WTP quality assurance efforts and outcomes."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Energy (DOE) has taken several actions to identify and address quality assurance problems at the Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant (WTP) at its Hanford site in Washington. Among the actions taken is the implementation of the Managed Improvement Plan by DOE's Office of River Protection (ORP) and the WTP contactor. The plan is intended to ensure that the WTP can operate in compliance with DOE-approved safety and quality requirements. The contractor has stated that the plan is fully implemented, but GAO found that a number of key activities may be incomplete and ORP officials will not be able to verify the extent of implementation until December 2018.", "According to DOE documents that GAO reviewed and ORP quality assurance experts GAO spoke with, ORP has not ensured that all WTP quality assurance problems have been identified and some previously identified problems are recurring. For example, a 2016 DOE report found quality assurance problems, such as engineering errors and construction deficiencies, that neither ORP nor the contractor had identified when the work was conducted. ORP quality assurance experts GAO spoke with reiterated the issues identified in reports. In addition, DOE audits have found that previously identified quality assurance problems have recurred in key areas, such as the procurement of items that do not meet requirements or perform as specified. These problems were also raised by several of the ORP quality assurance experts GAO interviewed. According to these experts, such recurring problems may lead to significant rework at WTP facilities in the future if work is not stopped and the issues addressed. ORP's quality assurance framework requires the contractor to determine the extent to which quality assurance problems exist in all WTP structures, systems, and components when such problems are identified, and allows ORP to stop work at a facility if recurring issues arise. However, ORP has neither directed the contractor to make this determination nor stopped work when problems recur because it has confidence in the Managed Improvement Plan.", "ORP's organizational structure may not provide its Quality Assurance Division with sufficient independence from the office's upper management to oversee the contractor's quality assurance program effectively. GAO has previously found that an oversight organization should be structurally distinct and separate from program offices responsible for cost and schedule performance to avoid conflict between mission objectives and safety. However, a 2017 DOE headquarters assessment found that ORP's Quality Assurance Division's effectiveness has been limited. This is because in some cases ORP upper management had mischaracterized its findings, and in other instances, ORP upper management had not used this division to evaluate the extent of potential quality assurance problems. ORP quality assurance experts GAO spoke to were also concerned that ORP's organizational structure does not always ensure the independence of the division. For example, two of these experts described instances when ORP upper management had downgraded the division's findings so that the contractor could take less stringent corrective measures. By providing the Quality Assurance Division adequate independence, DOE can better ensure that compliance with nuclear safety requirements will not be subordinated to other project management goals, such as meeting cost and schedule targets."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DOE direct the WTP contractor to determine the extent of problems in WTP structures, systems, and components and order work stops when problems recur, and DOE should direct ORP to revise its organizational structure to ensure the independence of the Quality Assurance Division.

This waste was  created as a by-product of producing plutonium and other special nuclear  materials for nuclear weapons, starting during World War II and  continuing until the late 1980s. The most hazardous and radioactive  waste is stored in 177 large underground tanks. However, as of January  2017, none of the tank waste had been treated for disposal because the  facilities intended to treat a significant portion of this waste\u2014known  collectively as the Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant (WTP)\u2014 have faced persistent technical and management challenges that have  increased the project\u2019s cost by billions of dollars and added decades to  the waste treatment schedule. Among these challenges, DOE has had  difficulty ensuring that WTP engineering, procurement, and construction  work meets nuclear safety and quality requirements.", "In 2000, DOE awarded a contract to Bechtel National, Incorporated, to  design, construct, and commission the WTP. The WTP is a complex, first- of-a-kind project and is being constructed under a design-build contract.  In the design-build approach, technology development activities, plant  design, and construction occur simultaneously rather than sequentially.", "DOE no longer allows the use of the design-build approach for complex,  first-of-a-kind facilities but has continued to use it for the WTP.", "In December 2012, the WTP Engineering Division of DOE\u2019s Office of  River Protection (ORP) issued a memorandum that recommended that all  activities affecting engineering design, construction, and installation of  structures, systems, and components be stopped because the division  had found that it could not verify that completed work met nuclear safety  and quality requirements. According to the memorandum, stopping work  would help the department avoid future nuclear safety and quality  compromises and substantial rework. Instead of stopping all work at the  WTP, ORP management stopped work only on those facilities that faced  the most significant technical challenges. Around this time, ORP issued  nine \u201cPriority Level One\u201d findings\u2014findings reflecting problems that if  uncorrected could have serious effects on safety, quality, and operability  of a nuclear facility, as well as on the environment, according to ORP\u2019s  quality assurance guidance. Seven of the nine findings were issued by  ORP\u2019s WTP Engineering Division in 2012 and focused on engineering  and nuclear safety. The other two were issued by ORP\u2019s Quality  Assurance Division in 2013 and focused on the contractor\u2019s quality  assurance program.", "Federal regulations require DOE contractors to establish DOE-approved  quality assurance programs. Under an approved quality assurance  program, the contractor must establish and implement processes to  detect and prevent quality problems; identify, control, and correct items,  services, and processes that do not meet established requirements;  identify the causes of problems and work to prevent recurrence as a part  of correcting the problems; and plan and conduct independent  assessments to measure the adequacy of work performance and to  promote improvement. ORP\u2019s two Priority Level One findings related to  quality assurance deficiencies found that the contractor\u2019s quality  assurance program did not effectively ensure that work was being  completed to meet these requirements. Significantly, one of the two  findings concluded that the contractor\u2019s overall quality assurance program  was not fully effective. The other finding concluded that the contractor\u2019s  Corrective Action Program to address quality assurance problems was  not fully effective. Overall, ORP determined that the deficiencies in the  contractor\u2019s quality assurance program were the most serious type\u2014 those that could result in a systemic breakdown in safety or quality or that  could have a serious effect on worker health and safety, the public and  environment, and facility operations.

According to this expert, the  extent of this shortcoming is not known, but fixing it\u2014that is, creating a  complete record of required documentation\u2014may lead to years of delays.", "ORP Quality Assurance Division officials told us that because ORP\u2019s  focus is on ensuring that facilities needed for initial operations will be  ready to operate by December 2023, they have not been directed by ORP  management to focus on identifying all quality assurance problems for  work completed before 2012 for facilities needed for later phases of WTP  operations, such as structures, systems, and components of the  Pretreatment and High-Level Waste Facilities. In addition, they stated that  there may be significant changes to these facilities needed for the WTP\u2019s  later phases, making it unnecessary for them to review the extent of  quality assurance problems until it is known what parts of the facilities will  remain and which parts will not.", "However, similar problems appear to exist in WTP facilities needed for  initial operations. ORP quality assurance experts that we interviewed also  stated that ORP oversight has not always ensured that all quality  assurance problems in facilities needed for the initial WTP operations, or  DFLAW, have been identified. Five experts told us that issues such as  identifying problematic items, services, and processes had not been fully  resolved. Specifically, these ORP quality assurance experts told us that  when quality assurance problems are identified in structures, systems, or  components needed for DFLAW, ORP does not always ensure that the  contractor identifies the extent to which such problems may exist in other  areas affected by the same structures, systems, or components. For  example, an ORP quality assurance expert cited an instance in which an  ORP quality assurance team reviewed a sample of 25 procurement  \u201cpackages\u201d (out of thousands) for a DFLAW facility and identified 143  problems\u2014significantly more problems than the team expected for such a  small sample. Consistent with ORP quality assurance requirements, this  ORP quality assurance expert recommended to ORP upper management  that the contractor determine the extent to which such problems could  affect other structures, systems, and components needed for DFLAW.  However, according to an ORP memo, ORP upper management did not  require the contractor to implement this recommendation, instead citing  \u201cextenuating circumstances\u201d and requiring a lesser corrective action than  what was recommended. Three ORP quality assurance experts told us  that they believe that because problems have not been comprehensively  assessed, there may be equipment and systems within DFLAW that will  fail to meet their intended functions.", "We also found that although ORP conducted its vertical slice audit in  2017 to test its compensatory measures and the MIP to improve quality  assurance, the audit report notes that it was focused on only one system  within the Low-Activity Waste Facility. According to ORP officials, there  are numerous structures, systems, and components in facilities needed  for DFLAW that have not been audited or reviewed in a manner similar to  the vertical slice audit. Both the contractor\u2019s and ORP\u2019s quality assurance  programs require that corrective actions to address significant problems  with the quality of the work include a determination of the extent to which  the problematic conditions exist as well as the underlying causes of those  conditions. Until ORP requires the WTP contractor to determine the full  extent to which problems exist in all WTP structures, systems, and  components, DOE lacks a comprehensive understanding of all potential  quality assurance problems at all WTP facilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Previously Identified Quality Assurance Problems Are Recurring", "paragraphs": ["DOE requires its program offices, such as ORP, and contractors to have  oversight processes to ensure that quality assurance problems are  evaluated and corrected in a timely basis to prevent recurrence. However,  several DOE documents we reviewed show that previously identified  quality assurance problems have recurred in recent years, including the  following:  In 2015, an ORP audit report identified recurring weaknesses in  quality assurance for the contractor\u2019s process for procuring  commercial items for use in a nuclear facility. For example, ORP  found that the contractor\u2019s internal controls for this process were not  consistently performed; did not consistently comply with procedural  requirements; and, in many cases, did not establish reasonable  assurance that procured systems, services, and components acquired  from 2010 to 2014 would perform their intended safety functions.", "In a 2015 report on the design and operability of key systems and  components for the Low-Activity Waste Facility, ORP found that the  quality of computer systems software was not in full compliance with  DOE requirements, leading to conditions where personnel and the  environment may not be adequately protected. ORP had identified a  similar problem in 2008, when it found that the contractor\u2019s computer  programs used in engineering calculations were not always verified to  show that they produced correct solutions within defined limits for all  parameters, as required by the contractor\u2019s quality assurance manual.  ORP had also previously identified WTP computer software quality  problems in 2010 when it issued a Priority Level Two finding on  software procedures and another Priority Level Two finding on  software testing.", "In 2017, ORP\u2019s Quality Assurance Division issued a report that  examined the contractor\u2019s quality assurance program and found  problems in quality assurance areas that had been previously  identified. The report noted that in 6 of 19 quality assurance  program areas, the contractor\u2019s performance was marginal\u2014and in  need of improvement\u2014or indeterminate. These 6 areas included  identifying, controlling, and correcting items, services, and processes  that do not meet established requirements; maintaining items to  prevent damage, loss, or deterioration; and procuring items and  services that meet established requirements and perform as specified.", "ORP quality assurance experts that we spoke with also stated that  previously identified quality assurance problems are recurring, including  some in areas where the contractor had implemented corrective  measures. These quality assurance experts told us that quality assurance  problems are recurring in several key areas, including those areas  identified in the documents described above: (1) procurement of items  and services that do not meet established requirements or perform as  specified; (2) software that does not meet established requirements; and  (3) a maintenance program that does not prevent damage, loss, or  deterioration of WTP structures, systems, and components. For example,  see the following.", "Procurement of items and services that do not meet requirements or  perform as specified. Four out of the five ORP quality assurance  experts we interviewed who had recent experience with the  procurement of items and services told us that problems with  procured items and services that do not meet established  requirements or perform as specified are not fully resolved. One of  these ORP quality assurance experts stated that an ORP team  recently reviewed a random sample of 45 of the roughly 30,000  procurements the contractor had made for the WTP and identified a  number of instances where materials did not meet requirements,  which resulted in one Priority Level Two finding\u2014which represents a  serious issue that indicates an adverse condition, such as a  noncompliance or breakdown of a management system\u2014and five  Priority Level Three findings. The expert noted that this was many  more deficiencies than the team expected for such a small sample.", "Settlement of Allegations of Contractors  Knowingly Mischarging Costs at the Waste  Treatment and Immobilization Plant (WTP)  In November 2016, the WTP contractor and  certain subcontractors agreed to pay $125  million to resolve allegations under the False  Claims Act that they made false statements  and claims to the Department of Energy (DOE)  by charging DOE for deficient nuclear quality  materials, services, and testing that were  provided to the WTP at DOE\u2019s Hanford Site.  The contract required materials, testing, and  services to meet certain nuclear quality  standards. The Department of Justice alleged  that the defendants violated the False Claims  Act by charging the government the cost of  complying with these standards when they  failed to do so. In particular, the Department of  Justice alleged that the defendants improperly  billed the government for materials and  services from vendors that did not meet quality  control requirements, for piping and waste  vessels that did not meet quality standards,  and for testing from vendors that did not have  compliant quality programs. As part of the  settlement, the contractors admitted no  wrongdoing, and the United States did not  concede that its claims were not well founded.", "Software that does not meet requirements. ORP quality assurance  experts told us that problems are recurring in certain areas where  items and processes do not meet requirements, such as computer  software quality assurance, despite the contractor developing two MIP  corrective measures in this area. Two ORP quality assurance experts  reported that problems with software quality are recurring. One ORP  quality assurance expert added that the contractor often fails to  develop software quality documentation that is needed to demonstrate  compliance with quality requirements when permitting facilities for  operation. As a result, the contractor will have to re-create this  documentation at some cost.", "A maintenance program that does not prevent damage, loss, or  deterioration. Each of the three ORP quality assurance experts with  knowledge in this area told us that the contractor had not established  a fully effective WTP maintenance program, particularly for the  Pretreatment and High-Level Waste Facilities, and as a result,  structures, systems, and components at these facilities have  deteriorated and been damaged. Such statements are consistent  with findings of the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board, which  reported in April 2016 that systems and components stored in an  outdoor storage yard were not properly covered and showed signs of  being affected by water, sand, or animals. In March 2016, ORP  reported significant water intrusion into several areas of the High- Level Waste Facility. As a result, some of the facility\u2019s structures,  systems, and components had deteriorated and will require costly  rework. The contractor notified DOE in April 2017 that because DOE\u2019s  focus is on completing facilities needed for initial WTP operations, it  would submit a proposal to change the WTP contract to account for  the increased scope, cost, and schedule of long-term maintenance,  storage, and management of procured and partially installed  structures, systems, and components at those facilities not needed for  initial WTP operations.", "Consistent with its quality assurance procedures, ORP can use its  authorities\u2014such as those under the Consent Order and its quality  assurance policy\u2014to stop work if corrective measures do not prevent  quality assurance problems from recurring. However, ORP has not used  such authorities. ORP senior officials told us that they did not consider it  necessary to stop work because of the recurrence of problems in certain  areas because they plan to evaluate the extent of the contractor\u2019s  implementation of MIP corrective measures over the next year and have  allowed work to continue because they believe that the contractor\u2019s  quality assurance program is generally adequate. Without directing ORP  to use its authorities to stop work in areas where quality assurance  problems are recurring until it can verify that the problems are corrected  and will not recur, DOE may face future rework that could increase costs  and schedule delays for the WTP."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "ORP\u2019s Organizational Structure May Not Provide Sufficient Independence for Effective Oversight of the WTP Contractor\u2019s Quality Assurance Program", "paragraphs": ["A 2017 assessment from DOE headquarters and our interviews with nine  ORP quality assurance experts suggest that ORP\u2019s organizational  structure does not provide the quality assurance function with sufficient  independence from upper management\u2014which includes the ORP  Manager and the WTP Federal Project Director\u2014to effectively oversee  the contractor\u2019s quality assurance program. Our prior work has found that  to be independent, an oversight organization should be structurally  distinct and separate from program offices responsible for achieving the  program\u2019s mission to avoid management interference or conflict between  program office mission objectives and safety. At ORP, however, the  Quality Assurance Division is not fully separate and independent from the  upper management of the WTP project, which manages cost and  schedule performance. We believe that such a structure has the potential  to create a conflict of interest.", "Specifically, we found that ORP\u2019s Quality Assurance Division performs  assessments of the contractor\u2019s quality assurance program, among other  things, and reports its findings to ORP upper management, including the  ORP Manager, who has the discretion to determine whether and to what  extent to require the contractor to take action in response to findings.  When quality assurance issues are identified, ORP upper management  must balance its mission of meeting cost and schedule targets with its  responsibility to ensure that nuclear safety and quality standards are met.  However, these are two potentially conflicting responsibilities because  meeting WTP cost and schedule targets may be threatened if serious  quality assurance problems are identified.", "A February 2017 external assessment from DOE headquarters noted that  ORP\u2019s Quality Assurance Division\u2019s effectiveness has been limited  because, in some instances, its findings have been mischaracterized by  ORP upper management, and in others, ORP upper management has not  used this division effectively to evaluate the extent of potential quality  assurance problems. This assessment found that ORP had not  performed adequate oversight of the contractor\u2019s MIP and that some  critical quality assurance areas were not receiving the necessary scrutiny  from ORP. Further, the assessment found that ORP management  sometimes mischaracterized the seriousness of the Quality Assurance  Division\u2019s findings and, as a result, did not require the contractor to  conduct extent-of-condition review for significant quality assurance  problems. While this assessment stated that ORP had an effective quality  assurance program, it concluded that three of the eight quality assurance  areas the assessment team reviewed were not fully effective, including  ORP\u2019s ability to conduct assessments of the contractor\u2019s quality  assurance program.", "A Cautionary Tale: Quality Assurance  Problems Doom Commercial Nuclear  Power Plant  In the commercial nuclear industry, there is a  notable example of a construction project that  faced significant quality assurance challenges.  In the 1970s and early 1980s, Cincinnati Gas  & Electric attempted to construct a commercial  nuclear power plant, known as the Zimmer  Plant, near Moscow, Ohio. After 10 years of  construction and more than $2 billion spent,  the company abandoned its effort to construct  the plant. An independent review mandated by  the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in 1982  concluded that several issues impeded  successful construction of the Zimmer Plant as  a commercial nuclear power plant. These  issues included (1) the company\u2019s failure to  elevate its commitment to quality and quality  assurance to an equal status with cost and  schedule, (2) the regulator\u2019s failure to hold the  company accountable for quality in design and  construction, and (3) the company\u2019s  inadequate quality assurance procedures. To  recoup some of the $2 billion spent in  attempting to construct this commercial  nuclear power plant, Cincinnati Gas & Electric  later converted facilities built at the site for use  in a coal-fired power plant. management and the contractor place cost and schedule performance  above identifying and resolving quality assurance issues. One quality  assurance expert specified that ORP\u2019s culture does not encourage  staff to identify quality assurance problems or ineffective corrective  measures. This expert said that people who discover problems are  not rewarded; rather, their findings are met with resistance, which has  created a culture where quality assurance staff are hesitant to identify  quality assurance problems or problems with corrective measures.  This expert added that quality assurance is subordinate to cost and  schedule\u2014that is, senior managers responsible for approving quality  assurance findings are more concerned with whether WTP  construction meets schedule milestones than identifying and resolving  quality assurance issues. This expert compared the WTP to the  Zimmer Power Plant\u2014a power plant in Ohio that was designed to be  a nuclear power plant but that was never licensed because of  unresolved quality assurance problems and a focus on schedule over  construction quality.", "As stated earlier, in October 2008, we identified key elements that any  nuclear safety oversight organization should have in order for it to provide  effective independent oversight. For example, we found that an  organization should be structurally distinct and separate from DOE  program offices to avoid management interference or conflict between  program office mission objectives, such as cost and schedule  performance and safety. We also found that the organization should have  sufficient authority to require program offices to effectively address its  findings and recommendations.", "ORP\u2019s Assistant Manager for Technical and Regulatory Support and ORP  senior quality assurance staff told us that ORP\u2019s organizational structure  ensures that the quality assurance function is sufficiently independent of  ORP management. These officials and the ORP Quality Assurance  Program Description state that the Quality Assurance Division is  structured to report directly to the ORP Assistant Manager for Technical  and Regulatory Support and the ORP Manager. They also cited the ORP  Quality Assurance Program policy, which states that the Quality  Assurance Division has the authority and overall responsibility to  independently audit the contractor\u2019s quality assurance program to verify  the achievement of quality. According to these officials, this organizational  structure ensures independence from cost and schedule considerations  and ensures objectivity in quality assurance evaluations, and they added  that the ORP Manager evaluates differing opinions without any  hindrances or organizational bias.", "Given that some previously identified problems are recurring at the WTP,  including some in areas where the contractor had implemented corrective  measures, and given the findings of the 2017 headquarters assessment  and the statements of ORP\u2019s quality assurance experts outlined above,  we are concerned that ORP\u2019s organizational structure may not entirely  ensure that the Quality Assurance Division meets key elements for a  nuclear safety oversight organization to provide effective independent  oversight. According to ORP reports and officials, in ORP\u2019s current  organizational structure, upper level management retains discretion in  how to resolve quality assurance problems. As a result, the Quality  Assurance Division does not have sufficient authority to ensure that its  findings are addressed and its recommendations are implemented.

Upon  learning in 2012 that it could not verify that engineering, procurement, and  construction at the WTP met nuclear safety and quality requirements,  ORP directed the contractor to implement quality assurance corrective  measures to ensure that problems would be identified and prevented from  recurring. However, 5 years later, the contractor has not fully  implemented all planned corrective measures. Moreover, in some areas  where the contractor has stated that corrective measures are now in  place, ORP continues to encounter quality assurance problems similar to  those it encountered in the past. When and where problems have  recurred, ORP has not always required the contractor to determine the  extent to which the problems may affect all parts of the WTP. By directing  ORP to require the WTP contractor, where quality assurance problems  have been identified, to determine the full extent to which problems exist  in all WTP structures, systems, and components, DOE will gain a  comprehensive understanding of all quality assurance problems at all  WTP facilities. In addition, ORP has not always used its authorities to  stop work when problems are detected before they are fully corrected.  Without directing ORP to use its authorities to stop work in areas where  quality assurance problems are recurring until it can verify that the  problems are corrected and will not recur, DOE may face future rework  that could increase costs and schedule delays for the WTP.", "Also of concern is the potential lack of sufficient independence of ORP\u2019s  Quality Assurance Division from ORP\u2019s upper management. This has  resulted in ORP upper management not always allowing its own experts  to fully examine the contractor\u2019s work even when problems have recurred.  At other times, this has resulted in the significance of identified  problems\u2014and strength of associated corrective measures\u2014being  reduced. DOE\u2019s ability to effectively self-regulate a high-hazard nuclear  facility not only depends on vigorous oversight of the contractor by the  program office but also on active oversight by an independent group. The  WTP is the largest and most technically complex cleanup project  managed by DOE, and we recognize that meeting its cost and schedule  targets places immense pressure on ORP upper management. However,  meeting those targets is further threatened when quality assurance  problems are downgraded.
