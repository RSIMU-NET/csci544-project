In April 2000, GAO recommended that the Service issue BCRS cost-recovery regulations and make available cost data and analyses to provide postal ratepayers assurance they were not involuntarily subsidizing BCRS costs. The Service issued regulations in July 2000, but it has not yet submitted the recommended data and analyses to Congress. Service officials attributed the lack of providing Congress with this information to administrative oversight and other factors, but said they would provide Congress with this information as soon as practicable. In 2001, the Service amended its BCRS regulations stating that cost-recovery determinations would be made using baseline costs for comparable commemorative stamps. GAO, however, is concerned that the regulations can be interpreted as not requiring the Service to provide for baseline comparisons for certain BCRS costs, e.g., printing, sales, and distribution, although the Stamp Out Breast Cancer Act states that reasonable costs attributable to the BCRS in these areas should be recouped. The Service has not established baseline costs for these categories. Without these baselines, the Service lacks assurance that it is identifying and recouping excess costs from BCRS surcharge revenue. The BCRS continues to be an effective means of raising funds for breast cancer research. Sales have fluctuated, but the BCRS has raised over $30 million for research since it was issued in July 1998. NIH and DOD--recipients of research funds generated by the BCRS--are not subject to the same statutory reporting requirements as agencies that are to receive funds generated by semipostals issued under the Semipostal Authorization Act. Such agencies are required to submit an annual report to Congress on the amount of funds received, how the funds were used, and accomplishments.

There are more than 2 million women  today in the United States who have been diagnosed with breast cancer,  and it has been reported that another 1 million women do not know they  have it. Annually, nearly $7 billion is spent on the treatment of breast  cancer. Given these statistics, the importance of research to find a cure for  breast cancer cannot be over emphasized. In the past 5 years alone, the  federal government has spent about $3 billion on breast cancer research.  To supplement these federal dollars, Congress passed legislation creating  the Breast Cancer Research Semipostal (BCRS) to increase public  awareness of the disease and allow the public to participate directly in  raising funds for such research.", "This report, mandated by Congress, is a follow-up to our April 2000 report  on the Postal Service\u2019s Breast Cancer Research Semipostal. The Stamp Out  Breast Cancer Act, Public Law 105-41, August 13, 1997, mandated our 2000  report. The act required that we issue a report to Congress on the BCRS\u2019s  effectiveness and appropriateness and the U.S. Postal Service\u2019s (the  Service) costs associated with carrying out the act. In general, we reported  that the BCRS had been an effective fund-raiser, and most of the public and  key stakeholders viewed the BCRS as an appropriate way of raising funds  for a nonpostal purpose. We expressed some concerns, however, about the  Service\u2019s identification and recovery of costs associated with carrying out  the act.", "Soon after we issued our April 2000 BCRS report, Congress enacted the  Semipostal Authorization Act, Public Law 106-253, dated July 28, 2000.  Among other things, the act requires that we update Congress on the BCRS  and address at least the same matters we addressed in our earlier report.  This report responds to that mandate and addresses   the monetary and other resources the Service has expended in operating  and administering the BCRS program,  the effectiveness of using the BCRS as a means of fund-raising, and   the appropriateness of using the BCRS as a means of fund-raising.", "We also provide information on the status of recommendations made to the  Postmaster General in our April 2000 BCRS report. In essence, we  recommended that the Service issue regulations formalizing its criteria for  making BCRS cost-recovery decisions and make BCRS cost data and  analyses available to assure postal ratepayers that they were not  involuntarily contributing funds to breast cancer research.", "The BCRS was the first semipostal ever issued by the Postal Service. It  currently sells for 45 cents, and is valid for the 37-cent, First-Class postage  rate, leaving 8 cents as surcharge revenue. The Stamp Out Breast Cancer  Act provides that the Service is to deduct from the surcharge revenue its  reasonable costs incurred in carrying out the act. In general, the Service  has interpreted reasonable costs to mean costs incurred that are over and  above the costs normally incurred with a comparable commemorative  stamp. After deducting its reasonable costs, the Service is to remit the  remaining proceeds from the BCRS surcharge revenue to the National  Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Department of Defense (DOD) for breast  cancer research. Seventy percent of the net proceeds go to NIH, with the  remaining 30 percent going to DOD\u2019s medical research program.", "The use of semipostals to raise funds for specific purposes is on the rise.  Since our April 2000 BCRS report, Congress has twice extended the sales  period for the BCRS, required the introduction of two more semipostals,  and given the Service specific authority to consider and issue future  semipostals. Additionally, as of August 2003, Congress was considering  legislation that would require introduction of two more semipostals and  extend the sales period of the BCRS past its scheduled end date of  December 31, 2003.", "In doing this work, we reviewed and updated the information included in  our April 2000 BCRS report to reflect the current situation. For this report,  we mainly focused on the Service\u2019s efforts to identify and recoup its  reasonable costs from the BCRS surcharge revenue and ensure that postal  ratepayers were not subsidizing the BCRS. We also identified postal staff  resources devoted to the BCRS and interviewed key stakeholders regarding  the effectiveness and appropriateness of using the BCRS as a means of  fund raising. Additionally, we commissioned a survey to obtain the public\u2019s  opinion regarding the BCRS, and semipostals in general; and we  interviewed NIH and DOD officials about how funds generated from BCRS  sales are being used for breast cancer research.

The act  stipulated that the BCRS surcharge was not to exceed 25 percent of the  First-Class postage rate, which, at the time of issuance, was 32 cents. The  act further stipulated that after recovering its reasonable costs, the Service  was to transfer 70 percent of the remaining surcharge revenue to NIH and  30 percent to DOD for breast cancer research. The Service\u2019s presidentially  appointed governors initially set the price of the BCRS at 40 cents\u201432  cents for First-Class postage plus the maximum 25-percent surcharge of  8 cents.

L. 107-67,  Nov. 12, 2001) further extended the sales period for the BCRS and  established new requirements governing the sales price of the BCRS. That  act extended the BCRS\u2019 sales period through December 31, 2003, and  replaced the maximum 25 percent surcharge with a minimum 15 percent  surcharge that, when added to the First-Class postage rate, is evenly  divisible by five. That is, the BCRS must be sold for an amount evenly  divisible by five and must cost at least 15 percent more than First-Class  postage. Specifically, the BCRS is currently sold for 45 cents, which is  evenly divisible by 5; with the 8-cent surcharge, it costs about 22 percent  more than the 37-cent First-Class postage rate. Additional legislation is  currently pending that would extend the sales period for the BCRS through  December 31, 2005.", "Since the BCRS was issued in 1998, Congress has passed legislation  establishing two additional semipostals.

In July 2000, the Service issued a  revision to its Administrative Support Manual (ASM) that specified a  \u201cCost Recovery Policy for the Breast Cancer Research Semipostal Stamp.\u201d  The ASM provisions, which are viewed by the Service as part of its  regulations, specified that the Service was to recover BCRS costs that are  determined to be incremental costs from its surcharge revenue. The  regulations described some types of costs that the Service had determined  to be incremental to the BCRS. Examples of such costs included (1) design  and production costs in excess of the cost to produce equivalent stamps;  (2) packaging costs in excess of the cost to package equivalent stamps; and  (3) printing costs for items other than stamps that are specific to the BCRS,  such as flyers and special receipts.", "In June 2001, the Service published in the Federal Register its regulations  covering semipostals issued under the Semipostal Authorization Act.  Among those regulations was 39 C.F.R. 551.8, which established  procedures for determining costs to be offset from semipostal differential  revenue. On December 27, 2001, the Postal Service published a similar  version of this regulation in section 645 of the ASM. The ASM regulations  were made applicable to semipostals issued under the Semipostal  Authorization Act, as well as the BCRS. The December 2001 revision to the  ASM (hereafter referred to as regulations) no longer refer to \u201cincremental  costs,\u201d as was done in the July 2000 version. The December 2001  regulations state that the Service is to recover BCRS costs that are  determined to be in excess of the costs normally incurred for  commemorative stamps having similar sales; physical characteristics; and  marketing, promotional, and public relations activities. These regulations  prescribe that on the basis of judgment and available information, the  Service is to identify stamp(s) comparable with the BCRS and create a  profile of selected cost characteristics, thereby establishing a baseline for cost comparison purposes. According to the regulations, BCRS costs that  exceed the baseline costs for comparable commemorative stamps are to be  recovered from the BCRS\u2019 surcharge revenue. In May 2003, we asked the  Service to provide us the baseline costs for the comparable stamps being  used to determine what costs are to be recovered from the BCRS\u2019  surcharge revenue. In July 2003, the Service provided us with what it  referred to as costs above comparable stamp costs that were recouped  from the BCRS\u2019 surcharge revenue and updated that information in August  2003. However, the Service did not provide us with the actual baselines  used in making the determinations about which costs were to be recouped  from the BCRS\u2019 surcharge revenue.", "The Service\u2019s December 2001 regulations provide guidance regarding its  BCRS cost-recovery criteria. The regulations state that cost items  recoverable from the BCRS\u2019 surcharge revenue may include, but are not  limited to, the following:   packaging costs in excess of the cost to package comparable stamps,  printing costs of flyers and special receipts,  costs of changes to equipment,  costs of developing and executing marketing and promotional plans in  excess of the cost for comparable stamps, and  other costs specific to the BCRS that would not normally have been  incurred for comparable stamps.", "In addition, the Service\u2019s regulations state that BCRS costs that meet the  following criteria will not be tracked:  costs that the Service determines to be inconsequentially small, which  include those cost items not exceeding $3,000 per invoice;  costs for which the cost of tracking would be burdensome (e.g., costs  for which the cost of tracking exceeds the cost to be tracked);  costs attributable to mail to which the BCRS is affixed (i.e., costs that  are attributable to the appropriate class and/or subclass of mail); and  administrative and support costs that the Service would have incurred  whether or not the BCRS program had been established.", "The regulations further identify the following BCRS costs\u2014those the  Service would normally incur for comparable stamps\u2014as recovered  through the First-Class postage portion of the BCRS stamp price.

Section 414 (c) (2) of the act states that the Service must recover  from the BCRS\u2019 surcharge revenue \u201can amount sufficient to cover  reasonable costs . . . in carrying out this section, including those  attributable to the printing, sale, and distribution of stamps under this  section.\u201d The Service has determined, and we have no basis to challenge its  discretion in this regard, that \u201creasonable costs\u201d are costs in excess of  those normally incurred for a comparable stamp. However, we are  concerned that the regulations the Service issued to implement this  requirement can be interpreted as not requiring the Service to provide  baseline comparisons for certain BCRS costs, e.g., printing, sales, and  distribution, although the Stamp Out Breast Cancer Act specifically states  that reasonable costs in these areas attributable to the BCRS should be  recouped from the BCRS\u2019 surcharge revenue. Our concerns with the  regulations include the following: BCRS printing costs: The Service\u2019s December 2001 regulations can be  interpreted as not requiring baseline comparisons for BCRS printing costs.  The regulations could be interpreted to mean that all BCRS printing costs  are covered by the First-Class postage portion and comparisons with  baseline costs are not necessary. This interpretation is supported by the  fact that, as of August 2003, the Service had not established a baseline cost  for comparable stamps against which to compare BCRS printing costs. The  Service did, however, provide information showing that the BCRS\u2019 printing  costs between 1998 and 2003 ranged from $3.35 per thousand stamps to  $7.39 per thousand. The Service also provided information on printing  costs for the three stamps that it considers comparable with the BCRS. The  printing costs for these three stamps ranged from $11.52 per thousand in  1999 to $14.34 per thousand in 1997. Additionally, the Service provided  printing costs for various commemorative stamps in 1998 through 2002.  That information would tend to support the view that printing costs for the  BCRS have not exceeded the printing costs for other commemoratives.  Nevertheless, the Service did not establish a baseline for making BCRS  printing cost comparisons. Therefore, the Service has not demonstrated  that its regulations establish an adequate process for ensuring that excess  semipostal costs are identified and recouped from surcharge revenues.  Following its regulations, the Service reported that it did not recoup from  the BCRS\u2019 surcharge revenue any of the $3,597,000 it incurred in BCRS  printing costs. Without a comparison between actual BCRS printing costs  and the baseline printing costs for comparable stamps, the Service lacks  assurance that it is identifying and recouping excess costs from BCRS  surcharge revenue.", "BCRS sales costs: The Service\u2019s December 2001 regulations can be  interpreted as not requiring baseline comparisons for BCRS sales costs.  The regulations can be interpreted to mean that all BCRS sales costs are  covered by the First-Class postage portion and comparisons with baseline  costs are not necessary. As of August 2003, the Service had not established  a baseline cost for comparable stamps against which to compare BCRS  sales costs. Unlike BCRS printing costs, the Service reported that it did not  track BCRS sales costs because they were \u201cminimal,\u201d but it was unable to  provide documentation supporting this position. The Service has reported  that the BCRS was available for sale at over 27,000 post offices across the  country, where salaries and benefits for its clerks average about $30 per  hour. Service officials told us that no staff were hired for the BCRS  program nor were any staff dedicated full-time to work on the program.  However, the Service commented in July 2003 that each semipostal  generates sales costs that it would not incur for commemorative stamps,  such as time spent responding to customer questions about the fund-raising  involved. In addition, the Service has reported that stamp sales costs are 24  cents per dollar for stamps sold at the window, compared with 14 cents for  stamps sold at vending machines. However, the Service has more recently  taken the position that stamp sales costs are substantially less than  previously calculated. In September 2003, the Service was in the process of  reviewing its stamp sales costs, but revised stamp sales figures were not  yet available. Therefore, it is unclear whether the Service has incurred sales  costs for the BCRS that are greater than those incurred for comparable  commemorative stamps. Without a comparison between actual or  estimated BCRS sales costs and the baseline sales costs for comparable  stamps, the Service lacks assurance that it is identifying and recouping  excess costs from surcharge revenue.", "In addition to these examples, we have similar concerns regarding other  BCRS costs that are being handled in a manner similar to that described for  BCRS printing, as well as sales. These other costs include stamp design,  shipping, and distribution; estimated training for field staff, except for  special training associated with the BCRS; withdrawal of the stamp issue  from sale; destruction of unsold stamps; and incorporation of BCRS images  into advertising for the Postal Service as an entity.", "We discussed our concerns about the Service\u2019s cost-recovery regulations  and their impact with Service officials, especially in light of statements  made by Service officials in June 2001 that the issuance of multiple  semipostals at the same time could significantly increase the administrative  burden on the Service and ultimately burden existing staff and limited  resources. Service officials said that their overriding concern in developing  the cost-recovery regulations was to avoid having to establish cost-tracking  systems that would cost more to develop and implement than the  surcharge revenue to be collected from semipostals, including the BCRS.  We pointed out that the Service already performs a number of cost-related  studies that could possibly be used or modified to capture or estimate  incremental semipostal costs, or that new approaches to capture or  estimate such information might be possible and not be cost prohibitive.  Service officials also said that in developing the regulations, they had not  intended to preclude the Service from recovering excess costs in the  printing, sales, and distribution categories, and they believe they can do so  under the existing regulations. However, we remain concerned that the  regulatory provisions do not require the Service to do so. In fact, the  Service has not established baseline costs that would allow it to identify  and recoup excess costs for printing, sales, and distribution. Therefore, we  continue to believe that a reassessment of the regulatory provisions would  be warranted.

Further, we believe that making available current  data and analyses are even more important now than before, given that  additional semipostals have been authorized; and more semipostals are  likely in the future. More specifically, Congress has authorized two  additional semipostals; and in August 2003, it was considering legislation  authorizing two more semipostals and extending the sales period for the  BCRS.

We reported in April 2000 that the BCRS  had been successful to those ends. Since then, the BCRS has continued to  be a voluntary and convenient way for the public to contribute millions of  dollars for breast cancer research. BCRS sales have fluctuated over time;  however, the BCRS has raised over $30 million for breast cancer research  since it was issued in July 1998. Additionally, most key stakeholders told us  that for the most part, they viewed the BCRS as an effective fund-raiser;  and the public\u2019s view of the BCRS was generally positive, as reflected in the  results from our survey.

We also provide information on the status  of recommendations made to the Postmaster General in our April 2000  BCRS report. In essence, we recommended that the Service formalize its  criteria for making BCRS cost recovery decisions and make BCRS cost data  and analyses available to assure postal ratepayers that they were not  involuntarily subsidizing BCRS costs.", "To describe the monetary and other resources the Service has expended in  operating and administering the BCRS program, we updated pertinent  information presented in our April 2000 report to reflect current  conditions. To do this, we interviewed officials in the Service\u2019s Offices of  Stamp Services and Finance responsible for administering the BCRS  program and tracking its costs. We gathered and analyzed data on the  surcharge revenue raised by the BCRS as well as data on the costs and  resources the Service used in operating and administering the BCRS  program. We also identified and reviewed the Service\u2019s criteria for  determining which costs are to be recouped from the BCRS\u2019 surcharge  revenue and, as necessary, discussed with finance officials the application  of the Service\u2019s criteria for certain cost items.", "To determine if the BCRS has been an effective means of fund-raising, we  obtained and analyzed BCRS sales data and discussed with finance and  stamp services officials how certain events may have affected sales. We  obtained similar information for the Heroes of 2001 semipostal and  compared sales for the two semipostals. We also obtained information on  how much BCRS generated funds had been transferred to the National  Institutes of Health (NIH) and Department of Defense (DOD) for breast  cancer research, and obtained information on how the money was being  used to further breast cancer research. We did not evaluate or assess NIH\u2019s  and DOD\u2019s process for determining who would be awarded BCRS research  funds, nor did we evaluate any of the individual awards. Additionally, we  did not independently verify any of the financial data provided by NIH and  DOD. Further, we interviewed all but one of the key stakeholders that we  had interviewed for our April 2000 report to determine if their views on the  BCRS\u2019 effectiveness as a fund-raiser have changed since our last report.  The key stakeholders interviewed included representatives of (1) the  American Cancer Society, (2) the National Breast Cancer Coalition  (NBCC), (3) the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation, (4) Dr. B. I.  Bodai, and (5) the American Philatelic Society. We did not interview the  current Curator of the Smithsonian Institution\u2019s National Philatelic  Collection for this report. We had interviewed the former Curator for our  April 2000 report, but the current Curator said that it was not within his  personal expertise to evaluate the effectiveness or appropriateness of the  BCRS, or semipostals in general, and it would not be proper for him to  comment in his role as an official of the Postal Museum. For this report, we  also interviewed Betsy Mullen, who is the founder of the Women\u2019s  Information Network Against Breast Cancer, and who, along with Dr. B.I.  Bodai, lobbied Congress to pass legislation creating the BCRS. Further, we  interviewed the Chairperson of the Citizens Stamp Advisory Committee  because, since our last BCRS report, the committee has been given the  responsibility for reviewing semipostal candidates and making  recommendations to the Postmaster General. We did not update the  information included in our April 2000 report on foreign postal  administration\u2019s semipostal activities because of the time and resources  that such work would have required and the limited new information that it  likely would have yielded.", "To determine if the BCRS has been an appropriate means of fund-raising,  we interviewed the same key stakeholders identified above to solicit their  current views on the appropriateness of using the BCRS to raise funds. We  also researched and analyzed applicable sections of the U. S. Code and  Postal Service regulations to identify changes that have occurred since our  April 2000 report that either affected the BCRS directly or the semipostal  program in general. Additionally, we identified and analyzed pending  legislation that would affect the Service\u2019s semipostal program.", "We conducted our review at Postal Service Headquarters in Washington,  D.C., from February through August 2003 in accordance with generally  accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Public Opinion Survey", "paragraphs": ["To obtain the public\u2019s opinion of the BCRS in 2003, we contracted with  International Communications Research (ICR) of Media, Pa. ICR included  five questions about the BCRS and semipostals in its national omnibus  telephone survey, conducted on 5 days, from June 27 and July 1, 2003  (Friday through Tuesday). Omnibus surveys of this type also collect  demographic information and include questions for other clients on other  topics. For our previous survey in 1999, ICR followed the same survey  procedures when it asked four of the five questions that we used in 2003. In  2003, interviews were completed with respondents at 1,038 of the  estimated 9,046 eligible sampled households, for a response rate of about  11 percent. These survey procedures yield a nonprobability sample of  members of the population of the contiguous United States (48 states and  the District of Columbia) who are 18 years or older, speak English, and  reside in a household with a residential, land-based telephone. The 89  percent nonresponse rate means that estimates in the report are subject to  nonsampling errors of unknown magnitude."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Selection of Households and Respondents", "paragraphs": ["Random digit dial (RDD) equal probability selection methods were  followed to identify telephone numbers using the GENESYS Sampling  System. The GENESYS system draws numbers from those active banks of  telephone exchanges that have at least two household numbers listed and  are accessed through land lines. Exchanges assigned to cellular telephones  are not included.", "The interviewers selected a member from each household, using a mixture  of random and systematic procedures. Because adult males are more  difficult to contact and interview in telephone surveys, ICR took the  following measures to meet the specification of at least 500 completed  male interviews, or approximately half of the sample. An interviewer first  attempted to interview the adult male (aged 18 or older) with the most  recent birthday. If that male was not present in the household at the time of  the telephone call, then any other male present in the household at that  time was selected; if no male was present, then an adult female was  selected, with first preference being for the female present with the most  recent birthday. Because the specifications were still not met, only males  were interviewed during the closing phase of the survey. Although routine  procedures specify five attempts to locate a respondent in each household,  many households did not receive five calls and had not been contacted by  the end of the interview period after one or more calls ended in a busy  signal, no answer, or inability to complete a callback attempt. The  respondent selection procedures eliminated interviewer judgment from the  selection process, but did not yield a random, probability sample of the U.S.  population. For example, these procedures exclude females who are  present in households at the time when a willing male is present. The  procedures also exclude any household members who are not at home at  the time the interviewer contacts the household.", "Survey respondents are weighted in our analyses so that age, sex,  education, and regional estimates from our survey will match U.S. data  from the March 2002 Current Population Survey (CPS) on these  demographic characteristics for the adult population (18 years of age and  older) of the 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia. The number  of telephone numbers in the household and number of household members  were also considered in the weighting process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Sampling Errors", "paragraphs": ["As with all sample surveys, this survey is subject to both sampling and  nonsampling errors. The effects of sampling errors, due to the selection of  a sample from a larger population, can be expressed as confidence  intervals based on statistical theory. The effects of nonsampling errors,  such as nonresponse and errors in measurement, may be of greater or  lesser importance, but cannot be quantified on the basis of the available  data.", "Sampling errors occur because we use a sample to draw conclusions about  a much larger population. The survey\u2019s sample of telephone numbers is  based on a probability selection procedure. As a result, the sample was  only one of a large number of samples that might have been drawn from the  total telephone exchanges throughout the country. If a different sample had  been taken, the results might have been different. To recognize the  possibility that other samples might have yielded other results, we express  our confidence in the precision of our particular sample\u2019s results as a 95  percent confidence interval. For all the percentages presented in this  report, we are 95-percent confident that when only sampling errors are  considered, the results we obtained are within +/- 6 percentage points or  less of what we would have obtained if we had surveyed the entire study  population. For example, our survey estimates that 70 percent of the  population feels that it is very or somewhat convenient to use special  stamps to raise funds. The 95 percent confidence interval due to solely  sampling errors for this estimate is between approximately 66 percent and  73 percent."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Nonsampling Errors", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the reported sampling errors, the practical difficulties of  conducting any survey introduce other types of errors, commonly referred  to as nonsampling errors.

With the available  information we cannot estimate the impact of the nonresponse on our  results. Our results will be biased to the extent that the people at the 89  percent of the telephone numbers that did not yield an interview have  different opinions about or experiences with the BCRS than did the 11  percent of our sample who responded.", "Once a respondent agreed to participate, the nonresponse for any  particular item was low.
