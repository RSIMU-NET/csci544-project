IRS officials said that evaluating these strategies would require varying levels of effort because the probability and magnitude of risks differ.

IRS officials acknowledged that the plan did not include these  processes and responsibilities but said that they believe that teams  considered such factors when making decisions. Additionally, the plan did  not provide guidance on documenting the rationale(s) for selecting one  alternative over others. As a result, IRS is less likely to have a trail of  analysis that explains the decisions to those who work on PPACA  projects in the future. Such a trail is important, as PPACA implementation  involves many people managing many tasks over a number of years and  across multiple offices. In the years ahead, implementation responsibility  will shift from the PMOs to staff in the BODs who may not have been  involved in these decisions about the mitigations considered and chosen  and may have to develop a new mitigation if the original does not work.", "IRS officials noted that spending resources to do a thorough evaluation  and to document the rationale for decisions may not be practical for risks  that have a low probability of occurring or that IRS cannot control, such as  a lack of funding. While this may be true, IRS\u2019s risk plan does not offer  guidance on factors like the probability of a risk\u2019s occurrence that could  affect the level of evaluation and amount of documentation to be done.

However,  IRS did not have a formal system for managing risks when coordinating  with HHS.", "While we noted in Table 3 that most activities in project plans were not  assigned specific resources, IRS\u2019s risk plan does facilitate knowledge  sharing among the entities involved in allocating resources to the  program, with the exception previously stated that it does not provide  guidance on verifying that resources are available for selected mitigation  strategies. The CFO, along with IRS management, allocates IRS\u2019s  appropriation to IRS teams doing the implementation work. By involving  the CFO in reviewing identified risks, the risk plan ensures that the CFO  is aware of any risks related to the availability of resources. Regularly  scheduled meetings between the CFO and PPACA implementation  leadership also serve to facilitate discussion of the risks related to  resource allocation. To the extent that IRS provides more specific  guidance in the risk plan on verifying resources and updates its cost  estimate for PPACA implementation, IRS will enhance its ability to  manage risks related to allocating resources in an efficient manner.", "IRS and HHS developed an informal process for regular communication  on project management, consisting of meetings several times per week to  monitor progress on deliverables and solicit needed input on IRS  activities that affect other agencies. IRS officials expressed confidence  that the informal system of coordination worked effectively.

IRS used its Research, Analysis, and Statistics  (RAS) organization to help project the volume of tax returns that would be  subject to PPACA and help identify the likely population requiring  outreach and education. When historical data for similar provisions were  available, IRS attempted to use the data to construct a baseline of  anticipated results. Counsel solicited formal comments from stakeholders  and taxpayers in response to preliminary guidance. IRS made limited use  of other means, such as focus groups, to gain insight into compliance and  burden challenges facing the public. IRS officials said that they received  informal feedback from conversations with other tax stakeholders, such  as groups representing taxpayers, tax software developers, and tax  preparers.

Further, IRS could  take specific steps such as providing additional guidance on how to  evaluate potential mitigation strategies and document the rationales for  decisions made. Without additional guidance, IRS staff selecting  mitigation strategies may not fully evaluate all alternatives or verify that  resources are available for the strategy chosen.  Not knowing the  rationale behind selecting a mitigation strategy over others could hinder  future decisions if the original strategy did not work and the original  decision makers are no longer involved.", "While IRS\u2019s PPACA implementation teams generally followed the steps of  the risk management plan in identifying and mitigating risks, the plan was  not followed when Counsel led pieces of the implementation.
