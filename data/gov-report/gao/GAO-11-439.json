GAO also examined documents and met with IRS officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Foreign and U.S. tax administrators use many of the same practices such as information reporting, tax withholding, providing Web-based services, and finding new approaches for tax compliance. These practices, although common to each system, have important differences. Although differences in laws, culture, or other factors likely would affect the transferability of foreign tax practices to the United States, these practices may provide useful insights for policymakers and the IRS. For example, New Zealand integrates evaluations of its tax and discretionary spending programs. The evaluation of its Working For Families tax benefits and discretionary spending, which together financially assist low- and middle-income families to promote employment, found that its programs aided the transition to employment but that it still had an underserved population; these findings likely would not have emerged from separate evaluations. GAO previously has reported that the United States lacks clarity on evaluating tax expenditures and related discretionary spending programs and does not generally undertake integrated evaluations. In Finland, electronic tax administration is part of a government policy to use electronic services to lower the cost of government and encourage private-sector growth. Overall, according to Finnish officials, electronic services have helped to reduce Tax Administration staff by over 11 percent from 2003 to 2009 while improving taxpayer service. IRS officials learn about these practices based on interactions with other tax administrators and participation in international organizations, such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. In turn, the IRS may adopt new practices based on the needs of the U.S. tax system. For example, in 2009, the IRS formed the Global High Wealth Industry program. The IRS consulted with Australia about its approach and operational practices."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO makes no recommendations in this report."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Tax administrators around the world all strive to address similar issues  regardless of the specific provisions of their laws.

To assist you in considering the  potential applicability of foreign tax administration practices for U.S.  policy and practices, we will describe (1) how foreign tax administrators  have approached issues that are similar to those in the U.S. tax system and  (2) whether and how the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) identifies and  adopts tax administration practices used elsewhere.", "We selected six foreign tax administrators\u2019 approaches to practices that  were different than the approach to a similar practice in the United States  as shown in table 1.", "We based our selection of these practices on several factors, including  whether the tax administrators had advanced economies and tax systems,  tax information was available in English, and the foreign tax  administrator\u2019s approach differed, at least in part, from how the United  States approaches similar issues. We primarily used documentation from  each government\u2019s reports that are publicly available. When possible, we  confirmed additional information provided to us by officials. To identify  taxpayers\u2019 attitudes toward Hong Kong\u2019s semiannual payment system, we  interviewed experts who were either university professors, were the  authors of publications on Hong Kong\u2019s tax system, or were practitioners  in well-known law or accounting firms.

However, it was beyond the scope of this report to identify and assess the  factors that might affect the transferability of the practices to the United  States. For example, nations have differing cultures and differing attitudes  toward government, sometimes called \u201ctax morale.\u201d Generally, higher tax  morale has been found to be positively related to high levels of voluntary  tax compliance. To the extent that taxpayers in some countries are more  willing to fully comply with tax rules, voluntary tax compliance is higher  and less enforcement action is needed by the tax administrator. Thus,  those nations\u2019 tax enforcement practices may not be as appropriate in  other nations where citizens have lower tax morale. Measurements of tax  morale generally are not well defined or uniform; nor are measurements of  voluntary tax compliance.", "We conducted our work from October 2009 to May 2011 in accordance  with all sections of GAO\u2019s Quality Assurance Framework that are relevant  to our objectives.

Information reporting is a widely accepted  practice for increasing taxpayer compliance. Under U.S. law, some types  of transactions are required to be reported to the IRS by third parties who  make payments to, or sometimes receive payments from, individual  taxpayers. Typically, information returns represent income paid to the  taxpayer, such as wages or bank account interest. After tax returns are  filed, the IRS then matches the amounts reported on information returns  to the amounts reported on the taxpayer\u2019s return. For any differences, the  IRS may send a notice to the taxpayer requesting an explanation. If the  taxpayer does not respond to the notice, the IRS may make an additional  assessment. For fiscal year 2010, the IRS received over 2.7 billion  information returns, sent 5.5 million notices on differences between  information returns and tax returns, and assessed an additional $20.7  billion in taxes, interest, and penalties.", "Withholding. Withholding is a widely accepted practice to increase  taxpayer compliance. Under U.S. law, employers must withhold income  tax from the wages paid to employees. Withholding from salaries requires  wage earners to pay enough tax during the tax year to assure that they will  not face a large payment at year end. Also, withholding can be required as  a backup to information reporting if a payee fails to furnish a correct  taxpayer identification number (TIN). If the payee refuses to furnish a TIN,  the payer generally withholds 28 percent of the amount of the payment\u2014 for example, interest payments on a bank account\u2014and remits that  amount to the IRS.", "Electronic tax administration. Many tax administrators in the United  States and worldwide have increasingly used electronic tax administration  to improve services and reduce costs. The IRS has focused its electronic  tax administration on filing tax returns over the Internet, providing  taxpayer assistance through its Web site, and providing telephone  assistance. To accept electronically filed tax returns, IRS has authorized  preapproved e-file providers to submit the returns. IRS cannot accept  electronically filed returns directly from taxpayers. Through its Web site,  IRS provides taxpayers with publications explaining tax law and IRS  administrative procedure. The Web site also provides automated services  such as \u201cWhere\u2019s My Refund?\u201d During the 2010 filing season, the IRS Web  site had 239 million total visits and 277 million searches. IRS also received  77 million telephone calls of which IRS phone assistors answered about 24  million calls.", "Tax enforcement. The U.S. tax system, as well as many other tax systems  worldwide, is based on some degree of self-reporting and voluntary  compliance by taxpayers. Tax administrations worldwide have  enforcement programs to ensure that tax returns are accurate and  complete and taxes are paid. Among others, IRS uses two principal  enforcement programs. After tax returns have been filed, the Automated  Underreporter Program matches data on information returns (usually on  income) provided by employers, banks, and other payers of income to data  reported on taxpayers\u2019 tax returns. IRS may contact taxpayers about any  differences. The Examination Program relies on IRS auditors to check  compliance in reporting income, deductions, credits, and other issues on  tax returns by reviewing the documents taxpayers provided to support  their tax return.", "IRS, like revenue agencies in many countries, administers tax  expenditures. Tax expenditures are tax provisions that grant special tax  relief for certain kinds of behavior by taxpayers or for taxpayers in special  circumstances. Tax expenditures reduce the amount of taxes owed and  therefore are seen as resulting in the government forgoing revenues. These  provisions are viewed by many analysts as spending channeled through  the tax system. For fiscal year 2010, the U.S. Department of the Treasury  reported 173 tax expenditures costing, in aggregate, more than $1 trillion.  Tax expenditures are often aimed at policy goals similar to those of federal  spending programs, such encouraging economic development in  disadvantaged areas and financing postsecondary education. In 2005, we  reported that all U.S. federal spending and tax policy tools, including tax  expenditures, should be reexamined to ensure that they are achieving their  intended purposes and designed in the most efficient and effective  manner."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Examples of Selected Tax Administration Practices to Address Known Tax Administration Issues", "paragraphs": ["The following examples illustrate how New Zealand, Finland, the  European Union (EU), the United Kingdom (UK), Australia, and Hong  Kong have addressed well-known tax administration issues.

In New Zealand, tax expenditures are known as tax credits.  New Zealand has overcome obstacles to evaluating these related programs  at the same time to better judge whether they are working effectively.  Rather than doing separate evaluations, New Zealand completes integrated  evaluations of tax expenditures and discretionary spending programs to  analyze their combined effects. Using this approach, New Zealand can  determine, in part, whether tax expenditures and discretionary spending  programs work together to accomplish government goals.", "One example is the Working For Families (WFF) Tax Credits program,  which is an entitlement for families with dependent children to promote  employment. Prior to the introduction of WFF in 2004, New Zealand\u2019s  Parliament discovered that many low-income families were not better off  from holding a low-paying job, and those who needed to pay for childcare  to work were generally worse off in low-paid work compared to receiving  government benefits absent having a job. This prompted Parliament to  change its in-work incentives and financial support including tax  expenditures.", "The WFF Tax Credits program differs from tax credit programs in the  United States in that it is an umbrella program that spans certain tax  credits administered by the Inland Revenue Department (IRD) as well as  discretionary spending programs administered by the Ministry of Social  Development (MSD). IRD collects most of the revenue and administers the  tax expenditures for the government. Being responsible for collecting  sensitive taxpayer information, IRD must maintain tax privacy and protect  the integrity of the New Zealand tax system. MSD administers the WFF\u2019s  program funds and is responsible for collecting data that include monthly  income received by its beneficiaries. Given different responsibilities, IRD  and MSD keep separate datasets, making it difficult to assess the  cumulative effect of the WFF program.", "Therefore, to understand the cumulative effect of changes made to the  WFF program and ensure that eligible participants were using it, New  Zealand created a joint research program between IRD and MSD that ran  from October 2004 to April 2010. The joint research program created  linked datasets between IRD and MSD. Access to sensitive taxpayer  information was restricted to IRD employees on the joint research  program and to authorized MSD employees only after they were sworn in  as IRD employees.", "The research provided information on key outcomes that could only be  tracked through the linked datasets. The research found that the WFF  program aided the transition from relying on government benefits to  employment, as intended. It also found that a disproportionate number of  those not participating in the program faced barriers to taking advantage  of the WFF. Barriers included the perceived stigma from receiving  government aid, the transaction costs of too many rules and regulations,  and the small amounts of aid for some participants. On the basis of these  findings, Parliament made changes to WFF that provided an additional  NZ$1.6 billion (US$1.2 billion) per year in increased financial entitlements  and in-work support to low- to middle-income families.", "Appendix II provides more details on New Zealand\u2019s evaluation of tax  expenditures as well as similarities and differences to the U.S. system."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Finland Uses the Internet to Calculate Individual Tax Withholding Rates and Revise Preprepared Tax Returns to Improve Service at Lower Costs", "paragraphs": ["Finland encourages accurate withholding of taxes from taxpayers\u2019 income,  lowers its costs, and reduces taxpayers\u2019 filing burdens through Internet- based electronic services. In 2006, Finland established a system, called the  Tax Card, to help taxpayers estimate a withholding rate for the individual  income tax. The Tax Card, based in the Internet, covers Finland\u2019s national  tax, municipality tax, social security tax, and church tax. The Tax Card is  accessed through secured systems in the taxpayer\u2019s Web bank or an  access card issued by Finland\u2019s government. The Tax Card system enables  taxpayers to update their withholding rate as many times as needed  throughout the year, adjusting for events that increase or decrease their  income tax liability. When completed, the employer is notified of the  changed withholding tax rate through the mail or by the employee  providing a copy to the employer. According to the Tax Administration,  about a third of all taxpayers using the Tax Card\u2014about 1.6 million  people\u2014change their withholding percentages at least annually.

Under the treaty, called the  Savings Taxation Directive, adopted in June 2003, the 27 EU members and  10 other participants agreed to share information about income from  interest payments made to individuals who are citizens in another member  nation. With this information, the tax authorities are able to verify whether  their citizens properly reported and paid tax on the interest income. The  directive provides the basic framework for the information exchange,  defining essential terms and establishing automatic information exchange  among members.", "As part of the directive, 3 EU member nations as well as the 5 European  nonmember nations agreed to apply a withholding tax with revenue  sharing (described below) during a transition period through 2011, rather  than automatically exchanging information. Under this provision, a 15  percent withholding tax gradually increases to 35 percent by July 1, 2011.  The withholding provision included a revenue-sharing provision, which  authorizes the withholding nation to retain 25 percent of the tax collected  and transfer the other 75 percent to the nation of the account owner.

It is generally recognized that a Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN)  provides the best means of identifying the owner. However, the current  directive does not require paying agents to record a TIN. Using names has  caused problems when other EU member states tried to access the data.  For example, a name that is misspelled cannot be matched. In addition,  how some member states format their mailing address may have led to  data-access problems.", "Other problems with implementing the directive include identifying  whether investors moved their assets into categories not covered by the  directive (e.g., shifting to equity investments), and concerns that tax  withholding provisions may not be effective because withholding rates  were low until 2011 when the rate became 35 percent. The EU also  identified problems with the definition of terms, making uniform  application of the directive difficult.

According to HMRC officials, the individual tax system in the  UK is simple for most taxpayers who are subject to PAYE. PAYE makes it  unnecessary for wage earners to file a yearly tax return, unless special  circumstances apply. For example, wage earners do not need to file a  return unless income from interest, dividends, or capital gains exceeds  certain thresholds or if deductions need to be reported. Therefore, a tax  return may not be required because most individuals do not earn enough  of these income types to trigger self-reporting. For example, the first  \u00a310,100 (US$16,239) of capital gains income is exempt from being reported  on tax returns.", "PAYE also facilitates the reconciliation of tax liabilities for prior tax years  through the use of withholding at source for wages.

Individuals not under the PAYE  system are required to file a tax return after the end of the tax year based  on their records.", "In addition, HMRC uses information reporting and tax withholding as part  of its two-step process to assess the compliance risks on filed returns. In  the first step, individual tax returns are reviewed for inherent compliance  risks because of the taxpayers\u2019 income level and complexity of the tax  return. For example, wealthy taxpayers with complex business income are  considered to have a higher compliance risk than a wage earner. In the  second step, information compiled from various sources\u2014including  information returns and public sources\u2014is analyzed to identify returns  with a high compliance risk.

The three main  individual income tax rates for income above the personal allowance are  20 percent (\u00a30-\u00a337,400 or up to US$60,132), 40 percent (\u00a337,401-\u00a3150,000  or up to US$241,170), and 50 percent (over \u00a3150,000 or over US$241,170).

For example, banks are to provide interest  payment information. Over 400 local government organizations are to  report information on payments made to small businesses. Local  government as both an employer and contractor must report information  on payments made to others.", "The information provided by employers enables HMRC to update the  employee\u2019s tax record and issue a tax code to the new employer to start  the withholding against employee earnings. HMRC calculates the PAYE  code using information about the previous year\u2019s income or other  employment in the current tax year. Employers are to match the PAYE  code to a tax table, which shows how much tax to withhold each pay  period. The employer has to remit the withheld tax to HMRC on a monthly  or quarterly basis to fulfill the taxpayer\u2019s tax liability. HMRC annually  reviews taxpayer records and issues updated PAYE codes before the start  of the tax year for employers to operate at the start of the tax year. The  individual will receive a notice showing how the tax code has been  calculated. To maintain taxpayer confidentiality, the employer will only  receive the tax code itself.", "HMRC can refund income tax overpayments or collect underpayments for  previous tax years through adjustments to the PAYE code. HMRC reported  in 2010 that around 5 million individuals overpaid or underpaid these  taxes. HMRC officials said that they use information returns to help  determine these adjustments under PAYE. In lieu of having their PAYE  codes adjusted, taxpayers may receive a onetime refund of the  overpayment or pay the underpaid amount in one lump sum. Taxes owed  usually are collected through code adjustments as long as the taxpayer  stays within the PAYE system.", "HMRC also uses information reporting and withholding to assess the  compliance risks on filed returns. In assessing compliance risks, HMRC is  attempting to identify underpaid and overpaid tax. The majority of the  information for risk assessment is collected centrally from information  returns, tax withholdings, filed tax returns, and public sources. This  information is mined for risks by special risk-assessment teams. According  to HMRC officials, the outcomes of such mining are to be used to verify  tax compliance. If low compliance is found, risk specialists are to develop  programs to increase compliance.", "The data mining uses electronic warehouse \u201cData Marts\u201d that HMRC has  had for about 10 years. They have been configured with subsets of data  and have been supplemented by sophisticated analysis tools for doing risk  assessments. For example, an analyst can create reports to assess the risk  for all self-assessment income tax returns where the legal expense is  above a specified amount. HMRC officials told us that Data Marts had  recently been revamped and a strategic capability was added that links  related information such as a business that files a corporate tax return for  its business profits, pays value added tax, and has directors who submit  self-assessment returns.", "According to HMRC officials, the use of Data Marts combined with their  more recent Strategic Risking Capability has allowed them to assess risks  at the national and regional levels. HMRC officials said that they have  moved towards national risk assessments because risk has not proven to  be geographically based at regional levels. HMRC officials noted that while  a return is being assessed for one type of risk, another type of risk can be  found. HMRC is attempting to uncover emerging compliance risks by  combining and reviewing data from the various sources in the Data Marts  and elsewhere.", "The risk assessment process has two steps, resulting in identifying tax  returns for examination. The first step is to identify tax returns that have  an inherent risk because of the taxpayers\u2019 size, complexity of the tax  return, and past tendency for noncompliance. For example, returns filed  by high-wealth individuals are viewed as risky returns that are sent to a  related specialty office. The second step assesses risk on returns that are  not sent to a specialty office. HMRC officials said that a relatively large  proportion of the risk-assessment effort focuses on the self-employed, who  are seen as having the greatest risk for tax noncompliance since they  usually are not under the PAYE system (unless they have some wage  income) and instead are to file a self-assessment return. HMRC has  separate risk-assessment approaches, depending on the type of individual  taxpayer, as discussed below.", "For individuals under the PAYE system, HMRC\u2019s computers capture most  of the necessary data and the system carries out routine checks to verify  data and link it to the taxpayer record. A risk to the PAYE system arises  when employees receive benefits from their employers that are not  provided to HMRC at the time it determines the annual tax code. Employer  benefits may include a car, health insurance, or professional association  fees that employers report on information returns after the tax year and  that may be subject to income tax. If these benefits received are not  included in the tax code then an underpayment of tax is likely to arise. The  unpaid tax can be recovered by an annual reconciliation or when the  employee reports the benefits on the employee\u2019s self-assessment tax  return.  Individuals not under the PAYE system are required to file a self- assessment tax return. To assess risk, HMRC checks some self-assessment  tax returns for consistency by comparing them to returns from previous  years, focusing on small businesses. For example, if the legal expense  jumped from \u00a35,000 to \u00a3100,000 (US$8,039 to US$160,780) over 2 years,  HMRC may decide to review the reason. HMRC permits any self-employed  small business with gross receipts of less than \u00a368,000 (US$109,330) to file  a simple three-line tax return to report business income, expenses, and  profit.

Further, data from information  reporting and withholding are to help simplify or eliminate tax reporting at  the end of a tax year.

The upgrade was to combine information on individuals\u2019  employment and pension income into a single record to support more  accurate tax withholding codes and reduce the likelihood of over- and  underpayments of tax. However, software problems delayed processing  2008-09 PAYE returns for a year.

Also, the tax paid by individuals is a larger percentage of revenue than the  corporation tax in each country. The tax on property, goods, and services  is the next most important tax except in the UK where the income tax is  the second largest source. A large component of the taxes on property,  goods, and services is the value added tax and sales tax. In Australia, New  Zealand, the UK, and Finland, value added tax and sales tax ranged from  25 percent to 31 percent of the taxes collected in the nation. The United  States does not have a value added tax, but sales taxes alone totaled about  14 percent of all U.S. revenue."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IX: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Thomas Short, Assistant Director;  Juan P.
