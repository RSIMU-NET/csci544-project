Regarding political conditions, for example, the FSM states and national government have been unable to agree on implementation of the compact infrastructure grant, while the RMI government has had difficulty securing agreement from land owners regarding its use of leased land for compact-related projects. Social challenges in both countries include persistent health and education problems despite substantial expenditures. For instance, the FSM and the RMI have low immunization rates relative to other countries with similar income levels. The FSM and the RMI economies show limited potential for achieving longterm development objectives. Both economies depend on public sector expenditures--funded largely by external assistance--and government budgets have growing wage expenditures, heightening the negative fiscal impacts they will face as compact grants decline. As a result, long-term economic growth must come from the private sector and increased income sent home from FSM and RMI emigrants (\"remittances\"). However, poor business environments hamper private industry in both countries, and FSM and RMI emigrants' lack of marketable skills hinders increasing revenue from remittances. Compact management committees have not discussed the countries' progress toward budgetary self-reliance and long-term economic advancement at their annual meetings. FSM and RMI progress in key policy reforms has been slow. Country officials reported passing some new mortgage and bankruptcy laws, but other needed reforms have not been implemented. For example, according to economic experts, tax systems remain inequitable and inefficient and foreign investment regulations remain confusing and relatively burdensome. FSM and RMI development plans include reform objectives in each of these areas; however, compact management committees have not addressed the nations' slow progress in implementing reforms."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["From 1987 to 2003, the United States provided about $2.1 billion in  economic assistance to the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) and the  Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) through a Compact of Free  Association.

Representing a new phase of the unique  relationship between the United States and these island areas, the  compact provided a framework for the United States to work toward  achieving its three main goals: (1) to secure self-government for the FSM  and the RMI, (2) to ensure certain national security rights for all of the  parties, and (3) to assist the FSM and the RMI in their efforts to advance  economic development and self-sufficiency. The first goal was met; the  FSM and the RMI are independent nations. The second goal has also been  achieved with the compact\u2019s establishment of several key defense rights  for all three countries. The defense relationship continues with, among  other things, U.S. access to military facilities on Kwajalein Atoll in the RMI  through 2016. The compact\u2019s third goal was to be accomplished primarily  through U.S. direct financial assistance to the FSM and the RMI. For the  15-year period covering 1987 to 2001, funding was provided at levels that  decreased every 5 years. For 2002 and 2003, during negotiations to renew  expiring compact provisions, funding levels increased (see fig. 1) to equal  an average of the funding provided during the previous 15 years plus  inflation. For 1987 through 2003, compact financial assistance to the FSM  and the RMI was estimated, on the basis of Interior data, to be about $2.1  billion.", "Economic development and self-sufficiency were not achieved under the  original compact. Both nations remained dependent on U.S. funds; total  U.S. assistance accounted for more than 50 percent of government  revenues throughout the compact period. In addition, FSM and RMI GDP  estimates reveal that per capita GDP at the close of the compact had not  exceeded, in real terms, early 1990s levels in either country (see fig. 2).  Although U.S. direct assistance maintained standards of living that were  higher than could be achieved without support, we found previously that  compact funds spent on economic development were largely ineffective in  promoting economic growth. For example, compact funds were used to  support general government operations that, among other things,  maintained high levels of public sector employment and wages, creating  disincentives to private sector growth. Compact funds were also used to  support business ventures, most of which have failed. In our examination  of a wide range of projects funded under the compact, we found that many  projects experienced problems due to poor planning and management,  inadequate construction and maintenance, or misuse of funds. In 2000, we  recommended, among other things, that the Secretary of State direct the  Special Negotiator for the Compact of Free Association to negotiate  amended compact provisions that include assistance provided through  grants targeted to priority areas, expanded reporting and consultation  requirements, and the ability to withhold funds for noncompliance with  compact terms and conditions.", "The compact also gave citizens of both nations the rights to live and work  in the United States as \u201cnonimmigrants\u201d and to stay for long periods of  time. Further, the compact exempted FSM and RMI citizens from meeting  U.S. passport, visa, and labor certification requirements when entering the  United States.

In comparing projected trust fund revenue with the fiscal year 2023 grant  level, we reported earlier that, under certain conditions, the trust fund  revenue available in 2024 may be less than even the lower level of grant  funding in 2024. For example, at an assumed annual 6 percent rate of  return, earnings from the FSM\u2019s trust fund would be lower than expiring  grant assistance in 2024, while earnings from the RMI\u2019s trust fund would  encounter the same problem by 2040. If the trust funds consistently earn  a higher rate of return, or if additional contributions to the funds are  provided, the probability rises that the trust funds could provide a  sustainable income source at the level of fiscal year 2024 grants.

State and Interior officials reported  that the FSM\u2019s weak federal structure inhibits compact grant  implementation. Because each state has its own constitution and authority  over budgetary policies, the central government that is represented on  JEMCO does not control the majority of compact funds and have been  unable to secure agreement from the state governments regarding  compact needs. As a result, FSM access to the compact infrastructure  grant, for example, has been delayed for more than 2 years owing to  national and state disagreements over infrastructure priorities. Similarly,  the RMI government and landowners on Kwajalein Atoll have been  disputing government use of leased land and management of public  entities on the atoll.

We recognize that the FSM and the RMI were required under the  amended compacts to contribute an initial $30 million to their trust  funds. Recent RMI GDP performance may have differed if this funding  were used to provide current goods and services rather than for  savings. Nonetheless, the RMI\u2019s contribution to their trust fund does  not alter the extent of RMI economic dependence on external  assistance. Our description of RMI economic performance was also  based on broad trends from 2000 to 2005, rather than exclusively on  the 2 years of bump-up assistance in 2002 and 2003.  3.  We will address amended compact implementation issues and trust- fund issues in two separate reports, forthcoming. We have also added  language to this report indicating the RMI\u2019s concern over delays in  setting up its trust fund.  4.  We have clarified our estimates and figures with regards to funding  streams they include and exclude. Section 177 funds are not included  in our analysis.  5.  Section 211 of Title Two of the Amended Compact with the RMI states  that compact grants shall be used for assistance in education, health  care, the environment, public sector capacity building, and private  sector development, or for other areas as mutually agreed, with  priorities in the education and health sectors.  6.  We have added language regarding RMI consultations with the private  sector and their desire for improved tax enforcement. The  effectiveness of U.S. and ADB technical assistance to the RMI is  outside the scope of this report. We note, however, that the RMI  allocated no compact funding to a public sector capacity building grant  in fiscal year 2004 and less than 1 percent of compact sector grant  funding to such a grant in fiscal year 2005.  7.  We discuss remittances in our report as one option that the RMI may  consider in pursuing the economic goals under the amended compact  and that the JEMFAC may consider when discussing compact grant  implementation. In the RMI\u2019s METO 2000 Statement of Development  Strategies and its 2001 Strategic Development Plan entitled \u201cVision  2018,\u201d the RMI estimates that between 500 to 800 new job entrants will  need to find employment each year from 1999 to 2009. To meet this  objective, the ready access provided under the compact for  Marshallese to live and work in the U.S. must be preserved. These  documents also emphasize that the education system needs to equip  Marshallese to succeed both in the RMI and abroad. Economic experts  have emphasized that the RMI\u2019s free access and strong historical links  to the U.S. market provide the RMI with relatively good opportunities  to expand remittance income, particularly if migrants had upgraded  skills. Improved skill provision should benefit both RMI emigrants as  well as domestic economic prospects.  8.  We have clarified our reference that 2003 data on international visitor  arrivals are for other Pacific island nations. Such data are not available  for Kiribati and Nauru. The World Bank has estimated that, in 2002,  Kiribati had 5,000 international visitors. However, Kiribati also has a  per capita GDP that is less than one-third of the RMI\u2019s.  9.  RMI employment data indicate that the RMI did succeed in reducing  public sector employment from about 3,760 jobs in 1997 to about 3,530  jobs in 2001. However, since then, public sector employment has risen  to about 4,320 jobs in 2005.  10. We have modified language in the report to clarify each of these points.", "We have added language to the report to include the volatility in tax  income from the fisheries and tourism sectors and the fact that RMI  offices related to reform efforts, such as land registration offices, have  been funded with compact grants."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix VIII: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the persons named above, Emil Friberg, Assistant Director;  Leslie Holen; Reid Lowe; Mary Moutsos; Kendall Schaefer; and Seyda  Wentworth made key contributions to this report.", "This is a work of the U.S. government and is not subject to copyright protection in the  United States.
