The project was recently reclassified from an area-funded project to a headquarters-funded project. The project is now waiting to be included in the next 5-year prioritization process for ranking and funding capital projects, and this process is anticipated to be completed by August 2000.

There, the mail undergoes a first-level sort by the first three digits of the ZIP Code. The mail is then transported to smaller mail processing facilities, such as the Mojave MPO, where secondary operations are performed on automated equipment to sort the mail to the five-digit ZIP Code level. Generally at this stage, some of the mail would also be automatically sorted to the carrier-route level and sequenced in the order that carriers deliver it. However, in Mojave, the necessary automated equipment is not available for sorting mail down to the carriers\u2019 delivery sequence order. Thus, the mail is transported to the postal facilities responsible for mail delivery, such as Lancaster, where the mail carriers manually sort the mail into delivery sequence order.", "Administrative support and mail processing functions for mail to be delivered in the 935 ZIP Code area, as well as local retail and delivery functions, are housed at the MPO in Mojave. According to available postal documents, the Mojave MPO was functioning at its maximum capacity in 1990. Mail processing and customer service operations competed for space in the crowded facility. Operational efficiency was beginning to suffer due to the continual shifting of equipment to allow adequate space for processing operations. More recently, postal documents noted that some automated sorting equipment intended for Mojave processing operations was being stored in warehouses due to insufficient space.", "Postal documents from 1990 also reported that the Lancaster MPO had reached its maximum capacity and could not accommodate the future growth anticipated in Lancaster. Carrier operations had spread onto the loading platform, where mail was being placed to await distribution. Both employees and mail were exposed to weather conditions. There was a demand for additional post office boxes at the MPO, but there was no room to expand the box section. According to the Service, employee support facilities were inadequate; and parking facilities for customer, employee, and postal vehicles were also inadequate. Similar conditions reportedly existed in the Palmdale MPO, and a facility replacement was included in the Western Region\u2019s Five-Year Facility plan.

At that time, we reviewed a sample of 246 sites purchased during fiscal year 1987 and made recommendations to improve the Service\u2019s real estate acquisition program. Our 1989 report found that the Service usually purchased sites that exceeded both its operational needs and advertised size requirements. When alternative sites were available for purchase, the Service generally selected the larger, more costly sites without requiring site selection committees to document why less expensive alternative sites were less desirable. The report raised concerns, based on the Service\u2019s requirements for advertising and purchasing practices, that the Service might be spending more than was necessary for land and accumulating an unnecessarily large real estate inventory.

All major mail processing facilities must be funded from the headquarters capital facility budget, while other types of processing and delivery facilities may be funded from regional/area budgets. At the time that the proposed project was suspended in 1992, it was classified as a mail processing facility in the Western Region/Pacific Area Major Facility Priority List. It had also been submitted for headquarters funding consideration in the Five-Year Major Facilities Priority List for fiscal years 1991 to 1995. The project was reinstated and reclassified in 1995 as a Delivery and Distribution Center (DDC), with the expectation that it would be funded out of area funds in fiscal year 1998. The Service suspended the project a second time in March 1999, while it was undergoing review by headquarters officials. Based upon the headquarters review, the project was again reclassified from a DDC to a Processing and Distribution Center. The latest reclassification meant that the project would have to be funded by headquarters rather than the Pacific Area Office, and it would have to compete nationally for funding. This means that the project will have to await placement on the next headquarters Five-Year Major Facilities Priority List, which is scheduled to be completed by August 2000.", "It is also not clear why the proposed project was reinstated and reclassified in 1995 as a DDC when the major purpose and design of this project had not fundamentally changed. Postal officials in the Pacific Area Office and Van Nuys District said that the recently proposed Antelope Valley project is essentially the same as the project that was being planned when the Service acquired the 25-acre Lancaster site in 1991. The major differences in the two projects are in nonmail processing areas.

This additional sorting would decrease the time that the carriers spend in the delivery units preparing the mail for delivery and increase the amount of time the carriers would have to deliver the mail. Another negative effect of the space deficiencies in Mojave was that some of the mail originating in the 935 ZIP Code area (approximately 130,000 pieces per day) was diverted from processing in Mojave to the processing facility in Santa Clarita.  According to local postal officials, the effect of this diversion was to delay by 1 day the delivery of some mail that was to be delivered in the 935 ZIP Code area.  The local area First-Class mail was supposed to be delivered within 1 day to meet overnight delivery standards for First-Class mail.", "Since this project was initiated in 1989, the Service has taken several actions to address mail processing and delivery deficiencies in the Antelope Valley. The Service added 2,417 square feet of interior space to the Palmdale MPO by relocating the post office into a larger leased facility. Some relief was provided to the cramped carrier operations at the Lancaster MPO by relocating 15 of the 89 carrier routes serving Lancaster to the Lancaster Cedar Station. However, as we observed on our visit to the Lancaster facilities, conditions in Lancaster were still very congested. Mail that was waiting to be processed and workroom operations spilled out of the building onto the platform, exposing both employees and the mail to weather conditions.", "In an effort to provide the Mojave MPO with more mail-processing space, a 2,400 square foot tent was installed in 1998, at a cost of $30,000, next to the loading platform. The tent provided additional space for processing operations and for holding mail that was waiting to be processed, but it did not allow for deployment of any automated equipment scheduled for use in the 935 mail-processing functions. Also, we observed that the tent would not provide adequate shelter from high winds or other weather-related conditions. Some of the equipment was stored at district warehouses.

The Service\u2019s analyses of alternatives were incomplete because estimated costs of the alternatives and space requirements were still under development.

Such a review may have prevented the unexplained inconsistencies in the classifications of this project that have contributed to delays in its funding. Likewise, it is not known whether the Committee\u2019s review would have suggested a course of action other than acquisition of the Lancaster site.

However, what is known is that the Service spent about $6.5 million over 8 years ago to purchase a site that has remained unused. This site may or may not be used by the Service in the future, and its investment has a substantial annual interest cost associated with it. While this interest cost continues, the mail service deficiencies identified nearly 10 years ago remain unaddressed, and projected operating efficiencies and savings anticipated from new equipment are unrealized as the equipment remains in storage.", "Given this situation, it is not clear why the status of this project has been allowed to go unresolved for such a long time. It is also unclear at this time whether funding for this project will be approved and, if so, for what year of the next 5-year capital projects funding cycle. Thus, the Service\u2019s site investment in unused land and the existing operational deficiencies are likely to continue for some time, and the Service has not determined how it will address these issues if the project is not approved or funded for several years."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation", "paragraphs": ["To address the long-standing uncertainties related to the proposed Antelope Valley project, we recommend that the Postmaster General take the following actions:", "Resolve the internal inconsistencies in the classification of this project, determine whether the site in Lancaster should be retained, and ensure that the project is considered in the appropriate funding and approval process, and", "Require the Pacific Area office to determine whether immediate action is needed to address the operational deficiencies identified in the Antelope Valley area and report on planned actions and related time frames for implementation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We received written comments from the Postmaster General on August 20, 1999.  These comments are summarized below and included as appendix I. We also incorporated technical comments provided by Service officials into the report where appropriate.  The Postmaster General responded to our conclusion that the Service did not follow all of its procedures in effect at the time that approval was given to purchase a site for a proposed facility in advance of the proposed Antelope Valley project\u2019s review and approval.  He stated that the Service has revised its procedures for advance site acquisition so that proposed sites are subjected to additional review and approval.   As a result, he stated that the advanced acquisition of a site for project such as Antelope Valley now must receive approval from the Headquarters Capital Investment Committee and the Postmaster General.", "The Postmaster General generally agreed with our recommendations to address the unresolved status of the Antelope Valley project and the operational deficiencies in the Antelope Valley area.  In response to our first recommendation to resolve the inconsistent classification of the project, he stated that the Service has determined that the proposed Antelope Valley project is properly classified as a mail processing facility. He also stated that the proposed project would be considered for funding along with other such projects during the next round of project review and prioritization.  While clarification of the project\u2019s classification is a good first step, until disposition of the entire project is completed, the status of the project, including the use of the Lancaster site, remains unresolved.", "Regarding our second recommendation to address operational deficiencies in the Antelope Valley area, he stated that officials from the involved Pacific Area offices have met to discuss the most workable alternatives to sustain and improve mail service for Antelope Valley customers.  However, due to the complexity of issues, including the possibility of relocating some operations into leased space on an interim basis, a fully developed distribution and delivery improvement plan may take some time to implement.  He agreed to provide us with action plans and time frames as they are finalized.   If actions are taken as described by the Postmaster General, we believe they would be responsive to our recommendations.", "We are sending copies of this report to Representative Howard (Buck) McKeon; Representative John McHugh, Chairman, and Chaka Fattah, Ranking Minority Member, Subcommittee on the Postal Service, House Committee on Government Reform; Mr. William J.
