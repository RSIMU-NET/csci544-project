RHS has identified improper payments resulting from inaccurate calculations of tenant subsidies and incomplete supporting documents. From fiscal years 2007 through 2010, RHS reduced its reported error rate from 3.95 percent (representing $35 million in errors) to 1.48 percent (representing $15 million in errors). However, these figures may be understated because RHS has not estimated improper payments due to unreported tenant income, and it lacks the authority to match tenant data to federal income data for this purpose. These data include the Department of Health and Human Services\u0092 (HHS) New Hires database and the Social Security Administration\u0092s (SSA) data on benefits payments. RHS has proposed legislation to gain access to the HHS data but not the SSA data. Additionally, RHS has not recently estimated payment processing errors and has not strictly adhered to procedures for classifying payments as improper. Further, in 2008, RHS began excluding improper payments of less than $100 from its estimated error rates. However, it did not submit this change to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), which is responsible for approving agency methodologies for estimation. As a result, RHS lacks assurance that its approach is appropriate.", "RHS uses required statistical methods for estimating improper payments but has not fully met requirements for reporting on, reducing, and recovering such payments. Consistent with the Improper Payments Information Act of 2002, as amended, and OMB guidance, RHS examines a statistically valid sample of payments and generates estimates with an acceptable level of precision. RHS also has reported required information, such as actions to address payment errors. However, RHS did not fully comply with the requirement to implement and report steps for holding agency managers accountable for reducing improper payments. In addition, although OMB cites data matching as a way to reduce payment errors, RHS has not used data already available from SSA to detect payments made on behalf of deceased tenants. Further, RHS has yet to institute a recovery audit program in accordance with the Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Act of 2010, although it plans to do so sometime in 2012. These shortcomings negatively affect the integrity of RHS\u0092s subsidy payments.", "The Department of Housing and Urban Development\u0092s (HUD) use of data matching to reduce improper payments in its rental assistance programs illustrates the potential benefits and challenges of this technique for RHS. HUD developed a web-based system that allows authorized HUD staff and program administrators (e.g., public housing agencies) to match tenant information to HHS\u0092s New Hires database and SSA benefits data. According to HUD, the system has helped to reduce income reporting errors and has contributed to a more than threefold decline in total improper payments from fiscal years 2000 through 2010.

First,  the audits do not check for an improper payment caused by a tenant not  reporting all sources of income (intentionally or otherwise). RHS bases its  rental subsidies, in part, on income information reported from tenants.  RHS policy requires property managers to verify this information with third  parties such as employers and welfare offices, but third-party verification  may not identify all unreported income (for example, if a tenant discloses  income from only one of two part-time jobs). If tenants do not report all of  their sources of income, the rental subsidies calculated for the tenants  may be too high and result in improper payments.", "RHS officials told us the improper payments audits do not examine  unreported income because RHS does not have access to data that could  readily identify unreported amounts. Two sources of such data are the  Department of Health and Human Services\u2019s (HHS) National Directory of  New Hires (New Hires database) and the Social Security Administration\u2019s  (SSA) data on Social Security and Supplemental Security Income  benefits as follows:", "New Hires database.

In a prior report, we  said that Congress should consider amending the Social Security Act  to grant RHS access to the New Hires database for purposes of  detecting unreported income.

RHS officials stated that RHS does not currently  have the statutory authority to access data on Social Security and  Supplemental Security Income payments to assisted tenants. If  granted this access, RHS would have to develop a matching  agreement with SSA (pursuant to the Computer Matching and Privacy  Protection Act of 1988) in order to use the information. In 2005,  USDA\u2019s Office of the Inspector General (OIG) recommended that  RHS draft legislation that would give RHS access to federal income  and benefits databases, including those maintained by SSA.However, RHS officials told us they had been focused on getting  statutory access to the New Hires database and had not worked on  developing legislation for accessing SSA benefits data. Without this  access, future RHS efforts to identify unreported tenant income will be  limited.", "The second source of improper payments not examined by RHS\u2019s audits  is a payment made on behalf of a deceased tenant.

Therefore, if the deceased tenant\u2019s landlord or family does not  notify RHS of the tenant\u2019s death in a timely manner, RHS could continue  to make rental assistance payments on the deceased tenant\u2019s behalf.", "A number of factors, including household income and the size of the living unit,  determine whether rental assistance payments need to be adjusted following the death of  a family member.", "USDA\u2019s OIG reported on weaknesses in the way RHS was estimating  improper payments that may have led RHS to understate its reported  error rates in prior years. RHS subsequently changed how it conducts  the improper payments audits, such as by using CSC staff (rather than  RHS field staff) to help ensure consistency in implementing audit  procedures, but it has not reestimated payment processing errors since  making these changes. As a result, RHS\u2019s assumption that payment  processing errors are negligible may not be accurate.", "RHS\u2019s estimated error rates may also mask the true extent of improper  payments because they exclude improper payments of less than $100.  RHS began using the $100 exclusion threshold for its audit of fiscal year  2007 payments. RHS officials said they adopted the threshold for two  main reasons. First, RHS officials stated that the $100 exclusion  threshold was based on a USDA regulation that lets tenant households  wait until their next recertification to report increases in monthly income of  less than $100. Second, RHS officials indicated that it was not cost- effective to attempt to recover small improper payments. While the $100  threshold may be appropriate for recertifying tenant income or deciding  whether to recover payments, it does not follow that the same threshold is  appropriate for conducting the improper payments audit. The purpose of  the audit is to measure the magnitude of payments made in error, which  IPIA defines as payments that should not have been made or were made  in an incorrect amount.", "In the fiscal year 2010 sample of 666 payments, RHS found 15 improper  payments of $100 or more, which represents 11 percent of all over- and  underpayments in the sample.

To illustrate, an improper  payment of $100 represents almost one-third of the median RHS monthly  rental assistance payment.", "While setting an exclusion threshold that eliminates small amounts from  overall error estimates may be reasonable\u2014such as amounts due to  rounding up or down to the nearest dollar\u2014RHS\u2019s fiscal year 2010  sample shows that using the $100 threshold excludes a high percentage  of improper payments from RHS\u2019s error estimates, including some larger  errors. As shown in figure 3, 89 percent of the improper payments in the  sample were less than $100. Fourteen percent of the improper payments  (or 19 payments) were from $25 to $99 and likely cannot be attributed to  rounding errors. Additionally, HUD\u2014which is the largest provider of  federal rental subsidies\u2014includes all improper payments greater than $5  in estimated error rates for its rental assistance programs. In RHS\u2019s  payment sample for fiscal year 2010, 51 percent of the improper  payments exceeded $5.", "OMB is required by IPIA to approve the methods used by agencies to  estimate improper payments. OMB initially approved RHS\u2019s methodology  in 2004, prior to RHS\u2019s first improper payments audit and 4 years before  RHS adopted the $100 exclusion threshold. However, OMB has not  subsequently reassessed RHS\u2019s methodology and therefore has not  examined whether RHS\u2019s $100 exclusion threshold is appropriate. In  addition, OMB guidance does not address the use of exclusion  thresholds. OMB officials told us they generally do not reassess an  agency\u2019s estimation method unless the agency tells OMB it is making a  major change and submits the change to OMB for review. OMB officials  also noted that more than 70 programs report on improper payments,  which makes regular reassessment of each one challenging.

However, RHS did not submit the change to  OMB for review.", "Our analysis of the payment sample that RHS used for its fiscal year  2010 audit found that the $100 exclusion threshold had a demonstrable  impact on the incidence and magnitude of RHS\u2019s reported improper  payments. If RHS had included all improper payments in its estimates,  the estimate of gross dollar errors would have been about $23 million  rather than $15 million, and the estimated error rate would have been  2.21 percent rather than 1.48 percent (see fig. 4). RHS\u2019s use of an  exclusion threshold could affect whether or not the rental assistance  program is subject to annual OMB reporting requirements for programs  classified as susceptible to improper payments. As previously discussed,  OMB has indicated that programs with error rates of at least 1.5 percent  in fiscal year 2013 will be classified as susceptible, and our analysis  shows that RHS\u2019s use of the $100 threshold reduced its error rate below  that level for fiscal year 2010.", "Finally, RHS\u2019s reported error rate may be understated because, contrary  to its stated audit procedure, RHS does not always count as improper  those payments with Tenant Certification forms that were signed but not  dated. The sample of payments that RHS used for the fiscal year 2010  audit contained five payments that were not counted as improper even  through the Tenant Certification forms were not dated. Had RHS followed  its audit procedure strictly and counted the five payments as improper,  the number of improper payments included in RHS\u2019s estimate would have  increased by one-third, and RHS\u2019s estimated error rate would have been  2.53 percent. RHS officials said they did not count payments associated  with undated certifications as improper when the auditors were able  impute an acceptable certification date from other documents in the  tenant file. For example, if auditors determined that income verification  documents in the tenant file were current and dated prior to the first  subsidy payment request, auditors considered the sampled payment to  be proper even though the Tenant Certification form was not dated.

However, the PAR lacks required detail on recovery of  improper payments because of delays by USDA in implementing a  recovery audit program. In addition, the required discussion of internal  controls, human capital, and information systems to reduce improper  payments is limited. The discussion consists of a high-level statement  that USDA is creating information systems and infrastructure to reduce  improper payments, that some of these efforts are constrained by limited  resources, and that USDA is working with OMB to focus resources on  critical needs. Because the discussion is not more specific, it is unclear if  RHS has sufficiently assessed whether its internal controls, human  capital, and information systems are sufficient to reduce improper  payments to targeted levels. A USDA representative told us that USDA  may provide a more detailed response to this reporting requirement in  future PARs. Finally, the PAR does not contain required information on  steps and associated timelines for holding RHS managers accountable  for reducing and recovering improper payments.", "With respect to the accountability issue, OMB guidance requires agencies  to describe the steps they have taken and plan to take to hold agency  managers accountable for reducing and recovering improper payments.  The guidance states that agency managers should be held accountable  through annual performance appraisal criteria for meeting applicable  improper payments reduction targets and establishing an internal control  environment that prevents, detects, and recovers improper payments.  However, in response to these requirements, the PAR states only that  \u201c State Offices with improper payment errors develop a corrective  action plan. The plan includes procedures to train field staff, borrowers,  and property manager in appropriate required documentation and  follow-up with tenants and income-verifiers.\u201d While the plans may be key  to addressing improper payments, the PAR does not discuss  mechanisms for ensuring that agency managers follow through on the  plans or how they are held accountable for reducing and recovering  improper payments generally. In contrast, the PAR\u2019s descriptions of  accountability measures for other USDA agencies are more consistent  with the OMB guidance. For example, the descriptions for several  agencies discuss how improper payments goals and objectives were  incorporated into agency managers\u2019 performance plans and performance  appraisals. RHS officials said that RHS state office directors currently  have management goals that emphasize efficient and effective use of  resources but acknowledged that improper payments are not specifically  referenced in the goals. In April 2012, RHS officials told us they were  seeking departmental approval of revised management goals for fiscal  year 2012 that explicitly address improper payments. By not  implementing accountability steps for improper payments, RHS may be  limiting the effectiveness of its efforts to reduce improper payments.  Additionally, by not reporting on accountability steps, RHS is not providing  Congress and OMB information they may need for overseeing  implementation of IPIA.", "OMB Circular A-123 requires agencies to develop and implement  corrective actions to address the root causes of improper payments. Our  review of USDA\u2019s PARs for fiscal years 2008 through 2011 and  documentation from RHS found that RHS developed and generally  followed through on corrective actions over that period (see table 3).  RHS\u2019s corrective actions included educating property managers about  improper payments, enhancing RHS\u2019s reviews of improper payments, and  seeking access to data for verifying tenant incomes. For example, in  2011, RHS met with housing industry groups about the results of its most  recent improper payments audit. This meeting prompted the groups to  develop training for property managers on how to reduce improper  payments. In 2010, RHS worked with OMB to develop legislation that  would grant RHS access to HHS\u2019s New Hires database for income  verification purposes. The legislative proposal, entitled the \u201cRural Housing  Fraud Prevention Act of 2012,\u201d would amend Section 453(j) of the Social  Security Act. As previously noted, the proposed legislation was included  in the President\u2019s budget for fiscal year 2013. Additionally, in 2008, RHS  enhanced its triennial supervisory visits (on-site reviews of assisted  properties that cover a number of physical, financial, and management  issues) to include reviews of tenant files that assess compliance with  income calculation and documentation requirements. RHS subsequently  enhanced its Multi-Family Information System (MFIS) to track the number  and results of these reviews.", "RHS uses a number of methods to reduce improper payments but has  not used a database cited in a 2010 presidential memorandum that could  help RHS identify cases in which rental assistance payments should be  discontinued or adjusted. In addition, RHS has experienced delays in  implementing a recovery audit program to comply with IPERA  requirements.", "OMB Circular A-123 states that federal agencies should take all  necessary steps to ensure the accuracy and integrity of federal payments.  OMB cites a number of steps that agencies can take to do so, including  prepayment reviews, quality-control checks to detect improper payments  that may have occurred, and data matching. Also, in June 2010, the  President issued a memorandum entitled Enhancing Payment Accuracy  Through a \u201cDo Not Pay List.\u201d The memorandum directs federal agencies  to review current prepayment and preaward procedures and ensure that a  thorough review of available databases with relevant information on  eligibility occurs before the release of any federal funds. The  memorandum states that, at a minimum, agencies should check SSA\u2019s  Death Master File, the General Services Administration\u2019s Excluded  Parties List System, the Department of the Treasury\u2019s (Treasury) Debt  Check Database, the HHS OIG\u2019s List of Excluded Individuals/Entities, and  HUD\u2019s Credit Alert System or Credit Alert Interactive Voice Response   These databases\u2014which constitute the \u201cDo Not Pay List\u201d\u2014can  System.help agencies determine if an individual or entity is ineligible for payments  or payments made on their behalf.

For example, as  part of their triennial supervisory visits to assisted properties, RHS local  offices check the accuracy of rental subsidy calculations and the  adequacy of supporting documentation for samples of tenant files. Also,  as previously noted, RHS has reached agreements with 31 states that  give RHS offices in those states the ability to match income information  submitted by tenants to state wage data.", "However, RHS has not used the \u201cDo Not Pay\u201d databases to check tenant  eligibility before making rental assistance payments to property owners.", "RHS officials told us that they had not considered using the \u201cDo Not Pay\u201d  databases for the rental assistance program because some of the  databases do not contain information relevant to eligibility for rental  assistance and because RHS lacks an automated method for checking  rental assistance payments against the databases. Nevertheless, RHS  officials acknowledged that some of the information was potentially  useful. Additionally, a representative from USDA\u2019s Office of the Chief  Financial Officer said that USDA agencies currently check some of the  \u201cDo Not Pay\u201d databases for some of their programs. The official noted  that USDA was in the process of getting access to a Treasury web portal,  which was established to meet the requirements of the President\u2019s \u201cDo  Not Pay\u201d memorandum. The web portal is intended to provide a single  point through which federal agencies can access the \u201cDo Not Pay\u201d  databases to help determine eligibility for a benefit, grant, or contract  award. Treasury offers agencies three options for using the databases:  (1) online access, which allows users to compare individual records  against the \u201cDo Not Pay\u201d databases via an Internet browser; (2) batch  processing, which allows users to send a file to Treasury to compare a  large number of records against the databases at one time; and   (3) continuous monitoring, which allows users to store files with Treasury  and continuously compare the files against the databases.", "The USDA representative said his office was in the process of entering  into an online processing agreement with Treasury\u2019s Bureau of Public  Debt, which he indicated will require legal review by USDA\u2019s Office of  General Counsel. He also indicated that USDA was considering pursuing  a batch processing agreement, which would require a separate  agreement and legal review. Although RHS officials told us they had not  considered the benefits of batch processing for the rental assistance  program, a batch processing or continuous monitoring agreement would  allow RHS to regularly check tenant records against the Death Master  File or other applicable \u201cDo Not Pay\u201d databases. As previously discussed,  this matching against the Death Master File could help RHS identify  instances in which rental assistance should be terminated or adjusted.", "USDA has not yet instituted a recovery audit program to implement  requirements included in IPERA and OMB implementing guidance. As a  result, RHS does not currently have a recovery auditing capability. The  process of identifying and recapturing overpayments is known as  recovery auditing. IPERA placed increased emphasis on this process by  requiring agencies to conduct recovery audits for each program and  activity that expends more than $1 million, if conducting such audits is  determined to be cost-effective. Previously, requirements for recovery  audits were focused on payments to contractors and limited to agencies  that entered into contracts with a total value in excess of $500 million in a  fiscal year. IPERA decreased the threshold for when recovery audits are  required to $1 million in annual outlays and expanded the scope of the  audits to include grants, loans, benefits, and other assistance. IPERA  allows federal agencies to hire private-sector contract auditors who  receive a percentage of the overpayments they collect. OMB guidance  states that agencies are to establish and report annual recovery targets,  beginning with fiscal year 2011. However, as previously noted, USDA  said in its fiscal year 2011 PAR that it was unable to report the amounts it  expected to recover because it had not yet awarded a recovery audit  contract.", "USDA plans to implement a recovery auditing program by hiring a  contractor.  According to USDA, the agency previously procured  recovery audits of contract payments through FedSource (an interagency  contracting service that was run by Treasury), but in fiscal year 2010,  FedSource closed out the procurement contract USDA had been using.In March 2011, USDA issued a request for proposals (RFP) to solicit the  broader range of recovery auditing services required by IPERA. However,  USDA terminated the RFP process after determining the proposals it  received did not meet the requirements of its payment recapture/recovery  audit plan, which called for an auditing contractor that could cover the  breadth of USDA programs and activities. USDA told us that the audit  firms that responded to the RFP had experience in contract recovery  auditing but lacked sufficient knowledge and experience for IPERA\u2019s  expanded focus on programs. As a result, USDA did not conduct any  recovery audits in fiscal year 2011 and issued a second RFP in August  2011 that specified the department\u2019s broader needs.

RHS\u2019s program serves over a quarter of a million  low-income tenants and expended more than $1 billion in fiscal year  2011. Because the program is not an entitlement, not all eligible  households receive rental subsidies. As a result, subsidy overpayments  effectively reduce the resources available to serve the program\u2019s target  population.

We reviewed RHS\u2019s policies and procedures  for determining and processing rental subsidy payments to identify steps  in the subsidy process where improper payments can occur. We also  reviewed provisions in the Improper Payments Information Act of 2002  (IPIA), as amended, and Appendix C of Office of Management and  Budget (OMB) Circular A-123 to determine the types of payments that  should be classified as improper. To supplement our understanding of the  sources of improper rental assistance payments, we interviewed RHS  officials and representatives from the Council for Affordable Rural  Housing and the National Affordable Housing Management Association.", "To determine the extent to which RHS has examined the magnitude of  improper rental assistance payments, we reviewed the improper  payments audits and PARs cited previously. We used this information to  analyze trends in RHS\u2019s estimated gross improper payments and gross  error rates from fiscal years 2007 through 2010. We focused on that time  frame because RHS used a somewhat different methodology and had  different types of personnel conducting the audits prior to that period. For  example, the audit for fiscal year 2007 marked the point at which staff  from RHS\u2019s Centralized Servicing Center (CSC), rather than RHS field  staff, began performing the audits. We also reviewed Appendix C of OMB  Circular A-123 to determine OMB\u2019s thresholds for identifying programs  that are susceptible to significant improper payments. We compared  RHS\u2019s error estimates with the current OMB thresholds and the  thresholds that will take effect in fiscal year 2013.", "We performed a more detailed analysis of the payment errors found in the  improper payments audit for fiscal year 2010 by obtaining and reviewing  an RHS database containing the 666 randomly selected payments  reviewed by CSC auditors. Among other things, the database included  the dollar amount and types of errors, if any, that the auditors identified  for each payment. We reviewed CSC\u2019s written audit procedures and  examined the extent to which CSC followed them, including criteria for  classifying payments as improper. We also interviewed CSC officials  about how they conducted the audit and their reasons for any deviations  from written audit procedures. Additionally, we interviewed RHS officials  about how they used the results of the audit to make programwide error  estimates and their rationale for excluding payments of less that $100  from these estimates. Using information in the database, we determined  the proportions of improper payments that fell within different ranges,  including above and below RHS\u2019s $100 exclusion threshold and above  and below HUD\u2019s $5 exclusion threshold. We calculated what the  estimated amount of gross improper payments and the gross error rate  would have been for the rental assistance program if RHS had included  all improper payments in its estimates and compared these figures with  the ones RHS reported. We interviewed OMB officials about RHS\u2019s  exclusion threshold and the extent to which they had reviewed or  provided guidance to RHS on its estimation methodology, including the  threshold. We also reviewed IPIA provisions describing OMB\u2019s  responsibilities for reviewing agency estimation methodologies.", "To assess the reliability of the data in the database of 666 sampled  payments, we conducted reasonableness checks, including tests for  missing data and outliers, on key data elements that RHS used to  estimate improper payments. In addition, we reviewed RHS  documentation about the database and interviewed RHS staff responsible  for maintaining the data. Because RHS drew the payment sample from  RHS\u2019s Multi-Family Information System, we also reviewed the processes  RHS had in place to safeguard the accuracy and reliability of data in the  system. On the basis of this review, we determined that the data in the  database of sampled payments were sufficiently reliable for purposes of  our analysis."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Compliance with Requirements Concerning Improper Payments", "paragraphs": ["To determine the extent to which RHS complied with applicable  requirements and guidance concerning improper payments, we reviewed  provisions in IPIA, as amended; associated OMB guidance; and various  RHS and USDA documents. To determine whether RHS met  requirements for estimating improper payments, we reviewed Appendix C  of OMB Circular A-123, which contains specific rules for sampling  payments and the level of precision that error estimates must have. We  compared these requirements with information presented in RHS\u2019s  improper payments audit for fiscal year 2010, the statistical sampling plan  underlying the audit, and USDA\u2019s fiscal year 2011 PAR. In addition, we  reviewed the techniques and formulas RHS used to generate its fiscal  year 2010 payment sample and produce estimates from the sample and  found them to be statistically sound. To assess whether RHS met  reporting requirements, we examined Appendix C of OMB Circular A-123,  as well as OMB Circular A-136, which set forth specific information that  agencies should include in their annual PARs about improper payments.  We reviewed USDA\u2019s fiscal year 2011 PAR to determine the extent to  which it contained the required information. Because the reporting  requirements call for agencies to identify corrective actions they have  taken or plan to take, we also identified RHS corrective actions described  in USDA\u2019s PARs from fiscal years 2008 through 2011 and determined the  status of those actions as of March 2012. We reviewed information  regarding these corrective actions, including RHS correspondence, draft  legislation, and other documents, as well as reporting by USDA\u2019s Office of  the Inspector General (OIG). We also interviewed RHS and OMB officials  about RHS\u2019s efforts to comply with improper payments requirements and  guidance.", "To assess RHS\u2019s use of required or recommended techniques to reduce  and recover improper payments, we reviewed guidance contained in  OMB Circular A-123, a 2010 presidential memorandum on ensuring  payment accuracy through a \u201cDo Not Pay List,\u201d and provisions in IPIA, as  amended by the Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Act of  2010 (IPERA). We reviewed documentation\u2014including USDA PARs,  RHS improper payments audits, and USDA OIG reporting\u2014describing  the methods RHS has used to help reduce improper payments. We also  interviewed RHS officials and a representative from USDA\u2019s Office of the  Chief Financial Officer about these methods, including the use of  databases that constitute the \u201cDo Not Pay List.\u201d With regard to RHS\u2019s  recovery of improper payments, we reviewed USDA\u2019s PAR for fiscal year  2011, which contains a summary of USDA\u2019s efforts to implement the  recovery audit provisions in IPERA. We also reviewed USDA\u2019s payment  capture/recovery audit plan and fiscal year 2011 requests for proposals to  solicit the services of a recovery auditing contractor. Finally, we  interviewed RHS officials and a representative from USDA\u2019s Office of the  Chief Financial Officer about the status of establishing a recovery audit  program in response to IPERA."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Potential Lessons Learned from HUD", "paragraphs": ["To determine the potential lessons RHS could learn from HUD\u2019s efforts to  reduce improper payments, we reviewed HUD\u2019s quality-control studies of  improper rental assistance payments (which are comparable to RHS\u2019s  improper payments audits) conducted for fiscal years 2000 through 2010.  We also reviewed information in HUD\u2019s PARs for fiscal years 2001  through 2011, which summarize the results of these studies and describe  HUD\u2019s corrective actions to address the causes of improper payments.  We used information from the PARs to examine trends in HUD\u2019s  estimated gross improper payments and gross error rate from fiscal years  2000 through 2010. Additionally, we reviewed findings from our prior work  on HUD\u2019s efforts to reduce payment errors and interviewed officials from  HUD\u2019s Offices of Public and Indian Housing, Multifamily Housing, and  Policy Development and Research about their more recent efforts.", "Our work emphasized the benefits and challenges associated with HUD\u2019s  web-based Enterprise Income Verification System (EIV) because RHS  lacks a comparable capability for verifying tenant incomes through data  matching. To determine the specific benefits of EIV, we reviewed  supplements to HUD\u2019s quality-control studies that focus specifically on the  data matching component of the studies and provide estimates of  improper payments due to income reporting errors. We analyzed changes  in HUD\u2019s estimates of income reporting errors from fiscal years 2000  through 2011. However, we could not draw statistically valid conclusions  about the changes, because the small number of households in HUD\u2019s  samples with unreported income resulted in estimates with large margins  of error. We also reviewed information on HUD\u2019s use of EIV to identify  and recover payments to deceased tenants and to correct inaccurate  tenant identifying information. Additionally, we interviewed the HUD  officials cited previously about the benefits they had seen from using the  system to annually estimate improper payments and help ensure the  integrity of rental assistance payments on an ongoing basis. To determine  the challenges associated with developing and implementing EIV, we  reviewed information from HUD about how EIV evolved, the agency\u2019s  efforts to negotiate data matching agreements with the Department of  Health and Human Services, estimated costs for developing and  maintaining the system, and staff resources dedicated to implementing  EIV and monitoring its use by program administrators. Further, we  reviewed HUD regulations, guidance, manuals, and training materials that  HUD developed to help implement EIV. Finally, we interviewed HUD  officials about these various efforts.", "We conducted this performance audit from July 2011 to May 2012 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
