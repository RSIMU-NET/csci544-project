In contrast, according to Pew, those who used cellphones to access the Internet in 2013 at lower rates tended to be seniors, the less educated, or rural populations. Only 22 percent of seniors ages 65 and older accessed the Internet using cellphones, compared to 85 percent of young people. GAO also found that access to the Internet using cellphones has increased, primarily due to lower cost, convenience, and technical advances.", "Although desktop and laptop computers are still the primary means of access, consumers are increasingly using mobile devices to access websites with government information and services.

Even so, mobile Internet users reportedly face a range of challenges accessing government services online.

In addition, five of the six agencies GAO interviewed have taken steps to improve access to their websites via mobile devices. For example, in 2012, the Department of Transportation (DOT) redesigned its main website, www.do t.gov, to p rovide a platform for mobile access.

However, small screens can also make it more difficult to read the content  of websites. Responsive web design is a method of designing content so  that it can be resized to fit on various screen sizes (e.g., designing a  service to work well on both a laptop screen and a smartphone, without  the need to develop and maintain separate \u201cstandard\u201d and \u201cmobile\u201d sites).  As we will discuss in more detail later in the report, some agencies we  selected have modified, or optimized, their websites, or have plans to do  so, to help mobile users access their information and services more  easily. Websites that have not been optimized can be more difficult to  view using mobile devices (see fig. 5). When a website does not  incorporate responsive design, consumers using mobile devices may  experience challenges efficiently accessing content.", "Further, excess information on government websites that have not been  optimized can make it challenging for mobile internet users. Government  websites in particular are not always streamlined with the end user in  mind, according to several consumer advocacy and agency officials. GAO  previously reported, for example, that the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s  website could do a better job meeting the needs of taxpayers by providing  taxpayers interactive personal account access. Government websites  may include unnecessary content, making it difficult for mobile users to  find the information they are looking for. Officials from FEMA and two  consumer advocacy organizations told us that occupying valuable  website space with unnecessary information or \u201cclutter\u201d can be a major  impediment and can make finding desired content more difficult for  seniors and individuals with vision impairment. Also, unnecessary  screens and functions prevent consumers from finding the information or  service they need within three clicks.too much unnecessary information can require individuals to \u201cdrill down\u201d  several layers to get to the information they need, violating the \u201cthree-click  rule.\u201d", "Navigating across different screens can also be difficult for mobile users.  Someone browsing the Internet using a desktop computer can view  content on multiple screens or tabs; however, doing so on a smartphone  (e.g., getting back to the home page) can be challenging. For example, a  mobile Internet user who finds a government form on a web page may  have difficulty going back to a previous page to find the instructions on  how to fill out the form. According to one FEMA official, disaster survivors  may find it inconvenient to access some of FEMA\u2019s emergency  management services on a mobile device due to navigational challenges,  small screens, and the need to input significant amounts of data. Officials  from the NEA and a consumer advocacy organization also added that  navigating or toggling between multiple screens on a government  website, especially when dealing with forms or applications, is more  challenging on a smartphone than on a desktop or laptop computer.", "Finally, mobile users sometimes face challenges accessing certain  websites as well as data-intensive portable document files (PDF) files\u2014 which can be slow to download on government web sites. Officials from  OMB noted that some websites take a long time to download using a  mobile phone.  Similarly, officials from DOT, DOI, and FEMA noted that  PDFs are difficult to download on a mobile device, in part because of the  large amount of data they contain. Some of these agencies are trying to  reduce the number of data-intensive PDF files on their websites, but a  number of these data-intensive PDFs are still present. Further, according  to agency and consumer-advocacy officials, downloading government  information using mobile devices can be cost-prohibitive, depending on  the data plan used, especially for certain segments of the population,  such as low-income individuals and seniors. Many mobile consumers  subscribe to data plans that may only provide as little as 500 megabytes  a month before they are assessed additional data fees.

NHTSA data from January through April 2014 indicated that  about 36 percent of the visits were in fact through mobile devices.

According  to FMCSA officials, they began developing SaferBus in 2011,  which became available for Apple devices in March 2012 and for  Android devices in February 2013. The funding used to develop it  covered a number of other projects; officials estimate that FMCSA  spent $150,000 to develop the initial Apple version and $300,000  to develop the Android version. They encountered challenges in  managing expectations for SaferBus but explained that this is  typical when developing apps. Specifically, some stakeholders  wanted FMCSA to develop a rating system, similar to NHTSA\u2019s  rating system used in SaferCar. However, according to the  officials, that type of rating system is outside of FMCSA\u2019s legal  authority.", "The QC Mobile app retrieves FMCSA\u2019s safety compliance and  enforcement data on commercial vehicle carriers.

For  example, the NWS works closely with private entities, such as news  organizations, that develop apps using NWS data. As a result, NWS  officials hesitate to develop federal government apps that would compete  with those developed by the private sector. Another agency, DOI,  prefers to let the market determine what apps the public wants, and allow  the private sector to develop them; agency officials believe this is a more  efficient use of agency resources. Private sector organizations have  developed apps for DOI, such as the Bureau of Land Management\u2019s  \u201cYonder\u201d app, which enables outdoor enthusiasts to find and share  information about hiking, biking, skiing, and mountain climbing.
