PPACA specified  the total amount issuers are to contribute each year to cover payments for  enrollees with high claims costs. For example, the amount of  reinsurance funds that was to be collected from and distributed to issuers  for the 2014 benefit year was $10 billion.

However, because of the temporary nature of the reinsurance program,  and after reviewing comments from rule-making, which included  comments from issuers, CMS ultimately chose to base contributions on a  flat per-enrollee amount because it is more straightforward for issuers and  less complex for CMS to administer. Additionally, in establishing the  basis for identifying enrollees as high-cost, CMS chose to use actual  claims costs incurred by the plan for each enrollee, rather than a list of  medical conditions identified as high risk.

CMS also modified the reinsurance program to  accommodate market changes resulting from its policy allowing states to  renew certain transitional plans until October 2, 2016. As a result of this  policy, CMS was concerned that healthier individuals were more likely to  remain enrolled in these non-PPACA compliant transitional plans, leaving  less healthy and higher-cost individuals to enroll in PPACA-compliant  plans. Because the policy was implemented in November 2013, after  issuers had set their premiums for 2014, there was an increased risk that  the premiums would not be adequate to cover higher than anticipated  claims costs.

According to  CMS, the system it developed\u2014known as the distributed data  approach\u2014allows enrollee claims data, which are needed to calculate  risk adjustment payments and charges and reinsurance payments and  contributions, to remain on the issuers\u2019 own servers. CMS provides each  issuer with software to calculate contributions but only the summary  reports generated by CMS\u2019s software are sent to the agency and not the  actual claims data. CMS told us that the system was designed to   (1) address privacy and data security concerns by minimizing the number  of transfers and amount of enrollee health information transferred,   (2) ensure that issuers\u2019 proprietary data remains with the issuer, and   (3) standardize software processes, timing, and rules uniformly across  issuers.", "CMS elected to use the distributed data approach after considering  comments from the industry through its rule-making process. In particular,  CMS initially considered three data collection options: a centralized data  collection system in which issuers send individual enrollee claims data  directly to CMS, a state-level approach in which states collected enrollee  claims data on behalf of CMS, and the distributed data approach. CMS  indicated that it received many comments in favor of the distributed data  approach because of the increased privacy and the fact that it eliminated  the administrative complexity of issuers transmitting claims data to CMS.", "In selecting the distributed data approach, however, CMS identified  potential tradeoffs. Specifically, it noted that this approach raises the  possibility that issuers could make errors when calculating their risk  scores. To address this concern, the agency said that it would augment  its data audit processes. CMS also indicated that some issuers,  particularly smaller companies, may be challenged by the administrative  complexity of the distributed data approach, and therefore this approach  may require more resources from CMS to support issuers with  implementation.", "CMS decided to leverage the distributed data approach to collect data for  both the risk adjustment and reinsurance programs in order to maximize  efficiency. As reinsurance is a temporary program, agency officials  believed it was not worth the resource investment for issuers or CMS to  develop a separate data collection system. As a result, the distributed  data approach is used for both programs, and issuers submit data to  CMS on the same schedule for both programs.", "For the risk corridors program, CMS officials said that the agency is using  an existing data system in an effort to maximize efficiency. Issuers will  submit data to CMS for calculating payment transfers through CMS\u2019s  Health Insurance Oversight System (HIOS), which issuers already use to  submit MLR data. Specifically, issuers use HIOS to submit data on their  total medical claims costs, expenses for quality improvement activities,  premiums, taxes and fees, and non-claims costs, which CMS will then  use to calculate whether issuers qualify for risk corridors payments or  owe contributions.

An initial delay occurred  when CMS changed the server requirements due to its concerns about  the administrative burden for the agency and to accommodate issuer  preferences. The servers used for the distributed data approach are  called the external data gathering environment (EDGE) servers. CMS  initially decided in May 2012 that each issuer would set up and maintain  its own physical EDGE servers, with the issuer downloading CMS  software to a server located on its premises. However, according to CMS  officials, when the agency tested these servers with a small sample of  issuers in late 2012 and early 2013, it found that it took the agency longer  than expected to load the necessary software onto each issuer\u2019s  individual server. CMS officials also said that the issuers involved in the  initial testing requested that CMS consider a virtual approach, in which  another entity would host the server rather than the issuers themselves.  In response to these concerns, CMS officials said that the agency  decided to develop a virtual EDGE server for issuers in late 2013 and  early 2014, furnished by Amazon Web Services. Once issuers uploaded  their claims data on to the virtual EDGE server, CMS\u2019s software would  generate detailed and summary reports to be transmitted to CMS.", "CMS\u2019s timeline for implementing the EDGE servers was delayed again  when it changed its plan for these servers a second time. After CMS  made the switch to the virtual EDGE server, some issuers that had  already purchased a physical on-premise server to comply with CMS\u2019s  initial requirements requested that CMS allow them to use those servers.  Therefore, in May 2014, CMS decided to allow issuers to use either  option, as well as an option to use a virtual server provided by an entity  other than Amazon Web Services\u2014known as a virtual on-premise server.  All three options allow issuers to maintain their data on private servers  that are only accessible to the issuer and use CMS software to generate  summary reports that are sent to the agency (see side bar). CMS officials  said that in addition to being responsive to issuer requests for flexibility,  they wanted to create multiple approaches to reflect the variation in issuer  size. For example, smaller issuers might find the virtual server option   more appealing if they do not have the administrative resources available  to purchase and maintain a physical on-premise server.", "Because of these changes in CMS\u2019s EDGE server requirements, the  agency was not able to adhere to its original timeline for uploading data  and providing program reports to issuers. CMS initially planned to have  issuers acquire and set up their servers in the first part of 2013 and to  then load software and configure the servers in the latter part of 2013.  This would have allowed issuers to upload enrollment and claims data on  a monthly basis starting in January 2014, and CMS planned to use these  data to generate issuer reports during 2014:", "CMS planned to provide quarterly reports to issuers with the  estimated amount of reinsurance program payments they would  receive for benefit year 2014. CMS officials said that these estimates  would allow issuers to more accurately account for reinsurance  payments when setting their premiums for benefit year 2015 and  beyond, as issuers set premiums in the year prior to the benefit year.", "CMS planned to provide interim estimate reports on risk adjustment  calculations throughout the benefit year as it did with the reinsurance  program. These reports were to include preliminary calculations of an  issuer\u2019s average risk score for each of its plans but not any data about  how an issuer\u2019s score compared to other issuers in its market, which  would be necessary for an issuer to estimate its potential contribution  or payment. CMS officials said that they did not plan to provide  relative market data to issuers in the estimate reports because CMS  may not have complete or correct data for all the issuers in a market  until the final data submission deadline on April 30 of the year  following the benefit year. They said that relative market data risk  scores based on incomplete data could present a misleading estimate  of an issuer\u2019s potential contribution or payment.", "However, CMS\u2019s plans for data collection and reporting were delayed. As  issuers were not able to begin loading data onto the EDGE servers until  September 27, 2014, CMS was not able to provide either quarterly  reinsurance reports or interim risk adjustment reports for benefit year  2014. Therefore, issuers did not have estimates of reinsurance payments  available from CMS to incorporate into their 2015 premium calculations.  CMS next planned to produce two risk adjustment estimate reports for  issuers, one in mid-December 2014 and one in May 2015. However, CMS  experienced further delays as issuers began uploading their data to the  EDGE servers. CMS officials noted that they were implementing a new  technology in a compressed timeframe, and that there were ongoing fixes  as they deployed the new software. As a result, CMS postponed the  deadline for issuers to upload their data to the EDGE servers from the  beginning to the end of December 2014, thus delaying CMS\u2019s issuance of  the first risk adjustment estimate reports to December 29, 2014, and the  first reinsurance estimate report to January 12, 2015 (see fig. 2). CMS  announced in January 2015 that it would provide monthly risk adjustment  and reinsurance estimate reports for the remainder of the data collection  period for benefit year 2014, which runs through April 30, 2015. Officials  said that the purpose of these monthly estimate reports is to allow CMS to  look at data discrepancies and quality issues before issuers upload their  final data. After benefit year 2014, CMS officials said the agency plans to  provide periodic risk adjustment and reinsurance estimate reports  throughout each benefit year.", "For the risk corridors program, CMS indicated that it expects to propose  and finalize a data collection tool from January to May 2015. Although  CMS is using an existing data system, HIOS, CMS officials said the  agency must still develop a new data collection tool within HIOS, which  will include new fields specifically for the risk corridors program. However,  the timeline for collecting these data is later, relative to the other two  programs. The calculation of risk corridors payments, as is also the case  with MLR rebates, incorporates risk adjustment program transfers and  reinsurance program payments and therefore must take place after CMS  makes those other calculations. Issuers must annually submit data for  both the risk corridors program and MLR payments by July 31 of the year  following the benefit year\u2014for example, July 31, 2015, for the 2014  benefit year.

For instance, a record may be rejected  if it has a value that is not the correct data type or the value is outside the  permitted range. The software on the EDGE server produces detailed  error reports\u2014with information on the errors in specific records\u2014for  issuers and provides summary error reports to CMS that aggregate the  number of records that were submitted, accepted, and rejected by plan,  year, and month. CMS plans to use the summary error reports to  understand if issuers have submitted data for all of their plans and  whether the data submission includes claims and enrollment data for all  months of the benefit year. CMS officials said that the reports will also be  used to identify software problems and particular issuers that may need  additional support. Going forward, the agency plans to use the reports for  additional analyses, such as analyses of the type and volume of issuer  claims for the risk adjustment program. Issuers are also supposed to  report data discrepancies to CMS for benefit year 2014 as they receive  monthly estimate reports from January through May 2015, including if the  results of the calculations in the reports are inconsistent with either the  risk adjustment or reinsurance payment methodologies, or if any claims or  enrollment data were incorrectly excluded from the calculations. For the  risk corridors program, CMS officials told us that the agency was in the  process of developing data verification procedures at the time of our  report, including automatic data checks that were going to be built into the  data collection system. Officials said that they are applying lessons  learned from the MLR data verification procedures to the data verification  procedures for the risk corridors program.", "In addition to automatic data verification checks, CMS requires issuers to  conduct a third-party risk adjustment data validation audit of their risk  adjustment program, starting with a 2015 audit of 2014 benefit year data.  The third-party audits address individual claims data that CMS does not  receive in the summary reports generated by issuers in the distributed  data approach. CMS will require issuers to conduct the data audits  annually in two phases. For the first phase, each issuer must have a  sample of its risk adjustment data, as selected by CMS, audited by an  independent party. The audit must include validation of all enrollment,  demographic, and medical data for enrollees in the data sample. For the  second phase, CMS will audit a sub-sample of validated data from the  initial audit. Beginning with 2016 benefit year data, CMS will adjust the  amount issuers owe or receive under the risk adjustment program based  on the audit results. Given the complexity of the risk adjustment program  and the audit process, the agency was concerned that adjusting  payments and charges without first gathering information on the  prevalence of data errors could lead to a costly and potentially ineffective  audit program.", "CMS officials told us that they are in the process of developing standard  operating procedures for auditing the reinsurance and risk corridors  programs. They said that they are developing a contract for auditing  issuers\u2019 reinsurance and risk corridors data submissions.

The  bid request identified general research and development tasks for the risk  adjustment program, such as analysis of the impact of market and  enrollee factors on the model, evaluation of the accuracy of the risk  adjustment program, and research to support adaptation of the model.
