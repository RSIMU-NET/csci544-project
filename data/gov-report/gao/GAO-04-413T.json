Weaknesses in these processes and controls resulted in over- and underpayments and late active duty payments and, in some cases, large erroneously assessed debts, to mobilized Army Guard personnel. The end result of these weaknesses is to severely constrain DOD's ability to provide active duty pay to these personnel, many of whom were risking their lives in combat in Iraq and Afghanistan. In addition, these pay problems have had a profound impact on individual soldiers and their families and may adversely impact on decisions to stay in the Army Guard. For example, many soldiers and their families were required to spend considerable time, sometimes while the soldiers were deployed in remote, hostile environments overseas, seeking corrections to active duty pays and allowances. The pay process, involving potentially hundreds of DOD, Army, and Army Guard organizations and thousands of personnel, was not well understood or consistently applied with respect to determining (1) the actions required to make timely, accurate pays to mobilized soldiers, and (2) the organization responsible for taking the required actions. With respect to human capital, we found weaknesses including (1) insufficient resources allocated to pay processing, (2) inadequate training related to existing policies and procedures, and (3) poor customer service. Several systems issues were also significant factors impeding accurate and timely payroll payments to mobilized Army Guard soldiers, including (1) nonintegrated systems, (2) limitations in system processing capabilities, and (3) ineffective system edits."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for the opportunity to discuss controls over payroll payments to  mobilized Army National Guard (Army Guard) soldiers.

A reported 93,000 Army Guard soldiers\u2014 accounting for about a third of all mobilized reserve forces\u2014were  activated as of March 2003. These forces were deployed on various  important missions across the United States and overseas in support of  Operations Noble Eagle and Enduring Freedom, including search and  destroy missions against the Taliban and al Qaeda; guarding al Qaeda  prisoners held at Guantanamo Bay; providing security at the Pentagon and  military bases; and carrying out military police functions in Iraq.  Particularly given the critical and continuing roles Army Guard soldiers  play in carrying out vital military and security missions, effective controls  are needed to provide timely and accurate pays and allowances to these  soldiers. Pay-related problems are not only costly and time-consuming to  resolve, but result in financial hardship for soldiers and their families.  In  addition, there are indications that these pay problems are beginning to  have an adverse effect on the Army\u2019s ability to retain these valuable Army  Guard personnel.", "Because current DOD operations used to pay mobilized Army Guard  soldiers relied extensively on error-prone, manual transactions entered into  multiple, nonintegrated systems, we did not statistically test controls in this  area.

We found that these pay problems could be attributed to  control breakdowns similar to those we found at our case study units,  including pay system input errors associated with amended orders, delays  and errors in coding pay and allowance transactions, and slow customer  service response. For example, available documentation and interviews  indicate that while several soldiers submitted required supporting  documentation to start certain pays and allowances at the time of their  initial mobilization in January 2003, over 20 soldiers were still not receiving  these pays in August 2003.

However, we found a significant number of  instances in which critical coordination requirements were not clearly  defined.

When pay technicians at the West Virginia USPFO attempted to  help take care of some of the West Virginia National Guard soldiers\u2019 pay problems, they  were told by personnel at DFAS-Indianapolis not to get involved because the active Army  finance offices had primary responsibility for correcting the unit\u2019s pay issues.", "Eventually, the sergeant was ordered to travel to the finance office at Camp Doha,  Kuwait, to get its assistance in fixing the pay problems.

As a result, we identified numerous instances in which military  pay technicians at both the USPFOs and active Army finance office  locations made data coding errors when entering transaction codes into the  pay systems.

This problem  was caused by weaknesses in the processes designed to work around the  lack of integrated pay and personnel systems.  Further, the problem was  not detected because reconciliations of pay and personnel data were not  performed timely.  Specifically, it was not until over 3 months after the  soldier\u2019s discharge, through its September 2002 end-of-month  reconciliation, that the Mississippi Army National Guard USPFO identified  the overpayment and took action on October 2, 2002, to stop the  individual\u2019s pay.  However, collection efforts on the $9,400 overpayment did  not begin until July 2003, when we pointed out this situation to USPFO  officials."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Pay System Has Limited Active Duty Pay Processing Capabilities", "paragraphs": ["DOD has acknowledged that DJMS-RC was not designed to process payroll  payments to mobilized Army Guard soldiers for extended periods of active  duty.  Consequently, it is not surprising that we found a number of  \u201cworkarounds\u201d\u2014procedures intended to compensate for existing DJMS- RC processing limitations with respect to Army Guard active duty pays.   Such manual workarounds are inefficient and create additional labor- intensive, error-prone transaction processing.", "Because of limited DJMS-RC processing capabilities, the Army Guard  USPFO and in-theatre active Army area servicing finance office pay  technicians are required to manually enter transactions for nonautomated  pay and allowances every month.  DJMS-RC was originally designed to  process payroll payments to Army Reserve and Army Guard personnel on  weekend drills, or on short periods of annual active duty (periods of less  than 30 days in duration) or for training. With Army Guard personnel now  being paid from DJMS-RC for extended periods of active duty (as long as 2  years at a time), DFAS officials told us that the COBOL/mainframe-based  system was now being stretched to the limits of its functionality.  In several  of the case study units we audited, we found a number of instances in  which soldiers were underpaid their entitled pays that must be entered  each month manually (such as foreign language proficiency, special duty  assignment, or hardship duty pays) because pay technicians did not enter  the monthly manual transaction input required to initiate those pays every  month.", "In addition, we found a significant number of soldiers were overpaid when  they were demobilized from active duty before the stop date specified in  their original mobilization orders.  This occurred because pay technicians  did not update the stop date in DJMS-RC necessary to terminate the  automated active duty pays when soldiers leave active duty early.  For  example, the military finance office in Kuwait, responsible for paying  Virginia 20th Special Forces soldiers in the fall of 2002, did not stop hostile  fire and hardship duty pays as required when these soldiers left  Afghanistan in October 2002.  We found that 55 of 64 soldiers eligible for  hostile fire pay were overpaid for at least 1 month beyond their departure  from Afghanistan.", "Further, these month-to-month pays and allowances were not separately  itemized on the soldiers\u2019 leave and earnings statements in a user-friendly  format.  Instead, many of these pays appeared as lump sum payments  under \u201cother credits.\u201d  In many cases these \u201cother credit\u201d pay and  allowances appeared with little explanation.  As a result, we found  indications that Army Guard soldiers had difficulty using the leave and  earnings statements to determine if they received all entitled active duty  pays and allowances.  Without such basic customer service, the soldiers  cannot readily determine whether they received all entitled active duty  pays and allowances.", "As shown in the example leave and earnings statement extract included in  figure 3, an Army Guard soldier who received a series of corrections to  special duty assignment pay along with their current special duty  assignment payment of $110 is likely to have difficulty discerning whether  he or she received all and only entitled active duty pays and allowances.", "In yet another example, one sergeant, apparently having difficulty  deciphering his leave and earnings statement, wrote a letter to a fellow  service member asking, \u201cAre they really fixing pay issues or are they  putting them off till we return?  If they are waiting, then what happens to  those who (god forbid) don\u2019t make it back?\u201d  This sergeant was killed in  action in Afghanistan on April 15, 2002, before he knew if his pay problems  were resolved."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "System Edits Do Not Prevent Large Payments or Debts", "paragraphs": ["While DJMS-RC has several effective edits to prevent certain  overpayments, it lacks effective edits to reject large proposed net pays over  $4,000 at midmonth and over $7,000 at end of month before their final  processing.  We found several instances in our case studies where soldiers  received large lump sum payments, possibly related to previous  underpayments or other pay errors, with no explanation.  Further, the lack  of preventive controls over large payments poses an increased risk of  fraudulent payments.", "Individual Case Illustration: System Edits Do Not Prevent Large Payments and  Debts  A sergeant with the Colorado Army National Guard, Special Forces, encountered  numerous severe pay problems associated with his mobilization to active duty, including  his deployment to Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. The  sergeant\u2019s active duty pay and other pay and allowances should have been stopped on  December 4, 2002, when he was released from active duty. However, because the  sergeant\u2019s mobilization orders called him to active duty for 730 days and not the 365  days that he was actually mobilized, and the Army area servicing finance office at the  demobilization station, Fort Campbell, did not enter the release from active duty date  into DJMS-RC, the sergeant continued to improperly receive payments, as if he were still  on active duty, for 2 and a half months after he was released from active duty totaling  over $8,000. The sergeant was one of 34 soldiers in the company whose pay continued  after their release from active duty. In an attempt to stop the erroneous payments, in  February 2003, pay personnel at the Colorado USPFO created a transaction to cancel  the tour instead of processing an adjustment to amend the stop date consistent with the  date on the Release from Active Duty Order. When this occurred, DJMS-RC  automatically processed a reversal of 11 months of the sergeant\u2019s pay and allowances  that he earned while mobilized from March 1, 2002, through February 4, 2003, which  created a debt in the amount of $39,699 on the soldier\u2019s pay record; however, the  reversal should have only been from December 5, 2002, through February 4, 2003. In  April 2003, at our request, DFAS-Indianapolis personnel intervened in an attempt to  correct the large debt and to determine the actual amount the sergeant owed. In May  2003, DFAS-Indianapolis erroneously processed a payment transaction instead of a debt  correction transaction in DJMS-RC. This created a payment of $20,111, which was  electronically deposited to the sergeant\u2019s bank account without explanation, while a debt  of $30,454 still appeared on his Leave and Earnings Statement. About 9 months after  his demobilization, the sergeant\u2019s unpaid debt balance was reportedly $26,559, but the  actual amount of his debt had not yet been determined as of September 2003.", "DOD has a system enhancement project underway for which one of the  major expected benefits is the improvement of military pay accuracy and  timeliness.  However, the effort to replace over 80 legacy personnel, pay,  training, and manpower systems (including DJMS-RC) has been underway  for over 5 years and DOD has encountered challenges fielding the system.   In the nearer term, the department reported that it expected to field a  system to replace the current DFAS system used to process pays to  mobilized Army Guard soldiers by March 2005.  However, given that the pay  system is only one of several non-integrated systems the department  currently relies on to authorize and pay mobilized Army Guard soldiers, it  is likely that the department will continue to operate with many of the  existing system constraints for at least several more years."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Actions to Improve Accuracy and Timeliness of Army Guard Pay", "paragraphs": ["While it is likely that DOD will be required to rely on existing systems for a  number of years, a complete and lasting solution to the pay problems we  identified will only be achieved through a complete reengineering, not only  of the automated systems, but also of the supporting processes and human  capital practices in this area.  However, our related report (GAO-04-89)  detailed immediate actions that can be taken in these areas to improve the  timeliness and accuracy of pay and allowance payments to activated Army  Guard soldiers.  The need for such actions is increasingly imperative in  light of the current extended deployment of Army Guard soldiers in their  crucial role in Operation Iraqi Freedom and anticipated additional  mobilizations in support of this operation.
