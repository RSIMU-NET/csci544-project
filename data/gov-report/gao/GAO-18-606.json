That same year, an estimated 13 million young adults aged  18 to 25 used illicit substances\u2014about 38 percent of all young adults.  The repeated use of illicit substances among adolescents and young  adults can result in substance use disorders, which are characterized by  symptoms such as the inability to fulfill work, school, and family  obligations. According to the Surgeon General, most people who develop  a substance use disorder begin using substances during adolescence  and develop a disorder by young adulthood, and the use of illicit  substances can adversely affect the developing brain. In addition, the  use of illicit substances can lead to death. In 2016 about 5,400  adolescents and young adults between the ages of 15 and 24 died as a  result of a drug overdose\u2014a rate that has increased nearly 300 percent  since 1999.", "In fiscal year 2016 the federal government spent $11.3 billion on  substance use prevention, treatment, and recovery services and  research.

This study is a longitudinal study that plans to collect data  from a sample of about 11,000 children across the country for 10 years,  beginning when they are 9 or 10 years old. Twenty-one research sites  across the country were selected to collect information from children  about their brain development, genetics, substance use, mental health,  physical health, environment, and other measures. In addition, this study  is funding a data analysis and informatics center to develop the  procedures for data collection, create and maintain a common database  pooling data from all of the research sites, and conduct data analysis.  According to NIDA officials, data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive  Development study will be made available to researchers for future use  through a data archive. In fiscal year 2017, 15 federal grants provided  funding for this study, of which NIDA contributed $18.1 million."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Stakeholders Identified Gaps in Services and Research for Adolescents and Young Adults, and Ongoing Federal Efforts Aim to Address Gaps Stakeholders Identified Gaps in Services for Adolescents and Young Adults, and Federal Agencies Have Ongoing Efforts to Address Them", "paragraphs": ["Stakeholders that we interviewed identified various gaps in services, and  among the most frequently cited were a lack of available recovery  services and treatment providers for adolescents and young adults with  substance use disorders.

They  also identified other gaps, such as a lack of knowledge about how to  effectively communicate to adolescents and young adults the harms of  substance use. Officials from HHS\u2019s NIDA agreed that such gaps in  research exist.", "Gaps in substance use research related to adolescents and young  adults. Stakeholders commonly identified the following gaps in research:", "Substance use disorder treatment with adolescents. Four of  the stakeholders we interviewed identified gaps in adolescent- specific substance use disorder treatment research. Officials  from one research organization said that it can be challenging to  recruit a sufficient number of adolescents with a substance use  disorder to participate in research studies focused on substance  use treatment, both because fewer adolescents have such  disorders compared to adults, and because adolescents\u2014or  potentially their parents\u2014may be in denial about the need for  treatment. These officials further stated that having too few  funding announcements that focus on adolescent-specific  research contributes to the gaps in research in this area, because  it is easier for researchers to simply work with adults when  announcements do not specify an age group of interest. An official  from another research organization said there is also a gap in  knowledge about how to deliver treatment services to adolescents  in ways that are developmentally appropriate. The official stated  that adolescents who receive treatment services generally are  less likely to complete substance use disorder treatment, and, as  a result, additional research is needed to identify how to engage  and retain adolescents in a developmentally appropriate way. The  official explained that adolescents often do not believe they need  treatment and are not certain they want to stop using substances.", "Recovery services. Three of the stakeholders we interviewed  identified gaps in recovery service research for adolescents and  young adults. Officials from one advocacy and education  organization said there has been little research conducted to  determine the types of recovery services that are most effective  for adolescents in preventing relapse. Officials from one research  organization said that it would be beneficial to develop a variety of  recovery services, since services are likely to vary in effectiveness  for different groups of adolescents and young adults.", "Translating research into practice. Three of the stakeholders  we interviewed identified gaps in knowledge about how to  translate evidence-based services from research into sustainable,  real world practices. For example, an official from one research  organization explained that translating evidence-based treatment  services from research into real world settings can be difficult for a  variety of reasons\u2014such as, because services that are grant- funded may have components that are impractical to implement or  are not reimbursable. The official said one example of such an  impractical component would be having an expert observer  periodically rate the fidelity of providers\u2019 implementation of the  service\u2014a component that makes sense when testing the efficacy  of the service under the grant, but which can be disruptive to  workflow and may not be reimbursable by insurers once the grant  ends. Officials from another research organization similarly  commented that more research is needed to identify which  components of services make them effective.", "Communicating harms of substance use. Officials from two of  the three research organizations identified a gap in knowledge  about how to effectively communicate the harms of substance use  to adolescents and young adults. They stated that it is particularly  difficult to effectively communicate the harms of cannabis to  adolescents and young adults. One official explained that societal  changes in attitudes towards cannabis have made it more difficult  to convince adolescents of both its harm and of the need for  treatment when its use develops into a substance use disorder.", "Federal response to gaps in research. Officials from NIDA agreed that  these gaps in research exist and explained that while additional research  is needed to address them, the process by which NIDA funds research  through grants ultimately relies on researchers to submit proposals for  consideration. While NIDA officials stated that researchers can submit  proposals for research projects addressing adolescent or young adult  substance use prevention, treatment, or recovery under general funding  announcements for grants, NIDA also had eight funding announcements  (as of May 2018) that either focused on these age groups or included  them as a population of interest, three of which were new as of fiscal year  2018."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to HHS, DOJ, ONDCP, and Education  for comment.
