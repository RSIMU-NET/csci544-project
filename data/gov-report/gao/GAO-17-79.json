This report examined (1) to what extent selected agencies' actions to manage in an environment of declining resources aligned with GAO's framework and (2) the effects, if any, declines in discretionary spending after 2009 had on services to the public at selected agencies.", "GAO applied its framework to three agencies selected based on budget data from FY 2010 through 2014. For the larger agencies (EPA and ETA), GAO selected two programs within each agency for review. GAO reviewed agency documents; and interviewed agency officials, program partners, and external stakeholders."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The three selected agencies GAO reviewed for this report\u2014the Employment and Training Administration (ETA), Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers (FLETC), and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)\u2014each took a number of different approaches to manage declining resources that aligned with the three key themes outlined in GAO's framework. For example:", "Top Management Should Lead Efforts to Manage Declining Resources. ETA's Office of Foreign Labor Certification top management led efforts to ensure the agency maintains capacity to achieve its mission by taking steps to restructure its workforce to better use existing staff to address changes in workload. This includes cross-training its workforce to achieve greater interoperability of employees among its three processing centers.", "Data Analytics Should Guide Decision Making. EPA used Lean Six Sigma, a data-driven process-improvement methodology, to evaluate agency processes and identify opportunities to make them more efficient. For example, EPA's Office of Pesticide Programs reported that it reduced the time it takes to post pesticide product labels, which provide critical information about proper use and handling of pesticides.", "Agencies Should Develop Cost-Cutting and Cost-Avoidance Strategies. FLETC reported that in FY 2013 and 2014 the agency reviewed its service contracts to identity potential cost avoidance opportunities. As a result, FLETC reported avoiding roughly $8 million out of $81 million in service contracts by reducing or eliminating nonessential services, such as reducing hours for the information technology (IT) service desk support and consolidating security guard services.", "However, opportunities exist for top management at selected agencies to take additional actions to ensure they maintain capacity to achieve their missions and avoid costs. For example, FLETC is working to develop an Online Campus initiative, which would provide distance-learning opportunities and represents a potential long-term cost avoidance strategy that could help the agency maintain capacity to provide necessary law enforcement training. However, FLETC has not yet finalized its plan for the Online Campus with steps and timeframes needed to ensure successful implementation. At ETA, the most recent recession tested the Unemployment Insurance (UI) program's capacity, but ETA has yet to systematically identify lessons learned to help ensure UI maintains capacity should workload increase again. Following through on these actions could help agencies better manage limited resources and maintain capacity to achieve their missions.", "Some agency officials and stakeholders reported that actions taken by the selected agencies affected timeliness and service level for some programs. While some stakeholder organizations commended the agencies for their efforts to continue to achieve their missions with fewer resources, they also noted that some actions had negative effects on individuals, businesses, states, localities, and others. The effects they cited included delays in receiving unemployment benefits and disruptions to businesses resulting from delays in processing foreign labor applications and pesticide registration applications."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO makes three recommendations, including that FLETC finalize its plan for the Online Campus and ETA systematically identify lessons learned by the UI program that could help it respond to future economic downturns.

GAO continues to believe the recommendation is valid as discussed in the report."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Discretionary appropriations are budgetary resources provided in and  controlled through appropriations acts. They fund many of the activities  commonly associated with the federal government. These include the  day-to-day operations of executive branch agencies as well as national  defense, federal law enforcement activities, food safety, environmental  protection, and investment-oriented spending on infrastructure and basic  research. Discretionary appropriations declined by roughly 12 percent  between fiscal years 2010 and 2015. In 2011, Congress enacted the  Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA), which amended the Balanced Budget  and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (BBEDCA), to impose  spending limits (or caps) on discretionary appropriations for fiscal years  2012 through 2021. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects  that under these limits, discretionary spending will continue to decline as  a share of the economy and within the next 5 years will be lower as a  share of gross domestic product (GDP) than any level seen in the last 50  years. In this budget environment, agencies may need to look for  opportunities to reconsider priorities, determine how and in what areas to  make tradeoffs, and evaluate the potential immediate and long-term  effects of these decisions. Declining discretionary resources can prompt  agencies to re-examine core missions, increase efficiency, and innovate.  Effectively managing the resources that agencies have available is vital to  ensuring that they can continue to effectively achieve their missions and  deliver services to the public.", "Given the recent budget trends and anticipated future fiscal outlook, you  asked us to examine the specific actions agencies are taking to manage  with declining resources. This includes some of the specific activities that  agencies reduced and any effects on external stakeholders in terms of  service and program delivery. This report examined (1) to what extent  selected agencies\u2019 actions aligned with our framework for managing in an  environment of declining resources and (2) the effects, if any, declines in  discretionary spending after 2009 had on services to the public at  selected agencies.", "To address our first objective, we applied a framework that we first  developed in 2012 for examining agencies\u2019 efforts to effectively manage  in an environment of declining resources. We developed this framework  to better understand the issues agencies face in an environment of  declining resources and how agencies could address them. This  framework is based on (1) an extensive review of relevant literature,  including our prior work; (2) interviews with high-level budget experts,  including academics, Office of Management and Budget (OMB) staff,  agency chief financial and budget officers, and former congressional staff  to discuss their experiences with budgeting in an environment of declining  resources; and (3) a forum of experienced budget practitioners who  discussed principles to guide agencies\u2019 respective decision making while  managing in an environment of declining resources, as well as specific  actions that could be taken at federal agencies to implement funding  reductions while still achieving their mission. The forum\u2019s participants  represented a cross-section of federal agencies including the  Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, and Homeland  Security; the Internal Revenue Service; and the U.S. Merit Systems  Protection Board.", "Based on the methodology described above, we identified three key  themes for managing in an environment of declining resources. We also  identified subthemes with examples of activities that align with each of the  major themes. These examples offer approaches that agencies could  apply to manage their own limited resources. For the purposes of this  report, we also reviewed our relevant reports released since the  framework was first developed. We then discussed this framework with  the agencies selected for this review. After assessing this information, we  determined that the criteria established in the framework are still current,  valid, and relevant and applicable for answering the research objectives  of this report.", "To accomplish our objectives, we made a purposeful selection of three  agencies. Each of the selected agencies experienced a decline between  11 and 25 percent in \u201cgross discretionary budget authority\u201d from fiscal  years 2010 through 2014 (the most recent year of actual data available at  the time of our agency selection). To understand the differential effects  of declines, we identified agencies that serve different national priorities  (as indicated by budget function data from the OMB Max database) and  also considered agencies\u2019 appropriation account structures, information  technology (IT) investments, and other factors. The three agencies we  selected were:", "Department of Homeland Security\u2019s (DHS) Federal Law  Enforcement Training Centers (FLETC). FLETC\u2019s mission is to  provide basic, advanced, specialized, and in-service requalification  training for law enforcement personnel in more than 90 federal law  enforcement agencies as well as international, state, local, and tribal  law enforcement agencies in areas such as the use of force,  defensive tactics, and constitutional law.", "Department of Labor\u2019s (Labor) Employment and Training  Administration (ETA).

This includes  administering programs that prevent air, water, and land pollution, as  well as developing and enforcing environmental regulations.", "Given its relatively smaller size, we included all FLETC activities in the  scope of our review. Given the relatively larger size of ETA and EPA and  the scope of their work, we selected two programs within each of these  agencies for in-depth review. Programs were selected based on the  overall amount of discretionary resources (discretionary budget authority)  for the program or account, the magnitude of reductions in enacted  budget authority from 2010 to 2015 (the most recent year of actual data  available from the agency at the time of our program selection), input  from agency officials at selected agencies, and our experience with  programs and accounts from past and ongoing work. We also considered  types of service delivery mechanisms such as grants and direct services  represented across all selected programs. Overall, we selected:  1.  Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers (FLETC)  2.  ETA\u2019s Office of Foreign Labor Certification (OFLC) Federal  3.  ETA\u2019s Unemployment Insurance (UI) State Administration  4.

This included  documentation of the effects of resources on program outputs. However,  a number of factors including overall program management can affect  program outputs, making it difficult to isolate the specific effects of  declining resources on outputs. We traced budget data provided by  agencies to data from the President\u2019s budget when possible. We  reviewed performance data from agencies\u2019 annual performance reports  and compared it to other data sources for consistency. We assessed the  reliability of computer-processed data sources that we reviewed by using  electronic data testing, interviewing agency officials, and reviewing  related documentation. We found the data to be sufficiently reliable for the  purpose of our report.", "We interviewed officials from budget offices as well as human capital, IT,  and procurement offices within each agency about actions taken to  manage declining resources and any related effects on internal  operations. We included these three functions because they are  performed widely by agencies across the federal government. We also  interviewed officials responsible for managing selected programs  regarding any effects of declining resources and actions to manage those  declines on program implementation and performance goals.", "To further address our second objective, we interviewed a purposeful,  nongeneralizable selection of two to three partner organizations and other  external stakeholder organizations for each program. These stakeholders  provided additional information on how agencies\u2019 efforts to manage  declining discretionary spending affected program recipients and  customers. Partner organizations and stakeholders were selected based  on our past work at selected programs and input from officials within  selected programs. The stakeholder organizations were the American  Immigration Lawyers Association, the Association of Clean Water  Administrators, BASF (a private sector chemical company), the  Consumer Specialty Products Association, Farmworker Justice, the  National Association of State Workforce Agencies, the National  Association of Conservation Districts, the National Employment Law  Project, the Small and Seasonal Business Legal Center, U.S. Customs  and Border Protection, U.S. Secret Service, and the Transportation  Security Administration.

These initial caps were  intended to reduce projected spending by about $1 trillion. Because  additional legislation to reduce the deficit by at least another $1.2 trillion  through fiscal year 2021 was not enacted, additional deficit reduction  procedures were triggered under BCA. This included further annual  downward adjustments to discretionary spending caps through fiscal year  2021. Congress and the President have since amended BBEDCA to  allow for increased discretionary appropriations in certain years. Looking  forward, nominal discretionary spending under the statutory caps grows in  future years. However, the Congressional Budget Office projects that  when measured as a share of the economy, discretionary spending is  projected to be lower in 2021 than at any point in the last 50 years (see  figure 1).", "As we have previously reported, state and local governments continue to  face their own fiscal challenges. Our simulations of long-term fiscal trends  for state and local governments suggest that they could continue to face  gaps between revenue and spending during the next several decades  that would require substantial policy changes to address. This suggests  that the federal government\u2019s fiscal challenges cannot be adequately met  over the long term by shifting spending to state and local governments."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Amount of Funding Reductions Varied by Agency and Program", "paragraphs": ["Our analysis of federal budget data shows that the overall amount of new  discretionary resources (or budget authority) declined by roughly 12  percent from fiscal year 2010 to 2015. The amount of actual reductions or  increases in discretionary resources for individual agencies and programs  is determined through the annual appropriations process, in which  policymakers make choices between competing national priorities. The  agencies and programs we selected for review all experienced a decline  of at least 9 percent in newly appropriated discretionary resources from  fiscal year 2010 to 2015. Figure 2 compares declines at select agencies  with the changes in newly appropriated discretionary resources for large  cabinet-level departments and for the federal government overall during  this period.", "A number of other factors beyond changes in the amount of budgetary  resources can also affect agencies\u2019 ability to manage declining resources.  This includes the enactment of laws that impose new requirements on the  agency and changes in demand for services resulting from the expansion  or contraction of the broader economy. For example, the number of new  unemployment insurance claims increases during recessionary periods.  This increases state workload, which is funded through appropriations  from ETA\u2019s State Unemployment Insurance and Employment Service  Operations account. The appropriation allows for additional funds to be  made available when workloads increase above those estimated in the  budget. However, according to ETA, during the 2007-2009 recession and  the slow recovery that followed, states faced challenges quickly  expanding capacity to process a record number of claims. In contrast,  ETA officials said that demand for foreign labor tends to increase during  periods when the economy is expanding, which affects the volume of  work at the Office of Foreign Labor Certification (OFLC). ETA reported  that OFLC\u2019s overall application volumes were 84 percent higher in fiscal  year 2015 than in fiscal year 2010.

As  part of this, they could consider clearly defining and communicating the  key principles and priorities for guiding budget reductions. Top  management should also reexamine the agency\u2019s core mission. For  example, they may want to reexamine programs and organizational  structures to determine if the current environment still warrants continuing  certain programs and activities. Top management should also consult  with Congress and involved stakeholders and take into consideration how  budget decisions align with congressional goals, constituent needs, and  industry concerns.", "As shown in figure 4, top management at selected agencies led efforts to  achieve their respective missions with fewer resources in various ways at  both the agency and program level. For example, top management at  OFLC and EPA initiated comprehensive reviews of the workforce to  identify skills gaps and reshape the workforce to align with evolving  mission needs and budgetary limitations. FLETC\u2019s Director and executive  team clearly defined key principles and priorities for guiding budget  reductions and communicated them to agency employees and  stakeholders.", "As described in our framework, when deciding how to implement reduced  appropriations, data analytics should guide agency officials\u2019 decision  making. Data analytics involves turning data into meaningful information  accessible to budget and program staff and agency leaders to help them  make informed decisions. This should include activities such as reviewing  operations to achieve additional efficiencies and assessing the availability  and quality of data. As a part of this, agencies may want to consider using  data analytics to set specific cost-savings goals and monitor progress  toward achieving those goals. Agencies should also connect performance  information to the budget. Linking strategic goals with related long-term  and annual performance goals and with the costs of specific activities that  contribute to those goals, for example, can help provide a basis for  informed tradeoff decisions. As shown in figure 5, selected agencies used  data analytics to help increase efficiency, manage workflow, or monitor  the effects of cost-avoidance efforts on their respective missions.", "As described in our framework, when facing declining resources,  agencies should employ strategies that consider both short and long-term  cost cutting and cost avoidance strategies. Cost savings are a reduction  in actual expenditures below the projected level of costs to achieve a  specific objective. Cost avoidance is an action taken in the immediate  time frame that will decrease costs in the future. Cost-cutting and cost- avoidance strategies should encompass both short- and long-term  solutions. Agencies may want to consider (1) instituting an employee- input cost saving incentive program, (2) using capital funds and other  mechanisms to support upfront investments, (3) expanding the use of  shared services for functions that can be shared within or among  agencies, or (4) reducing the size and cost of real property through  consolidation. OMB has initiated a number of efforts to help agencies  cut and avoid costs.", "Selected agencies reported implementing a broad range of short- and  long-term strategies to cut or avoid costs. Balancing these strategies can  provide agencies with the flexibility to weigh short-term needs and make  adjustments towards achieving their long-term goals. Selected agencies  reported taking short-term actions aimed at immediate cost savings. For  example, given the limited resources available to hire additional  permanent staff to process labor certification cases, ETA reported using  temporary seasonal contract staff during peak filing periods to help  address increases in filing volume in various temporary programs. In  doing so, ETA reported that it saved $1 million compared to the cost of  maintaining an equivalent staffing level year-round. Selected agencies  also reported implementing a broad range of long-term strategies to avoid  costs, such as reducing their real estate footprint and strategically  sourcing goods and services.

Top management at FLETC identified long-term strategies for  better managing resources but have not developed or finalized plans  with specific goals and resources needed to implement some of these  strategies. Some actions could help ensure that the agency avoids  longer-term costs and maintains capacity to achieve its mission.  FLETC anticipates increased training requests for fiscal year 2017  and beyond but has not strategically planned for this surge. According  to FLETC officials, in the near term, the anticipated increase is in part  due to pent up demand following sequestration in fiscal year 2013 and  budget cuts from previous fiscal years. Partner organizations are  expected to increase law enforcement hiring and therefore demand  for training. Looking out further, according to FLETC officials, demand  for training is expected to increase to address the anticipated  retirement of the large cohort of law enforcement officers hired in the  wake of the September 11 terrorist attacks. However, FLETC has not  planned strategically for how it will address the anticipated surge. A  multi-year strategic plan that articulates the fundamental mission of  the agency and lays out its long-term goals for implementing that  mission, including the resources needed to reach these goals, for  example, could help FLETC continue to have the capacity to fulfill its  mission of providing law enforcement training and address increased  demand for training.", "FLETC\u2019s most recent strategic plan covered fiscal years 2008 through  2013. FLETC officials told us that its expired strategic plan, while  dated, was relevant and useful to the agency. Nonetheless, FLETC  reported that, in March 2016, the agency began revising this plan and  in August formed a Strategic Planning Working Group to complete a  strategic plan covering fiscal years 2016-2018 by December 31, 2016.  However, fiscal year 2016\u2014which represents one-third of the  strategic plan\u2014has already elapsed, and fiscal year 2017 is already  underway. Further, a strategic plan that extends through fiscal year  2018 can assist the agency in formulating its 2018 budget but will be  less useful for assessing longer-term resource needs. OMB\u2019s  guidance for implementing the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010,  contained in Part 6 of its Circular No. A-11, states that strategic goals  and objectives should be established for a period of not less than 4  years forward from the fiscal year in which it is published. Although  the act\u2019s requirements apply at the departmental levels, we have  previously reported that they can serve as leading practices at other  organizational levels, such as component agencies, offices, and  programs. Finally, it is unclear based on the excerpts that FLETC  provided to what extent the revised strategic plan addresses the  anticipated surge in training needs.", "In addition, FLETC is in the process of developing an Online Campus  that can provide distance learning opportunities for federal law  enforcement officers and supplement the in-person training they  receive at FLETC campuses. Consistent with our framework, the  Online Campus represents a potential long-term cost avoidance  strategy that could help the agency maintain capacity to provide the  necessary law enforcement training, potentially at a reduced cost to  both FLETC and its partner organizations. FLETC officials noted that  when complete, the Online Campus could reduce the travel and  lodging costs associated with in-person training and help FLETC meet  growing demand for training in the future.", "While the Online Campus initiative is included in the six overall priority  areas established by the FLETC Director and executive team, FLETC  has not finalized a plan for the Online Campus initiative that clearly  identifies the steps needed to achieve its goals. In October 2016,  FLETC provided us with a draft plan that outlines some activities and  milestones for the Online Campus initiative as well as some broad  cost savings goals. According to FLETC officials, the agency plans to  complete the plan by December 31, 2016, as part of its larger  strategic planning effort. The first year of this strategic plan has  passed, but FLETC did not provide evidence that the agency  achieved milestones, including the cost savings and enrollment goals,  established for that year. Furthermore, it is unclear where FLETC will  identify the necessary resources to fund the Online Campus initiative  within its existing budget. FLETC has funded the Online Campus  initiative with annual appropriations and has in the past used funding  from its other cost avoidance efforts to support this initiative. FLETC  officials reported that they are currently working on a funding model  for the Online Campus initiative. A final, up-to-date plan could allow  FLETC management to monitor progress toward these activities and  milestones and ensure that the Online Campus initiative helps FLETC  avoid longer-term costs and maintain capacity to achieve its mission.", "ETA. Top management at ETA has begun to take actions to help  ensure that the UI program maintains capacity to achieve its mission  with reduced resources, such as reengineering the UI program\u2019s  accountability and performance measurement process (as previously  described in figure 4). While ETA officials and stakeholder  organizations raised concerns about the Unemployment Insurance  program\u2019s capacity to adequately respond to the next recession, ETA  reported that it routinely communicates with states through meetings  hosted by ETA's Regional Offices and participates in national  conferences and that these and other efforts helped inform a number  of cost-neutral proposed reforms to the UI program included in the  President\u2019s Budget for fiscal year 2017. These reforms are intended in  part to make the UI program more responsive to economic downturns.  For example, the President\u2019s Budget proposed a new Extended  Benefits program to provide up to 52 weeks of additional federally- funded benefits for states seeing increased and high unemployment,  with the number of weeks tied to the state's unemployment rate.", "Although ETA has taken steps to communicate with states, ETA\u2019s  data collection efforts have not focused on systematically identifying  lessons learned from the most recent recession to help ensure the UI  program maintains capacity in response to a future economic  downturn and related issues, such as the states\u2019 ability to manage  changes in workload. In addition to regular communications with the  states, ETA officials said that they regularly monitor program activities  through a wide array of data collection, and that these efforts have  helped the agency identify lessons from the effects of the most recent  recession on the federal-state Ul system. Officials, however, also  noted that lack of capacity and competing priorities have prevented  the agency and state UI programs from systematically gathering  lessons learned by states from this recession. ETA officials said that  they intend to support states gathering and sharing lessons learned in  the future when their workload stabilizes.", "Systematically evaluating the challenges that states faced in  administering the UI program during the recent recession\u2014such as  rapidly ramping up staffing at the start of the recession and ramping  down as the economy recovered\u2014and identifying and incorporating  any lessons learned from this experience into a longer-term strategy  could help further prepare the program for the next economic  downturn. ETA officials reported that as the economy recovered and  federal funding for state administration of the program declined  following the recession that began in 2007, states reduced the  number of employees, many with extensive knowledge and  experience that state offices will have difficulty replacing in the future.  ETA reports that many state employees with extensive knowledge  have already left state unemployment insurance offices. If actions are  not taken promptly, opportunities to gather key lessons from the most  recent recession may be missed to help ensure capacity is maintained  in the next economic downturn.", "In addition to OFLC workforce efforts underway, ETA identified two  broad strategies for maintaining OFLC\u2019s capacity over the longer- term. Both would require congressional action (see text box). While  these legislative proposals, if enacted, would provide OFLC with  additional funding, in an era of declining resources, agencies cannot  rely solely on increased funding to continue to achieve their mission.  ETA officials noted that efforts to reorganize and cross-train OFLC  workforce (described in figure 4) should help the agency maintain  capacity with existing resources.", "Employment and Training Administration (ETA) Legislative Proposals for  Maintaining the Office of Foreign Labor Certification\u2019s (OFLC) Capacity  Proposed legislative changes for new fee. As part of the President\u2019s Fiscal Year 2017  budget request, ETA requested authority to collect user fees from employers in an  amount that would cover the costs of operating the H-2A, H-2B, permanent labor  certification, and prevailing wage programs. According to ETA, transitioning to a fee- based funding structure would improve case-processing services by creating a market-  structure that links the supply of resources with the demand for case-processing services.  ETA noted that the H-1B program administered by OFLC is already supported by user  fee collections and has experienced no backlogs despite a reported 76 percent increase  in applications between fiscal year 2010 and fiscal year 2015. ETA further noted that the  Citizenship and Immigration Services also already has the authority to collect user fees  for its operational role in each of the programs for which OFLC is requesting similar  authority. OFLC has developed a pricing structure conceptually similar to the existing  Citizenship and Immigration Services user fee system that, according to ETA, would  replace the need for annual appropriations into the future within several years of  receiving enabling authority. Congressional action would be needed to authorize OFLC to  collect and use (obligate) this new user fee. ETA officials said that they had received  technical inquiries from Congress about the proposal, but that they had not received  indication of congressional support from the current Congress to know whether the  proposed user fee proposal constituted a viable long-term plan.  Proposed one-time funding. ETA reported that another strategy for managing  resources over the longer-term is a proposal for an additional $20 million in one-time  funding to be made available for fiscal years 2017 and 2018 to process foreign labor  certifications. According to ETA, these funds would be used to support processing in the  H-2B and H-2A programs by investing in infrastructure and human capital to help meet  expanding service requirements in future filing cycles. ETA noted that in fiscal year 2016,  Congress responded to a backlog in another program\u2014permanent foreign labor  certifications\u2014by providing $13 million in additional budget authority specifically to  process these certifications. According to ETA, these additional resources helped the  OFLC reduce the backlog by 51 percent as of September 26, 2016.", "EPA. Our work found that EPA top management also had  opportunities to better manage declining resources by further  addressing our prior recommendations. For example, in 2012 we  reported that the way EPA measures the effectiveness of states\u2019 NPS  pollution programs has not consistently ensured that EPA select  projects likely to yield measurable water quality outcomes. We  recommended at the time that EPA emphasize measures that (1)  more accurately reflect the overall health of targeted water bodies  (e.g., the number, kind, and condition of living organisms) and (2)  demonstrate states\u2019 focus on protecting high-quality water bodies,  where appropriate. In a July 2016 report, we noted that EPA officials  said that the agency is planning to add one of the measures we  recommended but has not yet had the time and resources to do so.  EPA officials said the agency plans to begin developing a new  measure for the protection of healthy water bodies this year and to  establish a workgroup focused on this measure in fiscal year 2017.", "We found that funding for Section 319 NPS pollution grants declined  by more than 20 percent from 2010 to 2015. EPA officials said that it  would be difficult to isolate the effects of declining resources on  environmental outcomes using existing performance measures for the  Section 319 NPS pollution program. According to EPA officials, there  are many activities that contribute to the restoration of polluted  waterways and improve water quality. Some of these are EPA  programs, others are state programs, and yet others may be other  federal programs. In addition, EPA officials said that there is a time  lag between changes to funding for Section 319 NPS grants and  when effects from the changes take place. Implementing our prior  recommendation could provide top management with an opportunity  to better connect performance information to the budget, which could  help the agency understand how resource constraints affect program  outputs to guide decision making in the future.", "We testified earlier this year that, as of May 23, 2016, we had  identified 51 open recommendations related to management and  operations that we made to EPA since 2006 that had not been fully  addressed and another 36 open recommendations related to water  issues such as nonpoint source pollution. Implementing these  recommendations could help EPA improve efficiency and avoid costs  to better manage their limited resources. For example, in 2008, we  identified an error in EPA\u2019s calculation of reimbursable indirect costs  for hazardous waste cleanup. EPA acknowledged the error and  published revised indirect cost rates. As a result, we estimated, in  2010, that EPA had recovered or would recover $42.2 million."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Selected Agencies Have Ongoing Efforts to Expand Use of Data Analytics and Further Identify and Protect Upfront Investments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Data Analytics", "paragraphs": ["Selected agencies reported using data analytics to some extent and have  identified additional opportunities to improve or expand their use of data  analytics to better manage resources.

For example, FLETC has made initial investments in data  analytics and is planning to further expand its use of data analytics. As  discussed above, one of the FLETC Director and executive team\u2019s top  priorities is to enable FLETC to make data-driven decisions.

Protecting investments in new IT systems can  help agencies avoid longer-term costs. For example:  ETA. ETA officials and stakeholders reported that OFLC could  achieve increased efficiencies and functionality through modernizing  IT investments. For example, stakeholders noted that OFLC does not  have a reliable system for tracking the status of visa and immigrant  applications as its other federal partner agencies do. According to  ETA, OFLC has used its existing funds to make incremental  improvements in existing systems while planning to replace its two  aging electronic case processing systems. For example, the  requirement to scan documents into OFLC\u2019s integrated case  processing system (iCERT) significantly adds to workload and until  recently was the only way to ensure that analysts could work from  home without taking paper files to their residence in the current  telework environment. According to ETA, earlier this year, OFLC  enabled employer applicants to upload some documents into the  iCERT system directly, saving the time and effort required for OFLC  staff to scan those documents into the system.", "OFLC is also in the early stages of an electronic case processing  transformation plan that it recently initiated with the long-term goal of  replacing the current antiquated and unreliable electronic case  processing applications with a single, integrated solution for all labor  certification programs.

We recommended that EPA complete plans to  automate data related to conditional registrations to more readily track  the status of these registrations and related registrant and agency  actions and identify potential problems requiring management  attention. During our review, agency officials reported that EPA had  begun developing new IT infrastructure but more work is needed  before a functional tracking system is in place.

According to ETA,  OFLC\u2019s overall application volumes were 84 percent higher in fiscal  year 2015 than in fiscal year 2010, while the amounts appropriated to  process these applications decreased by roughly 9 percent. ETA  officials said that this\u2014along with other factors such as new  requirements and temporary court-ordered work stoppages\u2014affected  OFLC\u2019s ability to meet timeliness measures for processing  applications. For example, under an Interim Final Rule released in  April 2015, OFLC is required to issue either a Notice of Deficiency or,  if the application is complete and meets requirements, to issue a  Notice of Acceptance within 7 business days of receiving the H-2B  application. According to ETA data, as of September 2016, the  average processing time for H-2B applications with no deficiencies in  2016 thus far was roughly 69 days and even longer for applications  with deficiencies. One stakeholder organization representing  employers who use the H-2B program to meet seasonal employment  needs\u2014including for landscaping, forestry, and housekeeping\u2014  conducted an informal survey of its members.

Annual appropriations for OPP  declined by more than 14 percent from fiscal year 2010 through 2015.  Despite these declines, according to EPA officials, there was no  decline in the program\u2019s outputs and outcomes for pesticide programs  because Congress made collections from Pesticide Registration  Improvement Act of 2013 (PRIA) user fees available to supplement  OPP\u2019s annual appropriations. Specifically, in 1988, Congress  enacted annual registration maintenance fees to support the review of  existing pesticide registrations. In 2004, Congress enacted pesticide  registration fees, which are paid by registrants for some registration  actions, such as registering new uses of pesticides, to help pay for  registration costs. According to EPA, these fees were established to  both create a more predictable evaluation process for affected  pesticide decisions and to couple the collection of individual fees with  specific deadlines for pesticide registration decisions. Further, as  noted earlier, OPP reported improving the efficiency of some  processes, such as through Lean Six Sigma process improvements.", "We found that data for pesticide registration decisions from fiscal year  2011 through fiscal year 2015 show both increases and decreases in  registration decision times depending on the category. Overall, the  average annual percentage of decisions completed on time has  decreased slightly during the period of our review from 99.7 percent in  fiscal year 2010 to 98.4 percent in fiscal year 2015. In fiscal year  2014, the average annual percentage of decisions completed on time  did drop to 85 percent, which EPA attributed to the October 2013  government shutdown.", "Stakeholders that we spoke with noted that annual appropriations for  OPP fell below a minimum appropriation threshold established by  statute. Pesticide registration service fees may not be assessed for a  fiscal year unless Congress provides at least a set amount of annual  appropriations for certain OPP functions for that year. Nonetheless,  Congress has at times authorized EPA to assess pesticide  registration service fees for a given fiscal year notwithstanding the  minimum appropriations provision. One stakeholder organization told  us EPA management has done an outstanding job implementing  PRIA despite funding challenges. Nonetheless, this stakeholder  organization told us that reductions in annual appropriations affected  overall staffing levels at OPP and that average processing times  increased for certain types of registration decisions. For example,  based on EPA data, the average decision time for an application that  proposes to use a new food use active ingredient increased 214 days  from an average of 703 days in fiscal year 2011 to an average of 917  days in fiscal year 2015. The average decision time for an application  for amendments for conventional agricultural products requiring  scientific review increased 67 days, from an average of 276 days in  fiscal year 2011 to an average of 343 days in fiscal year 2015.  According to one stakeholder organization we spoke with, the  pesticide industry relies heavily upon timely and predictable  registration decision time frames. This allows manufacturers to  effectively market their new products to growers before their  respective growing seasons. According to this stakeholder  organization, slower timelines have resulted in uncertainty and slowed  innovation and growth for industry and can ultimately result in lost  revenue for the manufacturers of particular products if they are not  ready to be released until after the growing season.", "FLETC. According to FLETC officials, FLETC\u2019s capacity to  accommodate the increased demand for training in recent years is  reaching its limit and could increase waitlists and delay training for  partner organizations. FLETC serves as an interagency law  enforcement training organization for more than 90 federal partner  organizations as well as international, state, local and tribal law  enforcement agencies. According to FLETC officials, an improved  budget outlook for partner organizations increased law enforcement  hiring and therefore demand for training in recent years. FLETC  expects that demand for training will further increase in future years to  address the anticipated retirement of the large cohort of law  enforcement officers hired in the wake of the September 11 terrorist  attack. According to FLETC officials, capacity constraints resulted in  longer waiting lists for training or some partner organizations being  given less flexibility to make changes in their training schedule later in  the fiscal year. FLETC officials said that the agency has used  unobligated balances carried forward from prior fiscal years in which  actual training enrollment fell short of partner organizations\u2019  projections, to help manage increased demand.  Partner  organizations that we spoke with credited FLETC\u2019s recent efforts to  accommodate the increased demand in training by, for example,  shifting the training from one campus to another or honoring short- notice training support requests for additional classes. However, if  budgetary trends persist, FLETC officials said that the agency will  have fewer unobligated balances and therefore less flexibility to  manage future surges in training given the depletion in balances."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Declining Resources Affected the Level of Services for Some Programs at Selected Agencies According to Some Agency Officials and Stakeholders", "paragraphs": ["In part due to declining resources, selected agencies provided states with  less funding to administer and implement joint federal-state programs,  such as unemployment insurance (UI) and Section 319 nonpoint source  (NPS) pollution. While federal agencies are responsible for monitoring  and overseeing these programs, states generally have some discretion in  how they implement reductions. As a result, the actions taken by  individual states can vary and the effects of those actions are difficult to  isolate. In addition, some states may choose to use other sources of  funding to offset a decline in funding for federal programs such as  unemployment insurance and nonpoint source pollution. This includes  both state resources and other federal sources. However, according to  agency officials and stakeholder organizations, the use of state funding to  supplement federal funding varied considerably. Some states provided no  resources for these programs while others established dedicated revenue  streams. For example, based on an annual survey of state workforce  agencies by the National Association of State Workforce Agencies, states  have provided between roughly $100 million and $362 million in  supplemental funding for state administration of the UI program between  2010 and 2015.", "EPA Section 319 NPS pollution grants. Declining resources for  Section 319 NPS pollution grants to states coincided with fewer  projects to improve water quality in impaired waters.

While EPA regional offices administer the Section 319 NPS grants to  states and are responsible for grant and programmatic oversight,  states set their overall program priorities and devise processes for  selecting projects. One stakeholder organization that represents local  water conservation districts told us that the decreased funding for  Section 319 NPS grants puts more pressure on local government  entities and conservation districts to implement the program. This  stakeholder expressed concerns that there has not been an overall  commitment to funding the Section 319 program and other programs  to reduce hypoxia in areas such as the Mississippi River/Gulf of  Mexico watershed. Hypoxia can cause harmful algal blooms. For  example, in August 2014, Lake Erie experienced a harmful algal  bloom near the intake to the drinking water treatment plant serving the  city of Toledo, Ohio. Toledo issued a \u201cdo not drink or boil advisory\u201d  that affected nearly 500,000 customers due to the presence of the  harmful substance cyanotoxin that exceeded the safe drinking water  threshold recommended by the World Health Organization.", "ETA\u2019s Unemployment Insurance Program.

It averaged roughly 82 percent from 2010 to 2015. ETA  attributed states\u2019 inability to meet the performance goal partially to  staff layoffs associated with reduced administrative funding caused by  lower workloads. According to ETA, workloads were lower because  temporary federal programs expired and the economy improved.  Figure 7 shows the percentage of first unemployment benefits paid  within 21 days.", "Two stakeholder groups that we spoke with said that declining federal  funding contributed to increased wait times to process UI claims,  which can lead to delays in claims being paid on time and lower  customer satisfaction. This is consistent with our prior work, which  indicates that states are experiencing customer service challenges  related to insufficient staff, outdated IT systems, and limited funding.", "State UI programs rely extensively on IT systems funded through  annual appropriations to administer the UI program and to support  related administrative needs. As we have previously reported, states  face challenges modernizing their IT systems to operate more  efficiently. These challenges include limited funding for  modernization efforts and limited resources for operating legacy  systems while implementing modernized systems. The majority of the  states\u2019 existing systems for UI operations were developed in the  1970s and 1980s. However, it can be difficult to isolate effects of  declining resources from other factors such as limited staff with the  technical and project management expertise to manage system  modernization efforts. According to ETA, current appropriations to  fund state administration do not provide sufficient funding to enable  states to modernize UI information technology infrastructure, which  can cost many millions of dollars for each state. To address this  challenge with limited additional funding, ETA has invested available  resources to support consortia of states to jointly modernize their  systems with the goal of sharing development and ongoing  maintenance costs.", "FLETC.

For instance, EPA has not updated 18-year-old  testing guidelines addressing public health pests, such as bed bugs,  which one of the stakeholders we spoke with identified as a significant  problem in the United States. These guidelines specify methods for  generating the necessary data to submit to EPA for registering a  pesticide or setting a tolerance level (i.e., the maximum pesticide  residue allowed) or tolerance exemption for pesticide residues. One  stakeholder who represents an industry trade group said that it is vital  for these efficacy guidelines to be finalized so that industry can know  how and what to test for to ensure EPA accepts the study the first  time it is submitted. The representative also said that uncertainty has  slowed innovation for developing new products and renewing  registrations of existing, effective products.

Meanwhile, new discretionary appropriations for  selected programs declined by between 9 percent and 16 percent.", "The Unemployment Insurance (UI) State Administration program  funds grants to states for the administration of UI programs in  accordance with Section 302(a) of the Social Security Act. ETA uses  a combination of national claims-related workload projections and  other factors to develop the request for UI administrative funding for  states. After Congress appropriates funds, the Department of Labor  uses a formula based in large part on workload estimates ETA  develops, as well as other information provided by states, such as  cost accounting information to allocate \u201cbase\u201d funding to states. Base  resources attempt to provide 80 to 90 percent of total \u201cneed\u201d for  workload processing with the remaining funding for workload related  activities provided after the conclusion of each quarter when states  report workload activity in excess of the \u201cbase\u201d workload. This  approach is intended to address forecast error in the original  estimates. Since available funding is calculated in large part on  claims-related workloads, the federal funding available for states is  sensitive to changes in total claims, with more funding available when  claims increase and less when they decrease.", "Foreign Labor Certification Federal Administration funds most of the  administrative costs of the immigration programs overseen by the  Office of Foreign Labor Certification (OFLC). This includes salaries  and expenses, IT systems development, case adjudication support,  rent, equipment, and supplies. OFLC is responsible for reviewing  employer requests for the certification of a foreign worker to work in  the United States to ensure that hiring a foreign worker will not  adversely affect the wages and working conditions of American  workers, and that no qualified American workers are willing or  available to fill a given vacancy. OFLC oversees the labor  certifications for a number of visa programs, including the Permanent  Labor Certification, H-2A, H-2B, and H-1B programs.", "Table 3 highlights select agency performance measures, showing the  annual targets and results for each measure during the relevant  timeframe. Years where results fell below the agency\u2019s target are  highlighted in gray. According to ETA budget and performance  documents, ETA was unable to reach its target for some performance  measures in part because of resource constraints.

From  fiscal year 2010 through fiscal year 2014, the most recent years for  which complete data on awarded projects were available, states  awarded approximately 4,000 projects under the Section 319 NPS  program. The two most common categories of nonpoint source water  pollution targeted by these projects were agricultural runoff and urban  and stormwater runoff.", "The Environmental Programs and Management (EPM) account  supports a broad range of activities involved in EPA developing  pollution control regulations and standards, and enforcement of these  requirements across multiple environmental media, such as air quality  and water quality. For the purposes of this report, we focused on three  of the EPM budget activities related to pesticides. These support the  Office of Pesticide Programs (OPP) activities that protect human  health and the environment from pesticide risk, as well as activities to  realize the value of pesticide availability. In addition to receiving  annual appropriations, OPP has the authority to collect and obligate  Pesticide Registration Improvement Act of 2003 (PRIA) fees.  Specifically, in 1988, Congress enacted annual registration  maintenance fees to support EPA reviewing existing pesticide  registrations. In 2004, Congress enacted pesticide registration fees,  which are paid by registrants for some registration actions, such as  registrations for new uses of pesticides, to help pay for registration  costs. According to EPA, the goals of the PRIA fee system are to both create a more predictable evaluation process for affected pesticide  decisions and to couple the collection of individual fees with specific  decision review periods. Pesticide registration service fees have a  minimum appropriation threshold established by statute. Pesticide  registration service fees may not be assessed for a fiscal year unless  Congress provides at least a set amount of annual appropriations for  certain OPP functions for that year. Nonetheless, Congress has at  times authorized EPA to assess pesticide registration service fees for  a given fiscal year notwithstanding the minimum appropriations  provision. PRIA fees, which include both discretionary budget  authority and mandatory budget authority from offsetting collections,  can supplement OPP\u2019s annual appropriations. PRIA fees totaled  roughly $44 million in fiscal year 2015.", "Table 5 highlights select agency performance measures, showing the  annual targets and results for each measure during the relevant  timeframe. Years where results fell below the agency\u2019s targets are  highlighted in gray. Currently, EPA is unable to effectively track the  effects of declining resources on some performance measures. There are  many activities that contribute to restoring polluted waterways and  reducing nonpoint source pollution. Some of these are EPA programs,  others are state programs, and yet others may be other federal programs.  In addition, EPA officials said that there is a time lag between changes to  funding for Section 319 NPS pollution grants and when effects from the  changes take place. Further, we previously recommended that EPA  revise Section 319 guidelines to states to emphasize measures that more  accurately reflect the overall health of targeted water bodies (e.g., the  number, kind, and condition of living organisms) and demonstrate states\u2019  focus on protecting high-quality water bodies, where appropriate. EPA  agreed that different measures would better represent Section 319 NPS  pollution program progress, and, according to EPA, the agency will  undertake work on a new measure for protecting unimpaired waters."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Overview of Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers\u2019 Budget and Performance Measures", "paragraphs": ["Newly enacted appropriations for FLETC declined by roughly 11 percent  from fiscal year 2010 to fiscal year 2015.", "FLETC\u2019s annual appropriation is available for necessary expenses for  Salaries and Expenses, including materials and support costs for  federal law enforcement basic training, and public awareness and  enhancement of community support of law enforcement training.
