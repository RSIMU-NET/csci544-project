This statement also addresses the Transportation Security Administration's (TSA) planned deployment of technologies for enhanced explosive detection and the challenges associated with this deployment. GAO's comments are based on products issued from September 2006 through October 2009 and selected updates in January 2010. For these updates, GAO reviewed government reports related to the December 25 attempted attack and obtained information from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and TSA on use of the watchlist and new technologies for screening airline passengers."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The intelligence community uses standards of reasonableness to evaluate individuals for nomination to the consolidated terrorist watchlist. In making these determinations, agencies are to consider information from all available sources. However, for the December 25 subject, the intelligence community did not effectively complete these steps and link available information to the subject before the incident. Therefore, agencies did not nominate the individual to the watchlist or any of the subset lists used during agency screening, such as the \"No Fly\" list. Weighing and responding to the potential impacts that changes to the nomination criteria would have on the traveling public will be an important consideration in determining what changes may be needed. Also, screening agencies stated that they do not check against all records in the watchlist, partly because screening against certain records may not be needed to support a respective agency's mission or may not be possible because of the requirements of computer programs used to check individuals against watchlist records. In October 2007, GAO reported that not checking against all records may pose a security risk and recommended that DHS and the FBI assess potential vulnerabilities, but they have not completed these assessments. TSA is implementing an advanced airline passenger prescreening program--known as Secure Flight--that could potentially result in the federal government checking passengers against the entire watchlist under certain security conditions. Further, the government lacks an up-to-date strategy and implementation plan--supported by a clearly defined leadership or governance structure--which are needed to enhance the effectiveness of terrorist-related screening and ensure accountability. In the 2007 report, GAO recommended that the Homeland Security Council ensure that a governance structure exists that has the requisite authority over the watchlist process. The council did not comment on this recommendation. As GAO reported in October 2009, since TSA's creation, 10 passenger screening technologies have been in various phases of research, development, procurement, and deployment, including the Advanced Imaging Technology (AIT)--formerly known as the Whole Body Imager. TSA expects to have installed almost 200 AITs in airports by the end of calendar year 2010 and plans to install a total of 878 units by the end of fiscal year 2014. In October 2009, GAO reported that TSA had not yet conducted an assessment of the technology's vulnerabilities to determine the extent to which a terrorist could employ tactics that would evade detection by the AIT. Thus, it is unclear whether the AIT or other technologies would have detected the weapon used in the December 25 attempted attack. GAO's report also noted the problems TSA experienced in deploying another checkpoint technology that had not been tested in the operational environment. Since GAO's October report, TSA stated that it has completed the testing as of the end of 2009. We are currently verifying that all functional requirements of the AIT were tested in an operational environment. Completing these steps should better position TSA to ensure that its costly deployment of AIT machines will enhance passenger checkpoint security."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["We are pleased to submit this statement on the progress federal agencies  have made and the challenges they face in key areas of terrorism  information sharing and the deployment of checkpoint technologies. The  December 25, 2009, attempted bombing of flight 253 has led to increased  scrutiny of how the government creates and uses the consolidated  terrorist screening database (the watchlist) to screen individuals and  determine if they pose a security threat, and highlighted the importance of  detecting improvised explosive devices and other prohibited items on  passengers before they board a commercial aircraft. The White House\u2019s  initial review of these events exposed gaps in how intelligence agencies  collected, shared, and analyzed terrorism-related information to determine  if the subject\u2014Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab\u2014posed enough of a threat to  warrant placing him on the watchlist, which could have altered the course  of events that day. To enhance its ability to detect explosive devices and  other prohibited items on passengers, the Transportation Security  Administration (TSA) is evaluating the use of Advanced Imaging  Technology (AIT)\u2014formerly called the Whole Body Imager\u2014as an  improvement over current screening capabilities.", "In October 2007, we released a report on the results of our review\u2014 conducted at your request\u2014of how the watchlist is created and  maintained, and how federal, state, and local security partners use the list  to screen individuals for potential threats to the homeland. As a result of  that review, we identified potential vulnerabilities, including ones created  because agencies were not screening against all records in the watchlist.  We made a number of recommendations aimed at addressing these  potential vulnerabilities and helping to enhance the effectiveness of the  watchlist process, which the agencies have not yet fully addressed. These  recommendations\u2014which we discuss later in this statement\u2014are still  important to address and can inform ongoing reviews of the December 25  attempted terrorist attack.", "Also, in January 2005, we designated information sharing for homeland  security a high-risk area because the government faced formidable  challenges in analyzing and disseminating this information in a timely,  accurate, and useful manner. Since then, we have been monitoring and  making recommendations to improve the government\u2019s efforts to share  terrorism-related information, not only among federal agencies but also  with their state, local, tribal, and private sector security partners.  Addressing this high-risk area is important to help remove barriers that  lead to agencies maintaining information in stove-piped systems, and to  hold them accountable to the Congress and the public for ensuring  terrorism information is shared, is used, and makes a difference. We are  continuing to review federal agencies\u2019 efforts to share terrorism-related  information and expect to report the results of this work later this year.", "In addition, in October 2009, we released a report on TSA\u2019s efforts to  deploy checkpoint technologies and the challenges the agency faces in  these efforts. We made eight recommendations related to the research,  development, and deployment of these technologies. The Department of  Homeland Security (DHS) agreed with our recommendations and  identified actions planned or under way to implement them. While DHS is  taking steps to address our recommendations related to conducting risk  assessments, the actions DHS reported that TSA had taken or plans to take  do not fully address the intent of the majority of our recommendations.", "This statement for the record discusses (1) the government\u2019s efforts to use  the terrorist watchlist to screen individuals and determine if they pose a  threat, as well as how aspects of this process contributed to the December  25 attempted terrorist attack and (2) TSA\u2019s planned deployment of the AIT  for enhanced explosive detection and the challenges associated with this  deployment.", "This statement is based on products GAO issued from September 2006  through October 2009.

For example, NCTC receives terrorist-related information from executive  branch departments and agencies, such as the Department of State, the  Central Intelligence Agency, and the FBI, and catalogs this information in  its Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment database, commonly known  as the TIDE database. This database serves as the U.S. government\u2019s  central classified database with information on known or suspected  international terrorists. According to NCTC, agencies submit watchlist  nomination reports to the center, but are not required to specify individual  screening systems that they believe should receive the watchlist record,  such as the No Fly list of individuals who are to be denied boarding an  aircraft. NCTC is to presume that agency nominations are valid unless it  has other information in its possession to rebut that position.", "To decide if a person poses enough of a threat to be placed on the  watchlist, agencies are to follow Homeland Security Presidential Directive  (HSPD) 6, which states that the watchlist is to contain information about  individuals \u201cknown or appropriately suspected to be or have been engaged  in conduct constituting, in preparation for, in aid of, or related to  terrorism.\u201d HSPD-24 definitively established the \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d  standard for watchlisting by providing that agencies are to make available  to other agencies all biometric information associated with \u201cpersons for  whom there is an articulable and reasonable basis for suspicion that they  pose a threat to national security.\u201d NCTC is to consider information from  all available sources and databases to determine if there is a reasonable  suspicion of links to terrorism that warrants a nomination, which can  involve some level of subjectivity. The guidance on determining  reasonable suspicion, which TSC most recently updated in February 2009,  contains specific examples of the types of terrorism-related conduct that  may make an individual appropriate for inclusion on the watchlist.", "The White House\u2019s review of the December 25 attempted terrorist attack  noted that Mr. Abdulmutallab\u2019s father met with U.S. Embassy officers in  Abuja, Nigeria, to discuss his concerns that his son may have come under  the influence of unidentified extremists and had planned to travel to  Yemen. However, according to NCTC, the information in the State  Department\u2019s nomination report did not meet the criteria for watchlisting  in TSC\u2019s consolidated terrorist screening database per the government\u2019s  established and approved nomination standards. NCTC also noted that the  State Department cable nominating Mr. Abdulmutallab had no indication  that the father was the source of the information. According to the White  House review of the December 25 attempted attack, the U.S. government  had sufficient information to have uncovered and potentially disrupted the  attack\u2014including by placing Mr. Abdulmutallab on the No Fly list\u2014but  analysts within the intelligence community failed to connect the dots that  could have identified and warned of the specific threat.", "After receiving the results of the White House\u2019s review of the December 25  attempted attack, the President called for members of the intelligence  community to undertake a number of corrective actions\u2014such as  clarifying intelligence agency roles, responsibilities, and accountabilities  to document, share, and analyze all sources of intelligence and threat  threads related to terrorism, and accelerating information technology  enhancements that will help with information correlation and analysis.  The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform has asked  us, among other things, to assess government efforts to revise the  watchlist process, including actions taken related to the December 25  attempted attack.", "As part of our monitoring of high-risk issues, we also have ongoing work\u2014 at the request of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and  Governmental Affairs\u2014that is assessing agency efforts to create the  Information Sharing Environment, which is intended to break down  barriers to sharing terrorism-related information, especially across federal  agencies. Our work is designed to help ensure that federal agencies have  a road map that defines roles, responsibilities, actions, and time frames for  removing barriers, as well as a system to hold agencies accountable to the  Congress and the public for making progress on these efforts. Among  other things, this road map can be helpful in removing cultural,  technological, and other barriers that lead to agencies maintaining  information in stove-piped systems so that it is not easily accessible,  similar to those problems that the December 25 attempted attack exposed.  We expect to issue the results of this work later this year."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "By Not Placing Mr. Abdulmutallab on the Consolidated Watchlist or Its Subsets, the Government Missed Opportunities to Use These Counterterrorism Tools", "paragraphs": ["Following the December 25 attempted terrorist attack, questions were  raised as to what could have happened if Mr. Abdulmutallab had been on  TSC\u2019s consolidated terrorist screening database. We created several  scenarios to help explain how the watchlist process is intended to work  and what opportunities agencies could have had to identify him if he was  on the watchlist. For example, according to TSC, if a record from the  terrorist screening database is sent to the State Department\u2019s system and  the individual in that record holds a valid visa, TSC would compare the  identifying information in the watchlist record against identifying  information in the visa and forward positive matches to the State  Department for possible visa revocation. If an individual\u2019s visa is revoked,  under existing procedures, this information is to be entered into the  database CBP uses to screen airline passengers prior to their boarding,  which we describe below. According to CBP, when the individual checks  in for a flight, the on-site CBP Immigration Advisory Program officers  already would have been apprised of the visa revocation by CBP and they  would have checked the person\u2019s travel documents to verify that the  individual was a match to the visa revocation record. Once the positive  match was established, the officers would have recommended that he not  be allowed to board the flight.", "Under another scenario, if an individual is on TSC\u2019s terrorist screening  database, existing processes provide CBP with the opportunity to identify  the subject of a watchlist record as part of the checks CBP is to conduct to  see if airline passengers are eligible to be admitted into the country.  Specifically, for international flights departing to or from the United States  (but not for domestic flights), CBP is to receive information on passengers  obtained, for example, when their travel document is swiped. CBP is to  check this passenger information against a number of databases to see if  there are any persons who have immigration violations, criminal histories,  or any other reason for being denied entry to the country, in accordance  with the agency\u2019s mission. According to CBP, when it identifies a U.S.  bound passenger who is on the watchlist, it coordinates with other federal  agencies to evaluate the totality of available information to see what  action is appropriate. In foreign airports where there is a CBP Immigration  Advisory Program presence, the information on a watchlisted subject is  forwarded by CBP to program officers onsite. The officers would then  intercept the subject prior to boarding the aircraft and confirm that the  individual is watchlisted, and when appropriate based on the derogatory  information, request that the passenger be denied boarding.", "In a third scenario, if an individual is on the watchlist and is also placed on  the No Fly or Selectee list, when the person checks in for a flight, the  individual\u2019s identifying information is to be checked against these lists.  Individuals matched to the No Fly list are to be denied boarding. If the  individual is matched to the Selectee list, the person is to be subject to  further screening, which could include physical screening, such as a pat- down. The criteria in general that are used to place someone on either of  these two lists include the following:    Persons who are deemed to be a threat to civil aviation or national  security and should be precluded from boarding an aircraft are put on  the No Fly list.", "Persons who are deemed to be a threat to civil aviation or national  security but do not meet the criteria of the No Fly list are placed on the  Selectee list and are to receive additional security screening prior to  being permitted to board an aircraft.", "The White House Homeland Security Council devised these more stringent  sets of criteria for the No Fly and Selectee lists in part because these lists  are not intended as investigative or information-gathering tools or tracking  mechanisms, and TSA is a screening but not an intelligence agency.  Rather, the lists are intended to help ensure the safe transport of  passengers and facilitate the flow of commerce. However, the White  House\u2019s review of the December 25 attempted terrorist attack raised  questions about the effectiveness of the criteria, and the President tasked  the FBI and TSC with developing recommendations for any needed  changes to the nominations guidance and criteria.", "Weighing and responding to the potential impacts that changes to the  nominations guidance and criteria could have on the traveling public and  the airlines will be important considerations in developing such  recommendations. In September 2006, we reported that tens of thousands  of individuals who had similar names to persons on the watchlist were  being misidentified and subjected to additional screening, and in some  cases delayed so long as to miss their flights. We also reported that  resolving these misidentifications can take time and, therefore, affect air  carriers and commerce. If changes in criteria result in more individuals  being added to the lists, this could also increase the number of individuals  who are misidentified, exacerbating these negative effects. In addition, we  explained that individuals who believe that they have been inappropriately  matched to the watchlist can petition the government for action and the  relevant agencies must conduct research and work to resolve these issues.  If more people are misidentified, more people may trigger this redress  process, increasing the need for resources. Finally, any changes to the  criteria or process would have to ensure that watchlist records are used in  a manner that safeguards legal rights, including freedoms, civil liberties,  and information privacy guaranteed by federal law."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agencies Do Not Screen Individuals against All Records in the Watchlist, Which Creates Potential Security Vulnerabilities; GAO Continues to Recommend That Agencies Assess and Address These Gaps", "paragraphs": ["In reacting to the December 25 attempted terrorist attack, determining  whether there were potential vulnerabilities related to the use of watchlist  records when screening\u2014not only individuals who fly into the country but  also, for example, those who cross land borders\u2014are important  considerations. Screening agencies whose missions most frequently and  directly involve interactions with travelers generally do not check against  all records in the consolidated terrorist watchlist. In our October 2007  report, we noted that this is because screening against certain records may  not be needed to support a respective agency\u2019s mission or may not be  possible because of computer system limitations, among other things.", "For example, CBP\u2019s mission is to determine if any traveler is eligible to  enter the country or is to be denied entry because of immigration or  criminal violations. As such, CBP\u2019s computer system accepts all records  from the consolidated watchlist database that have either a first name or a  last name and one other identifier, such as a date of birth. Therefore, TSC  sends CBP the greatest number of records from the consolidated watchlist  database for its screening. In contrast, one of the State Department\u2019s  missions is to approve requests for visas. Since only non-U.S. citizens and  nonlawful permanent residents apply for visas, TSC does not send the  department records on citizens or lawful permanent residents for  screening visa applicants.", "Also, the FBI database that state and local law enforcement agencies use  for their missions in checking individuals for criminal histories, for  example, also receives a smaller portion of the watchlist. According to the  FBI, its computer system requires a full first name, last name, and other  identifier, typically a date of birth. The FBI noted that this is because  having these identifiers helps to reduce the number of times an individual  is misidentified as being someone on the list, and the computer system  would not be effective in making matches without this information.  Finally, the No Fly and Selectee lists collectively contain the lowest  percentage of watchlist records because the remaining ones either do not  meet the nominating criteria, as described above, or do not meet system  requirements\u2014that is, include full names and dates of birth, which TSA  stated are required to minimize misidentifications.", "TSA is implementing a new screening program that the agency states will  have the capability to screen an individual against the entire watchlist.  Under this program, called Secure Flight, TSA will assume from air  carriers the responsibility of comparing passenger information against the  No Fly and Selectee lists. According to the program\u2019s final rule, in  general, Secure Flight is to compare passenger information only to the No  Fly and Selectee lists. The supplementary information accompanying the  rule notes that this will be satisfactory to counter the security threat  during normal security circumstances. However, the rule provides that  TSA may use the larger set of watchlist records when warranted by  security considerations, such as if TSA learns that flights on a particular  route may pose increased risks. TSA emphasized that use of the full  terrorist screening database is not routine. Rather, TSA noted that its use  is limited to circumstances in which there is information concerning an  increased risk to transportation security, and the decision to use the full  watchlist database will be based on circumstances at the time. According  to TSA, as of January 2010, the agency was developing administrative  procedures for utilizing the full watchlist when warranted.", "In late January 2009, TSA began to assume from airlines the watchlist  matching function for a limited number of domestic flights, and has since  phased in additional flights and airlines. TSA expects to assume the  watchlist matching function for all domestic and international flights  departing to and from the United States by December 2010. It is important  to note that under the Secure Flight program, TSA requires airlines to  provide the agency with each passenger\u2019s full name and date of birth to  facilitate the watchlist matching process, which should reduce the number  of individuals who are misidentified as the subject of a watchlist record.  We continue to monitor the Secure Flight program at the Congress\u2019s  request.", "In our October 2007 watchlist report, we recommended that the FBI and  DHS assess the extent to which security risks exist by not screening  against certain watchlist records and what actions, if any, should be taken  in response. The agencies generally agreed with our recommendations  but noted that the risks related to not screening against all watchlist  records needs to be balanced with the impact of screening against all  records, especially those records without a full name and other identifiers.  For example, more individuals could be misidentified, law enforcement  would be put in the position of detaining more individuals until their  identities could be resolved, and administrative costs could increase,  without knowing what measurable increase in security is achieved. While  we acknowledge these tradeoffs and potential impacts, we maintain that  assessing whether vulnerabilities exist by not screening against all  watchlist records\u2014and if there are ways to limit impacts\u2014is critical and  could be a relevant component of the government\u2019s ongoing review of the  watchlist process.

However, many critical infrastructure components are not using  watchlist records, and DHS has not finalized guidelines to support such  private sector screening, as HSPD-6 mandated and we previously  recommended.", "In that same report, we noted that HSPD-11 tasked the Secretary of  Homeland Security with coordinating across other federal departments to  develop (1) a strategy for a comprehensive and coordinated watchlisting  and screening approach and (2) a prioritized implementation and  investment plan that describes the scope, governance, principles,  outcomes, milestones, training objectives, metrics, costs, and schedule of  necessary activities. We reported that without such a strategy, the  government could not provide accountability and a basis for monitoring to  ensure that (1) the intended goals for, and expected results of, terrorist  screening are being achieved and (2) use of the watchlist is consistent with  privacy and civil liberties.

The office noted  that the report was formally submitted to the Executive Office of the  President through the Homeland Security Council and reviewed by the  President on January 25, 2008. Further, the office noted that it also  provided a sensitive version of the report to the Congress in October 2008.  DHS provided us an excerpt of that report to review, stating that it did not  have the authority to share excerpts provided by other agencies, and we  were unable to obtain a copy of the full report. The information we  reviewed only discussed DHS\u2019s own efforts for coordinating watchlist  screening across the department. Therefore, we were not able to  determine whether the HSPD-11 report submitted to the President  addressed all of the components called for in the directive or what action,  if any, was taken as a result. We maintain that a comprehensive strategy,  as well as related implementation and investment plans, as called for by  HSPD-11, continue to be important to ensure effective governmentwide  use of the watchlist process.", "In addition, in our October 2007 report, we noted that establishing an  effective governance structure as part of this strategic approach is  particularly vital since numerous agencies and components are involved in  the development, maintenance, and use of the watchlist process, both  within and outside of the federal government. Also, establishing a  governance structure with clearly-defined responsibility and authority  would help to ensure that agency efforts are coordinated, and that the  federal government has the means to monitor and analyze the outcomes of  such efforts and to address common problems efficiently and effectively.  We determined at the time that no such structure was in place and that no  existing entity clearly had the requisite authority for addressing  interagency issues. We recommended that the Homeland Security Council  ensure that a governance structure was in place, but the council did not  comment on our recommendation.", "At the time of our report, TSC stated that it had a governance board in  place, comprised of senior-level agency representatives from numerous  departments and agencies. However, we also noted that the board  provided guidance concerning issues within TSC\u2019s mission and authority.  We also stated that while this governance board could be suited to assume  more of a leadership role, its authority at that time was limited to TSC- specific issues, and it would need additional authority to provide effective  coordination of terrorist-related screening activities and interagency  issues governmentwide. In January 2010, the FBI stated that TSC has a  Policy Board in place, with representatives from relevant departments and  agencies, that reviews and provides input to the government\u2019s watchlist  policy. The FBI also stated that the policies developed are then sent to the  National Security Council Deputies Committee (formerly the Homeland  Security Council) for ratification. The FBI noted that this process was  used for making the most recent additions and changes to watchlist  standards and criteria. We have not yet been able to determine, however,  whether the Policy Board has the jurisdiction and authority to resolve  issues beyond TSC\u2019s purview, such as issues within the intelligence  community and in regard to the nominations process, similar to the types  of interagency issues the December 25 attempted attack identified. We  maintain that a governance structure with the authority for and  accountability over the entire watchlist process, from nominations  through screening, and across the government is important.", "On January 7, 2010, the President tasked the National Security Staff with  initiating an interagency review of the watchlist process\u2014including the  business processes, procedures, and criteria\u2014and the interoperability and  sufficiency of supporting information technology systems.

The image identifies  objects, or anomalies, on the outside of the physical body but does not  reveal items beneath the surface of the skin, such as implants. TSA plans  to procure two types of AIT units: one type uses millimeter wave and the  other type uses backscatter X-ray technology. Millimeter wave technology  beams millimeter wave radio frequency energy over the body\u2019s surface at  high speed from two antennas simultaneously as they rotate around the  body. The energy reflected back from the body or other objects on the  body is used to construct a three-dimensional image.

However, as of December 31, 2009, according to  a senior TSA official, the agency has deployed 40 of the millimeter wave  AITs, and has procured 150 backscatter X-ray units in fiscal year 2009 and  estimates that these units will be installed at airports by the end of  calendar year 2010. In addition, TSA plans to procure an additional 300  AIT units in fiscal year 2010, some of which will be purchased with funds  from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. TSA plans to  procure and deploy a total of 878 units at all category X through category  IV airports. Full operating capability is expected in fiscal year 2014.

In addition, the estimated training costs  are $50,000 per unit.", "While TSA stated that the AIT will enhance its explosives detection  capability, because the AIT presents a full body image of a person during  the screening process, concerns have been expressed that the image is an  invasion of privacy. According to TSA, to protect passenger privacy and  ensure anonymity, strict privacy safeguards are built into the procedures  for use of the AIT. For example, the officer who assists the passenger  never sees the image that the technology produces, and the officer who  views the image is remotely located in a secure resolution room and never  sees the passenger. Officers evaluating images are not permitted to take  cameras, cell phones, or photo-enabled devices into the resolution room.  To further protect passengers\u2019 privacy, ways have been introduced to blur  the passengers\u2019 images. The millimeter wave technology blurs all facial  features, and the backscatter X-ray technology has an algorithm applied to  the entire image to protect privacy. Further, TSA has stated that the AIT\u2019s  capability to store, print, transmit, or save the image will be disabled at the  factory before the machines are delivered to airports, and each image is  automatically deleted from the system after it is cleared by the remotely  located security officer. Once the remotely located officer determines that  threat items are not present, that officer communicates wirelessly to the  officer assisting the passenger. The passenger may then continue through  the security process. Potential threat items are resolved through a direct  physical pat-down before the passenger is cleared to enter the sterile  area. In addition to privacy concerns, the AITs are large machines, and  adding them to the checkpoint areas will require additional space,  especially since the operators are segregated from the checkpoint to help  ensure passenger privacy."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "TSA Reports That It Is Taking Steps to Operationally Test AITs but Has Not Conducted Vulnerability Assessments", "paragraphs": ["We previously reported on several challenges TSA faces related to the  research, development, and deployment of passenger checkpoint  screening technologies and made a number of recommendations to  improve this process. Two of these recommendations are particularly  relevant today, as TSA moves forward with plans to install a total of 878  additional AITs\u2014completing operational testing of technologies in  airports prior to using them in day-to-day operations and assessing  whether technologies such as the AIT are vulnerable to terrorist  countermeasures, such as hiding threat items on various parts of the body  to evade detection.", "First, in October 2009, we reported that TSA had relied on technologies in  day-to-day airport operations that had not been proven to meet their  functional requirements through operational testing and evaluation,  contrary to TSA\u2019s acquisition guidance and a knowledge-based acquisition  approach. We also reported that TSA had not operationally tested the AITs  at the time of our review, and we recommended that TSA operationally  test and evaluate technologies prior to deploying them. In commenting  on our report, TSA agreed with this recommendation. A senior TSA offici stated that although TSA does not yet have a written policy requiring  operational testing prior to deployment, TSA is now including in its  contracts with vendors that checkpoint screening machines are required  to successfully complete laboratory tests as well as operational tests. The  test results are then incorporated in the source selection plan. The official  also stated that the test results are now required at key decision points by  DHS\u2019s Investment Review Board. While recently providing GAO with  updated information to our October 2009 report, TSA stated that  operational testing for the AIT was completed as of the end of calendar  year 2009. We are in the process of verifying that TSA has tested all of the  AIT\u2019s functional requirements in an operational environment.", "Deploying technologies that have not successfully completed operational  testing and evaluation can lead to cost overruns and underperformance.  TSA\u2019s procurement guidance provides that testing should be conducted in  an operational environment to validate that the system meets all functional  requirements before deployment. In addition, our reviews have shown that  leading commercial firms follow a knowledge-based approach to major  acquisitions and do not proceed with large investments unless the  product\u2019s design demonstrates its ability to meet functional requirements  and be stable. The developer must show that the product can be  manufactured within cost, schedule, and quality targets and is reliable  before production begins and the system is used in day-to-day operations.", "TSA\u2019s experience with the ETPs, which the agency uses for secondary  screening, demonstrates the importance of testing and evaluation in an  operational environment. The ETP detects traces of explosives on a  passenger by using puffs of air to dislodge particles from the passenger\u2019s  body and clothing that the machine analyzes for traces of explosives. TSA  procured 207 ETPs and in 2006 deployed 101 ETPs to 36 airports, the first  deployment of a checkpoint technology initiated by the agency. TSA  deployed the ETPs even though agency officials were aware that tests  conducted during 2004 and 2005 on earlier ETP models suggested that  they did not demonstrate reliable performance. Furthermore, the ETP  models that were subsequently deployed were not first tested to prove  their effective performance in an operational environment, contrary to  TSA\u2019s acquisition guidance, which recommends such testing. As a result,  TSA procured and deployed ETPs without assurance that they would  perform as intended in an operational environment. TSA officials stated  that they deployed the machines without resolving these issues to respond  quickly to the threat of suicide bombers. In June 2006, TSA halted further  deployment of the ETP because of performance, maintenance, and  installation issues. According to a senior TSA official, as of December 31,  2009, all but 9 ETPs have been withdrawn from airports and 18 ETPs  remain in inventory. TSA estimates that the 9 remaining ETPs will be  removed from airports by the end of calendar year 2010. In the future,  using validated technologies would enhance TSA\u2019s efforts to improve  checkpoint security. Furthermore, retaining existing screening procedures  until the effectiveness of future technologies has been validated could  provide assurances that use of checkpoint technologies improves aviation  security.", "Second, as we reported in October 2009, TSA does not know whether its  explosives detection technologies, such as the AITs, are susceptible to  terrorist tactics. Although TSA has obtained information on vulnerabilities  at the screening checkpoint, the agency has not assessed vulnerabilities\u2014 that is, weaknesses in the system that terrorists could exploit in order to  carry out an attack\u2014related to passenger screening technologies, such as  AITs, that are currently deployed. According to TSA\u2019s threat assessment,  terrorists have various techniques for concealing explosives on their  persons, as was evident in Mr. Abdulmutallab\u2019s attempted attack on  December 25, where he concealed an explosive in his underwear.  However, TSA has not assessed whether these and other tactics that  terrorists could use to evade detection by screening technologies, such as  AIT, increase the likelihood that the screening equipment would not detect  the hidden weapons or explosives. Thus, without an assessment of the  vulnerabilities of checkpoint technologies, it is unclear whether the AIT or  other technologies would have been able to detect the weapon Mr.  Abdulmutallab used in his attempted attack. TSA is in the process of  developing a risk assessment for the airport checkpoints, but the agency  has not yet completed this effort or clarified the extent to which this effort  addresses any specific vulnerabilities in checkpoint technology.", "TSA officials stated that to identify vulnerabilities at airport checkpoints,  the agency analyzes information such as the results from its covert testing  program. TSA conducts national and local covert tests, whereby  individuals attempt to enter the secure area of an airport through the  passenger checkpoint with prohibited items in their carry-on bags or  hidden on their persons. However, TSA\u2019s covert testing programs do not  systematically test passenger and baggage screening technologies  nationwide to ensure that they identify the threat objects and materials the  technologies are designed to detect, nor do the covert testing programs  identify vulnerabilities related to these technologies. We reported in  August 2008 that while TSA\u2019s local covert testing program attempts to  identify test failures that may be caused by screening equipment not  working properly or caused by screeners and the screening procedures  they follow, the agency\u2019s national testing program does not attribute a  specific cause of a test failure. We recommended, among other things,  that TSA require the documentation of specific causes of all national  covert testing failures, including documenting failures related to  equipment, in the covert testing database to help TSA better identify areas  for improvement. TSA concurred with this recommendation and stated  that the agency will expand the covert testing database to document test  failures related to screening equipment.", "In our 2009 report, we also recommended that the Assistant Secretary for  TSA, among other actions, conduct a complete risk assessment\u2014including  threat, vulnerability, and consequence assessment\u2014for the passenger  screening program and incorporate the results into TSA\u2019s program  strategy, as appropriate. TSA and DHS concurred with our  recommendation, but have not completed these risk assessments or  provided documentation to show how they have addressed the concerns  raised in our 2009 report regarding the susceptibility of the technology to  terrorist tactics.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes our statement for the record."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Contacts and Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["For additional information on this statement, please contact Eileen  Larence at (202) 512-6510 or larencee@gao.gov or Stephen Lord at (202)  512-4379 or lords@gao.gov.", "In addition to the contacts named above, Kathryn Bernet, Carissa Bryant,  Frances Cook, Joe Dewechter, Eric Erdman, Richard Hung, Anne Laffoon,  Linda Miller, Victoria Miller, and Michelle Woods made key contributions  to this statement.", "This is a work of the U.S. government and is not subject to copyright protection in the  United States.
