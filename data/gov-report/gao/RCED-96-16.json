In 1990, the Congress amended the Clean Air Act to, among other things, require EPA to identify ozone-depleting substances and phase out their production. In December 1993, EPA issued regulations under these provisions to phase out methyl bromide, a widely used agricultural pesticide identified by scientists as an ozone-depleting substance. EPA\u2019s regulations freeze the production and importation of methyl bromide at 1991 levels until January 1, 2001; after this date, the pesticide can no longer be produced or imported into the United States for domestic use.

Shortly after the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) developed the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer (Protocol), the Congress added title VI to the Clean Air Act to supplement the Protocol\u2019s terms and conditions. Amendments to the Protocol and regulations implementing title VI have since expanded the restrictions on individual ozone-depleting chemicals.", "An ozone depletion potential (ODP) index is used under the Protocol and the Clean Air Act to gauge a substance\u2019s relative potential to deplete stratospheric ozone. This index primarily reflects the substance\u2019s (1) likely lifetime in the atmosphere and (2) efficiency in destroying ozone compared with chlorofluorocarbon-11 (CFC-11), a widely used refrigerant and major ozone depleter that is being phased out under the Protocol and the Clean Air Act. On the basis of scientific assessments performed in December 1991 and updated in June 1992, UNEP calculated that methyl bromide has an ODP of 0.7, or 70 percent of CFC-11\u2019s ozone-depleting potential.", "The Protocol originally placed controls on eight major ozone depleters\u2014five chlorofluorocarbons (CFC) and three halons\u2014and provided for technical and scientific assessments of potential ozone-depleting substances to be undertaken at least every 4 years. In November 1992, following the update of UNEP\u2019s 1991 assessment, the parties to the Protocol first imposed controls on methyl bromide. They agreed to accept UNEP\u2019s calculation of methyl bromide\u2019s ODP as 0.7, and they amended the Protocol to freeze production of the substance at 1991 levels, beginning in January 1995. They did, however, create an exemption for the substance\u2019s preshipment and quarantine uses. The parties also agreed to decide by January 1, 1996, how the freeze would affect the consumption of methyl bromide in developing countries. (The Protocol allows methyl bromide producers to produce 10 percent above 1991 levels for export to developing countries.) The parties further agreed to consider imposing additional controls on methyl bromide at their November 1995 meeting, after they had reviewed the results of UNEP\u2019s next round of scientific and technical assessments. These assessments were completed in late 1994.", "Title VI of the Clean Air Act identifies many substances that EPA is to list as ozone depleting and requires the agency to list any others that have an ODP of 0.2 or that it finds may reasonably be anticipated to cause harm to the ozone layer. These substances are to be listed as either class I or class II, depending primarily on their ODP. The title authorizes EPA to add substances to either list and requires the agency to update both periodically. Substances that have an ODP of 0.2 or greater are to be listed as class I, and EPA is to take action to phase out their production no later than 7 years after they are listed. The schedule for phasing out the less threatening class II substances is less stringent.", "In December 1991, three environmental groups petitioned EPA under the Clean Air Act to list methyl bromide as a class I substance. EPA concluded, in large part on the basis of UNEP\u2019s calculation, that methyl bromide has an ODP of 0.7, well above the act\u2019s 0.2 threshold for listing as a class I substance. In December 1993, EPA issued a rule first freezing and then banning the production and importation of methyl bromide. The freeze, which is at 1991 levels, took effect on January 1, 1994. No further reduction from 1991 levels is required until January 1, 2001, when the ban is mandated to begin. EPA imposed no further reductions during this 7-year period because it recognized that the loss of methyl bromide would be costly and it wanted to allow as much time as possible for the development of alternatives. (In promulgating the rule, EPA estimated both the costs and benefits of phasing out methyl bromide. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the University of California at Berkeley and the University of Florida have also estimated the costs of banning methyl bromide\u2019s agricultural uses. App. I summarizes these studies.)", "Table 1 compares the controls placed on methyl bromide by the Montreal Protocol and by EPA\u2019s regulation.", "Methyl bromide is a highly effective fumigant used to control a broad spectrum of pests\u2014insects, nematodes (parasitic worms), weeds, pathogens (bacteria, fungi, and viruses), and rodents. The agricultural community today uses it for over 100 crops. U.S. production in 1993 was over 60 million pounds. About 80 percent is used to fumigate the soil before planting crops. Another 19 percent is used to fumigate harvested agricultural commodities during storage\u2014including those being exported from and imported into the United States\u2014and to fumigate structures such as food processing plants, warehouses, mills, and grain elevators. A small amount is used in the production of other chemicals.", "According to EPA, methyl bromide is a very toxic substance whose effects on human health depend on the concentration and duration of the exposure. Exposure to the pesticide can damage the lungs, eyes, and skin and, in severe cases, cause the central nervous and respiratory systems to fail. Gross permanent disabilities or death may result. Agricultural field workers and structural fumigators have developed respiratory, gastrointestinal, and neurological problems, including inflammation of nerves and organs and degeneration of the eyes. EPA officials told us that exposures to high concentrations have resulted in deaths."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scientific Evidence of Methyl Bromide\u2019s Role in Ozone Depletion", "paragraphs": ["UNEP\u2019s scientific assessments of ozone-depleting substances have concluded that methyl bromide is a significant ozone depleter. Although some uncertainties are involved in these assessments, the participating scientists are confident that methyl bromide\u2019s ODP will not drop below the 0.2 level that triggers the phaseout of the pesticide as a class I substance under the Clean Air Act.", "The atmosphere is made up of distinct layers, each of which has its own composition of gases and natural processes. The troposphere extends from the earth\u2019s surface up to about 6 miles, and the stratosphere extends from the troposphere to about 30 miles above the surface. Although ozone can be harmful in the troposphere\u2014it is a primary constituent of smog\u2014in the stratosphere it helps protect life on earth from the sun\u2019s ultraviolet radiation. (See fig. 1.)", "Ozone is continuously being produced naturally in the stratosphere by a photochemical reaction caused by the sun\u2019s rays. It is also continuously being removed by other chemical reactions. According to scientists involved in the UNEP assessment, the production and destruction of ozone are normally in balance. However, as emissions from human uses of ozone-depleting chemicals reach the stratosphere, more ozone is lost than is created, and the ozone layer is thinned. Similarly, methyl bromide is continuously being produced and removed from the atmosphere by natural processes\u2014scientists estimate that up to 60 percent or more of the methyl bromide in the atmosphere may be released from the oceans. Again, the UNEP scientists believe that the amounts produced and removed by natural processes tend to be in balance. Therefore, their concern about methyl bromide as an ozone depleter is focused on emissions from human uses.", "The scientific basis for the Montreal Protocol\u2019s freeze and EPA\u2019s phaseout was principally a 1992 assessment completed under the auspices of UNEP. This assessment, which scientists from around the world performed for the parties to the Montreal Protocol, concluded that the best estimate of methyl bromide\u2019s ODP was 0.7. The 1994 UNEP scientific assessment found that the pesticide\u2019s ODP is 0.6.", "Producers of methyl bromide and members of the agricultural community have expressed concern about UNEP\u2019s estimate of the substance\u2019s ODP. More specifically, they have questioned UNEP\u2019s calculation of methyl bromide\u2019s \u201clifetime\u201d in the atmosphere, which the 1994 UNEP assessment calculated to be about 1 year. This calculation is important because the less time the substance is in the atmosphere, the less chance it has of reaching the stratosphere and depleting the ozone layer. UNEP\u2019s calculation of the pesticide\u2019s lifetime assumes that significant amounts of methyl bromide are being removed from the atmosphere through chemical reactions in the troposphere and through interaction with the oceans. However, some in industry and the agricultural community have suggested that soil and vegetation may also remove significant amounts of methyl bromide from the atmosphere. Scientists who participated in the UNEP assessment believe that the range of uncertainty factored into their estimates of methyl bromide\u2019s lifetime is sufficient to allow for the possibility that the substance may be removed by soil and vegetation.", "The other major part of the ODP measurement is the relative efficiency of methyl bromide in destroying ozone. On the basis of laboratory measurements, the scientists who participated in the UNEP assessment estimate that bromine, a major component of methyl bromide, is about 50 times more efficient in destroying ozone than the chlorine in chlorofluorocarbons.", "Additional research is addressing the scientific uncertainties currently involved in calculating methyl bromide\u2019s ODP. At this point, the scientists associated with the UNEP assessment anticipate only a further refinement of the ODP calculation.

USDA and the agricultural community, however, are less optimistic than EPA that economical and effective alternatives will be identified by the time the ban on methyl bromide goes into effect in 2001.

Nonchemical alternatives include techniques such as rotating crops to avoid a buildup of pests, using plants that are more pest-resistant, and using organisms like parasitic bacteria to control weeds and nematodes.", "These alternatives, according to EPA, are technically capable of controlling many of the pests currently controlled by methyl bromide. (In its 1994 report, UNEP\u2019s Methyl Bromide Technical Options Committee said that it had identified a technically feasible alternative, either currently available or at an advanced stage of development, for over 90 percent of the uses being made of methyl bromide in 1991. According to the report, alternatives were not identified for controlling some soilborne viruses and other pathogens and for some quarantine procedures.) The key question\u2014assuming that the alternatives do not pose any unmanageable health and environmental risks\u2014is which alternative or combination of alternatives is most effective and economical in a given situation.", "According to USDA officials, alternatives are not currently available for some important uses, such as treating certain quarantined commodities and responding to certain incidents or emergencies. The officials noted, for example, that ships carrying infested commodities may dock at U.S. ports, military equipment contaminated with soilborne pests may be brought back to the United States, or a destructive pest, such as the Mediterranean fruit fly, may be found in an area of California or another state. In these circumstances, they said, fumigation with methyl bromide is the only effective way to deal with the pests.", "USDA officials also pointed out that numerous scientific, economic, and environmental variables have to be considered in evaluating potential replacements. Selecting a replacement can be further complicated because a use can be quite specific. For example, alternatives for preplant soil fumigation (a technique for killing pests in the soil before planting) will need to be selected on the basis of such factors as the crop grown, the pests present in the soil, the climate, and the geographical location. Government and industry researchers believe that considerable research and field testing are needed to define the alternatives\u2019 efficacy, applicability, and cost-effectiveness in given situations.", "To fund research on alternatives to methyl bromide, EPA and USDA spent about $13.3 million in fiscal year 1995 and, according to agency officials, a similar amount has been requested for fiscal year 1996. However, the Crop Protection Coalition estimates that about $60 million is needed annually for this research. According to the Coalition, the public sector has not mobilized sufficient resources and funds to achieve meaningful results before 2001 in either preplant or postharvest applications. The Coalition also believes that this research needs to be more effectively coordinated.", "The Coalition, with USDA\u2019s and EPA\u2019s cooperation, is attempting to consolidate federal and private research activities into a single agenda reflecting a consensus on priorities. In July 1995, the Coalition issued a report on the status of research activities to (1) help prioritize projects for funding, (2) identify gaps in current research, and (3) improve the transfer of technology to users of methyl bromide.

They noted that moving a new pesticide from development to commercialization can take up to 10 years and cost a manufacturer from $50 million to $70 million. As part of this process, the manufacturer must develop the health and safety data that EPA requires to register a pesticide for use.", "Under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), EPA decides whether to register a pesticide after assessing, among other things, the potential effects on human health and the environment of using a pesticide product according to the directions on the label. A separate registration is required for each new chemical, and an existing registration has to be amended for a new or different use. The registration process can take many years, depending on the type of substance, the complexity of the testing needed, the gaps in the data, and the nature of EPA\u2019s findings from the health and safety data submitted for the agency\u2019s review. However, EPA recently established an expedited system for reviewing alternatives to methyl bromide. According to EPA, to date, no new chemicals and only a few new uses of existing chemicals have been submitted to EPA as potential alternatives to methyl bromide.", "Under 1988 amendments to FIFRA, all pesticides registered before November 1984 must be reviewed for reregistration and the data supporting their registrations must be brought up to current scientific standards. Methyl bromide and a number of pesticides that have been approved for use on pests now controlled by methyl bromide are included in this group of chemicals. USDA has identified six of these chemicals as potential alternatives to methyl bromide.", "For each of the alternatives identified by USDA, EPA has found potentially serious environmental and/or health and safety concerns. According to USDA officials, regulatory actions by EPA to ban or limit the use of these or other pesticides because of health and environmental concerns could exacerbate the economic effects of the methyl bromide phaseout by eliminating potentially effective alternatives. However, EPA officials told us that, under FIFRA, the agency balances risks and benefits, and if the benefits of using a pesticide outweigh the potential risks to people and the environment, then EPA may register or reregister the pesticide. The officials said that EPA is likely to reregister many of the chemical alternatives to methyl bromide after adopting appropriate risk mitigation measures, such as label changes.

In addition, some countries require certain U.S. commodities to be treated with methyl bromide as a condition of entry. These exports would likely be lost unless acceptable alternatives could be agreed upon with the importing countries. Likewise, the United States requires treatment with methyl bromide as a condition of entry for certain imports.

For example, the Florida study stated that the use of methyl bromide is critical because of the state\u2019s environment. According to the study, producers faced with substantially reduced revenues would reduce their acreage for fresh fruit, vegetable, and fresh citrus crops. The study concluded that the primary beneficiary would be Mexico, which, the study assumed, would be given longer, as a developing country, to use methyl bromide under any future agreement reached under the Montreal Protocol.

For example, could strawberries be shipped to market in time to maintain the necessary freshness? And would these fruits and vegetables be grown in Mexico at the same time of year as in the United States?", "According to USDA officials, the Florida study and two recent USDA studies document the competition that the United States faces from developing countries, especially Mexico, in markets for crops whose production relies heavily on the use of methyl bromide.

Quarantine requirements are negotiated between the importing and exporting countries for individual commodities, and the treatments are governed by strict regulations that require very high efficacy levels. For example, USDA\u2019s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) requires efficacy levels of 99.9968 percent for most treatments.

However, they expressed concern that the report leaves the impression that the outlook for finding alternatives to methyl bromide is more dire than warranted. In their view, the fact that no single chemical or other alternative is expected to replace methyl bromide for all of its uses does not mean that viable, economical alternatives will not be available for most uses by 2001. Furthermore, they added, even though viable, economical alternatives may not be found for some uses by 2001, current projections of large losses resulting from the phaseout cannot be relied on by any means.", "EPA officials indicated that the agency would look at the need for exemptions and determine whether EPA has the authority to grant them as the deadline for the ban approaches.

The costs and benefits of a ban on these uses were analyzed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) during the promulgation of its phaseout rule. We also identified three other studies of the potential economic impact of a phaseout on agricultural users. The U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s (USDA) National Agricultural Pesticide Impact Assessment Program studied the effects of a phaseout on 21 crops in six states, and the University of California at Berkeley and the University of Florida examined the impact of a phaseout in their states. Each of these studies compared the projected costs and crop yields for likely replacements with those for methyl bromide and found that growers would incur significant losses because of a ban on agricultural uses of methyl bromide. The USDA study also found that consumers would suffer a loss because supplies would be reduced and prices would be higher. Each study based its economic estimates on alternatives available at the time the study was conducted. The economic impact could change if more effective or less costly alternatives are identified in the future.", "The studies by EPA and USDA arrived at substantially different estimates of the impact of a ban on methyl bromide. However, these estimates could not be easily compared because the studies made different assumptions, differed in their scope, and used different methodologies and cost data.

This study included information on the costs and effectiveness of potential new alternatives by the year 2001 and on the costs and benefits of improving the use of existing alternatives. On the basis of this study, EPA estimated that the total costs of a phaseout of methyl bromide between 1994 and 2010 would be $1.7 billion to $2.3 billion. EPA\u2019s cost analysis examined the likely range of costs for the alternatives and coupled these assumptions with a monte carlo analysis, presenting a set of costs (median, mean, minimum, and maximum) that could be expected with a methyl bromide phaseout in 2001. The $1.7 billion figure represented the estimated median cost, and the $2.3 billion figure represented the mean cost. The minimum and maximum costs were estimated at approximately $7 million and roughly $16 billion, respectively. According to EPA, some available alternatives, if used after 2001, may indeed prove to be more expensive than methyl bromide, and their users may receive lower profits if the increases cannot be passed on to consumers. However, EPA said that it has found that the effects of regulatory actions that remove pesticides from the market are mitigated over time as new pest control technologies are introduced and adjustments are made to compensate for the loss of the pesticide through alternative pest control practices.", "EPA estimated that the benefits of the phaseout would be between $244 billion and $952 billion. This estimate was based primarily on avoided cases of nonmelanoma cancers. According to the study, in the longer term (until 2160), a total of 2,800 skin cancer fatalities in the United States would be avoided because of the phaseout. The benefits for the period from 1994 through 2010 were estimated to be between $14 billion and $56 billion. The analysis reflected key assumptions about emissions of methyl bromide from human activities, the impact of bromine on ozone, and the likely growth in use of methyl bromide without regulations. The range in values for benefits results from different estimates of the value of a human life.", "EPA recognized but did not calculate the benefits of avoiding other health and environmental problems caused by increased ultraviolet radiation, such as damage to plants and animals.

The study showed that actions to ban or restrict methyl bromide\u2019s use in the United States would be costly because currently available alternative control practices are less effective or more expensive than using methyl bromide. The study estimated that the annual economic loss to producers and consumers from banning the agricultural uses of methyl bromide included in this study would be about $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. Of this amount, $800 million to $900 million would be attributed to the loss of methyl bromide for soil fumigation and $450 million to its loss for the fumigation of quarantine imports. An additional economic loss of about $200 million would occur if Vorlex\u2014the alternative identified as having the most potential for succeeding methyl bromide\u2014were no longer available. (The manufacturer had indicated to EPA that it planned to stop producing Vorlex because of high reregistration costs.)", "According to the study, a phaseout, rather than an immediate ban, of methyl bromide would postpone annual losses and provide time for potential alternatives to be developed and for consumers and producers to adjust.

The most significantly affected crops would be strawberries, nursery products (cut flowers and rose, fruit, vine, nut, and strawberry plants), and grapes, and estimated net annual farm income losses would be $105.8 million, $71.7 million, and 31.3 million, respectively. Net income losses reflect differences in production costs from using alternative treatments, which are more costly for some crops, and lower revenues from reduced yields.", "The report also found that the cancellation of methyl bromide for postharvest applications would have a significant impact on the profitability of California\u2019s fresh fruit and dried nut crops in the short run because fumigation by another method would cost more and take longer. For example, producers of cherries sell their highest-quality fruit on the export market and receive a premium price. If the cancellation of methyl bromide diverts all of the cherries previously sold on the export market to the domestic market, growers will lose $7.3 million annually. Likewise, walnut producers will have to ship more products to the domestic market instead of the holiday markets abroad because alternative techniques could not be used to fumigate the walnuts quickly enough to meet the holiday markets\u2019 needs. As a result, walnut producers would lose about $36.8 million annually.

The study concludes that producers in the state would reduce the acreage allocated to these crops by 43 percent, from about 126,000 acres to 71,500 acres. Tomato production would decline by more than 60 percent, pepper production by 63 percent, and cucumber production by 46 percent without methyl bromide.
