Since the inception of CHIP,  the percentage of children without health insurance coverage has  decreased by more than half, from 13.9 percent in 1997 to 5.5 percent in  2014. Over the course of the program, Congress has enacted legislation  authorizing continued funding for CHIP. Most recently, the Medicare  Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 appropriated federal CHIP  funding to states through fiscal year 2017.", "Since January 2014, federal subsidies have been available to qualifying  individuals to offset the cost of private health insurance purchased  through health insurance exchanges\u2014marketplaces where eligible  individuals may compare and select among qualified health plans (QHP)  offered by participating private issuers\u2014established under the Patient  Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA).PPACA directed each  state to establish the exchange itself (referred to as a state-based  exchange) or cede the responsibility to the Department of Health and  Human Services (HHS) (referred to as a federally facilitated exchange  (FFE)). The federal government and states each play a role in  overseeing CHIP and the exchanges, including oversight of the CHIP  plans, the QHPs, and the adequacy of provider networks\u2014that is, the  networks of physicians, hospitals, and other providers that contract with  the issuer of the CHIP plan or QHP.", "PPACA also requires that, if a state\u2019s federal CHIP funding is insufficient  to cover all CHIP-eligible  children, the state must establish procedures to  ensure that eligible children who are not covered by CHIP are screened  for Medicaid eligibility.  By law, any state with insufficient federal CHIP  funding is required to have procedures to facilitate the enrollment of  children found ineligible for Medicaid in QHPs certified by HHS as  comparable to CHIP, if any such QHPs are available. The Secretary of  HHS in November 2015 reported there were no QHPs comparable to  CHIP. Children transitioning from CHIP to exchange coverage may be  eligible for federal subsidies established through PPACA to offset the cost  of insurance purchased through the exchanges by eligible families. In  contrast to the more than 8 million children enrolled in CHIP, HHS  estimated that QHPs covered fewer than 1 million children in 2015,  comprising about 8 percent of total QHP enrollment.", "Access to care from pediatric providers\u2014including those practicing in and  outside of children\u2019s hospitals\u2014is important for children, given that they  have different health care needs than adults. Further, receiving regular  preventive care and vaccinations at a young age are a key factor in an  individual\u2019s long-term health. Based on an analysis of the National Survey  of Children\u2019s Health, the Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access  Commission (MACPAC) reported that approximately one-quarter of  children likely to be covered by CHIP reported having special health care  needs. Even the majority of CHIP enrollees who are relatively healthy  may need occasional access to pediatric specialists, many of whom  provide services at children\u2019s hospitals. More than two-thirds of CHIP  enrollees received coverage through states\u2019 CHIP programs that were  administered separately from their Medicaid programs in fiscal year 2013,  and most of these children (80 percent) were enrolled in managed care  plans. In general, in both CHIP managed care plans and QHPs,  enrollees\u2019 choice of providers is largely limited to providers within the  CHIP plan and QHP networks. MACPAC has raised concerns about  whether the provider networks used by QHPs are adequate to address  the health care needs of children.

In this report, we examine:   1.  federal and state provider network adequacy standards CHIP plans  must meet, particularly for pediatric providers, and how these  compare to standards for QHPs;   2.  the extent to which selected issuers of CHIP plans and QHPs include  children\u2019s hospitals in their networks and otherwise help to ensure  access to pediatric specialists; and   3.  how the federal government and selected states monitor CHIP plan  and QHP compliance with provider network adequacy standards.", "To address all three objectives, we reviewed relevant laws, regulations,  and guidance documents to obtain information on network adequacy  standards and monitoring responsibilities at the federal level, and  interviewed knowledgeable officials from HHS\u2019 Centers for Medicare &  Medicaid Services (CMS).  Additionally,  to obtain a broad perspective  on network adequacy for pediatric providers, we interviewed officials from  10 organizations, including the National Association of Insurance  Commissioners (NAIC), research organizations, and stakeholder  organizations representing consumers, issuers, and providers.", "In addition, we selected five states\u2014Alabama, Massachusetts,  Pennsylvania, Texas, and Washington\u2014that administer the majority of  their CHIP programs separately from their Medicaid programs and cover  children ages 0 to 18 in these separate programs. These states varied in  the type of health insurance exchange (i.e., state-based exchange or  FFE), the size of their CHIP program, and their overall child population,  among other characteristics. In these five states, we reviewed  documents such as state laws and contracts between the states and  selected issuers of CHIP plans. We also interviewed or obtained  information in writing regarding network adequacy requirements and  monitoring from knowledgeable officials from state agencies that  administer the CHIP program and departments of insurance in each state,  as well as exchanges in the two state-based exchange states. For the  most populous county in each selected state, we selected issuers and  children\u2019s hospitals from which to obtain information.

For QHPs, we selected  issuers based on total county enrollment in each issuer\u2019s silver plan with  the lowest premium for 2014 or 2015. Where possible, within each state  we selected at least one issuer that offered: (1) only a CHIP plan, (2) only  QHPs, and (3) both a CHIP plan and QHPs.

CHIP is funded jointly by the federal government and states. States  administer CHIP under federal standards, and the state programs may  vary, for example, in the services covered, costs to individuals and  families, and eligibility  standards. Specifically, CHIP income eligibility  standards vary across states, with most states\u2019 upper income eligibility  levels between 200 and 300 percent of the federal poverty level and the  highest eligibility  level being 400 percent of the federal poverty level.  PPACA requires states to maintain their current eligibility  levels for  children in CHIP and Medicaid through fiscal year 2019. Thus, under  current law, some states could choose to eliminate or scale back  coverage for children in their CHIP and Medicaid programs beginning in  fiscal year 2020, even if federal funds for these programs are available.", "PPACA required the establishment of exchanges by January 1, 2014, to  allow consumers to compare individual health insurance options available  in each state and enroll in coverage. As of June 2015, 17 states had  established state-based exchanges and 34 states had FFEs. The  exchanges include certified QHPs offered in the states by the  participating issuers of coverage. QHPs are required to meet certain  benefit design, consumer protection, and other standards. Issuers may  offer multiple QHPs and may also offer other health insurance products  outside of the exchange, such as a CHIP managed care plan, Medicare  Advantage plan, Medicaid managed care plan, or other commercial  insurance products.", "While the CHIP program was created to address the health care needs of  children in low-income families, QHPs offered through the exchanges  established by PPACA are intended to target a broader population.  Specifically, PPACA contained a number of provisions that were intended  to make coverage more available and affordable for individuals seeking  coverage in the private individual and small group health insurance  markets. Some of these provisions established new rules that limit how  much issuers can vary the premiums they charge certain individuals or  groups, as well as prohibiting issuers from denying coverage based on an  individual\u2019s health status, among other things. With the introduction of  QHPs in 2014, researchers have found that issuers have increasingly  employed cost-containment tools\u2014such as creating narrow networks that  include a smaller group of providers and hospitals\u2014as well as by tiering  networks\u2014that is, creating several networks of differing levels of  coverage that reflect different arrangements of out-of-pocket costs that  may be incurred by an enrollee.", "The federal government and states each play a role in overseeing CHIP,  CHIP plans, exchanges, and QHPs:", "CHIP. CMS is the federal agency responsible for overseeing states\u2019  implementation and administration of their CHIP programs, including  establishing federal standards for these programs and ensuring that  states take steps to adequately oversee issuers\u2019 compliance with  these standards. At the state level, state agencies such as the  Medicaid agencies or departments of health or social services are  responsible for administering CHIP programs and overseeing CHIP  plans. For CHIP programs operated through the use of managed  care, the relevant state agencies contract with managed care  organizations to provide services to CHIP enrollees. State  departments of insurance may also play a role in overseeing CHIP  plans, to the extent these plans are subject to state insurance rules.", "QHPs. Regardless of the exchange type, CMS has direct oversight  responsibilities for the PPACA exchanges, as CMS is responsible for  certifying state exchanges for operation and directly operating the  FFE. In addition, CMS is responsible for establishing minimum QHP  certification requirements that all QHPs must meet in order to  participate in an exchange. In the FFE states, CMS oversees  compliance with these requirements; in the states with state-based  exchanges, the states are responsible for ensuring the plans comply.  Federal regulations require that all exchanges have procedures to  annually certify QHPs to ensure they are in compliance with exchange  requirements.", "While we and others have reported on CHIP enrollees\u2019 experiences with  access to health care compared to those with private insurance or without  insurance and comparisons of other aspects of CHIP and QHPs, little is  known about whether the provider networks used by QHPs are adequate  to address the health care needs of children or how CHIP networks  compare with those of QHPs. Specifically, we reported in November 2013  that survey data indicated that CHIP enrollees reported comparably  positive responses regarding their ability to obtain care when compared  with responses for enrollees with private insurance, but that  approximately 18 percent of CHIP enrollees reported difficulties seeing a  specialist. We also reported in February 2015 that coverage of services  by selected CHIP plans in five selected states was generally comparable  to that of the selected QHPs, with the notable exceptions of pediatric  dental and certain enabling services such as translation and  transportation services, which were covered more frequently by the CHIP  plans.

CMS conducts an annual  certification process of QHPs in FFE states. CMS officials told us that  during this process they assess QHPs\u2019 provider networks using the  \u201creasonable access\u201d standard in order to identify networks that  potentially fail to provide access without unreasonable delay, as  required by federal regulations. CMS officials told us they do not  assess QHP networks for their adequacy of pediatric providers or  pediatric specialists because there have not historically been network  adequacy concerns with these types of providers. During the  certification process, CMS officials told us they analyze issuers\u2019 QHP  provider network data on the providers and types of providers in the  networks for each service area using a computerized geographic  mapping and analytics tool. CMS compares the QHPs\u2019 network data  against internal CMS metrics, including time and distance standards  for certain provider categories that have historically raised network  adequacy concerns\u2014hospitals, mental health, oncology, primary  care, and dental. According to CMS officials, 17 QHP issuers were  flagged as having potential network adequacy concerns during the  certification process for benefit year 2015, resulting in CMS  communicating with the issuers through an iterative process to obtain  more information. CMS officials reported that these issuers either  provided what CMS officials deemed to be a reasonable justification  for the lack of providers, such as a lack of available providers in a  specialty or patterns of care that reasonably justify the lack of  providers, or they provided CMS with data to indicate they included  additional providers in their networks since their initial data  submission. CMS officials said that, for benefit years 2014 and 2015,  all issuers ended up providing adequate information about their  networks to be able to attain QHP certification.", "Comprehensive issuer compliance reviews. CMS officials reported  monitoring QHPs\u2019 compliance with provider network standards in FFE  states through comprehensive issuer compliance reviews, though  network adequacy is only one of many elements in these reviews.  During a compliance review, CMS reviews an issuer\u2019s policies and  procedures related to CMS\u2019s internally established availability  and  accessibility standards and also reviews issuers\u2019 compliance with  other federal standards, such as QHPs\u2019 rates, benefit design, and  marketing.

CMS officials reported that they also  conduct post-certification reviews, which focus on a specific topic and  may be conducted for a sample of issuers or for all issuers, depending  on the focus of the review. For example, prior to the start of benefit  year 2015, officials said they reviewed all certified QHP issuers\u2019  websites to make sure the links to their provider directories were  compliant with CMS network adequacy standards\u2014that is, that the  links worked and were easily accessible.", "In addition to these monitoring activities, CMS officials told us they also  receive and respond to consumer complaints about QHPs.
