It may be useful to view this assistance in the context of the costs of damages incurred by the region and the resources necessary to rebuild. Some damage estimates have put capital losses at a range of $70 billion to over $150 billion, while the State of Louisiana estimated that the economic impact on its state alone could reach $200 billion. Such estimates raise important questions regarding additional assistance that will be needed to help the Gulf Coast rebuild in the future. To date, the federal government has provided long-term rebuilding assistance to the Gulf Coast through 2 key programs, which follow different funding models. The Federal Emergency Management Agency's public assistance program provides public infrastructure funding for specific projects that meet program eligibility requirements. HUD's CDBG program, on the other hand, provides funding for neighborhood revitalization and housing rehabilitation activities, affording states broad discretion and flexibility. To date, the affected states have received $16.7 billion in CDBG funding from supplemental appropriations--so far, the largest share of funding targeted to rebuilding. With the vast number of homes that sustained damage in Louisiana and Mississippi, each state allocated the bulk of its CDBG funds to homeowner assistance. Louisiana developed an assistance program to encourage homeowners to return to Louisiana and begin rebuilding while Mississippi developed a program to target homeowners who suffered losses due to Katrina's storm surge that were not covered by insurance. As of March 28, 2007, Louisiana has awarded 4,808 grants to homeowners with an average award amount of $74,250. Mississippi has awarded 11,894 grants with an average award amount of $69,669. Restoring the region's housing and infrastructure is taking place in the context of broader planning and coordination activities. In Louisiana and Mississippi, state and local governments are engaged in both short-and long-term planning efforts. Further, the President established a position within the Department of Homeland Security to coordinate and support rebuilding activities at the federal, state, and local levels. As states and localities begin to develop plans for rebuilding, there are difficult policy decisions Congress will need to make about the federal government's contribution to the rebuilding effort and the role it might play over the long-term in an era of competing priorities. Based on our work, we raise a number of questions the Subcommittee may wish to consider in its oversight of Gulf Coast rebuilding. Such questions relate to the costs for rebuilding the Gulf Coast--including the federal government's share, the effectiveness of current funding delivery mechanisms, and the federal government's efforts to leverage the public investment in rebuilding."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I appreciate the opportunity to participate in today\u2019s hearing to discuss our  preliminary work and observations on Gulf Coast rebuilding issues. The  size and scope of the devastation caused by the Gulf Coast hurricanes  presents the nation with unprecedented rebuilding challenges. Wide  swaths of housing, infrastructure, and businesses were destroyed, leaving  more than 1,500 people dead and hundreds of thousands of others  displaced without shelter and employment. Today, more than a year and a  half since the hurricanes made landfall, rebuilding efforts are at a critical  turning point. The Gulf Coast and the nation must now face the daunting  challenges of rebuilding. Our recent work in southern Louisiana and New  Orleans confirms that some communities are still without basic needs,  such as schools, hospitals, and other infrastructure, while the doors of  many businesses remain closed. Many Gulf Coast neighborhoods and  communities will need to be rebuilt\u2014some from the ground up.", "Current rebuilding activities, including the bulk of federal rebuilding  assistance, are directed primarily towards restoring the region\u2019s stock of  livable housing and essential infrastructure. Over the coming years,  perhaps decades, significant and complex challenges lie ahead. Major  decisions will need to be made regarding a wide range of issues including  coastal restoration, levee protection, infrastructure, land use, and  economic recovery. All levels of government, together with the private and  nonprofit sectors will need to play a critical role in this process. Agreeing  on what rebuilding will be done, where, how, and\u2014particularly  important\u2014who will bear the costs, will be key to moving forward with  the rebuilding process.", "My testimony today will offer some preliminary observations on rebuilding  efforts in the Gulf Coast that may assist you in your oversight of these  activities\u2014now and over the longer term. I would like to: (1) place the  federal assistance provided to date in the context of the resources likely  needed to rebuild the Gulf Coast; (2) discuss the key federal programs that  provide rebuilding assistance, with an emphasis on the Community  Development Block Grant (CDBG) program; (3) describe some differences  in Louisiana\u2019s and Mississippi\u2019s approach to using CDBG funds; and   (4) provide some observations on planning activities in Louisiana and  Mississippi and the role of the federal government in coordinating Gulf  Coast rebuilding efforts.

Specifically, we interviewed state and local officials as well as  representatives from nongovernmental organizations in these two states  and analyzed state and local documentation related to rebuilding funding  and allocations and planning initiatives. We also interviewed various  federal officials from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)  and the Coordinator of Federal Support for the Recovery and Rebuilding  of the Gulf Coast Region within the Department of Homeland Security  (DHS) and analyzed federal regulations and state policies regarding Gulf  Coast federal funding.

The bulk of this assistance was provided between September 2005 and  June 2006 through four emergency supplemental appropriations. A  substantial portion of this assistance was directed to emergency  assistance and meeting short-term needs arising from these hurricanes,  such as relocation assistance, emergency housing, immediate levee repair,  and debris removal efforts. Consequently, a relatively small portion of  federal assistance is available for longer-term rebuilding activities such as  the restoration of the region\u2019s housing and infrastructure. Later in this  statement, I will discuss in greater detail the two programs that the federal  government has used so far to provide assistance to the Gulf Coast for  longer-term rebuilding.", "It is useful to view the federal assistance provided to the Gulf Coast within  the context of the overall costs of the damages incurred by the region and  the resources necessary to rebuild. Although there are no definitive or  authoritative estimates of these costs, the various estimates of aspects of  these costs offer a sense of their magnitude. For example, early damage  estimates from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) put capital losses  from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita at a range of $70 billion to $130 billion  while another estimate put losses solely from Hurricane Katrina\u2014 including capital losses\u2014at over $150 billion. Further, the state of  Louisiana has estimated that the economic impact on its state alone could  reach $200 billion. While the exact costs of damages and rebuilding the  Gulf Coast may never be known, they will likely surpass those from the  three other costliest disasters in recent history\u2014Hurricane Andrew, the  September 2001 terrorist attacks, and the 1994 Northridge earthquake.
