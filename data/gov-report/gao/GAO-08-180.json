Two primary tools for identifying agents released and their dispersion and effect are equipment to detect and identify CBRN agents in the environment and plume models to track the dispersion of airborne releases of these agents. GAO reports on the limitations of the CBRN detection equipment, its performance standards and capabilities testing, plume models available for tracking urban dispersion of CBRN materials, and information for determining how exposure to CBRN materials affects urban populations. To assess the limitations of CBRN detection equipment and urban plume modeling for first responders' use, GAO met with and obtained data from agency officials and first responders in three states."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["While the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and other agencies have taken steps to improve homeland defense, local first responders still do not have tools to accurately identify right away what, when, where, and how much chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear (CBRN) materials are released in U.S. urban areas, accidentally or by terrorists. Equipment local first responders use to detect radiological and nuclear material cannot predict the dispersion of these materials in the atmosphere. No agency has the mission to develop, certify, and test equipment first responders can use for detecting radiological materials in the atmosphere. According to DHS, chemical detectors are marginally able to detect an immediately dangerous concentration of chemical warfare agents. Handheld detection devices for biological agents are not reliable or effective. DHS's BioWatch program monitors air samples for biothreat agents in selected U.S. cities but does not provide first responders with real-time detection capability. Under the BioWatch system, a threat agent is identified within several hours to more than 1 day after it is released, and how much material is released cannot be determined. DHS has adopted few standards for CBRN detection equipment and has no independent testing program to validate whether it can detect CBRN agents at the specific sensitivities manufacturers claim. DHS has a mission to develop, test, and certify first responders' CB detection equipment, but its testing and certification cover equipment DHS develops, not what first responders buy. Interagency studies show that federal agencies' models to track the atmospheric release of CBRN materials have major limitations in urban areas. DHS's national TOPOFF exercises have demonstrated first responders' confusion over competing plume models' contradictory results. The Interagency Modeling and Atmospheric Assessment Center (IMAAC), created to coordinate modeling predictions, lacks procedures to resolve contradictory predictions. Evaluations and field testing of plume models developed for urban areas show variable predictions in urban environments. They are limited in obtaining accurate data on the characteristics and rate of CBRN material released. Data on population density, land use, and complex terrain are critical to first responders, but data on the effects of exposure to CBRN materials on urban populations have significant gaps. Scientific research is lacking on how low-level exposure to CBRN material affects civilian populations, especially elderly persons, children, and people whose immune systems are compromised."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["A terrorist act involving the use of a chemical, biological, radiological, or  nuclear (CBRN) agent or weapon presents an array of complex issues to  state and local responders.

They  must also determine whether the agent has spread beyond the incident site  and what actions should be taken to protect other people.", "Since at least 2001, it has been recognized that CBRN materials might be  released by a terrorist act when letters laced with anthrax were sent  through the mail to two U.S. senators and members of the media. The  letters led to the first cases of anthrax disease related to bioterrorism in  the United States. In all, 22 persons contracted anthrax disease and 5 died  in four states and Washington, D.C. The anthrax attack highlighted the  nation\u2019s vulnerability. In 2002, the Congress enacted legislation to create  the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), merging 22 separate  agencies, with the primary mission of protecting the United States against  conventional and unconventional attacks. In addition, the Homeland  Security Council (HSC), in coordination with DHS and other federal  agencies, identified nine possible scenarios involving the release of CBRN  materials in urban areas. In one scenario, for example, terrorists release  sarin in three city office buildings. In this scenario, it is estimated that  6,000 people are killed and economic damages amount to $300 million.", "Typically, the first to show up in emergency situations like these are local  first responders. Local first responders are responsible for identifying the  nature of an emergency. In order to respond to a CBRN event, first  responders need timely and accurate information about the type and  quantity of agents released, where and when they were released, and how  far contamination is likely to spread. Also critical for first responders is  information on the potential effects on civilian populations from exposure  to concentrations of CBRN materials.", "In incidents caused by airborne CBRN releases, first responders\u2019 two  primary tools are (1) detection equipment to identify CBRN materials  released into the atmosphere and (2) information from plume models that  track airborne dispersion of CBRN materials and define the area of  contamination. In this report, we focus on the limitations of these tools  for first responders. Detection devices identify and confirm in real time the  chemical or particle stimuli by triggering signals or alarms when certain  sensitivity and specificity parameters are detected. With respect to  equipment first responders purchase with DHS grant funds, DHS is  required to establish and implement procedures for developing and  adopting standards for such equipment to ensure that it meets a minimum  level of performance, functionality, adequacy, durability, sustainability,  and interoperability.

County and local hazardous  materials (hazmat) teams and bomb squads would be among the first units  called to augment the first responders. A major terrorist act involving  CBRN materials might cause significant casualties among the first  responders. It is therefore critical that they be able to quickly identify,  locate, characterize, and assess the potential effect of CBRN, explosive, or  incendiary threats and communicate this information rapidly and  effectively.", "The primary challenge facing first responders is knowing how to identify  and distinguish between CBRN releases. The first responders need to be  able to communicate what was released, the quantity of the material  released (and its purity, in the case of chemical agents), where it is going,  who is at risk, and how to respond. Of ultimate interest are the human  health and environmental effects, since exposure to CBRN materials can  kill or seriously injure people through their physiological effects. A  chemical agent attacks the organs of the human body so as to prevent  them from functioning normally. The results are usually disabling and can  even be fatal. However, DHS S&T officials said that for biological agents,  there \u201cwill be no first responders\u201d in the traditional sense of being present  while the aerosol cloud is present, and so they are not preferentially  exposed in the initial exposure. Follow-up investigation does pose  additional risk to the first responders from contamination and  reaerosolization, but they can be suitably protected by both personal  protective equipment and antimicrobials.", "The danger that TICs and TIMs will be released in urban areas from  industrial and transportation accidents is also of concern. Approximately  800,000 shipments of hazardous materials such as liquid chlorine and  ammonia travel daily throughout the United States by ground, rail, air,  water, and pipeline. Many are explosive, flammable, toxic, and corrosive  and can be extremely dangerous when improperly released. They are often  transported over, through, and under densely populated areas, where a  release could cause injury or death and significant environmental damage.", "Both international and domestic accidents illustrate the potentially  catastrophic effects of the release of TICs and TIMs. An accidental, large- scale hazardous release in Bhopal, India, in 1984, killed approximately  3,800 people and left thousands of people with permanent or partial  disabilities. More recently, on January 6, 2005, in Graniteville, South  Carolina, a freight train pulling three chlorine tanker cars and a sodium  hydroxide tanker car collided with a train parked on an industrial rail spur.  Almost immediately, 11,500 gallons of chlorine gas released from the  tankers caused 9 people to die, 8 from inhaling chlorine gas, and at least  529 to seek medical care for possible chlorine exposure. A visible cloud  that spread initially in all directions led local emergency officials to issue a  shelter-in-place order. South Carolina officials later declared a state of  emergency, under which local authorities evacuated 5,453 residents within  a mile\u2019s radius of the collision.", "In contrast to chemical agents, biological agents can multiply in the human  body, significantly increasing their effects. Many biological agents are  highly virulent and toxic; they may have an incubation period so that their  effects are not seen for hours to days.

Buildings create complex wind and turbulence patters in urban  areas, including updrafts and downdrafts; channeling of winds down street  canyons; and calm winds or \u201cwake\u201d regions, where toxic materials may be  trapped and retained between buildings. Since most existing models have  little or no building awareness, they could be misapplied in urban settings  with fatal consequences. According to LLNL modeling experts,  misinterpretation of modeling results is a key issue facing first responders.  Many users assume that models are more accurate than warranted,  because of the impression left by model predictions showing that  individual buildings may actually not be accurately predicting fine-scale  features, like the location of hot spots and plume arrival and departure  times.", "Obtaining information on the source term, or the characteristics of CBRN  materials released, is also a problem with current models, especially in  complex urban environments. When modeling is used in an emergency,  characterizing the source term and local transport is typically the greatest  source of uncertainty. First responders\u2019 key questions are, What was  released, when, where, and how much? Locating the source and  determining its strength based on downwind concentration measurements  is complicated by the presence of buildings that can divert flow in  unexpected directions. Answers may not be available or may be based on  uncertain and incomplete data that cannot be confirmed. For example,  evidence of the release of a biological agent may not be known for days or  weeks, when the population begins to show symptoms of exposure,  becomes ill, and is hospitalized.", "Information from four basic categories of models is available to first  responders today:  1.  Gaussian plume or puff models, widely used since the 1940s, can be  run quickly and easily by nonspecialists. They typically use only a  single constant wind velocity and stability class to characterize  turbulence diffusion. They can be reasonably reliable over short ranges  in situations involving homogeneous conditions and simple flows, such  as unidirectional steady state flow over relatively flat terrain. The  CAMEO/ALOHA model is a Gaussian plume model that has been  widely distributed to first responders.  2.  Lagrangian models (puff and particle) provide more detailed resolution  of boundary layer processes and dispersion. Puff models represent  plumes by a sequence of puffs, each of which is transported at a wind  speed and direction determined by the winds at its center of mass.   Lagrangian particle models use Monte Carlo methods to simulate the  dispersion of fluid marker particles. These models can capture plume  arrival and departure times and peak concentrations. Examples of  models in this category include HPAC (puff model), HYSPLIT and  LODI (particle models).  3.  Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) are first principles physics  models that simulate the complex flow patterns created in urban areas  by large buildings and street canyons. CFD models provide the highest  fidelity transport and diffusion simulations but are computationally  expensive compared to Gaussian or Lagrangian models. They can take  hours or days to run on a large computer. However, CFD models can  capture plume arrival and departure times and peak concentrations.  4.  Empirical urban models are derived from wind tunnel and field  experiment data.  These models incorporate urban effects by explicitly  resolving buildings. Such models are not considered as accurate as  CFD models because of their empirical basis, particularly for the  highest temporal and spatial resolutions and near-source regions.   They need to be carefully validated.  Examples include the Urban  Dispersion Model and the Quick Urban and Industrial Complex  dispersion modeling system.", "For example, EPA and NOAA developed the CAMEO/ALOHA model  specifically for first responders\u2019 use. Widely used by state and local first  responders, it originated as an aid in modeling the release of TICs but has  evolved over the years into a tool for a broad range of response and  planning. CAMEO is a system of software applications used to plan for and  respond to chemical emergencies and includes a database with specific  emergency response information for over 6,000 chemicals. ALOHA can  plot a gas plume\u2019s geographic spread on a map. It employs an air  dispersion model that allows the user to estimate the downwind  dispersion of a chemical cloud based on the toxicological and physical  characteristics of the released chemical, atmospheric conditions, and  specific circumstances of the release.", "However, like any model, CAMEO/ALOHA cannot be more accurate than  the information given to it to work with. Even with the best possible input  values, CAMEO/ALOHA can be unreliable in certain situations, such as at  low wind speeds, very stable atmospheric conditions, wind shifts and  terrain steering effects, and concentration patchiness, particularly near the  spill source of a release. CAMEO/ALOHA does not account for the effects  of byproducts from fires, explosions, or chemical reactions; particulates;  chemical mixtures; terrain; and hazardous fragments. It does not make  predictions for distances greater than 6.2 miles (10 kilometers) from the  release point or for more than an hour after a release begins, because wind  frequently shifts direction and changes speed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "TOPOFF 2 Revealed Weaknesses in Coordinating Plume Modeling Efforts", "paragraphs": ["That using several competing models supported by different agencies can  produce contradictory results and confuse first responders was  highlighted during DHS\u2019s TOPOFF 2003 and 2005 exercises.

Running counter to typical norms, they went almost  directly against the prevailing winds and \u201cstraight as an arrow\u201d where the  terrain would certainly have diverted their path. Confusion resulted from  models being generated using different meteorological inputs.  The  resulting plume models were contradictory.

In fact, about 2 hours before the truck explosion, a small aircraft had  flown over the New London City Pier, releasing mustard in a gaseous form  over the area.

The  Connecticut Joint Field Office also sought plume products that assumed  either an air or a ground release but not both.

This  misinformation resulted from state officials\u2019 claim that the FBI had  determined that the plane contained no chemicals.

Existing  nonurban and urban plume models for emergency response to CBRN  events have several limitations as a primary tool for tracking the release of  CBRN materials in urban areas and for making decisions about handling  them. National TOPOFF exercises have also shown the problems and  confusion that could occur to first responders\u2019 responses to CBRN events  from disparate modeling inputs and results. In addition, more data are  needed about the effects of hazardous materials in built-up urban  environments. Continued improvements are needed in urban building and  population databases and for understanding the health effects from  concentrations of hazardous substances, especially on vulnerable  populations, so that first responders are properly prepared for addressing  airborne releases of harmful materials in urban areas.", "Led by DHS, ongoing federal efforts have attempted to improve the  capabilities of detection systems and models so that first responders can  accurately identify CBRN materials released in urban environments, the  extent of their dispersion, and their effect on urban populations. For  detection equipment, one shortcoming that should be addressed is the lack  of emphasis on the development of detection equipment that first  responders can use to detect radiological materials in the atmosphere.  DHS has recognized the threat of a terrorist attack involving the explosion  of radiological dispersal devices\u2014or dirty bombs\u2014and has used this as a  scenario in TOPOFF exercises. However, DHS\u2019s development of radiation  detection equipment has largely focused on the interdiction of radioactive  material rather than on detecting the release of radioactive material into  the atmosphere in urban areas.

While DHS indicated it  has missions to develop, independently test, and certify CB detection  equipment for first responders\u2019 use, its testing and certification are limited  to equipment DHS is developing and does not extend to equipment  developed by commercial manufacturers. As we have noted, DHS has no  evaluation and qualification program that guides and informs first  responders on the veracity of manufacturers\u2019 claims about the  performance of their CBRN detection systems.

At best, models can give a  close approximation and can help inform a decision maker on the  probable plume. The TOPOFF exercises demonstrated that plume model  results developed without the incorporation of field data are only  estimates that should be used for guidance but are not an accurate  rendition of the actual situation facing first responders. Plume models are  most effectively used to provide early estimates of potentially  contaminated areas in combination with data gathered from the field.

DHS\u2019s S&T Directorate assessed  that while current detectors can be used for rapid warning of chemicals in  the vapor phase, they are generally considered inadequate to provide  information on the presence of chemical threat agents at less than lethal  but still potentially harmful levels.  According to DHS\u2019s S&T, HHAs, the  tool that first responders would use to detect biological threat agents, do  not have the sensitivity to detect the atmospheric concentrations of agents  that pose health risks.  Moreover, the detection of biological agent  aerosols and particulates through the current BioWatch sample collection  and laboratory analysis process is time-consuming and labor intensive,  with final confirmation occurring long after initial exposure.", "With respect to testing and validation of commercial CBRN detection  equipment available for first responder use, DHS stated that there is no  legislative requirement that such equipment for homeland security  applications meet performance standards.  DHS also believes that it will  never be feasible for the federal government to fund testing of all  commercial detectors without first assessing their potential merits for  detection of CBRN agents because of the very large number of hazardous  CBRN agents and the expense of testing detectors against these agents.", "While there is no legislative requirement that CBRN detection equipment  for homeland security meet performance requirements, we noted in our  report that DHS does require that commercial detection equipment first  responders purchase with DHS grant funds comply with equipment  performance standards adopted by DHS. However, DHS has adopted few  performance standards for CBRN detection equipment.  Without such  standards, first responders may purchase detection equipment that does  not detect harmful levels or whose performance varies. Without standards,  there would be no way to ensure the reliability of the equipment\u2019s  detection capabilities.", "As we indicated in our report, DHS had adopted only four standards for  radiation and nuclear detection equipment as of October 30, 2007.  DHS  acknowledged that current testing is mainly limited to DHS and DOD CBRN  detection systems under development, and it has no process to validate the  performance of commercial CBRN detection equipment.  However, we are  not recommending that DHS test all available commercial detection  equipment.  We are recommending that DHS independently test and evaluate  detection equipment first responders purchase using DHS grant funds. (DHS\u2019s  comments appear in appendix III.)", "In DOC\u2019s general comments on our draft report, DOC stated that it  believed that even with the implementation of our recommendations  aimed at improving IMAAC operations, the plume models will still have  several limitations as a primary tool for tracking the release of CBRN  materials in urban areas.  To improve information available for emergency  managers, DOC suggested offering a recommendation that DHS work with  the federal plume modeling community to accelerate research and  development to address plume model deficiencies in urban areas. Such  efforts should include improvements to meteorological information, plume  models, and data sets to evaluate plume models.  DOC acknowledged that  these improvements would be likely to take several years, but work should  be initiated while IMAAC is instituting improvements.", "We believe that DOC\u2019s recommendation has merit and have included it in  our final report for DHS\u2019s consideration.", "DOC also stated that it believed that IMAAC should be working to improve  federal modeling and assessment capabilities and to enhance the national  scientific capability through cooperation among the federal agencies for  incidents of national significance.  IMAAC and the atmospheric transport  and diffusion community should support OFCM in developing a joint  model development and evaluation strategy.", "We also agree that IMAAC should continue to improve federal modeling  and assessment capabilities with OFCM and other federal agencies  involved with modeling terrorist-related or accidental releases of CBRN  materials in urban areas. This is included in our recommendation. In  technical comments on our draft report, IMAAC operations staff at LLNL  stressed that improvements to plume modeling information and  predictions are best achieved by establishing trusted working  relationships with federal, state, and local agency operations centers and  deployed assets.", "DOC also stated that the inference in our report that IMAAC will be  providing a single dispersion solution is misleading. IMAAC, as a federal  entity, provides a recommendation to the local incident commander and  the commander decides what information to use.  This stems from the  basis that all events are local in nature.  DOC stated that it believed that  the report should also highlight the need to promote an aggressive  program of educating first responder and local incident commanders in  the use of dispersion models.", "We clarified our discussion in the report about the role of IMAAC in order to  remove any inference that it was expected to provide a single dispersion  solution.  We noted in our draft report that IMAAC does not replace or  supplant the atmospheric transport and dispersion modeling activities of  other agencies whose modeling activities support their missions. IMAAC  provides a single point for the coordination and dissemination of federal  dispersion modeling and hazard prediction products that represent the  federal position during actual or potential incidents requiring federal  coordination.  We also noted in our conclusions that TOPOFF exercise results  demonstrated the larger problem of the confusion among first responders\u2019  awareness about the timing, value, and limitations of plume models and other  analyses following a CBRN event.  We agree that an aggressive program for  educating first responders on the use of dispersion models is needed.", "DOC also commented on our discussion about the confusion from the  models produced during the TOPOFF 2 exercise.  DOC noted that the  confusion resulted from models being generated using different  meteorological inputs\u2014real weather versus \u201ccanned\u201d weather.  We noted  in our draft report that one major cause for the confusion was the use of  different meteorological inputs in the modeling conducted during TOPOFF  2.  (DOC\u2019s comments appear in app. IV.)", "We also received technical comments from DHS and DOC, from DOD, and  from DOE (LLNL), and we made changes to the report where appropriate.   Technical comments we received from LLNL, in particular, proposed  broadening the recommendation related to revising IMAAC standard  operating procedures to deal with contradictory modeling inputs.  IMAAC  operations staff at LLNL believed that integrating procedures with other  emergency response agencies are the key to clarifying plume modeling  information. They stated that their experience has shown that refining  IMAAC\u2019s standard operating procedures is relatively ineffective unless this is  coordinated with the development of joint operating procedures with other  agencies, leading to the incorporation of IMAAC into these agencies\u2019 standard  operations.  We agreed and have revised our recommendation accordingly.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretaries of Commerce,  Defense, Energy, and Homeland Security and others who are interested.
