This report examines (1) why the primary role for mass care in the NRF shifted from the Red Cross to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and potential issues with implementation, (2) whether National Voluntary Organizations Active in Disasters (NVOAD)--an umbrella organization of 49 voluntary agencies--is equipped to fulfill its NRF role, (3) the extent to which FEMA has addressed issues with mass care for the disabled since the hurricanes, (4) the extent to which major voluntary agencies have prepared to better serve the disabled since the hurricanes, and (5) the extent to which FEMA has addressed issues voluntary agencies faced in receiving Public Assistance reimbursement. To analyze these issues, GAO reviewed the NRF and other documents, and interviewed officials from FEMA, voluntary agencies, and state and local governments."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["FEMA and the Red Cross agreed that FEMA should be the primary agency for mass care in the NRF because the primary agency should be able to direct federal agencies' resources to meet mass care needs, which the Red Cross cannot do. The shifting roles present several implementation issues. For example, while FEMA has enhanced responsibilities for coordinating the activities of voluntary organizations, it does not currently have a sufficient number of specialized staff to meet this responsibility. NVOAD has characteristics that help it carry out its broad role of facilitating voluntary organization and government coordination, but limited staff resources constrain its ability to effectively fulfill its role in disaster response situations. NVOAD held daily conference calls with its members after Hurricane Katrina, but these calls were not an effective means of sharing information, reflecting the fact that NVOAD had only one employee at the time of Katrina. FEMA has begun taking steps in several areas to improve mass care for the disabled based on lessons learned from the Gulf Coast hurricanes. For example, FEMA hired a Disability Coordinator to integrate disability issues into federal emergency planning and preparedness efforts. However, FEMA has generally not coordinated with a key federal disability agency, the National Council on Disability, in the implementation of various initiatives, as required by the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006. The Red Cross has taken steps to improve mass care services for the disabled, but still faces challenges. For example, the Red Cross developed a shelter intake form to assist staff in determining whether a particular shelter can meet an individual's needs. However, Red Cross officials said that some local chapters are still not fully prepared to serve individuals with disabilities. Other voluntary organizations had not identified a need to improve services for individuals with disabilities, and we did not identify concerns with their services. FEMA has partially addressed the issues faced by local voluntary organizations, such as churches, in seeking Public Assistance reimbursement for mass care-related expenses after the hurricanes. At the time of the hurricanes, a key FEMA reimbursement program was not designed for a disaster of Katrina's magnitude, but FEMA has changed its regulations to address this issue. Local voluntary organizations also had difficulty getting accurate information about reimbursement opportunities. Key FEMA staff had not received training on reimbursement policies and sometimes did not provide accurate information, and some of the information on FEMA's Web site was not presented in a user-friendly format. FEMA has not addressed these communication issues."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The 2005 Gulf Coast hurricanes caused extensive human suffering and  damage along the Gulf Coast, and highlighted the need for improved  coordination of mass care services, such as shelter and feeding. Voluntary  organizations, including the American Red Cross and the Salvation Army,  play a critical role in providing these services after disasters. Using lessons  learned from the hurricanes, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)  has developed the National Response Framework (NRF) that defines the  roles of federal, state, local, tribal governments; the private sector; and  voluntary organizations in response to disasters, including mass care. The  NRF\u2014which was released in January 2008\u2014designates 15 emergency  support functions (ESF) that address specific disaster response needs.   The NRF made a key change to the prior 2004 National Response Plan  (NRP) by shifting the primary agency responsibility for coordinating  federal support for mass care under the sixth emergency support function  (ESF-6) from the Red Cross to the Federal Emergency Management  Agency (FEMA), a federal agency that is a component of DHS.  As the  primary agency for mass care, FEMA is responsible for convening  organizations that are part of ESF-6 after disasters and responding to state  requests for assistance by directing resources from federal agencies to  meet state needs. Under the NRF, states continue to have principal  responsibility for meeting mass care needs.", "When responding to a disaster, states utilize the mass care services of  voluntary organizations. The Red Cross\u2014the nation\u2019s largest mass care  provider\u2014has two distinct roles in disaster response. As a support agency  under ESF-6 of the NRF, the Red Cross assists FEMA and states in  coordinating mass care activities. The Red Cross also maintains a separate  role outside of the federal framework as a private mass care service  provider using donated funds. National Voluntary Organizations Active in  Disasters (NVOAD), an umbrella organization of 49 nonprofits (see app. II  for a list of NVOAD members as of December 2007), is also a support  agency under ESF-6. NVOAD has responsibility for sharing information  and facilitating collaboration among its members while these  organizations plan for and respond to disasters. As support agencies, the  Red Cross and NVOAD work with FEMA at the nation\u2019s disaster response  center after disasters. After Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, mass care  services to the disabled and elderly were identified as a key problem.  Partly in response, Congress passed the Post-Katrina Emergency  Management Reform Act of 2006 (Post-Katrina Act or the Act), which  included provisions directing FEMA to assist states, localities, and  voluntary organizations in preparing to serve these populations.", "After Katrina, local voluntary organizations\u2014such as churches\u2014played a  critical role in providing mass care. At one point after Katrina, nearly as  many evacuees were staying in shelters operated by chuches and other  small nonprofits as were staying in Red Cross shelters. These  organizations often sought reimbursement for related expenses through  the Public Assistance program, which is administered by FEMA. The  federal government generally provides funds to state and local  governments through the Public Assistance program, which then  reimburse voluntary organizations.", "Our previous work on the federal response to the 2005 Gulf Coast  hurricanes identified three main areas of concern: a lack of clearly defined  roles and responsibilities, the capabilities to perform those roles and  responsibilities, and accountability for resources. This report examines  the following questions: (1) What was the rationale of DHS for shifting the  primary role for coordinating mass care from the Red Cross to FEMA, and  what are potential implementation issues associated with this change? (2)  How well equipped is NVOAD to fulfill its role in ESF-6 of the NRF? (3) To  what extent has FEMA addressed issues that arose after Hurricanes  Katrina and Rita with the provision of mass care services to the disabled  and elderly? (4) To what extent have major national voluntary  organizations made preparations since Hurricanes Katrina and Rita to  better meet the mass care needs of the disabled and elderly? and (5) What  difficulties did local voluntary organizations providing mass care after  Katrina and Rita face in being reimbursed under FEMA\u2019s Public Assistance  Program, and to what extent has FEMA addressed these issues?", "To obtain information on changes in the roles of FEMA and the Red Cross  under the NRF, we reviewed key FEMA and Red Cross documents, such  as the new NRF, and interviewed officials from FEMA, the Red Cross,  other major national voluntary organizations, including the Salvation Army  and Southern Baptists, and emergency management officials from a  selection of states that included Louisiana, Mississippi, and nine other  states throughout the country to help us identify potential implementation  issues with the shift in roles in the new ESF-6. We gathered information  about NVOAD\u2019s capability to perform its NRF role by reviewing NVOAD  documents about its member services, internal governance, funding and  plans for the future. We also interviewed officials from NVOAD, eight of  NVOAD\u2019s member organizations, and FEMA to obtain additional  information. To gather information about the efforts made by FEMA and  voluntary organizations to improve services for individuals with  disabilities and the elderly, we interviewed FEMA officials, officials from  five major national voluntary organizations\u2013the Red Cross, Salvation  Army, Catholic Charities, Southern Baptists, and United Way\u2013local- and  state-level emergency managers from Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas,  and officials from advocacy groups for elderly and disabled populations.  We also reviewed FEMA and Red Cross documents that pertained to the  elderly and disabled. To examine issues related to the Public Assistance  Program, we reviewed FEMA\u2019s regulations, policies, and protocols for  reimbursements at the time of Katrina and subsequent changes to these  regulations, policies and procedures. We also reviewed FEMA\u2019s website  and interviewed officials within FEMA\u2019s Public Assistance Program,  FEMA\u2019s Voluntary Agency Liaisons, local voluntary organizations  providing mass care that sought reimbursement, and state and local  governments in the Gulf Coast region.

Other voluntary organizations  focus on providing longer-term assistance, such as job training,  scholarships, or mental health counseling. In addition, churches and other  community organizations that do not traditionally play a role in disaster  response may begin providing these services.

Under the congressional charter the purposes of the Red Cross are to  provide volunteer humanitarian assistance to the armed forces, serve as a  medium of communication between the people of the United States and  the armed forces, and provide disaster prevention and relief services.  Although it is congressionally chartered, the Red Cross provides these  services as a private organization.", "Following a disaster, the Red Cross serves as a direct service provider to  disaster victims. In this capacity, the organization provides services that  include feeding, sheltering, financial assistance, and emergency first aid.", "After Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, the Red Cross estimated that it provided  more than 3.7 million hurricane victims with financial assistance, 3.4 million  overnight stays in almost 1,100 shelters, and more than 27.4 million hot meals  and 25.2 million snacks. According to the Red Cross, its efforts after Hurricanes  Katrina and Rita were larger than for any previous disaster relief effort. For  example, the Red Cross provided more than six times the number of shelter  nights after Katrina and Rita than it did in the entire 2004 hurricane season,  when four major hurricanes\u2014Charley, Francis, Ivan, and Jeanne\u2014struck the  continental United States in August and September."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The NRF", "paragraphs": ["The NRF is a guide to how the nation conducts all-hazards disaster  response, including support for voluntary organizations providing shelter,  food, and other mass care services. The NRF revises the nation\u2019s prior  disaster plan, the NRP, which was originally signed by major federal  government agencies, the Red Cross and NVOAD in 2004. Major federal  government agencies, the Red Cross, NVOAD, and other voluntary  organizations are included in the NRF. The NRF is designed on the  premise that disaster response is generally handled by local jurisdictions.  In the vast majority of disasters, local emergency personnel, such as  police, fire, public health, and emergency management personnel, act as  first responders and identify needed resources to aid the community.  Local jurisdictions can also call on state resources to provide additional  assistance. The federal government responds to state or local requests for  assistance when an incident occurs that exceeds state or local response  capability or when an incident falls within its own response authorities. In  such situations it may use the National Response Framework to involve all  appropriate response partners. The primary authority under which the  federal government provides assistance to states after a disaster is the  Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (Stafford  Act).  It authorizes the President to issue a major disaster or emergency  declaration when a state\u2019s resources are overwhelmed and the governor  makes a request for federal assistance. Under the Stafford Act, the federal  government provides assistance for mass care, debris removal, restoration  of facilities, and financial aid to families and individuals, among other  activities. After disasters that result in extraordinary levels of mass  casualties or damage, called catastrophes, the federal government can  invoke the Catastrophic Incident Annex of the NRF. The Annex does not  assume that local governments\u2014which may no longer be functioning\u2014 will ask for assistance, but rather that the federal government will provide  resources to the local level before being asked.", "In addition to outlining the organizational structure used to respond to  disasters, the National Response Framework designates 15 emergency  support functions. ESF-6 creates a working group of key federal agencies  and voluntary organizations to coordinate federal assistance in support of  state and local efforts to provide:    mass care, including sheltering, feeding, and emergency first aid;    emergency assistance, such as coordination with voluntary  organizations; reunification of families; pet evacuation and sheltering;  support to specialized shelters; and support to medical shelters;    housing, both short- and long-term; and   human services, such as counseling and processing of benefits.", "The NRF assigned FEMA to be the primary agency for a new component  of ESF-6, called emergency assistance, to ensure that immediate needs  that are beyond the scope of traditional mass care are addressed.  Emergency assistance adds new expectations for coordination with  voluntary organizations by the ESF-6 working group, stating that the group  works with non-governmental and faith-based organizations to facilitate  an inclusive, coordinated response effort. In addition, the emergency  assistance component includes the expectation that a National Shelter  System (NSS) will provide data from shelters. The NSS is a Web-based  system that provides information on shelter facilities, capacity, and  population counts.", "In addition to its role as a service provider, the Red Cross has specific  responsibilities as a support agency under ESF-6. ESF-6 specifies that  these activities are separate from its role as a direct service provider. The  Red Cross announced in January 2008 that it planned to make significant  layoffs to its staff at the Red Cross national headquarters. These layoffs  could potentially have implications for the Red Cross\u2019 capacity to meet its  NRF responsibilities. However, the Red Cross had not announced details  of these layoffs as of mid-February 2008.

Although  there are few statistics on the impact of Hurricane Katrina on the disabled,  the White House report on the federal response to Katrina estimated that  over two-thirds of the 1,300 victims who died were over age 60. Individuals  with disabilities are a diverse group, including those with disabilities  affecting individuals\u2019 functioning in a number of different ways. For  example, some disabilities, such as paraplegia, affect individuals\u2019 mobility,  and other disabilities, such as deafness, affect communication. Many of  these disabilities can be prepared for and accommodated in general  population shelters. For example, with modifications to existing facilities,  many mobility impairments can be addressed. These modifications can  include ensuring accessible routes for people with wheelchairs, crutches,  or walkers from sleeping quarters to dining areas and toilet/bathing areas,  ramps, and handrails in toilet facilities.

In partnership with state, local, and tribal  governments, emergency response providers, the private sector, and  nongovernmental organizations as well as other federal agencies, FEMA is  tasked with building a national system of emergency management. The Act  included a number of provisions that should provide a new focus on  assistance to individuals with disabilities in connection with these efforts.  It directs the Administrator of FEMA to appoint a Disability Coordinator  who is required to report directly to the Administrator to ensure that the  needs of individuals with disabilities are being properly addressed in  emergency preparedness and disaster relief, and assigns a detailed set of  responsibilities to the Coordinator. The Post-Katrina Act provides  authority for FEMA to address the needs of individuals with disabilities by  adding the Americans with Disabilities Act\u2019s definition of \u201cindividual with  a disability\u201d to the Stafford Act and requires that the FEMA Administrator  develop guidelines concerning the provision of services to individuals with  disabilities in connection with emergency facilities and equipment.

The Post-Katrina Act expanded the universe of voluntary organizations  eligible for reimbursement for facilities damage after future disasters.  Private non-profit facilities that serve certain specified functions  (education, utility, irrigation, emergency, medical, rehabilitation, and  temporary custodial care) as defined by the President, no longer need to  provide essential services of a governmental nature to the general public  in order to be eligible for reimbursement. The Act also added another  group of private nonprofit facilities potentially eligible for assistance by  defining the term to include any facility providing essential services of a  governmental nature to the general public (including museums, zoos,  performing arts facilities, and community arts centers), as defined by the  President. The facilities in this group are similar to those identified in  FEMA regulations.

The changing roles of  the Red Cross and FEMA present several implementation issues. With  respect to sheltering, the NRF includes the expectation that a national  shelter system will be developed to collect and report shelter data. FEMA  and the Red Cross have developed an initial system for collecting and  reporting data on shelters, but FEMA is still working to develop a federal  shelter database.  Furthermore, some states have indicated that they are  concerned about their ability to collect and report data from non-Red  Cross shelters.

The Red Cross\u2019 inability to direct federal resources after  the Gulf Coast hurricanes contributed to problems that we highlighted in  our June 2006 report. After Katrina, the Red Cross could not go directly to  federal agencies for resources to fulfill requests for assistance, but instead  had to request these items through FEMA, which then directed the  appropriate federal agencies to supply the needed materials or services.  This resulted in confusion about roles and led to duplicative requests.", "In the February 2007 letters, the Red Cross and FEMA also agreed that the  expansion of ESF-6 to include a new function\u2014emergency assistance\u2014 provided another reason why FEMA should be the primary agency for  mass care. The primary agency for mass care will need to coordinate mass  care activities with the primary agency for emergency assistance\u2014 FEMA\u2014and having different primary agencies could make this more  difficult. For example, Red Cross and FEMA officials told us that Red  Cross is not knowledgeable about activities in the emergency assistance  function, which would make it difficult for them to coordinate these  activities with mass care. FEMA and the Red Cross agreed that having  FEMA serve as the primary agency for all four functions of ESF-6 would  help ensure a unified command structure during operational response.", "Although the Red Cross role for mass care under the NRF will shift from  that of a primary agency to a support agency, its specific responsibilities  will largely remain the same as under the NRP. For example, the  organization still provides staff to work at DHS offices to support ESF-6  activities and supports DHS in working with state agencies for mass care  in planning and preparedness activities. However, the Red Cross will no  longer have two key responsibilities that it had under the NRP. First, the  Red Cross will no longer be responsible for filling out requests from states  and other local organizations for federal assistance after a disaster and  sending them to FEMA. This activity will now be performed primarily by  states. Under the NRF, the Red Cross will provide guidance to states as  they determine their needs for federal assistance. FEMA did tell us,  however, that in some rare circumstances the Red Cross may fill out  requests independently of states. States also filled out these requests  under the NRP\u2014along with the Red Cross\u2014and state officials that we  interviewed told us that they were familiar with this process. Second, the  Red Cross will no longer be responsible for reporting data on the number  and characteristics of people in shelters that are operated by organizations  other than the Red Cross. After Katrina, the Red Cross was responsible for  reporting data on all shelters to FEMA, including those operated by other  organizations, but both FEMA and the Red Cross reported problems with  this process.

As the primary agency for ESF-6, FEMA will be primarily  responsible for addressing these issues. These requirements for coordination  with voluntary organizations are more extensive and specific than in the NRP,  and FEMA officials told us that FEMA voluntary agency liaisons (VAL) will fill  this role. VALs are FEMA staff members who coordinate the activities of  voluntary organizations with FEMA. Most FEMA VALs are based in FEMA  regions and work with state and local voluntary organizations, and the regional  offices of national voluntary organizations (see app. III for a job description for  VALs).", "While the NRF calls for an enhanced FEMA role in helping coordinate  voluntary agency assistance, FEMA does not have the staff resources  necessary to meet this objective. As of July 2007, each FEMA region had  one full-time VAL who could work on the entire range of coordination  issues with voluntary organizations, as shown in figure 2. FEMA regions  can include up to eight states. FEMA VALs are tasked with coordinating  FEMA activities and policies with voluntary organizations across their  regions and building the capacity of these organizations according to  voluntary organization and FEMA officials. Effective VALs build  relationships and network, however, many officials from voluntary  organizations and multiple senior FEMA VALs told us that there are not  enough full-time VALs for them to develop strong relationships in all of the  areas covered. For example, one of the primary responsibilities of VALs is  to improve coordination with state- and local-level voluntary  organizations, but officials from FEMA and voluntary organizations said  that in many states coordination between these organizations and  government is weak. In addition, officials from some voluntary  organizations told us that VALs have so much work it is difficult to  communicate with them. Officials from voluntary organizations also said  that there were not enough VALs after disasters. During the response to  disasters, VALs can be pulled out of their own regions to assist in disaster- affected areas. For example, after Katrina, VALs from across the country  were brought to the Gulf Coast. As a result, during Katrina these VALs  were not available to respond to their own smaller scale regional disasters,  even though they had built relationships with voluntary organizations in  those states. At the time of Katrina, FEMA was providing states with  assistance for 38 other disasters across the nation. Disaster research  experts told us that there should be additional FEMA VALs in each  region. FEMA officials told us that there are no plans to change the  current staffing structure for VALs.

For example, the DHS OIG  found that FEMA does not have staff or plans adequate to meet its human  capital needs during catastrophic disasters.", "FEMA has two other types of VALs, reserves and Katrina VALs. However,  the job responsibilities of these individuals constrain them from  performing many VAL job duties. FEMA had 85 reserve VALs that it can  call upon in response to major disasters, and 36 Katrina VALs as of  December 2007. The reserve VALs are only activated during disasters,  however, and are not available to network and build the capacity of  voluntary organizations during preparedness. Furthermore, the Katrina  VALs are designated specifically to address Katrina-related issues and  FEMA is not planning to retain these individuals after Katrina-related work  is finished.", "In addition, VALs do not receive role-specific training and, as a result,  some VALs have not been fully prepared for their duties. The lack of  specialized training has resulted in VALs not always being prepared to  coordinate FEMA activities with the voluntary sector. For example, VALs  do not receive any training on how voluntary organizations can receive  reimbursement for their mass care activities during disasters. One  voluntary organization official that we spoke with said that, while some  VALs were very helpful in that they had access to information and  resources that they would not have had otherwise and understood FEMA  policies, other VALs were not familiar with key FEMA Public Assistance  policies for the reimbursement of voluntary organizations.

For example,  the Post-Katrina Act specifically requires that FEMA identify gaps in mass  care capabilities at the state level. In response, FEMA has undertaken a  gap analysis initiative that examines, by state, the gaps in disaster  preparedness. This initiative, which began in 2007, has begun identifying  gaps in hurricane-prone states along the Eastern seaboard and Gulf Coast.  A FEMA official responsible for these efforts told us that the initial gap  analysis had been completed in 18 high-risk states as of December 2007.  Eventually, FEMA plans to roll this initiative out in every state, and to  make it all-hazards rather than hurricane-specific.", "FEMA officials told us that they are also working to identify resources for  situations in which the mass care capabilities of government and voluntary  organizations are exceeded, but that FEMA is still working to develop a  standardized system for coordinating these resources. FEMA officials told  us that FEMA has developed contracts with private companies for mass  care and other disaster resources for situations in which federal  capabilities are exceeded. After Katrina, FEMA made four noncompetitive  awards to companies for housing services. These contracts have since  been broadened through a competitive process so that if a disaster struck  now they could also include facility assessment for shelters, facility  rehabilitation\u2014including making facilities accessible\u2014feeding, security,  and staffing shelters. The FEMA official in charge of these contracts said  that contractors had assessed facilities to determine whether they could  be used as shelters in the Gulf Coast during the summer of 2007. He said  that these contracts gave the federal government the option of purchasing  whatever resources it needs in response to disasters. FEMA officials told  us, however, that they prefer using federal resources when possible  because contract services are more expensive. Another round of contracts  will be awarded in May 2008 on a competitive basis.", "However, FEMA is still working to standardize training, resources, and  terminology across the many different organizations\u2014including the  private sector\u2014involved in disaster response to improve coordination  among these organizations. FEMA is working to develop standardized  training that could be provided to staff from all of these organizations.  FEMA is currently working with the Red Cross to develop a standardized  training based on current Red Cross training, according to a FEMA official  responsible for these efforts. Having standardized training could, for  example, make it easier for employees of organizations providing services  contracted by the federal government to work in shelters operated by  other organizations. A key FEMA official said that this standardized  training should be complete by summer 2008. FEMA is also working to  standardize disaster relief resources and terminology across the providers  of mass care services. The FEMA official said that this allows disaster  service providers to communicate more readily, and to share resources  across organizations when necessary.

Third, NVOAD shares information with  voluntary organizations about the situation on the ground and services being  provided by different organizations after disasters. For example, after Katrina,  NVOAD hosted daily conference calls for several months after Katrina to  coordinate with its members.

Through a working group of stakeholders,  FEMA developed a definition of special needs that refers to those who  may have additional needs before, during, or after an incident in one or  more of the following functional areas: maintaining independence,  communication, transportation, supervision, and medical care. For  example, hearing-impaired individuals would be categorized as those  needing assistance with communication.

Officials from NCD said that there has been little coordination with FEMA and  that they had not been offered the chance to provide input on a number of  these initiatives. As a result, disability-related issues may not be fully addressed.

Using  lessons learned from Katrina, FEMA and voluntary organizations have  begun taking steps to improve mass care services for future disasters, such  as replacing the National Response Plan with the National Response  Framework.", "The NRF includes an enhanced role for FEMA in coordinating with  voluntary organizations. FEMA VALs\u2014employees who are FEMA\u2019s  primary link to the voluntary sector\u2014will have primary responsibility for  this role. However, the size of FEMA\u2019s VAL workforce is not sufficient to  meet FEMA\u2019s NRF responsibilities for voluntary agency coordination.  Having only one full-time VAL in each region who can work on the entire  range of coordination issues with voluntary organizations can limit VALs\u2019  ability to build successful relationships in their states, a critical element of  fulfilling their responsibilities. In addition, VALs receive no role-specific  training, and no training on a key federal program that reimburses  voluntary organizations after disasters. If FEMA does not take steps to  address these issues, it will encounter difficulties in meeting its NRF role  of coordinating with voluntary organizations, and the nation is likely to see  some of the same coordination problems that occurred after the Gulf  Coast hurricanes.", "Under the NRF, NVOAD plays a critical role in sharing disaster  information among national voluntary organizations, and FEMA plays an  important role in supporting coordination among these organizations.  After Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, timely information was important for  organizations\u2019 efforts to provide disaster services, but the daily conference  calls hosted by NVOAD were an ineffective communication strategy.  NVOAD\u2019s executive director has indicated that improving the  organization\u2019s communication systems is a priority, but NVOAD has only  two staff members and limited funding. Without FEMA\u2019s assistance,  NVOAD may not have the technical capacity to adequately assess and  improve its communications systems. Unless NVOAD and FEMA work  together to systematically assess and expand NVOAD\u2019s information  sharing efforts, NVOAD members are likely to face continued  communication problems after disasters.", "FEMA has begun taking actions to improve the mass care services  provided to the disabled after disasters, including actions to implement  relevant provisions of the Post-Katrina Act. As FEMA noted in the  Nationwide Plan Review, it is critical that federal, state, and local  governments increase the participation of people with disabilities and  subject-matter experts in the development and execution of plans and  training. However, FEMA has generally not coordinated with NCD in its  efforts to implement relevant provisions of the Act, as required by the Act.  Unless FEMA begins working more closely with NCD, emergency planners  may not fully incorporate this population\u2019s needs into planning efforts.", "Small voluntary organizations played a key role in the mass care response  to Katrina, but were often unfamiliar with how to navigate these federal  reimbursement procedures. Although FEMA has posted the Public  Assistance program policies for voluntary organizations on its Web site,  the site does not provide key information about opportunities for  voluntary organizations to be reimbursed for facilities damage in a user- friendly format. In addition, the Web site does not include contact  information voluntary organizations could use to get more information.  Unless FEMA provides information in a more user-friendly format, some  voluntary organizations may be unable to take advantage of  reimbursement opportunities after future disasters, which could be an  incentive to stop providing mass care services."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["To provide greater assurance that FEMA has adequate staff capabilities to  support the agency\u2019s enhanced role under the NRF in helping coordinate  with voluntary organizations, we recommend that the Secretary of  Homeland Security direct the Administrator of FEMA to take action to  enhance the capabilities of its VAL workforce, such as:    converting some Katrina VALs into full-time VALs able to work on the  entire range of coordination issues with voluntary organizations;  increasing the number of full-time VALs; or    providing role-specific training to VALs, including providing them with  information about Public Assistance opportunities and policies for  voluntary organizations.", "To improve NVOAD\u2019s effectiveness in meeting its NRF information-sharing  responsibilities after disasters, we recommend that NVOAD assess  members\u2019 information needs, and improve its communication strategies  after disasters. As part of this effort, NVOAD should examine how best to  fund improved communication strategies, which may include developing a  proposal for FEMA funding. To facilitate the implementation of improved  communication strategies, NVOAD may want to consider strategies for  increasing staff support for NVOAD after disasters, such as having staff  from NVOAD member organizations temporarily detailed to NVOAD. In  addition, in light of FEMA\u2019s enhanced role under the NRF in helping  coordinate the activities of voluntary organizations in disasters, we  recommend that the Secretary of Homeland Security direct the  Administrator of FEMA to provide technical assistance to NVOAD, as  needed, as NVOAD works to improve its communication strategies.", "To ensure that the needs of individuals with disabilities are fully integrated  into FEMA\u2019s efforts to implement provisions of the Act that require FEMA  to coordinate with NCD, we recommend that the Secretary of Homeland  Security direct the Administrator of FEMA to develop a detailed set of  measurable action steps, in consultation with NCD, for how FEMA will  coordinate with NCD.", "To help ensure that voluntary organizations can readily obtain clear and  accurate information about the reimbursement opportunities offered by  the Public Assistance program, we recommend that the Secretary of  Homeland Security direct the Administrator of FEMA to take action to  make the information on FEMA\u2019s Web site about reimbursement  opportunities for voluntary organizations more user-friendly.

To obtain information about the rationale  for, and implications of, the shift in the primary mass care role in the  National Response Framework (NRF) from the Red Cross to the Federal  Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), we reviewed letters between  FEMA and the Red Cross documenting reasons for the shift in the primary  agency role from the Red Cross to FEMA, the National Response  Framework, information about the National Shelter System, the Post  Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act, and information about the  responsibilities of Voluntary Agency Liaisons. We also observed a  demonstration of the National Shelter System. We interviewed officials  from FEMA with responsibility for ESF-6, including FEMA Voluntary  Agency Liaisons (VALs) in headquarters and in the field, and from national  offices of voluntary organizations, including the Red Cross, National  Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster, the Salvation Army, the United  Way, America\u2019s Second Harvest, Catholic Charities, and the Southern  Baptist Convention. We also interviewed emergency management officials  from a selection of states that included Louisiana, Mississippi, and nine  other randomly selected states throughout the country.", "To obtain information about NVOAD\u2019s efforts to coordinate with the  voluntary sector, we reviewed documents about its member services,  internal governance, funding, and plans for the future. We also interviewed  NVOAD\u2019s former and current executive directors, chairman of the board,  officials from eight of NVOAD\u2019s member organizations, and FEMA officials  and disaster response experts who have worked with NVOAD. We also  interviewed an official who manages a Web site used to coordinate  disaster relief by the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, and  reviewed the Web site.", "To obtain information about the efforts of FEMA and major national  voluntary organizations to improve services for the disabled since Katrina,  we reviewed the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act (the  Act), the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), and guidance released by  the Justice Department about ADA, and also and conducted document  reviews with FEMA, the American Red Cross, and the Southern Baptist  Convention. These included documents related to FEMA\u2019s efforts to  improve services for the disabled and respond to the Act\u2019s requirements,  such as the Target Capabilities and guidelines for accommodating  individuals with disabilities. In addition, we reviewed a number of Red  Cross documents related to services for individuals with disabilities,  including training materials and a shelter intake form. We also interviewed  officials from DHS, FEMA, the Red Cross, the Southern Baptists, Salvation  Army, the United Way, and Catholic Charities, and state-level emergency  managers from Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas. Our interviews with  FEMA included individuals from the various initiatives required by the Act  to consult with the National Council on Disability, and FEMA\u2019s Disability  Coordinator. In addition, we interviewed officials from the National  Council on Disabilities, a number of disability advocacy organizations,  such as the National Spinal Cord Injury Association, and several advocacy  groups for the elderly, such as the American Association of Retired  Persons. We also reviewed a survey of 95 Red Cross chapters that was  conducted by the Disability Relations Group, an organization that  conducts survey research on disability issues.

Additionally  we toured the FEMA Joint Field Offices that were located in Baton Rouge,  Biloxi, and Austin; local emergency operations centers in Baton Rouge and  Austin; as well as distribution centers established by the Red Cross and  the Salvation Army. On these site visits, we met with local chapters of the  Red Cross, the Salvation Army, Catholic Charities, and the United Way. We  held two additional discussion groups\u2014one in Jackson, Mississippi, and  one in Houston, Texas\u2014to obtain the perspectives of local voluntary  organizations that provided disaster relief on their efforts to be reimbursed  under the Public Assistance program, and other issues.
