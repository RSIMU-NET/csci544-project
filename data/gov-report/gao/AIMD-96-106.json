A 1996 National Research Council report on TSM had a similar message. Its recommendations parallel the over a dozen recommendations we made in July 1995 to improve IRS\u2019 (1) business strategy to reduce reliance on paper, (2) strategic information management practices, (3) software development capabilities, (4) technical infrastructures, and (5) organizational controls.", "In the July 1995 report, we described our methodology for analyzing IRS\u2019 strategic information management practices, drawing heavily from our research on the best practices of private and public sector organizations that have been successful in improving their performance through strategic information management and technology. These fundamental best practices are discussed in our report Executive Guide: Improving Mission Performance Through Strategic Information Management and Technology (GAO/AIMD-94-115, May 1994), and our Strategic Information Management (SIM) Self-Assessment Toolkit (GAO/Version 1.0, October 28, 1994, exposure draft).", "To evaluate IRS\u2019 software development capability, we validated IRS\u2019 September 1993 assessment of its software development maturity based on the Capability Maturity Model (CMM) developed by Carnegie Mellon University\u2019s Software Engineering Institute, a nationally recognized authority in the area. This model establishes standards in key software development process areas (i.e., requirements management, project planning, project tracking and oversight, configuration management, quality assurance, and subcontractor management) and provides a framework to evaluate a software organization\u2019s capability to consistently and predictably produce high-quality products.", "When we briefed the IRS Commissioner in April 1995 and issued our report documenting its weaknesses in July 1995, IRS agreed with our recommendations to make corrections expeditiously. At that time, we considered IRS\u2019 response to be a commitment to correct its management and technical weaknesses.", "In September 1995, IRS submitted an action plan to the Congress explaining how it planned to address our recommendations. In our March 1996 testimony to the House Appropriation Committee\u2019s Subcommittee on Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government, we noted that this plan, follow-up meetings with senior IRS officials, and other draft and \u201cpreliminary draft\u201d documents received through early March 1996 provided little tangible evidence that actions being taken would correct the pervasive management and technical weaknesses that continued to place TSM, and the huge investment it represents, at risk. This interim status report on IRS\u2019 efforts to respond to our July 1995 recommendations noted that IRS had initiated a number of activities and made some progress in addressing our recommendations to improve management of information systems; enhance its software development capability; and better define, perform, and manage TSM\u2019s technical activities. However, we reported that none of these steps had fully satisfied any of our recommendations. Consequently, IRS was not in an appreciably better position in March 1996 than it was in April 1995 to assure the Congress that it would spend its fiscal year 1996 and future TSM appropriations judiciously and effectively.", "In a subsequent testimony before the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs, we reiterated our concerns that IRS\u2019 effort to modernize tax processing was jeopardized by persistent and pervasive management and technical weaknesses, and that ongoing efforts did not include milestones or provide enough evidence to conclude that weaknesses will soon be corrected. We also addressed analogous technical weaknesses in an electronic filing system project called Cyberfile which substantiated our concerns that IRS was continuing to risk millions of dollars in undisciplined systems development in fiscal year 1996.

We noted that IRS did not have a comprehensive business strategy to reach or exceed its electronic filing goal, which was 80 million electronic filings by 2001. IRS\u2019 estimates and projections for individual and business returns suggested that, by 2001, as few as 39 million returns may be submitted electronically, less than half of IRS\u2019 goal and only about 17 percent of all returns expected to be filed.", "We reported that IRS\u2019 business strategy would not maximize electronic filings because it primarily targeted taxpayers who use a third party to prepare and/or transmit simple returns, are willing to pay a fee to file their returns electronically, and are expecting refunds. Focusing on this limited taxpaying population overlooked most taxpayers, including those who prepare their own tax returns using personal computers, have more complicated returns, owe tax balances, and/or are unwilling to pay a fee to a third party to file a return electronically.", "We concluded that, without a strategy that also targets these taxpayers, IRS would not meet its electronic filing goals. In addition, if, in the future, taxpayers file more paper returns than IRS expects, added stress will be placed on IRS\u2019 paper-based systems. Accordingly, we recommended that IRS refocus its electronic filing business strategy to target, through aggressive marketing and education, those sectors of the taxpaying population that can file electronically most cost-beneficially.", "IRS agreed with this recommendation and said that it had convened a working group to develop a detailed, comprehensive strategy to broaden public access to electronic filing, while also providing more incentives for practitioners and the public to file electronically. It said that the strategy would include approaches for taxpayers who are unwilling to pay for tax preparer and transmitter services, who owe IRS for balances due, and/or who file complex tax returns. IRS said further that the strategy would address that segment of the taxpaying population that would prefer to file from home, using personal computers.", "To date, IRS has performed an electronic filing marketing analysis at local levels; developed a marketing plan to promote electronic filing; consolidated 21 electronic filing initiatives into its Electronic Filing Strategies portfolio; and initiated a reengineering project with a goal to reduce paper tax return filings to 20 percent or less of the total volume by the year 2000. It plans to complete its electronic filing strategy in August 1996. These initiatives could result in future progress toward increasing electronic filings. However, our review found that these initiatives are not far enough along to determine whether they will culminate in a comprehensive strategy that identifies how IRS plans to target those sectors of the taxpaying population that can file electronically most cost-beneficially. It also is not clear how the reengineering project will impact the strategy or how these initiatives will impact TSM systems that are being developed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "IRS\u2019 Strategic Information Management Practices Remain Ineffective", "paragraphs": ["We reported that IRS did not have strategic information management practices in place. We found, for example, that, despite the billions of dollars at stake, information systems were not managed as investments. To overcome this, and provide the Congress with insight needed to assess IRS\u2019 priorities and rationalization for TSM projects, we recommended that the IRS Commissioner take immediate action to implement a complete process for selecting, prioritizing, controlling, and evaluating the progress and performance of all major information systems investments, both new and ongoing, including explicit decision criteria, and using these criteria, to review all planned and ongoing systems investments by June 30, 1995.", "In agreeing with these recommendations, IRS said it would take a number of actions to provide the underpinning it needs for strategic information management. IRS said, for example, that it was developing and implementing a process to select, prioritize, control, and evaluate information technology investments to achieve reengineered program missions.", "Our assessment found that IRS has taken steps towards putting into place a process for managing its extensive investments in information systems. Following are examples of these steps.", "IRS created the executive-level Investment Review Board, chaired by the Associate Commissioner for Modernization, for selecting, controlling and evaluating all of IRS\u2019 information technology investments. IRS developed initial and revised sets of decision criteria used last summer and again in November 1995 as part of its Resource Allocation and Investment Review to make additional changes in information technology resource allocations for remaining fiscal year 1996 funds and planned fiscal year 1997 spending. This review included only TSM projects under development. It did not address operational systems, infrastructure, or management and technical support activities.", "The Treasury Department created a Modernization Management Board to review and validate high-risk, high-cost TSM investments and to set policy and strategy for IRS modernization effort. IRS is considering the use of a \u201cproject readiness review\u201d as an additional Investment Review Board control mechanism for gauging project readiness to proceed with spending. IRS developed the Business Case Handbook that includes decision criteria on costs, benefits, and risks. It is reassessing the business cases, which were developed on the TSM projects, using the handbook. Eleven cases are scheduled for completion in June 1996, and IRS plans to have the remaining cases completed by September 1996. Results are planned to be presented to the Investment Review Board to assist in making funding decisions for fiscal year 1997. IRS has developed the Investment Evaluation Review Handbook designed to assess projected costs and benefits against actual results. The handbook has been used on four TSM projects and five additional reviews are scheduled to be completed within the next year. The completed reviews contain explicit descriptions of problems encountered in developing these systems. The reviews make specific recommendations for management and technical process changes to improve future results. Specific recommendations pertain to strengthening project direction and decision-making. Many reflect concerns that we have raised in past reviews. The investment evaluation reviews were presented to the Investment Review Board and disseminated to other IRS managers. IRS is defining roles, responsibilities, and processes for incorporating Investment Evaluation Review recommendations at the project and process levels.", "These are positive steps and indicate a willingness to address many of the weaknesses raised in our past reports and testimonies. But, as noted in Treasury\u2019s report on TSM, the investment process is not yet complete. According to Treasury, it is missing (1) specific operating procedures, (2) defined reporting relationships between different management boards and committees, and (3) updated business cases for major TSM technology investments.", "These concerns coincide with two central criticisms we have repeatedly made about TSM. Because of the sheer size, scope, and complexity of TSM, it is imperative that IRS institutionalize a repeatable process for selecting, controlling, and evaluating its technology investments, and that it make informed investment decisions based on reliable qualitative and quantitative assessments of costs, benefits, and risks. Although IRS is planning and in the initial stages of implementing parts of such a process, a complete, fully-integrated process does not yet exist. Specifically, IRS has not provided us evidence to justify its claims that its decisions were supported by acceptable data on project costs, benefits, and risks. For example:", "Our review found no evidence to suggest that IRS established minimal data requirements for the decisions made as part of the TSM Resource Allocation and Investment Review or the rescope process in December 1995. For example, because IRS lacks the basic capabilities for disciplined software development, it cannot convincingly estimate systems development costs, schedule, or performance. Subsequent to its rescope analysis, IRS developed minimal data quality requirements for cost-benefit and risk studies, proposed return on investment calculations, and return on investment thresholds, or comparisons of expected performance improvements with results to date. However, to date, few, if any projects have met these criteria. In deciding whether to accelerate, delay, or cancel specific TSM projects, IRS did not use validated data on actual versus projected costs, benefits, or risks as set forth by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Instead, IRS continues to make its decisions based on spending whatever budgeted funding ceiling amounts can be obtained through its annual budget and appropriations cycles. As a result, IRS cannot convincingly justify its TSM spending decisions.", "All projects (i.e., proposed projects, projects under development, operational systems, infrastructure, and management and technical support activities) were not included in a single systems investment portfolio. Instead, only TSM projects under development were ranked. As a result, there is no compelling rationale for determining how much to invest in these projects compared to other projects, such as operational systems, infrastructure, etc.", "There is no defined process with prescribed roles and responsibilities to ensure that the results of investment evaluation reviews are being used to (1) modify project direction and funding when appropriate and (2) assess and improve existing investment selection and control processes and procedures. As a result, there is no evidence that changes are occurring based on the valuable lessons learned as in the recently completed post implementation review of the Service Center Recognition/Image Processing System. For example, IRS found that because system requirements were not adequately defined or documented, the system could not be quantifiably tested properly which adversely affected the implementation of the system. Moreover, with only four investment evaluation reviews completed to date and five planned for the upcoming year, this represents only a small fraction of the total IRS annual investment in TSM. More must be done to confirm actual results achieved from TSM expenditures."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reengineering Efforts Not Linked to Modernization", "paragraphs": ["We noted in our July 1995 report that IRS\u2019 reengineering efforts were not linked to its systems development efforts.

Three reengineering projects\u2014processing returns, responding to taxpayers, and enforcement actions\u2014were halted because IRS decided to focus instead on an enterprise-level view of reengineering.", "Its new effort, entitled Tax Settlement Reengineering, was begun in March 1996 and involves a comprehensive review of all the major processes and activities that enable taxpayers to settle their tax obligations, from educational activities through final settlement of accounts. The reengineering project team, working with IRS\u2019 Executive Committee, has identified 16 major processes involved in tax settlement and is about to begin reengineering four of them. High-level designs of the new processes are scheduled to be defined by September 30, 1996, with work on detailed designs to start early in fiscal year 1997, if approved by the Executive Committee. Reengineering efforts on as many as eight other tax settlement processes could be underway by the end of fiscal year 1997.", "Although this effort could have substantial impact, IRS still faces the same problem we reported on a year ago. Reengineering lags well behind the development of TSM projects, whereas it should be ahead of it\u2014defining and directing the technology investments needed to support new, more efficient business processes. Until the reengineering effort is mature enough to drive TSM projects, there is no assurance that ongoing systems development efforts will support IRS\u2019 future business needs and objectives.", "The reengineering team believes that by September 1996 they will have a general idea of how the first four tax settlement reengineering projects may impact current system development efforts. If additional reengineering projects are started as planned in 1997, it could be another year or more before most of the information and systems requirements stemming from these projects are defined. Meanwhile, investment continues in many TSM projects that may not support the requirements resulting from these reengineering efforts.", "IRS acknowledges that integration of reengineering and TSM must occur, and has assigned responsibility for it to the Associate Commissioner for Modernization, but has not yet specified how or when the requisite integration will occur."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Software Development Activities Are Inconsistent and Poorly Controlled", "paragraphs": ["We reported that unless IRS improves its software development capability, it is unlikely to build TSM timely or economically, and systems are unlikely to perform as intended.

IRS placed its software development capability at the lowest level, described as ad hoc and sometimes chaotic and indicating significant weaknesses in its software development capability. Our review confirmed that IRS\u2019 software development capability was immature and was weak in key process areas. For instance, a disciplined process to manage system requirements was not being applied to TSM systems, a software tool for planning and tracking development projects was not software quality assurance functions were not well defined or consistently systems and acceptance testing were neither well defined nor required, software configuration management was incomplete.", "To address IRS\u2019 software development weaknesses and upgrade IRS\u2019 software development capabilities, we recommended that the IRS Commissioner immediately require that all future contractors who develop software for the agency have a software development capability rating of at least CMM Level 2, and before December 31, 1995, define, implement, and enforce a consistent set of requirements management procedures for all TSM projects that goes beyond IRS\u2019 current request for information services process, and for software quality assurance, software configuration management, and project planning and tracking; and define and implement a set of software development metrics to measure software attributes related to business goals.", "IRS agreed with these recommendations and said that it was committed to developing consistent procedures addressing requirements management, software quality assurance, software configuration management, and project planning and tracking. It also said that it was developing a comprehensive measurement plan to link process outputs to external requirements, corporate goals, and recognized industry standards.", "Specifically regarding the first recommendation, IRS has (1) developed standard wording for use in new and existing contracts that have a significant software development component, requiring that all software development be done by an organization that is at CMM Level 2, (2) developed a plan for achieving CMM Level 2 capability on all of its contracts, and (3) started to implement a plan to monitor contractors\u2019 capabilities, which may include the use of CMM-based software capability evaluations. The Department of the Treasury report also noted that a schedule for conducting software capability evaluations was developed. However, we found that IRS does not yet have the disciplined processes in place to ensure that all contractors are performing at CMM Level 2. For example, contractors developing the Cyberfile electronic filing system were not using CMM Level 2 processes, subsequent to our July 1995 recommendation. Further, no schedule for conducting software capability evaluations has yet been developed.", "With respect to the second recommendation, IRS is updating its systems life cycle (SLC) methodology. The SLC is planned to have details for systems engineering and software development processes, including all CMM key process areas. IRS has updated its systems engineering process to include guidance for defining and analyzing systems requirements and for preparing work packages. Furthermore, IRS has drafted handbooks providing guidance to audit and verify developmental processes. In addition, IRS has developed a configuration management plan template, updated its requirements management request for information servicesdocument, and developed and implemented a requirements management course. The Department of the Treasury also reported that IRS is testing the SLC on two TSM efforts, Integrated Case Processing (ICP) and Corporate Accounts Processing System (CAPS). IRS also has a CMM process improvement plan and work is being done across various IRS organizations to define processes to meet CMM Level 2. Finally, IRS is assessing its capabilities to manage contractors using the CMM goals.", "However, the procedures for requirements management, software quality assurance, software configuration management, and project planning and tracking are still not complete. A software development life cycle implementation project, which is to include these procedures, is not scheduled for completion until September 30, 1996. In addition, software quality assurance and configuration management plans for two ICP projects were not being used, and the groups developing software for CAPS do not have a software configuration management plan or a schedule for its development. Furthermore, ICP and CAPS development is continuing without the guidelines and procedures for other process areas (e.g., requirements management, project planning, and project tracking and oversight) required by CMM Level 2.", "Regarding the third recommendation, IRS has a three-phase process to (1) identify data sources for metrics, (2) define metrics to be used, and (3) implement the metrics.

It outlined a three-track approach for transitioning over a period of 2 years to the use of a prime contractor that would have, according to IRS, overall authority and responsibility for the development, delivery, and deployment of modernized information systems.", "To facilitate this strategy, IRS reported it would consolidate the management of all TSM resources, including key TSM contractors, in its Government Program Management Office (GPMO). Under the direct control of the Chief Information Officer, GPMO will be delegated authority for the management and control of the IRS staff and contractors that plan, design, develop, test, and implement TSM components. IRS plans to have GPMO fully staffed and operational by October 1, 1996. IRS representatives told us the agency was currently developing a detailed contract management plan and a statement of work for acquiring its prime contractor, and believed it could award a contract in about 2 years.", "IRS\u2019 approach to expanding the use of contractors to build TSM is still in the early planning stages. Because of this, IRS was unable to provide us with formal plans, charters, schedules, or the definitions of shared responsibilities between GPMO and the existing program and project management staff.", "At this point, it is unclear what these IRS planned actions entail, or how they will work. For example, IRS has not specified how and when it plans to transfer its development activities to contractors, and to what extent contractors could be held responsible for existing problems in these government-initiated systems. This is particularly important because if IRS continues as planned, the principal TSM systems will be in development and/or deployed before IRS plans to select a prime contractor in about 2 years. Moreover, it is not clear how the prime contractor would direct potential competitors that are already under contract with IRS. Without further explanation of and a schedule for transitioning specific responsibilities from IRS to contractors, we cannot fully understand or assess IRS\u2019 plans.", "Further, plans to use additional contractors will succeed if, and only if, IRS has the in-house capabilities to manage these contractors effectively. In this regard, there is clear evidence that IRS\u2019 capability to manage contractors has weaknesses. In August 1995, IRS acquired the services of the Department of Commerce\u2019s National Technical Information Service (NTIS) to act as IRS\u2019 prime contractor in developing Cyberfile. However, Cyberfile was not developed using disciplined management and technical practices. As a result, this project exhibited many of the same problems we have repeatedly identified in other TSM systems, and, after providing $17 million to NTIS, it was not ready for planned testing during the 1996 tax filing season. Similarly, IRS contracted in 1994 to build the Document Processing System. After expending over a quarter of a billion dollars on the project, IRS has now suspended the effort and is reexamining some of its basic requirements, including which and how many forms should be processed, and which and how much data should be read from the documents.", "We recently initiated an assignment to evaluate in detail IRS\u2019 software acquisition capabilities using the Software Engineering Institute\u2019s Software Acquisition CMM. This assignment is scheduled to be completed later this year. It is clear that unless IRS has mature, disciplined processes for acquiring software systems through contractors, it will be no more successful in buying software than it has been in building software."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["IRS has initiated a number of actions and is making some progress in addressing our recommendations to correct its pervasive management and technical weaknesses. However, none of these actions, either individually or in the aggregate, fully satisfy any of our July 1995 recommendations and it is not clear when these actions will result in disciplined systems development. As a result, IRS continues to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on TSM through fiscal year 1997, while fundamental weaknesses jeopardize the investment.", "Recognizing its internal weaknesses, IRS plans to use a prime contractor and increase use of software development contractors to develop TSM.", "However, in this area, its plans and schedules are not well defined, and, therefore, cannot be completely understood or assessed.

As the Congress gains confidence in IRS\u2019 ability to successfully develop these smaller, cheaper, quicker projects, it could consider approving larger, more complex, more expensive projects in future years.", "Because IRS does not manage all of its current contractual efforts effectively, and because its plans to use a \u201cprime\u201d contractor and transition much of its systems development to additional contractors are not well defined, the Congress could consider requiring that IRS institute disciplined systems acquisitions processes and develop detailed plans and schedules before permitting IRS to increase its reliance on contractors."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["On June 6, 1996, we met with Treasury and IRS officials to discuss a draft of this report and we incorporated their comments as appropriate in finalizing it.

He also makes clear Treasury\u2019s and IRS\u2019 understanding that additional improvements are necessary to fully correct the management and technical weaknesses delineated in our report. The Deputy Secretary of the Treasury also says that he is reducing the fiscal year 1997 budget request for TSM from $850 million to $664 million and will need to ensure, at all times, solid stewardship for the dollars appropriated and clear accountability for the investments undertaken.", "Achieving sound management for the TSM program will require that IRS (1) institutionalize effective strategic information management practices, (2) institutionalize mature and disciplined software development processes, and (3) complete systems, data, and security architectures and use them to guide and control systems development, before making major investments in TSM systems development.
