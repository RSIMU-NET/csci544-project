Concerns have been raised about whether measures for non-homeland security programs accurately reflect performance, that is, they did not rise or fall as resources were added or reduced. For the six non-homeland security programs, GAO used established criteria to assess the soundness of the primary measures--that is, whether measures cover key activities; are clearly stated; and are objective, measurable, and quantifiable--and the reliability of data used to calculate them. GAO also used these criteria to assess the soundness of 23 selected secondary measures. Finally, through interviews and report review, GAO assessed challenges in using measures to link resources to results."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["While some opportunities for improvement exist, the primary measures for the Coast Guard's six non-homeland security programs are generally sound, and the data used to calculate them are generally reliable. All six measures cover key program activities and are objective, measurable, and quantifiable, but three are not completely clear--that is, they do not consistently provide clear and specific descriptions of the data, events, or geographic areas they include. Also, the processes used to enter and review the Coast Guard's own internal data are likely to produce reliable data; however, neither the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) nor the Coast Guard have policies or procedures for reviewing or verifying data from external sources, such as other federal agencies. Currently, the review processes vary from source to source, and for the primary measure covering marine environmental protection (which concerns oil and chemical spills), the processes are insufficient. Of the 23 secondary performance measures GAO assessed, 9 are generally sound, with weaknesses existing in the remaining 14. These weaknesses include (1) a lack of measurable performance targets, (2) a lack of agencywide criteria or guidance to ensure objectivity, and (3) unclear descriptions of the measures. Two main challenges exist with using primary measures to link resources to results. In one case, the challenge is comprehensiveness--that is, although each primary measure captures a major segment of program activity, no one measure captures all program activities and thereby accounts for all program resources. The other challenge involves external factors, some of which are outside the Coast Guard's control, that affect performance. For example, weather conditions can affect the amount of ice that must be cleared, the number of aids to navigation that need repair, or mariners that must be rescued. As a result, linking resources and results is difficult, and although the Coast Guard has a range of ongoing initiatives to do so, it is still too early to assess the agency's ability to successfully provide this link."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Recent years have seen a marked shift in the Coast Guard\u2019s  Recent years have seen a marked shift in the Coast Guard\u2019s  responsibilities.

To help  gauge its performance in these areas, the Coast Guard collects data on   45 performance measures, such as the percentage of mariners successfully  rescued from imminent danger and the number of oil spills and chemical  discharges. When reporting its performance, the Coast Guard follows the  instructions of its parent agency, the Department of Homeland Security  (DHS), and reports one measure for each program. For example, for the  ice operations program, the Coast Guard reports on the annual number of  days certain waterways are closed because of ice, and for the aids to  navigation program, the Coast Guard reports on the number of collisions,  allisions, and groundings. These performance measures, which we call  \u201cprimary measures\u201d in this report, are intended to communicate Coast  Guard performance and provide information for the budgeting process to  Congress, other policymakers, and taxpayers. Beyond the six primary  performance measures, the Coast Guard also uses a variety of other  performance measures to manage its programs, called \u201csecondary  measures\u201d in this report. There are three key publications that DHS and  the Coast Guard use to report the Coast Guard\u2019s non-homeland security  primary performance measures\u2014the DHS Performance and  Accountability Report, the DHS fiscal year budget request, and the Coast  Guard\u2019s fiscal year Budget-in-Brief.", "Our recent analyses have raised concerns about whether the primary  measures accurately reflect what the Coast Guard is accomplishing with  the resources it expends. In April 2004, we testified that despite  substantial changes in the distribution of resources among programs,  performance results appeared largely unaffected, and the Coast Guard had  limited data and no systematic approach to explain the lack of a clear  relationship between resources expended and performance results  achieved. You asked us to consider whether shortcomings in the primary  measures might explain why there was no apparent connection between  resources expended and results achieved for the non-homeland security  programs. In response, we evaluated the primary measures for the Coast  Guard\u2019s six non-homeland security programs with regard to two key  characteristics: (1) their soundness\u2014that is, whether the measures cover  the key activities of the program, are clearly stated and described, and are  objective, measurable, and quantifiable\u2014including having annual  targets\u2014and (2) the reliability of the data used to calculate the  measures\u2014that is, whether controls are in place to ensure the timeliness,  completeness, accuracy, and consistency of the data. You also asked us to  provide information on some of the secondary measures that are used in  the Coast Guard\u2019s six non-homeland security programs. Our report  addresses three questions:    Are the primary performance measures for the Coast Guard\u2019s six non- homeland security programs sound, and are the data used to calculate  them reliable?", "Are selected secondary performance measures for four of the Coast  Guard\u2019s non-homeland security programs sound?", "What challenges, if any, are present in trying to use the primary  measures to link resources expended and results achieved?", "To conduct our analysis of the soundness of the primary performance  measures, we relied primarily on a set of criteria that we had previously  developed. These criteria were developed based on the Government  Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA) and Office of Management  and Budget (OMB) guidelines for agency performance measures. We used  our judgment to assess whether these measures met our criteria. We also  reviewed the fiscal years 2005 and 2006 DHS Performance and  Accountability Report, the fiscal years 2006 and 2007 DHS budget  requests, and the Coast Guard\u2019s fiscal years 2006 and 2007 Budget-in- Brief. To conduct our reliability analysis, we relied primarily on  comparisons of Coast Guard data collection methods and internal control  processes with GPRA and the Reports Consolidation Act of 2000  requirements, as well as commonly accepted standards and practices. Our  reliability analysis assessed only the specific data fields used to collect and  report data for the six non-homeland security primary performance  measures, and not the relevant databases as a whole. We reviewed and  analyzed information collected and assembled at Coast Guard  headquarters as well as at four Coast Guard field locations. To the extent  possible, we also reviewed secondary measures for four of the six non- homeland security programs. To identify and assess the challenges in  trying to use the primary measures to link resources expended and results  achieved we interviewed Coast Guard officials at agency headquarters to  discuss how measures are used in resource and budget allocation  decisions and reviewed previous GAO reports on performance measures,  performance reporting, and the link between the Coast Guard\u2019s resources  used and results achieved. We conducted our work from July 2005 to  August 2006 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. More details about the scope and methodology of our work are  presented in appendix I."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Coast Guard has responsibilities divided into 11 programs that fall  under two broad missions\u2014homeland security and non-homeland  security\u2014which are recognized in the Homeland Security Act. To  accomplish its wide range of responsibilities, the Coast Guard is organized  into two major commands that are responsible for overall mission  execution\u2014one in the Pacific area and the other in the Atlantic area.  These commands are divided into nine districts, which in turn are  organized into 35 sectors that unify command and control of field units  and resources, such as multimission stations and patrol boats. In fiscal  year 2005, the Coast Guard had over 46,000 full-time positions\u2014about  39,000 military and 7,000 civilians. In addition, the agency had about   8,100 reservists who support the national military strategy or provide  additional operational support and surge capacity during times of  emergency, such as natural disasters. Furthermore, the Coast Guard also  had about 31,000 volunteer auxiliary personnel help with a wide array of  activities, ranging from search and rescue to boating safety education.", "For each of its six non-homeland security programs, the Coast Guard has  developed a primary performance measure to communicate agency  performance and provide information for the budgeting process to  Congress, other policymakers, and taxpayers. The Coast Guard has also  developed 39 secondary measures that it uses to manage these six  programs. The Coast Guard selected and developed the six primary  measures based on a number of criteria, including GPRA, DHS, and OMB  guidance as well as legislative, department, and agency priorities. When  viewed as a suite of measures, the primary and secondary measures  combined are intended to provide Coast Guard officials with a more  comprehensive view of program performance than just the program\u2019s  primary measure. Some of these secondary measures are closely related to  the primary measures; for example, a secondary measure for the marine  environmental protection program, \u201cannual number of oil spills greater  than 100 gallons and chemical discharges per 100 million tons shipped,\u201d is  closely related to the program\u2019s primary measure, \u201c5-year average annual  number of oil spills greater than 100 gallons and chemical discharges per  100 million tons shipped.\u201d However, other secondary measures reflect  activities and priorities that are not reflected in the primary performance  measures. For example, a secondary measure in the search and rescue  program, \u201cpercent of property saved,\u201d reflects activities not captured in  the program\u2019s primary measure, \u201cpercent of mariners in imminent danger  who are rescued.\u201d", "In 2004, we compared trends in performance results, as reported by the  Coast Guard\u2019s primary performance measures, with the agency\u2019s use of  resources and found that the relationship between results achieved and  resources used was not always what might be expected\u2014that is, resources  expended and performance results achieved did not have consistent  direction of movement and sometimes bore an opposite relationship. We  reported that disconnects between resources expended and performance  results achieved have important implications for resource management  and accountability, especially given the Coast Guard\u2019s limited ability to  explain them. In particular, these disconnects prompted a question as to  why, despite substantial changes in a number of programs\u2019 resource hours  used over the period we examined, the corresponding performance results  for these programs were not necessarily affected in a similar manner\u2014that  is, they did not rise or fall along with changes in resources. At that time,  the Coast Guard could not say with any assurance why this occurred. For  example, while resource hours for the search and rescue program dropped  by 22 percent in fiscal year 2003 when compared to the program\u2019s pre- September 11, 2001 baseline, the performance results for the program  remained stable for the same period. These results suggest that  performance was likely affected by factors other than resource hours. One  set of factors cited by the Coast Guard as helping to keep performance  steady despite resource decreases involved strategies such as the use of  new technology, better operational tactics, improved intelligence, and  stronger partnering efforts. Coast Guard officials also pointed to another  set of factors, largely beyond the agency\u2019s control (such as severe weather  conditions), to explain performance results that did not improve despite  resource increases. At the time of our 2004 report, the Coast Guard did not  have a systematic approach to effectively link resources to results.  However, the Coast Guard had begun some initiatives to better track  resource usage and manage program results, but many of these initiatives  were still in early stages of development and some did not have a time  frame for completion.", "Like other federal agencies, DHS is subject to the performance-reporting  requirements of GPRA. GPRA requires agencies to publish a performance  report that includes performance measures and results. These reports are  intended to provide important information to agency managers,  policymakers, and the public on what each agency accomplished with the  resources it was given. The three key annual publications that DHS and  the Coast Guard use to report the Coast Guard\u2019s non-homeland security  primary performance measures are the DHS Performance and  Accountability Report, the DHS fiscal year budget request, and the Coast  Guard\u2019s fiscal year Budget-in-Brief. The DHS Performance and  Accountability Report provides financial and performance information to  the President, Congress and the public for assessing the effectiveness of  the department\u2019s mission performance and stewardship of resources. The  DHS annual budget request to Congress identifies the resources needed  for meeting the department\u2019s missions. The Coast Guard\u2019s annual Budget- in-Brief reports performance information to assess the effectiveness of  the agency\u2019s performance as well as a summary of the agency\u2019s most  recent budget request. These documents report the primary performance  measures for each of the Coast Guard\u2019s non-homeland security programs,  as well as descriptions of the measures and explanations of performance  results.  While these documents report performance results from some  secondary measures, DHS and the Coast Guard do not report most of the  Coast Guard\u2019s secondary measures in these documents.", "GPRA also requires agencies to establish goals and targets to define the  level of performance to be achieved by a program and express such goals  in an objective, quantifiable, and measurable form. In passing GPRA,  Congress emphasized that the usefulness of agency performance  information depends to a large degree on the reliability of performance  data. To be useful in reporting to Congress on the fulfillment of GPRA  requirements and in improving program results, the data must be  reliable\u2014that is, they must be seen by potential users to be of sufficient  quality to be trustworthy. While no data are perfect, agencies need to have  sufficiently reliable performance data to provide transparency of  government operations so that Congress, program managers, and other  decision makers can use the information. In establishing a system to set  goals for federal program performance and to measure results, GPRA  requires that agencies describe the means to be used to validate and verify  measured values to improve congressional decision making by providing  objective, complete, accurate and consistent information on achieving  statutory objectives, and on the relative effectiveness and efficiency of  federal programs and spending. In addition, to improve the quality of  agency performance management information, the Reports Consolidation  Act of 2000 requires an assessment of the reliability of performance data  used in the agency\u2019s program performance report.", "OMB\u2019s Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART) is designed to strengthen  and reinforce performance measurement under GPRA by encouraging  careful development of outcome-oriented performance measures.  Between 2002 and 2005, OMB reviewed each of the Coast Guard\u2019s six non- homeland security programs. OMB found that four programs\u2014ice  operations, living marine resources, marine environmental protection, and  marine safety\u2014were performing adequately or better, and two programs\u2014 aids to navigation and search and rescue\u2014did not demonstrate results.  OMB recommended that for the aids to navigation program, the Coast  Guard develop and implement a better primary performance measure that  allows program managers to understand how their actions produce  results. Specifically, OMB recommended using an outcome-based  measure, the number of collisions, allisions, and groundings, as a measure  for the program, instead of the measure that was being used\u2014aid  availability. For the search and rescue program, OMB recommended that  the Coast Guard develop achievable long-term goals for the program.  Since these reviews, the Coast Guard has implemented a new primary  performance measure for the aids to navigation program, \u201c5-year average  annual number of distinct collisions, allisions, and groundings,\u201d and  developed new long-term goals for the search and rescue program\u2019s  primary performance measure, that is rescuing between 85 and 88 percent  of mariners in imminent danger each year from fiscal year 2002   through 2010."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Non-Homeland Security Primary Performance Measures Are Generally Sound and Data Are Generally Reliable, but Weaknesses Exist", "paragraphs": ["While the six non-homeland security primary performance measures are  generally sound, and the data used to calculate these measures are  generally reliable, we found weaknesses with the soundness of three  measures and the reliability of the data used in one measure (see table 2).

However, processes for reviewing or verifying data  gathered from external sources vary from source to source, and for the  marine environmental protection measure, the processes are insufficient."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Although the Six Primary Measures Are Generally Sound, Three Have Weaknesses", "paragraphs": ["While the six primary performance measures are generally sound\u2014in that  the measures cover key activities of the program, and are objective,  measurable, and quantifiable\u2014three of the measures are not completely  clear. The primary performance measures for the ice operations, living  marine resources, and search and rescue programs do not consistently  provide clear and specific descriptions of the data, events, or geographic  areas they include. It is possible these weaknesses could lead to decisions  or judgments based on inaccurate, incomplete, or misreported data. The  three programs with primary measures that are not completely clear are as  follows:  Ice operations. Further clarity and consistency in reporting the  geographic areas included in the ice operations primary performance  measure, \u201cdomestic ice breaking\u2014annual number of waterway closure  days,\u201d would provide users additional context to discern the full scope  of the measure. Despite its broad title, the measure does not reflect the  annual number of closure days for all waterways across the United  States, but rather reflects only the annual number of closure days in the  Great Lakes region, although the Coast Guard breaks ice in many East  Coast ports and waterways. According to Coast Guard officials, the  measure focuses on the Great Lakes region because it is a large  commerce hub where the icebreaking season tends to be longer and  where ice has a greater impact on maritime transportation. While this  limitation is included in accompanying text in some documents, the  description of the limitation is inconsistent across department and  agency publications. The DHS fiscal year 2005 Performance and  Accountability Report notes that the measure is made up of nine  critical waterways within the region, but the DHS fiscal year 2007  budget request reports that it consists of seven critical waterways,  while the Coast Guard\u2019s fiscal year 2007 Budget-in-Brief does not  mention the number of waterways included in the measure. In addition,  Coast Guard program officials said that the measure only reflects  closures in one critical waterway\u2014the St. Mary\u2019s River. Coast Guard  program officials at agency headquarters said that they are in the early  stages of developing a new primary performance measure that will  incorporate domestic icebreaking activities in areas beyond the Great  Lakes. However, until a better measure is developed, the description of  the current measure can confuse users and might cause them to think  performance was better or worse than it actually was.", "Search and rescue. While the primary performance measure for the  search and rescue program, \u201cpercent of mariners in imminent danger  who are rescued,\u201d reflects the program\u2019s priority of saving lives, it  excludes those incidents in which 11 or more lives were saved or lost.  According to Coast Guard officials, an agency analysis in fiscal year  2005 showed that 98 percent of search and rescue cases involved 10 or  fewer people that were saved or lost. Coast Guard officials added that  large cases involving 11 or more people are data anomalies and by  excluding these cases the agency is better able to assess the program\u2019s  performance on a year-to-year basis. While we understand the Coast  Guard\u2019s desire to assess program performance on a year-to-year basis,  and to not skew the data, in some instances this type of exclusion may  represent a significant level of activity that is not factored into the  measure. For example, during Hurricane Katrina, the Coast Guard  rescued more than 33,500 people. While including such large incidents  in the performance measure would skew annual performance results, it  is important for the Coast Guard to recognize these incidents, either  through a footnote or accompanying text in department and agency  publications. Not clearly defining the measure and recognizing such  incidents may cause internal managers and external stakeholders to  think performance was better or worse than it actually was.", "Living marine resources. Similar to the ice operations primary  measure, the living marine resources primary performance measure,  \u201cpercent of fishermen in compliance with regulations,\u201d is not  consistently and clearly defined in all department and agency  publications. The Coast Guard enforces federal regulations, similar to  agencies across law enforcement, not by checking fishing vessels at  random, but instead by targeting those entities that are most likely to  be in violation of fishery regulations, such as vessels operating in areas  that are closed to fishing. Because the Coast Guard targets vessels, the  primary measure does not reflect the compliance rate of all fishermen  in those areas patrolled by the Coast Guard, as could be inferred by the  description, but rather is an observed compliance rate, that is, the  compliance rate of only those fishing vessels boarded by Coast Guard  personnel. The description of this performance measure is inconsistent  across department and agency publications. For example, in the DHS  fiscal year 2005 Performance and Accountability Report and the Coast  Guard\u2019s Budget-in-Brief, this measure is described as an observed  compliance rate, but the DHS fiscal year 2007 budget request does not  clarify that this measure represents an observed compliance rate rather  than the compliance rate of all fishermen in those areas patrolled by  the Coast Guard. A measure that is not consistently and clearly stated  may affect the validity of managers\u2019 and stakeholders\u2019 assessments of  program performance, possibly leading to a misinterpretation of  results."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Existing Procedures Help Ensure Reliable Internal Data, but Procedures Do Not Exist to Check Reliability of All External Data", "paragraphs": ["While the Coast Guard has controls in place to ensure the timeliness,  completeness, accuracy, and consistency of internal data it creates\u2014that  is, original data that Coast Guard personnel collect and enter into its data  systems\u2014the agency does not have controls in place to verify or review  the completeness and accuracy of data obtained from all external sources  that it uses in calculating some of the primary performance measures. The  internal data used to calculate the six primary performance measures are  generally reliable\u2014in that the Coast Guard has processes in place to  ensure the data\u2019s timeliness, completeness, accuracy, and consistency.  These controls include data fields, such as pick lists and drop-down lists,  that allow for standardized data entry, mandatory data fields to ensure all  required data are entered, access controls that allow only authorized users  to enter and edit data, requirements for entering data in a timely manner,  and multiple levels of review across the agency. To ensure data  consistency across the Coast Guard, each of the six non-homeland  security programs has published definitions or criteria to define the data  used for the primary measures. However, the Coast Guard acknowledges  that in some instances these criteria may be open to subjective  interpretation, such as with the search and rescue program. For example,  when entering data to record the events of a search and rescue incident,  rescuers must identify the outcome of the event by listing whether lives  were \u201clost,\u201d \u201csaved,\u201d or \u201cassisted.\u201d While program criteria define a life that  is lost, saved, or assisted, there is potential for subjective interpretation in  some incidents. Through reviews at the sector, district, and headquarters  levels the Coast Guard attempts to remedy any inconsistencies from  interpretations of these criteria.", "While the Coast Guard uses internal data for all six of its non-homeland  security primary performance measures, it also uses external data to  calculate the primary performance measures for two programs\u2014marine  safety and marine environmental protection (see table 3). The Coast  Guard\u2019s procedures for reviewing external data are inconsistent across  these two programs. For example, while the Coast Guard has developed  better processes and controls for external data used in the marine safety  program\u2019s primary performance measure\u2014such as using a news clipping  service that gathers media articles on recreational boating accidents and  fatalities and using a database that gathers recreational boating injury data  from hospitals\u2014the agency does not have processes to test the reliability  of external data used in the marine environmental protection program\u2019s  primary performance measure. The extent to which controls are used to  verify external data for the marine safety and marine environmental  protection primary measures is described below.", "Marine safety. To calculate the marine safety program\u2019s primary  performance measure, \u201c5-year average annual number of deaths and  injuries of recreational boaters, mariners, and passengers,\u201d the Coast  Guard uses internal data on deaths and injuries for mariners and  passengers, as well as external data on recreational boating deaths and  injuries from the Boating Accident Reporting Database (BARD)\u2014a  Coast Guard managed database\u2014that relies on data collected and  entered by the states. In 2000, the Department of Transportation Office  of Inspector General reported that recreational boating fatality data  collected from the states consistently understated the number of  fatalities, in part because a precise definition of a recreational boating  fatality did not exist. To improve the reliability and consistency of the  data, the Coast Guard created a more precise definition and clarified  reporting criteria by providing each state with a data dictionary that  describes the definitions for all required data fields. In addition, to  improve the timeliness of incident reporting, the Coast Guard created a  Web-based version of BARD for electronic submission of recreational  boating accident data. According to Coast Guard officials, this system  allows Coast Guard staff to verify, validate, and corroborate data with  each state for accuracy and completeness prior to inclusion in the  measure.", "According to Coast Guard officials, a recent Coast Guard analysis  showed that these efforts have improved the error rate from an average  of about 6 percent to about 1 percent annually. However, despite these  improvements, the Coast Guard acknowledges that some incidents may  still never be reported, some incidents may be inaccurately reported,  and some duplicate incidents may be included. Coast Guard officials  told us that the agency continues to work to reduce these errors by  developing additional steps to validate data. These recent steps include  using a news clipping service that gathers all media articles concerning  recreational boating accidents and fatalities and using a database that  gathers recreational boating injury data from hospitals.", "Marine environmental protection. In contrast, the Coast Guard does  not have processes to validate the reliability of external data used in  the marine environmental protection program\u2019s primary performance  measure, \u201c5-year average annual number of oil spills greater than   100 gallons and chemical discharges per 100 million tons shipped.\u201d  Each year the Coast Guard uses internal data on oil spills and chemical  discharges, as well as external data from the Corps on the amount of  oil and chemicals shipped annually in the United States to calculate  this measure. However, the Coast Guard does not review the Corps\u2019  data for completeness or accuracy, nor does it review the data  reliability procedures the Corps uses to test the data for completeness  or accuracy. Coast Guard officials said that they did not take these  steps because they had thought the Corps performed its own internal  assessments, but they were also unaware of what these assessments  were or whether the Corps actually performed them.

According to Coast Guard officials, these measures do not have targets  because the focus of the program is on the primary performance  measures, and not the inputs and outputs reflected in these secondary  measures. However, without any quantifiable, numeric targets, it is  difficult for the Coast Guard to know the extent to which program and  agency goals and objectives are being achieved.", "Measure without criteria or guidance to accurately reflect program  results and ensure objectivity. One of the search and rescue program\u2019s  secondary performance measures that we analyzed, \u201cpercent of  property saved,\u201d does not have criteria or guidance for agency  personnel to objectively and consistently determine the value of saved  property. Despite this lack of criteria on how to consistently and  objectively determine property values, data from this measure are  reported in both the Coast Guard\u2019s annual Budget-in-Brief and the  DHS fiscal year Performance and Accountability Report. Coast Guard  officials said it would be difficult to develop such criteria because of  the large number of boats and vessels and their varying values. Officials  added that Coast Guard personnel generally do not have access to, and  do not follow up to obtain, insurance or damage estimates for saved  property. In addition, we found that Coast Guard units do not  consistently record property values across the agency. For example,  some units do not record property values at all, other units record  property values only when the actual value can be determined, and  other units estimate property values using a $1,000-per-foot-of-vessel- length rule of thumb. Without any criteria or guidance to determine  property values, the Coast Guard cannot provide assurance that agency  personnel are consistently and objectively making these  determinations across the agency, and whether the measure accurately  reflects program results.", "Measure not completely clear. Similar to the primary performance  measure for the search and rescue program, one of the search and  rescue program\u2019s secondary measures we analyzed, \u201cpercent of lives  saved after Coast Guard notification,\u201d reflects the program\u2019s priority of  saving lives, but excludes those incidents in which 11 or more lives  were saved or lost in a single case. As with the primary measure,  including such large incidents in performance measures would skew  annual performance results, and thus it may be appropriate to exclude  them. However, it is important for the Coast Guard to recognize, either  through a footnote or accompanying text, the exclusion of these  incidents\u2014such as during Hurricane Katrina, in which the agency  rescued more than 33,500 people\u2014because otherwise, performance  results could be misinterpreted or misleading to users."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Challenges Exist in Using Measures to Link Resources to Results, but the Coast Guard Is Working on Ways to Address Them", "paragraphs": ["While the primary measures for the Coast Guard\u2019s six non-homeland  security programs are generally sound and use reliable data, challenges  exist with using the primary measures to assess the link between  resources expended and results achieved. Ideally, a performance measure  not only tells decision makers what a program is accomplishing, but it also  gives them a way to affect these results through the decisions they make  about resources\u2014for example, by providing additional resources with a  degree of confidence that doing so will translate into better results. Even  sound performance measures, however, may have limits to how much they  can explain about the relationship between resources expended and  results achieved. For the Coast Guard, these limits involve (1) the  difficulty of fully reflecting an entire program such as ice operations or  marine environmental protection in a single performance measure and   (2) the ability to account for the many factors, other than resources, that  can affect program results. Recognizing these limitations, and responding  to recommendations we have made in past reports, Coast Guard officials  have been working on a wide range of initiatives they believe will help in  understanding the effects of these other factors and deciding where  resources can best be spent. According to Coast Guard officials, although  the agency has been working on some of these initiatives for several years,  the extent and complexity of the effort, together with the challenges  presented in integrating a multitude of initiatives into a data-driven and  comprehensive strategy, requires additional time to complete. At this time,  the Coast Guard does not expect many of the initiatives to be implemented  until 2010. Until these initiatives are developed and operational, it is not  possible to fully assess the overall success the agency is likely to have in  establishing clear explanations for how its resources and results are  linked."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Primary Performance Measures Cover a Key Activity, but Not Every Activity Conducted under a Program", "paragraphs": ["Performance measures are one important tool to communicate what a  program has accomplished and provide information for budget decisions.  It is desirable for these measures to be as effective as possible in helping  to explain the relationship between resources expended and results  achieved, because agencies that understand this linkage are better  positioned to allocate and manage their resources effectively. The Coast  Guard follows DHS guidance in reporting a single measure per program,  and doing so is consistent with our prior work on agencies that were  successful in measuring performance and implementing GPRA.  Previously, we found that agencies successful in measuring performance  and meeting GPRA\u2019s goal-setting and performance measurement  requirements limited their measures to covering core program activities  essential for producing data for decision making and not all program  activities. Each of the Coast Guard\u2019s primary measures for its six non- homeland security programs meets our criteria of covering a key activity.  None of them, however, is comprehensive enough to capture all of the  activities performed within the program that could affect results. For  example, the primary performance measure for the marine environmental  protection program relates to preventing oil and chemical spills. This is a  key program activity, but under this program the Coast Guard also takes  steps to prevent other marine debris and pollutants (such as plastics and  garbage), protect against the introduction of invasive aquatic nuisance  species, and respond to and mitigate oil and chemical spills that actually  do occur. As such, resources applied to these other activities would not be  reflected in the program\u2019s primary measure, and thus, a clear and direct  relationship between total program resources and program results is  blurred.", "In some cases, it may be possible to identify or develop a performance  measure that fully encapsulates all the activities within a program, but in  many cases the range of activities is too broad, resulting in a measure that  would be too nebulous to be of real use. Coast Guard officials told us that  developing primary measures that incorporate all of the diverse activities  within some programs, as well as reflect the total resources used within  the program would be difficult, and that such a measure would likely be  too broad to provide any value for assessing overall program performance.  As such, officials added that performance measures provide a better  assessment of program performance and resource use when all of a  program\u2019s measures\u2014both primary and secondary\u2014are viewed in  conjunction as a suite of measures."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Performance Results Can Be Affected by Factors Other than Resources", "paragraphs": ["A second challenge in establishing a clearer relationship between  resources expended and results achieved is that many other factors can  affect performance and blur such a relationship. Some of these factors can  be external to an agency\u2014and perhaps outside an agency\u2019s ability to  influence. At the time of our 2004 report, Coast Guard officials also  pointed to these external factors outside of the agency\u2019s control to explain  performance results that did not improve despite resource increases.  Because of the potentially large number of external factors, and their  sometimes unpredictable or often unknown effect on performance, it may  be difficult to account for how they\u2014and not the resources expended on  the program\u2014affect performance results.", "Such factors are prevalent in the Coast Guard\u2019s non-homeland security  programs, according to Coast Guard officials. They cited such examples as  the following:    Changes in fishing policies off the coast of Alaska had an effect on  performance results in the search and rescue program. For many years,  commercial sablefish and halibut fishermen were allowed to fish only  during a 2-week period each year. Given the limited window of  opportunity that this system provided, these fishermen had a strong  incentive to go out to sea regardless of weather conditions, thereby  affecting the number of the Coast Guard\u2019s search and rescue cases that  occurred. In 1994, these regulations were changed; in place of a 2-week  fishing season with no limits on the amount of fish any permitted  fisherman could harvest, the regulations set a longer season with  quotas. This change allowed fishermen more flexibility and more  opportunity to exercise caution about when they should fish rather  than driving them to go out in adverse weather conditions. Following  the change in regulations, Coast Guard statistics show that search and  rescue cases decreased in halibut and sablefish fisheries by more than  50 percent, from 33 in 1994 to 15 in 1995. However, Coast Guard  officials said that because of the large number of search and rescue  cases in the district during these two years\u2014more than   1,000 annually\u2014this policy change only had a minimal impact on the  amount of resources the district used for search and rescue cases.", "Vagaries of weather can also affect a number of non-homeland security  missions. Unusually severe weather, such as Hurricane Katrina, for  example, can affect the success rates for search and rescue or cause  navigational aids to be out of service. Even good weather on a holiday  weekend, can increase the need for search and rescue operations\u2014and  consequently affect performance results\u2014because such weather tends  to encourage large numbers of recreational boaters to be out on the  water. Harsh winter weather can also affect performance results for  the ice operations program.", "Results for the marine environmental protection primary performance  measure, \u201cthe 5-year average annual number of oil spills greater than  100 gallons and chemical discharges per 100 million tons shipped\u201d can  be affected by policies and activities that are not part of the marine  environmental protection program. For example, according to Coast  Guard officials, a foreign country\u2019s decision to institute a more  aggressive vessel inspection program could reduce spills caused by  accidents in U.S. waters, if the inspections uncovered mechanical  problems that were corrected before those vessels arrived in the  United States. While not captured in the primary performance measure,  the Coast Guard tracks such information through a secondary measure,  \u201cthe Tokyo and Paris memorandums of understanding port state  control reports.\u201d", "This small set of examples demonstrates that, in some situations, other  factors beyond resources expended may influence performance results.  Developing a system or model that could realistically take all of these  other factors into account is perhaps impossible, and it would be a  mistake to view this second challenge as a need to do so. Rather, the  challenge is to develop enough sophistication about each program\u2019s  context so that the Coast Guard can more systematically consider such  factors, and then explain the influence of these factors on resource  decisions and performance results."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Coast Guard Has Developed a Range of Initiatives to Forge Better Links between Resources and Results", "paragraphs": ["The Coast Guard is actively seeking to address such challenges, as those  discussed above, through efforts, some of which have been under way for  several years. In 2004, we reported that several initiatives had already  begun, and we recommended that the Coast Guard ensure that its strategic  planning process and associated documents include a strategy for  identifying intervening factors that may affect performance and  systematically assess the relationship among these factors, resources  expended, and results achieved. Shortly thereafter the Coast Guard  chartered a working group to investigate its then more than 50 ongoing  initiatives to make recommendations on their value, contribution, and  practicality, and to influence agency decisions on the integration,  investment, and institutionalization of these initiatives. The working  group\u2019s product was a \u201croad map\u201d that clearly defined executable  segments, sequencing, and priorities. These results were then documented  in a January 2005 Coast Guard internal report that summarized these  priorities. Agency documents indicate that the Coast Guard later reduced  these 50 original initiatives to the 25 initiatives considered to be the most  critical and immediate by evaluating and categorizing all 50 initiatives  based on their ability to contribute to the agency\u2019s missions. These   25 initiatives, listed along with their status in appendix III, involve a broad  range of activities that fall into seven main areas, as follows:    Measurement. Five initiatives are intended to improve the agency\u2019s  data collection, including efforts to quantify input, output, and  performance to enhance analysis and fact-based decision making.", "Analysis. Eight initiatives are intended to transform data into  information and knowledge to answer questions and enhance decision  making on issues such as performance, program management, cause- and-effect relationships, and costs.", "Knowledge management. Three ongoing initiatives are intended to  capture, evaluate, and share employee knowledge, experiences, ideas,  and skills.", "Alignment. Three initiatives are intended to improve the consistency  and alignment of agency planning, resource decisions, and analysis  across all Coast Guard programs.", "Access. Two initiatives relate to making data, information, and  knowledge transparent and available to employees.", "Policy and doctrine. Three initiatives are intended to develop new and  maintain current Coast Guard management policies.", "Communication and outreach. One initiative is intended to assist and  guide program managers and staff to understand and align all aspects  of the Coast Guard\u2019s overall management strategy.", "We found that one of the initiatives that the working group deemed  important and included among the most critical and immediate initiatives,  relates, in part, to the first challenge we discussed\u2014that is, developing  new measures and improving the breadth of old measures to better  manage Coast Guard programs and achieve agency goals. Coast Guard  efforts have been ongoing in this regard, and our current work has  identified several performance measures that were recently improved, and  others that are currently under development. For example, to provide a  more comprehensive measure of search and rescue program performance,  the Coast Guard is improving its ability to track lives-unaccounted-for\u2014 that is, those persons who at the end of a search and rescue response  remain missing. According to Coast Guard officials, the agency is working  on and anticipates being able to eventually include data on lives- unaccounted-for in the primary performance measure. Also, the Coast  Guard began including data on the number of recreational boating injuries,  along with the data on mariner and passenger deaths and injuries and  recreational boater deaths, which can help provide a more comprehensive  primary measure for the marine safety program. In addition, recently,  OMB guidance began requiring efficiency measures as part of performance  management, and in response, the Coast Guard has started developing  such efficiency measures. The Coast Guard is also developing a variety of  performance measures to capture agency performance related to other  activities, such as the prevention of invasive aquatic nuisance species  (marine environmental protection), maritime mobility (aids to navigation),  and domestic and polar icebreaking (ice operations).", "Many of the Coast Guard\u2019s other ongoing initiatives are aimed at the  second challenge\u2014that is, developing a better understanding of the  various factors that affect the relationship between resources and results.", "This is a substantial undertaking, and in 2005, upon the recommendation  of the working group, the Coast Guard created an office to conduct and  coordinate these efforts. This office has taken the lead in developing,  aligning, implementing, and managing all of the initiatives. Together, the  activities cover such steps as (1) improving measurement, with  comprehensive data on activities, resources, and performance;   (2) improving agency analysis and understanding of cause-and-effect  relationships, such as the relationship between external factors and  agency performance; and (3) providing better planning and decision  making across the agency. Coast Guard officials expect that once these  initiatives are completed, the Coast Guard will have a more systematic  approach to link resources to results.", "The Coast Guard has already been at this effort for several years but does  not anticipate implementation of many of these initiatives until at least  fiscal year 2010. The amount of time that has already elapsed since our  2004 report may raise some concerns about whether progress is being  made.  However, as described in the examples below, many of these are  complex data-driven initiatives that make up a larger comprehensive  strategy to better link resources to results, and as such, we think the  lengthy time frame reflects the complexity of the task. According to Coast  Guard officials, the agency is proceeding carefully and is still learning  about how these initiatives can best be developed and implemented. Three  key efforts help show the extent of, and interrelationships among, the  various components of the effort:    Standardized reporting. The Coast Guard is currently developing an  activities dictionary to standardize the names and definitions for all  Coast Guard activities across the agency. According to Coast Guard  officials, this activities dictionary is a critical step in continuing to  develop, implement, and integrate these initiatives. Officials added that  standardizing the names and definitions of all Coast Guard activities  will create more consistent data collection throughout the agency,  which is important because these data will be used to support many  other initiatives.", "Measurement of readiness. Another initiative, the Readiness  Management System, is a tool being developed and implemented to  track the agency\u2019s readiness capabilities by providing up-to-date  information on resource levels at each Coast Guard unit as well as the  certification and skills of all Coast Guard uniformed personnel. This  information can directly affect outcomes and performance measures by  providing unit commanders with information to reconfigure resources  for a broad range of missions. Tracking this information, for example,  should allow the unit\u2019s commanding officer to determine what  resources and personnel skills are needed to help ensure the unit has  the skills and resources necessary to accomplish its key activities, or  for new programs or activities. Coast Guard officials told us that the  Readiness Management System is in the early stages of being  implemented across the agency.", "Framework for analyzing risk, readiness, and performance.", "According to Coast Guard officials, the information from the Readiness  Management System will be integrated with another initiative currently  under development, the Uniform Performance Logic Model. This  initiative is intended to illustrate the causal relationships among risk,  readiness management, and agency performance. Coast Guard officials  said that by accounting for these many factors, the model will help  decision makers understand why events and outcomes occur, and how  these events and outcomes are related to resources. For example, the  model will provide the Coast Guard with an analysis tool to assist  management with decisions regarding the allocation of resources.", "The Coast Guard currently anticipates that many of the 25 initiatives will  initially be implemented by fiscal year 2010 and expects further  refinements to extend beyond this time frame. While the Coast Guard  appears to be moving in the right direction and has neared completion of  some initiatives, until all of the agency\u2019s efforts are complete, it remains  too soon to determine how effective it will be at clearly linking resources  to performance results."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["It is important for the Coast Guard to have sound performance measures  that are clearly stated and described; cover key program activities; are  objective, measurable, and quantifiable\u2014including having annual targets;  and using reliable data. This type of information would help Coast Guard  management and stakeholders, such as Congress, make decisions about  how to fund and improve program performance. We found that the Coast  Guard\u2019s non-homeland security performance measures satisfy many of the  criteria and use data that are generally reliable. The weaknesses and  limitations we did find do not mean that the measures are not useful but  rather represent opportunities for improvement. However, if these  weaknesses are not addressed\u2014that is, if measures are not clearly stated  and well-defined, do not have measurable performance targets, or do not  have criteria to objectively and consistently report data, or processes in  place to ensure external data are reliable\u2014the information reported  through these measures could be misinterpreted, misleading, or  inaccurate. For example, without either processes in place to review the  reliability of external data used in performance measures, or a familiarity  with the controls used by external parties to verify and validate these data,  the Coast Guard cannot ensure the completeness or accuracy of all of its  performance results.", "While the Coast Guard\u2019s measures are generally sound, even sound  performance measures have limits as to how much they can explain about  the relationship between resources expended and results achieved. The  Coast Guard continues to work to overcome these limitations by  developing a number of different initiatives, including but not limited to  developing and refining the agency\u2019s performance measures. Although the  agency appears to be moving in the right direction, until all of the Coast  Guard\u2019s efforts are complete, we will be unable to determine how effective  these initiatives are at linking resources to results. In the interim, an  additional step the Coast Guard can take to further demonstrate the  relationship between resources and results is to provide additional  information or measures in some of its annual publications\u2014aside from  the one primary measure used in department publications\u2014where doing  so would help provide context or provide additional perspective. For  example, this could be done in other venues\u2014such as the Coast Guard\u2019s  annual Budget-in-Brief, or any program-specific publications\u2014where  reporting some secondary measures or additional data could provide more  context or perspective on programs, and could help to more fully  articulate to stakeholders and decision makers the relationship between  resources expended and results achieved. Reporting supplemental  information on such things as the percentage of aids to navigation  available and in need of maintenance, the annual number of search and  rescue cases, and icebreaking activities beyond the Great Lakes region  would provide additional information on the annual levels of activity that  constitute the aids to navigation, search and rescue, and ice operations  programs; information that external decision makers, in particular, might  find helpful.

We reviewed legislative requirements for data  reliability in both the Government Performance and Accountability Act of  1993 and the Reports Consolidation Act of 2000 and reviewed Coast Guard  standards and procedures for collecting performance data and calculating  results. In addition, we interviewed agency officials at Coast Guard  headquarters, as well as at the district and sector levels, regarding  standardized agencywide data collection, entry, verification, and reporting  policies, and inquired as to if and how these procedures differed across  programs and at each level of the organization. We observed data entry for  the Marine Information Safety and Law Enforcement database at Coast  Guard district and sector offices in Boston, Massachusetts; Miami, Florida;  and Seattle, Washington; a district office in Cleveland, Ohio; as well as at  an air station in Miami, Florida; and a marine safety office in Cleveland,  Ohio, to check for inconsistencies and discrepancies in how data are  collected and maintained throughout the agency.

We selected  these programs because they had the largest budget increases between the  fiscal year 2005 budget and the Coast Guard\u2019s fiscal year 2006 budget  request, and are programs of particular interest because of events  surrounding Hurricane Katrina. In addition, we did not assess any of the  secondary measures that were in development at the time of our report.
