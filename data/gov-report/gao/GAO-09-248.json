In 2003, the Department of Energy (DOE) initiated FutureGen--a commercial-scale, coal-fired power plant to incorporate integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC), an advanced generating technology, with carbon capture and storage (CCS). The plant was to capture and store underground about 90 percent of its CO2 emissions. DOE's cost share was 74 percent, and industry partners agreed to fund the rest. Concerned about escalating costs, DOE restructured FutureGen. GAO was asked to examine (1) the original and restructured programs' goals, (2) similarities and differences between the new FutureGen and other DOE CCS programs, and (3) if the restructuring decision was based on sufficient information. GAO reviewed best practices for making programmatic decisions, FutureGen plans and budgets, and documents on the restructuring of FutureGen. GAO contacted DOE, industry partners, and experts."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The original FutureGen program and the new restructured FutureGen program attempt to use CCS at coal-fired power plants to achieve near-zero CO2 emissions and to make CCS economically viable. However, they take different approaches that could affect CCS's commercial advancement. First, the original program aimed at developing knowledge about the integration of IGCC and CCS at one plant; in contrast, the new program could provide opportunities to learn about CCS at different plants, such as conventional ones that use pulverized coal generating technology. Second, the original program was operated by a nonprofit consortium of energy companies at one plant, while the new program called for CCS projects at multiple commercial plants. The new, restructured FutureGen differs from most DOE CCS programs. The new FutureGen would develop and integrate multiple CCS components at coal-fired plants (including CO2 capture, transportation, and storage underground). Other programs concentrate on only one CCS component and/or a related component (e.g., capture or capture and compression). However, Round III of DOE's Clean Coal Power Initiative (CCPI) is a cost-shared partnership with industry that funds commercial CCS demonstrations at new and existing coal-fired plants. The new FutureGen is most like CCPI in that both fund CCS commercial demonstrations at several plants to accelerate CCS deployment and require that participants bear 50 percent of the costs, but DOE expects the new FutureGen to have more funding for commercial demonstrations than CCPI. Moreover, the new FutureGen targets a higher amount of CO2 to be captured and stored (at least 1 million metric tons of CO2 annually per plant) than CCPI (300,000 metric tons). Contrary to best practices, DOE did not base its decision to restructure FutureGen on a comprehensive analysis of factors, such as the associated costs, benefits, and risks. DOE made its decision, largely, on the conclusion that costs for the original FutureGen had doubled and would escalate substantially. However, in its decision, DOE compared two cost estimates for the original FutureGen that were not comparable because DOE's $950 million estimate was in constant 2004 dollars and the $1.8 billion estimate of DOE's industry partners was inflated through 2017. As its restructuring decision did not consider a comprehensive analysis of costs, benefits, and risks, DOE has no assurance that the restructured FutureGen is the best option to advance CCS. In contrast to the restructuring decision, DOE's Office of Fossil Energy had identified and analyzed 13 options for incremental, cost-saving changes to the original program, such as reducing the CO2 capture requirement. While the Office of Fossil Energy did not consider all of these options to be viable, it either recommended or noted several of them for consideration, with potential savings ranging from $30 million to $55 million each."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Key scientific assessments have underscored the urgency of reducing  Key scientific assessments have underscored the urgency of reducing  carbon dioxide (CO) emissions to help mitigate climate change.

In 2005, the FutureGen Industrial Alliance  (Alliance), a nonprofit consortium of some of the largest coal producers  and electric power companies in the world, formed to join DOE in this  effort. The Alliance agreed to fund 26 percent of the program, and DOE  agreed to fund the remaining 74 percent\u2014of which DOE anticipated  receiving funding contributions for about 8 percent of the program\u2019s total  cost from foreign government partners.

In a process called precombustion CCS, the CO as a concentrated gas stream at high pressure that may  be captured and stored more easily and cheaply than CO that must be separated  from other gases before storing. Construction on FutureGen was  scheduled to begin in 2009, and operations were to begin in 2012. In that  year, FutureGen was to begin capturing, storing, and monitoring the stored  CO for 2  more years. In addition, the FutureGen plant was being designed to serve  as a living laboratory host facility for emerging clean coal research  programs, including DOE\u2019s ongoing coal research program, to help  develop advanced technologies that could (1) improve CCS and IGCC, and  (2) advance research in other areas, such as hydrogen fuel cells.", "By mid-2007, partly because of cost escalations for building power plants  around the world, DOE had become increasingly concerned about  potential escalating costs for FutureGen. For example, the price of  cement, large quantities of which are required for building power plants,  had increased by about 30 percent from 2004 to 2006, and certain labor  costs for building power plants had increased by over 25 percent, or  almost twice the rate of general inflation, from 2001 to 2007. In October  2007, to address these concerns, DOE began renegotiating its share of  program costs with the Alliance. In December 2007, after DOE finished  conducting the extensive environmental analyses required by the National  Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) Further, DOE had advised the Alliance not to  announce a site selection until the Record of Decision had been issued, as  contemplated by the cooperative agreement. Subsequently, in January  2008, DOE announced that it would not continue its cooperative  agreement with the Alliance and that it was going to take a different  approach to FutureGen.

The  production of hydrogen was to support the President\u2019s Hydrogen Fuel  Initiative to create a hydrogen economy for transportation. The original  FutureGen plant was planned to operate at a commercial scale as a 275  megawatt IGCC facility that would capture and store at least 1 million  metric tons of CO Pursuant to the agreement, the  Alliance was to design, construct, and operate the FutureGen plant, and  DOE was to provide project oversight, conduct the environmental  analyses required by NEPA, and coordinate the participation of foreign  governments.

DOE received similar feedback in responses to its  request for information from the public about its plan to restructure  FutureGen. Eighteen of the 49 respondents indicated that the 90 percent  goal would be too restrictive for industry participants because of the  additional energy required to capture and compress CO However, the restructured program, a DOE commercial  demonstration project, seeks to accelerate the commercial deployment of  CCS (that is, generating and selling electricity to earn profits) by  implementing CCS at one or more commercial facilities by 2015\u2014 approximately five years earlier than the original program\u2019s commercial  operations could begin. The original program, a DOE research and  development project, would begin generating electricity in 2012, a few  years earlier than the restructured FutureGen; but, it could not begin  operating as a profit-seeking commercial facility until after the nonprofit  Alliance sells it, which is currently anticipated to occur in 2020.  Knowledgeable stakeholders told us that the restructured program\u2019s time  line for the commercial deployment of its project(s) might be ambitious  because legal and environmental issues related to siting and permitting, in  particular for CCS, could slow implementation. They also stated that the  required NEPA analyses, which must be completed prior to beginning  construction, could take up to 3 years. In contrast, DOE had completed its  NEPA analyses for the original FutureGen. Moreover, the governments of  the two states\u2014Texas and Illinois\u2014where the four finalist sites for the  original FutureGen were located, had agreed to assume liability for the  injected CO. DOE officials told us that, unlike the original program, a  primary goal of the restructured FutureGen was to facilitate the siting and  permitting process for CCS by implementing multiple projects in different  locations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Different Approaches for Achieving Goals Could Have Different Impacts on the Commercial Advancement of CCS", "paragraphs": ["Because of the different approaches for achieving their goals, the original  and restructured FutureGen programs could have different impacts on the  commercial advancement of CCS (see table 2).", "The type of information gained from the programs may vary. First, the  original program would have developed knowledge about CCS at IGCC  plants, while the restructured program could allow for opportunities to  learn about CCS at both IGCC and other types of coal plants.  Knowledgeable stakeholders whom we contacted stated that DOE could  benefit by taking advantage of the opportunity under the restructured  FutureGen program to learn about CCS at multiple types of plants. They  explained that opportunities to learn from multiple plant sites in different  regions with various technologies would provide a wide range of  knowledge about the implementation of CCS in various contexts.  Similarly, 30 of 49 respondents to DOE\u2019s request for information about the  restructured program indicated that it would be beneficial if the  restructured program were to include both IGCC and other types of coal  plants. In addition to other organizations, such as the National Academy of  Sciences, we have noted that the benefits of learning about CCS  technologies are also applicable to existing pulverized coal-fired plants,  since they account for an overwhelming share (about 99 percent) of the  world\u2019s coal-fired power plants. However, one of the intended benefits of  the restructured program\u2014providing opportunities to learn from multiple  plants about various technologies\u2014may not be fully realized since DOE  received only a small number of applications. If an application for IGCC  has not been received or is not selected, the loss of an IGCC plant with  integrated CCS capability is significant because, according to the draft  strategic planning document for the restructured program, demonstrating  this technology is a key solution for reducing atmospheric CO emissions  from coal-fired power plants. Comments submitted to DOE and  knowledgeable stakeholders we interviewed indicated that the carbon  capture goal for the restructured program was too restrictive for  commercial facilities. One stakeholder stated that the restructured  program goals might be overly optimistic about what commercial projects  are willing to do. As a result of receiving only a small number of  applications, the restructured program is not as likely to develop as broad  a base of knowledge as it could have if more applications were received.", "Second, it is unclear whether the original FutureGen program or the  restructured program could have advanced the broader roll out of CCS  more quickly across all of industry. According to DOE documents, the  restructured program is intended to begin deploying CCS at one or more  commercial facilities in 2015, approximately five years earlier than the  original program\u2019s commercial operations (that is, generating and selling  electricity) could begin. The original program, a DOE research and  development project, would have begun generating electricity in 2012, a  few years earlier than the restructured FutureGen, but it could not have  begun operating as a profit-seeking commercial facility until after the  nonprofit Alliance sold it, which was anticipated to occur in 2020.  Moreover, unlike the restructured program, the original FutureGen would  have included a wide variety of industry partners (including foreign  government partners, which are absent from the restructured program).   In addition, more industry partners could have joined the Alliance and its  11 members over the course of the original program. As a result of its  wider participation, the original FutureGen could potentially have  advanced the broader roll out of CCS across all of industry and  internationally, instead of at only a few commercial facilities, more quickly  than the restructured program. DOE officials told us that the original  program would likely improve the global advancement of CCS more  quickly than the restructured program due to its various international  partnerships. They stated that DOE is developing an approach to recoup  the loss of international involvement that resulted from restructuring  FutureGen.", "Third, the restructured program will not serve as a living laboratory host  facility for technologies emerging from energy research and development  programs aimed at the goal of near-zero emissions and for gaining broad  industry acceptance for these technologies. The original FutureGen plant  was to be designed with the ability to test various technologies that are  scalable to full size, such as fuel cells, advanced gasification, and  membrane air separation systems. Without the opportunity to test these  emerging research and development technologies, the restructured  FutureGen might result in a slower advancement of CCS than the original  program may have yielded. According to the cooperative agreement  between DOE and the Alliance, emerging technologies, such as fuel cells,  could have been tested at the original program\u2019s living laboratory host  facility. In a September 2007 presentation to DOE\u2019s Deputy Secretary,  NETL noted the impact of removing the living laboratory, saying it would  \u201csignificantly delay the availability of the technology for commercial  deployment\u201d and have a \u201csignificant programmatic impact.\u201d DOE officials  told us that they have not yet determined where these technologies will be  tested."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The Restructured FutureGen Differs from Most of the Other DOE Carbon Capture and Storage Programs, but It Is Similar to CCPI in Several Ways", "paragraphs": ["DOE manages a portfolio of clean coal programs that research and  develop CCS technology or demonstrate its application.

While DOE had reason to be concerned about the  escalating costs of the original FutureGen, it made its decision to cancel  that program and replace it with the restructured FutureGen based, in  large part, on a comparison of cost estimates that were not comparable.  That is, it compared one estimate that was in current dollars with one that  was in constant dollars. In restructuring FutureGen, DOE did not  sufficiently analyze the costs, benefits, and risks of canceling the original  FutureGen and replacing it with a significantly restructured program. A  comprehensive analysis could have helped DOE determine how the costs,  benefits, and risks of the restructured FutureGen compared with those of  the original FutureGen. Because it did not conduct such an analysis, DOE  cannot be assured that the restructured program is the best option to  accelerate the widespread commercial advancement of CCS more quickly  than the original program. Other options, rather than dramatically  restructuring the program, were possible that could have preserved some  of the benefits of the original program, including ensuring the integration  of IGCC and CCS at the FutureGen facility. For example, FE identified and  analyzed 13 other options for incremental, cost-saving changes to the  original program, such as reducing the COvary from location to location, and technology costs and designs, such as  for turbines, vary depending on the specific manufacturer and vendor.", "The March 2007 renewed cooperative agreement listed approximately $1.8  billion as the current estimated cost of the project. However, senior DOE  officials soon began to express concerns about escalating program costs,  and they directed FE officials to develop recommendations for controlling  costs. In September 2007, FE officials presented several recommendations  for incremental changes to control costs to the Deputy Secretary of  Energy; they also noted various measures already in place for controlling  costs, such as monthly progress reports and a risk management program.  Importantly, none of the recommendations indicated that DOE should  cancel the original program and restructure FutureGen; moreover, FE  officials told us that they did not prepare any analysis or recommendations  for senior DOE officials that resembled what was to become the  restructured program.", "According to DOE, following this presentation, senior DOE officials  directed FE to negotiate with the Alliance new cost sharing arrangements  under the cooperative agreement, which was scheduled for continuation  in June 2008. The Alliance agreed to meet to renegotiate the terms of the  cooperative agreement. Over the course of several meetings, the parties  discussed various funding scenarios and exchanged proposed term sheets.  Subsequently, however, the Alliance and DOE did not reach agreement. In  December 2007, the Alliance sent a letter to DOE stating that it preferred  to proceed under the existing cooperative agreement until FutureGen\u2019s  costs and risks could be assessed with input from the preliminary design  report and cost estimate that were due by June 2008.", "Also in December 2007, the Secretary of Energy briefed senior presidential  advisers that the estimated cost of FutureGen had nearly doubled\u2014from  $950 million to $1.8 billion\u2014and that costs were expected to continue  rising. In addition, according to the briefing documents, DOE planned to  end its partnership with the Alliance and was developing a new strategy  for FutureGen that would cap the government\u2019s financial exposure. The  briefing documents explained that DOE\u2019s new approach for FutureGen  would fund only the CCS-related technology associated with multiple  commercial IGCC plants, rather than the entire construction of a single  plant with CCS. Around this time, according to DOE officials, senior DOE  officials directed FE to develop the restructured FutureGen program. In  response, these officials told us, many high-level offices within DOE  collaborated on developing a draft strategic planning document for the  restructured program. According to these officials, the draft strategic  planning document that they finalized in January 2008 was the first  complete document about the restructured FutureGen. On January 30,  2008, DOE publicly announced that it was restructuring FutureGen to  provide a ceiling on federal contributions and that the restructured  program was a more cost-effective approach. On this same day, DOE  notified the Alliance that it was restructuring FutureGen and would not  continue its cooperative agreement with the Alliance. DOE informed the  Alliance that it was restructuring FutureGen in response to serious  concerns over substantial escalation in projected costs, including what the  agency concluded would be the likely continued escalation of the costs.  DOE officials also stated that they disapproved of the Alliance\u2019s decision  to announce the selection of a project site before DOE issued its NEPA  Record of Decision. According to DOE, prior to the site selection  announcement and without knowledge of the Alliance\u2019s choice of site,  DOE had asked the Alliance not to go forward with the announcement and  further advised the Alliance against making an announcement until the  Record of Decision had been issued. DOE officials also said that, in their  negotiations on measures that could limit DOE\u2019s financial exposure, they  lost confidence in the ability of the Alliance to fund its share of the project  cost.", "Although comparing cost estimates can provide valuable insight about the  impact of escalating costs on a project, DOE based its decision to  restructure FutureGen, in large part, on a comparison of cost estimates  that were not actually comparable. That is, in 2004, DOE had estimated  that the cost of the original FutureGen would be $950 million in constant  2004 dollars. In contrast, the Alliance\u2019s 2007 estimate of about $1.8 billion  was in current dollars, which reflected inflation over the course of the  program from 2005 through 2017. In explaining his decision to restructure  FutureGen to senior presidential advisers, the Secretary of Energy  indicated that the projected program costs had \u201cnearly doubled,\u201d from  $950 million to $1.8 billion. However, comparing constant dollars, which  exclude inflation, with current dollars, which reflect inflation, is  misleading. Our calculations show that the Alliance\u2019s current dollar  estimate of roughly $1.8 billion is equivalent to approximately $1.3 billion  in constant 2005 dollars\u2014an increase in total program costs of about $370  million, or about 39 percent\u2014not a near doubling of costs.", "In addition, the cost estimates by DOE and the Alliance were prepared  early in the project and, as a result, were based on conceptual designs for  FutureGen, including power plant case studies and a blanket 10 percent  increase incorporated into the Alliance\u2019s estimate to allow for the first-of- a-kind nature of some of the plant\u2019s components and integration issues.  However, neither estimate considered costs for specific types of  technology or a specific location. If DOE had waited approximately 6  months for the Alliance\u2019s technology-specific and site-specific cost  estimate, due by June 2008 as part of its preliminary design report, before  deciding whether to restructure the program, it would have had the benefit  of more current and complete information, including the latest  information on escalating costs, when making decisions about how to  move forward with FutureGen. In addition, regarding FutureGen\u2019s total  cost, the March 2007 cooperative agreement stated that DOE and the  Alliance recognized that many uncertainties\u2014such as plant design, site  selection, and market conditions\u2014still existed in developing a firm cost  estimate.", "In May 2008, the Secretary of Energy testified before Congress that  FutureGen was conceived as a $950 million venture and that its estimated  cost had increased to roughly $1.8 billion; however, the Secretary\u2019s  prepared statement did not indicate that the first estimate was in constant  dollars, while the second was in current dollars. The Secretary also  testified that DOE believed its costs would continue to escalate. We  requested that DOE provide us with the analysis that supported DOE\u2019s  anticipated escalation. In October 2008, DOE officials told us that the  ongoing cost escalations were unprecedented and that they had looked  internally across various indexes, including the Bureau of Labor Statistics,  to get a sense of prospective escalation. However, they stated that they did  not have any written or comprehensive analysis. They added that they did  not prepare a position paper, study, or generate any analysis examining  current or future escalation for the decision to restructure FutureGen.  Moreover, economic forecasting organizations, such as DOE\u2019s Energy  Information Administration, have found that significant cost escalations,  such as those for building power plants over the past several years, do not  typically continue in the long run."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "A Comprehensive Analysis Could Have Helped DOE Determine How the Costs, Benefits, and Risks of the Restructured FutureGen Compared with Those of Other Options", "paragraphs": ["DOE did not prepare a comprehensive analysis comparing the relative  costs, benefits, and risks of the original and restructured FutureGen  programs before making the decision to replace the original program with  the restructured FutureGen. On two different occasions, DOE officials told  us that the agency did not prepare such an analysis. These officials told us  that the Secretary of Energy\u2019s May 2008 congressional testimony included  the agency\u2019s official explanation for why it decided to restructure  FutureGen. In September 2008, we asked DOE to provide us with  additional information, including the agency\u2019s official position on why it  decided to restructure FutureGen, all the factors upon which DOE based  the decision, the extent to which the decision was based on documented  supporting analysis, and a copy of any such analysis. In January 2009, after  we sent a draft of this report to DOE for review and comment, DOE  responded to our request for additional information, stating that the  detailed analysis supporting its decision to restructure FutureGen could be  found in the draft strategic planning document for the restructured  program and that this document discussed the factors considered by DOE  in making the decision to restructure FutureGen. However, as previously  discussed in our findings, the draft strategic planning document was not  completed in time to inform the decision to restructure FutureGen. In  addition, we do not consider the draft strategic planning document to be  comprehensive because it did not assess:    1.  whether costs for the original FutureGen would escalate substantially  2.  the relative costs, benefits, and risks for all of the types of plants for  which the restructured FutureGen was eligible to receive proposals,  such as conventional pulverized-coal and oxyfuel combustion plants,  but only contemplated proposals for IGCC plants; 3.  the risk that industry respondents might not propose an IGCC plant for  4.  the risk that industry respondents might not propose enough viable  projects for the restructured FutureGen; 5.  the costs, benefits, and risks of making incremental changes to the  original FutureGen alongside the relative costs, benefits, and risks of  the restructured FutureGen; and  6.  any potential overlap between the restructured FutureGen and other  DOE programs.", "A comprehensive analysis could have supported DOE\u2019s decision making in  several ways. First, it could have helped DOE assess the risk that industry  respondents to DOE\u2019s request for applications under the restructured  FutureGen might not propose an IGCC plant. DOE received public  comments indicating that such an outcome was possible because IGCC is  not yet prevalent in the industry\u2014only two commercial IGCC plants  currently operate in the United States\u2014and other technologies may  provide better opportunities to meet the restructured program\u2019s  requirements, among other reasons. Applying CCS at existing,  conventional pulverized coal-fired plants is important because those  plants comprise almost all operating coal-fired plants in the United States  and abroad. However, according to DOE, IGCC plants integrated with CCS  are important for reducing CO emissions in the future. Both DOE\u2019s press  release announcing the restructured program and the updated draft  strategic planning document, dated July 1, 2008, that DOE provided  Congress indicated that the restructured program would include IGCC.  The funding announcement for the restructured FutureGen highlighted the  important contribution that an IGCC plant integrated with CCS would  make toward the nation\u2019s energy needs, such as providing continued fuel  diversity for generating electricity and mitigating dependence on more  expensive and less secure sources of energy. As late as May 2008, the  Secretary of Energy indicated in congressional testimony that the  restructured program would likely include IGCC, stating that advances in  technology and the market, in addition to regulatory uncertainty, would  provide incentives for industry to begin deploying commercial-scale IGCC  plants with CCS.", "In addition, a comprehensive analysis could have helped DOE assess the  risk that industry respondents might not propose enough viable projects  from which DOE could then assess and make multiple selections. Such an  analysis could also have helped DOE assess whether the new cost-share  arrangement would provide sufficient incentive for enough proposals to be  selective. In the draft planning documents and press release announcing  the restructured program, DOE stated that it restructured FutureGen, in  part, because market conditions had changed in such a way that DOE  could fund multiple industry projects and accomplish even more  widespread commercialization of CCS and related information sharing  across the industry than what would have been accomplished by the  Alliance\u2019s consortium of 11 coal producers and electric power companies.  However, DOE only received a small number of applications and some  proposed projects were outside the restructured FutureGen\u2019s scope. As a  result, widespread commercialization and information sharing seem less  likely than under the original program. DOE also asserted that the  restructured program would hasten the time frame for full-scale  commercial operation of CCS. However, even if DOE accepts all  applicable applications, the restructured program could implement CCS  sooner than the original program at only a few commercial sites rather  than, as stated before, on a more widespread and international scale.", "Finally, DOE also could have used a comprehensive analysis to help  compare the relative costs, benefits, and risks of the restructured  FutureGen with those of making incremental and other changes to the  original program in order to control or offset costs. For example, prior to  the decision to restructure FutureGen, FE identified and analyzed 13  options for changes to the original program, such as reducing the COrecommended or noted that DOE should be willing to consider several  options with potential savings from $30 million to $55 million each. Some  of these scenarios were broached during negotiations with the Alliance in  the fall of 2007."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["According to DOE, electric power industry, academic, and other officials  and experts, for the foreseeable future, coal, which is abundant and  relatively inexpensive, will remain a significant fuel for the generation of  electric power in the United States and the world. However, coal-fired  power plants are also a significant source of CO and other emissions  responsible for climate change. Hence, for at least the near-term, any  government policies that seriously address climate change will need to  have a goal of significantly reducing CO, and would accept technologies other than IGCC. The restructured  FutureGen left open the possibility of successfully applying CCS  technology to existing conventional, pulverized coal-fired power plants\u2014 an important goal in its own right, since those plants account for almost all  of the coal-fired generating capacity in the United States and abroad.  However, there are already existing programs to address CCS at existing  plants, and the decision to remove the FutureGen program\u2019s specific focus  on cutting edge technology (IGCC) at new plants was not well explained.", "In at least two ways, DOE\u2019s decision, which affected potentially up to $1.3  billion in federal funding, was not well considered. First, the decision was  made on the basis of a flawed comparison of life-cycle costs for the  original FutureGen, in that DOE compared an estimate of constant dollars  to an estimate of inflated dollars. Second, the decision was not based on a  systematic and comprehensive comparison of the costs, benefits, and risks  of the original FutureGen versus the restructured FutureGen. An  expanded analysis of the costs, benefits, and risks of the original  FutureGen compared with a range of modifications to the program could  have included incremental changes to the original FutureGen program that  could have preserved some of its original goals and benefits while  mitigating costs. Such an analysis might also have detailed the risk that  DOE would receive only a small number of applications and that those  applications might not include IGCC. The analysis could also have  considered whether DOE\u2019s $1.3 billion contribution for total program  funding presents the best option for advancing the overall goals of CCS in  both existing and future plants."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To help ensure that important decisions about the FutureGen program  reflect an adequate knowledge of the potential costs, benefits, and risks of  viable options, and to promote the attainment of the goals of the program  while protecting taxpayer interests, we are making the following two  recommendations to the Secretary of Energy:  1.  Before implementing significant changes to FutureGen or before  obligating additional funds for such purposes, the Secretary of Energy  should direct DOE staff to prepare a comprehensive analysis that  compares the relative costs, benefits, and risks of a range of options  that includes (1) the original FutureGen program, (2) incremental  changes to the original program, and (3) the restructured FutureGen  program.  2.
