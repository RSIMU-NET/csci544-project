Responding to calls for restructuring, by 1995 DOE initiated \u201cunprecedented\u201d reforms that it said would \u201cfundamentally improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the department.\u201d", "Created in 1977 from diverse agencies, DOE manages the nation\u2019s nuclear weapons production complex, cleans up the environmental legacy from the production of nuclear weapons, and conducts research and development on both energy and basic science. The relative emphasis given to these missions has changed over time. Early emphasis by the department on research and initiatives to cope with the global energy crisis quickly shifted to accelerated nuclear weapons production. However, by the late 1980s, DOE funding priorities again shifted to cleaning up the legacy of waste generated by the weapons complex, and this work remains DOE\u2019s largest budget category. Since then, DOE has placed increased emphasis on basic scientific research. DOE also has a role in helping to ensure the security of the nation\u2019s energy infrastructure. The result is a department with complex and diverse missions. These diverse missions are largely implemented by contractors to carry out DOE\u2019s program and project activities at government-owned facilities and sites across the country. The department contracts out about 94 percent of its budget and has established an extensive network of field offices to directly oversee the work of these contractors and address other departmental responsibilities.", "Concerned about the progress that DOE has made to strengthen its management in recent years, you asked us to   describe actions taken by DOE to improve its performance in the early to   assess DOE progress since then in addressing management weaknesses and improving performance, and identify any underlying impediments to more effective management and improved performance at DOE.", "To address these objectives, among other steps, we examined more than 200 audits and reviews conducted since 1995 on various aspects of DOE\u2019s activities. These reviews, which are listed in appendix II, were conducted by DOE\u2019s Inspector General, internal and external ad-hoc bodies and consultants, and us.

Over the years, DOE\u2019s ability to effectively fulfill these responsibilities has been repeatedly questioned, with calls for dismantling the department reaching a highpoint in the mid-1990s. We concluded at the time that the Congress and the administration needed to rethink DOE\u2019s missions and structure."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Missions and Organization of DOE", "paragraphs": ["To foster a secure and reliable energy system that is environmentally and economically sustainable; to be a responsible steward of the Nation\u2019s nuclear weapons; to clean up the department\u2019s facilities; to lead in the physical sciences and advance the biological, environmental, and computational sciences; and to provide premier scientific instruments for the Nation\u2019s research enterprise.", "DOE groups these responsibilities into four \u201cbusiness lines,\u201d which DOE describes as follows:   Energy resources promotes the development and deployment of systems and practices that provide energy that is clean, efficient, reasonably priced, and reliable;   National nuclear security enhances national security through military application of nuclear technology and by reducing global danger from the potential spread of weapons of mass destruction;   Environmental quality cleans up the legacy of nuclear weapons and nuclear research activities, safely managing nuclear materials, and disposing of radioactive wastes; and   Science advances tools to provide the foundation for the department\u2019s applied missions and to provide remarkable insights into the physical and biological world.", "Supporting these mission-related business lines is a \u201ccorporate management\u201d function that constitutes a fifth \u201cbusiness line.\u201d This function includes putting in place an effective organizational structure; efficient management practices and information systems; procedures to ensure the safety and health of the department\u2019s workforce and the public, and to protect the environment; and practices to ensure accountability to the public. According to DOE, \u201cthe department\u2019s success within its diverse portfolio of programs is largely dependent upon a strong and sound corporate management function.\u201d", "DOE\u2019s budget priorities have gradually shifted over the years from energy policy to defense and now environmental cleanup. In fiscal year 2000, the environmental quality business line was the department\u2019s largest budget category, accounting for approximately 34 percent (about $6.7 billion) of its $19.7 billion budget. National nuclear security follows, with 25 percent of the budget (about $5 billion). Science is allotted 16 percent of the budget (about $3.2 billion), and energy resources, the original responsibility of the department, accounts for 13 percent of the budget (about $2.5 billion).", "DOE has a workforce of almost 16,000 employees and over 100,000 contractor staff located at over 50 major installations in 35 states. Crucial to DOE\u2019s missions and performance are its 22 laboratories, 11 of which are responsible for multiple programs. Although each of these 11 multiprogram laboratories conducts work in every DOE business line,  3 concentrate on national security issues, 5 on basic science, 2 on environment, and 1 on energy. DOE\u2019s other laboratories are program- specific. The budgets for all 22 laboratories total nearly $8 billion annually.", "DOE has a complex structure to manage its diverse missions. All staff and support offices at headquarters report to the Secretary of Energy and a deputy secretary, who serves as the chief operating officer. Below them are two under secretaries: one for national nuclear security, who is also the Administrator of the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), and the other for the energy, science, and environmental missions. A variety of deputy administrators, directors, and assistant secretaries are subordinate to the two under secretaries and oversee individual program areas. DOE has an extensive set of field offices, which are responsible for overseeing contractor performance. The field offices include 11 \u201coperations\u201d offices and several smaller, affiliated \u201carea\u201d and \u201csite\u201d offices, which are usually located at contractor sites. For example, DOE has an area office in the Los Alamos National Laboratory that reports to an operations office in Albuquerque, New Mexico. DOE also has other field offices affiliated with the energy resources business line.", "Contractors manage and operate DOE\u2019s facilities and sites under the supervision of department employees. Given that DOE spends most of its budget through these contractors, the ability of DOE to direct, oversee, and hold accountable its contractors is crucial for its mission success and overall effectiveness. DOE\u2019s contracting practices are rooted in the development of the atomic bomb under the Manhattan Project during World War II. Special contracting arrangements were developed by DOE\u2019s predecessor agencies, with participating industry and academic organizations, to reimburse all of the contractors\u2019 costs and to indemnify contractors against any liability they might incur. Most of the current contractors are for-profit companies that receive incentives for meeting certain performance objectives. Several large contractors, however, are nonprofit institutions, such as the University of California, which typically operate research institutions for DOE. Some of these nonprofit contractors also have financial incentives for achieving certain DOE goals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GAO\u2019s Call for a New Assessment of DOE", "paragraphs": ["In August 1995 we reported that a fundamental reevaluation of DOE was warranted, based on prior reviews by us, DOE\u2019s Inspector General and other experts, and our survey of experts. All of these reviews identified serious management weaknesses at the department. Our report was neither the first nor the last to recommend rethinking the department\u2019s structure and mission responsibilities.", "Our August 1995 report said that DOE had gone through many evolutionary changes since its creation, in part resulting from shifts in priority among its diverse responsibilities. We concluded that even though the department had embarked on some major restructuring, in line with government-wide initiatives to reduce the federal workforce and become more results-oriented, there was no assurance that these reforms would fundamentally alter and improve the ways that DOE managed its missions. We noted that attempting to resolve management weaknesses without first evaluating and achieving consensus on missions was a risky approach to restructuring the department.", "Overwhelmingly, our survey of experts concurred that DOE must change. While there was general consensus that DOE should retain and concentrate on essential energy activities, opinions differed on where to place other departmental responsibilities. Most experts considered moving the weapons-related and environmental cleanup responsibilities to other federal agencies and creating a new organizational structure for the national laboratories, such as sharing them among federal agencies or, in some cases, privatizing them. We concluded that the ultimate structure of each mission should be determined by the option that encouraged the most cost-effective practices, attracted necessary technical talent, provided ample flexibility to react to changing conditions, and exhibited the highest degree of accountability."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOE Initiated Major Reforms in the 1990s", "paragraphs": ["In the early to mid-1990s, newly appointed Energy Secretary Hazel O\u2019Leary initiated many reforms to address long-standing criticisms of how DOE conducted its business. As part of this process, DOE commissioned various study groups and panels to make recommendations intended to fundamentally improve the department\u2019s efficiency and effectiveness. Based on these recommendations, DOE launched a series of reforms to realign and downsize the agency, as well as address structural weaknesses and improve its management and oversight of contractors. Many of these reforms achieved their immediate objectives.", "In 1993, DOE launched an internal initiative to improve safety and awareness of good practices throughout all aspects of the department\u2019s work. The initiative included more attention to risk reduction, improving the qualifications of the workforce, organizational realignment, and moving to external regulation of facilities. In particular, outside reviewers and DOE\u2019s own senior managers questioned the continued justification for the department\u2019s self-regulation of its contractor operated facilities, given that virtually all other federal facilities are externally regulated (including some DOE facilities). In 1994, while legislation was proposed and the Congress held hearings to assess the proposal to move to external regulation, no action was taken. A year later, a DOE advisory committee concluded that secrecy had been used as a shield to deflect public scrutiny of safety and health problems at these facilities, and that the widespread environmental contamination at some facilities was clear evidence that self-regulation had failed.", "Also in 1993, the Energy Secretary told the Congress that DOE was not adequately in control of its major facility and site contracts and, therefore, \u201cnot in a position to ensure effective and efficient expenditures of taxpayer dollars.\u201d To improve this condition, the Secretary created the Contract Reform Team. (We had previously designated DOE contracting practices as high risk, making the department vulnerable to waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement. It remains on our high risk list today.) DOE\u2019s contract reform team made more than 45 recommendations, including a call for strengthening financial information systems, using performance- based contracts, and including performance criteria and incentives in contracts. One significant recommendation urged DOE to shift from making noncompetitive contract awards to adopting a full and open competitive process.", "DOE also commissioned two special task forces in 1993 to examine the quality and effectiveness of the department\u2019s laboratories and the management of its energy research and development (R&D) mission. The Secretary of Energy Advisory Board chartered The Task Force on Alternative Futures for the Department of Energy National Laboratories, chaired by a former chairman of the Motorola Corporation, Robert Galvin, to look at the laboratories. The task force\u2019s final report, issued in February 1995, concluded that DOE\u2019s laboratories were in \u201cserious jeopardy, owing to patterns of management and organization that have grown in complexity, cost, and intrusiveness over a long period.\u201d  The report called for a more disciplined research focus by the national laboratories and recommended improvements in DOE management of these facilities, including moving to an independent management structure resembling a government corporation. In response, DOE created the Laboratory Operations Board, an advisory group whose purpose was to provide dedicated management attention to laboratory issues.", "The Secretary chartered The Task Force on Strategic Energy Research and Development, chaired by energy analyst Daniel Yergin, to examine DOE\u2019s energy resources business line. The June 1995 report of this task force assessed the rationale for the federal government\u2019s support of energy R&D, reviewed the priorities and management of the overall program, and recommended ways to make it more efficient and effective. The task force recommended that DOE streamline its R&D management, develop a strategic plan for energy R&D, eliminate duplicative laboratory programs and research projects, and reorganize and consolidate the many dispersed R&D programs at DOE laboratories.", "The Galvin and Yergin reports led to many changes in how DOE interacts with its contractors, including a streamlining of departmental orders and procedures.", "In addition to these improvement efforts, DOE also established a strategic alignment initiative in the fall of 1994, following the results of its extensive strategic planning process. The strategic plan was developed based on the principles of \u201ctotal quality management\u201d and the desire to increase \u201cstakeholder\u201d participation in decision-making. Under this plan, the department organized itself by \u201cbusiness lines\u201d that were essentially the same as they are today. The first phase of the strategic alignment initiative was employee driven and aimed to identify better, more cost-effective means of performing the core missions of the department as defined in the strategic plan. In May 1995, DOE announced its plan to achieve $1.7 billion in savings over the next 5 years by reducing overhead costs; closing or consolidating field offices; realigning the organizational structure; reducing federal employment; and initiating the delegation of some departmental responsibilities to the private sector (referred to as \u201cprivatization\u201d). A portion of the overhead cost savings was to come from externally regulating environment, safety, and health activities; reforming contracting practices; and streamlining departmental oversight. In August 1995, DOE released the specifics of 45 implementation plans, developed in the second phase of the initiative, to guide the cost-saving efforts and improve the department\u2019s performance and accountability.", "DOE officials were well aware of the criticism aimed at their department in the early 1990s. While maintaining that their own initiatives could transform the department, DOE officials also recognized that others were calling for more radical changes, ranging from organizing the national laboratories under a corporate structure to completely dismantling the department. DOE officials stated in response to our August 1995 report that while there is \u201cno assurance DOE\u2019s initiatives will succeed, we know that no alternative approach can provide that assurance either.\u201d The department continued to assert that its reforms, unprecedented in its history, would transform the department into a \u201cpositive model of organizational change and effectiveness.\u201d According to the Deputy Secretary at the time, the department\u2019s initiative promised to \u201cfundamentally alter how we  look and how we conduct business\u2026.\u201d"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Unresolved Management Weaknesses Contribute to Performance Problems", "paragraphs": ["Unresolved management weaknesses have led to recurring performance problems within DOE.

However, the department has not been able to use its strategic plan and other corporate management tools, such as a department-wide information system, to organize and integrate its missions. According to DOE, its strategic plan is a composite of plans guiding the activities of its major programs within the four business lines. This approach has created some management problems that have been identified in our past reports, in particular:   Disconnects exist between the current strategic \u201cbusiness lines\u201d and the way the department is actually organized. While DOE\u2019s strategic goals and objectives are stated within the context of the business lines, the department is organized and managed by its multiple programs. In some cases, several programs contribute to the same business line without any apparent integration. While we have called on DOE to rectify this misalignment, it has not done so. DOE has asserted that its structure is affected by external factors and that no single alignment will yield an organization that eliminates crosscutting objectives. DOE told us that it has therefore organized itself around budget decision units and set program performance measures that are linked to each strategic plan business line.", "Shortcomings persist in program planning and priority setting, as well as in the use of strategic goals and measures to describe specific activities. For example, we could not determine from DOE\u2019s 1999 and 2000 accountability and performance reports what the department was trying to accomplish. We also noted that DOE had not corrected the problems in its strategic goals and measures that we identified 2 years ago. According to DOE, changes were made in the FY 2001 Annual Performance Plans to track accomplishments by budget decision units rather than the strategic plan.", "DOE has not been able to develop a single strategic plan that integrates its vast laboratory network. The laboratories, particularly the multiprogram ones, operate largely as separate entities. DOE has no central program control over the laboratories, but has instead required that each report to a lead headquarters program office since 1999. Integration into the strategic plan is supposed to occur through the interests of the headquarters offices, even though the major laboratories conduct work in all business lines.   DOE does not have an integrating management information system to consolidate its business, organizational, and operational information throughout the department. In the absence of such an integrating system, mission and program areas have developed their own systems and procedures. A September 2000 DOE Office of Inspector General report noted that duplicative systems existed or were under development at virtually all organizational levels within the department. DOE has acknowledged that a significant barrier to greater departmental integration of information systems has been the Chief Information Officer\u2019s lack of control and influence over the program budgeting processes.", "Problems continue with the validity and verifiability of the data used by the information systems to provide a baseline from which to track performance across many parts of the department."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Roles and Responsibilities Remain Unclear", "paragraphs": ["Since 1995, there have been a number of attempts to clarify roles and responsibilities between headquarters and field staffs to improve lines of authority and accountability. A resolution for this management issue has been elusive because of the way DOE oversees its contractors. Typically, field office managers sign contracts and rate contractors on their performance, but direction on programs or project work comes from the headquarters program offices. Additionally, at least in the past, headquarters staff offices have been allowed to give direct orders to field offices outside of the formal chain of command. The reports that we reviewed frequently cited problems with such intermingled roles and responsibilities.", "A 1997 study by the Institute for Defense Analyses revealed that the coordination between DOE programs is an \u201cundisciplined, uncoordinated, essentially ad hoc process between the field managers and each of the program assistant secretaries.\u201d The institute concluded that there was no assurance that resource decisions are weighed against each other in a complete and consistent manner.", "A 1999 Panel to Assess the Reliability, Safety and Security of the United States Nuclear Stockpile reported that DOE suffered from a diffusion of functional responsibilities across a range of staff and line organizations that has led to clouded lines of authority and blurred responsibilities and accountability. In 1999, the President\u2019s Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board reported that DOE\u2019s \u201cdecentralized structure, confusing matrix of cross cutting and overlapping management, and shoddy record of accountability has advanced scientific and technological progress, but at the cost of an abominable record of security.\u2026\u201d The board labeled DOE\u2019s organization as a \u201cdysfunctional\u201d structure that has too often resulted in mismanagement of security in weapons-related activities and in a lack of emphasis on counterintelligence. The board concluded that \u201cfor the past two decades, the Department of Energy had embodied science at its best and security at its worst.\u201d", "A 1999 National Research Council review of DOE\u2019s project management problems found that DOE\u2019s \u201corganizational structure makes it much more difficult to carry out projects than in comparable private and public sector organizations.\u201d The council noted that by operating as an aggregate of independent agencies amid various program and field operations offices, DOE had failed to benefit from economies of scale. In 1999 and 2000, we attributed problems at DOE\u2019s Spallation Neutron Source project under construction in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and at DOE\u2019s National Ignition Facility being built in Livermore, California, to, among other problems, DOE\u2019s complex management and organizational structure and unclear lines of authority.", "A March 2000 National Academy of Public Administration report on DOE\u2019s Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Office found that the office had suffered from unclear roles and responsibilities among various organizational levels. The Academy noted that there are \u201csignificant differences in  understanding of the roles and responsibilities for program and project management.\u201d", "Recognizing these problems, DOE has changed reporting relationships between headquarters and field offices in an attempt to clarify lines of authority and to strengthen accountability. The latest major realignment occurred in 1999 with the assigning of field offices to lead program secretarial offices at headquarters. In addition, a Field Management Council was established to coordinate the direction given to the field by program and support offices. DOE\u2019s field offices now report to whichever headquarters program office provides the most funding to the contractor sites overseen by the field managers\u2014an approach used without success in the past. This realignment had to be modified slightly in late 2000 to accommodate the establishment of NNSA. The current reporting arrangement, however, has given rise to some new management problems. We found, for example, that there is considerable uncertainty about reporting relationships in situations where many different headquarters programs support activities at shared facilities and complexes. This problem is particularly acute at DOE\u2019s multiprogram national security laboratories, where work is conducted on all of DOE\u2019s missions, yet field management must report only to NNSA headquarters. Thus, non-NNSA program staff in headquarters must work through NNSA management in the field to accomplish work related to the science and environmental missions. Conversely, some NNSA staff members work in field offices that report to headquarters programs in science or environmental management, even though they can receive direction only from NNSA. Various memorandums of agreement have been created to sort out these arrangements and to provide support services across business lines. However, staff in some field offices that we visited told us that they are unsure how the new reporting relationships will work.", "The establishment of NNSA has yet to clarify roles and responsibilities within the nuclear security business line and may have exacerbated reporting relationships, at least temporarily. In early 2001, we and the Panel to Assess the Reliability, Safety and Security of the United States Nuclear Stockpile challenged NNSA to develop a plan for fundamentally redefining roles and responsibilities among its headquartered and field organizational units. The panel called on NNSA to \u201cclarify functional authority, reduce management layers, eliminate micromanagement [of the laboratories], and downsize.\u201d As late as April 2001, we found that NNSA had not specified the roles and responsibilities of each of the headquarters offices; the relationship between the headquarters and the field offices; whether headquarters or field offices will direct and oversee contractors; and the relationship between the NNSA staff and the rest of DOE. In NNSA\u2019s May 2001 interim report, the administration stated that it intended to seek expert advice on clarifying relationships between headquarters and the field, as well as on other issues in preparation for an October 2001 status report to the Congress. On June 26, 2001, in testimony before the House Armed Services Committee, the chairman of the Panel to Assess the Reliability, Safety and Security of the United States Nuclear Stockpile noted that \u201csome of the more fundamental management problems [with DOE] still remain to be addressed.\u201d"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Lack of Qualified Staff Has Impeded Effective Contractor Oversight", "paragraphs": ["Lack of technically qualified staff within DOE is another long-standing management weakness that has been linked to performance problems. We have raised concerns about this weakness since 1991, and many other external reviewers have echoed these concerns since then. For example, a 1997 report by the Institute for Defense Analyses pointed out deficiencies in the technical capabilities of those DOE managers who had survived departmental downsizing. In addition, the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board warned in 1997 that, given likely future reductions in DOE\u2019s budget, the department needed to make advance preparations to avert the loss of technically competent safety personnel.", "Responding to these and other concerns, the department announced a new Workforce for the 21st Century Initiative to strengthen technical and management capabilities for its mission requirements. In particular, a 1998 internal DOE study confirmed the need to develop programs to address workforce management weaknesses in the procurement environment, such as recruitment, retention, and succession planning. However, despite these actions, additional internal and external reports that followed have raised concerns about the qualifications of DOE\u2019s workforce.", "We reported in 1999 that while the Spallation Neutron Source project appeared to be on schedule, it had already exhibited warning signs of failure because it lacked personnel with technical skills and managerial experience. In 1999, the Commission on Maintaining United States Nuclear Weapons Expertise found that DOE\u2019s aging workforce, the tight market for talent, the lack of a long-term hiring plan, and other constraints had raised serious doubts that the department would be able to maintain its nuclear weapons expertise in the future. In 1999, the National Research Council found that DOE did not have \u201cthe necessary experience, knowledge, skills, procedures or abilities to prepare good performance measures\u201d for its contracts.", "In its fiscal year 2001 Annual Performance Plan, the department stated that it had \u201cfully addressed\u201d the lack of technical and management skills by establishing a Corporate Education, Training and Development Plan in fiscal year 1999. DOE pointed out that it had training programs in place for procurement professionals, property managers, and information management specialists, and that it was establishing a new program to rebuild a talented and well-trained corps of R&D technical program managers. In particular, DOE reported in March 2000 that it had initiated a program to develop future leaders of the acquisition workforce. The Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board\u2019s 2000 report credited DOE with taking steps to improve the technical capabilities of personnel at its defense nuclear facilities, but pointed out the need for DOE\u2019s leadership to pay increased attention to this issue and to follow through with its improvement plan. Notwithstanding these efforts, the department has now acknowledged that its workforce weaknesses represent a much broader challenge encompassing the larger arena of human capital management.", "In commenting on a draft of this report, DOE said it had additional efforts in workforce restructuring.

For example, DOE has increased competition, imposed greater contractor liability, phased in performance-based incentives, and begun using results-oriented statements of work. According to DOE, 26 of its 37 major site and facility management contracts have now been competed, up from just 3 prior to 1994. All of these new contracts employ performance-based techniques in defining contractor requirements, evaluating performance, and linking financial incentives to results. In addition, according to DOE, there has been an overhaul and standardization of contract regulations and the issuance of guidance on proper contract administration. Nonetheless, the department has been criticized for not fully implementing its contract reforms, as noted in several reports.", "In an October 1997 report, DOE\u2019s Inspector General reported problems with performance-based contracting at DOE\u2019s Nevada Operations Office. The report found that performance-measurement milestones had been estimated after the work had actually been completed. In addition, performance measures associated with this aspect of the contract were vague, leading DOE to reward performance that could not be objectively validated. In May 1999, we reported that while DOE laboratory contracts we examined had some performance-based features, there was a wide variance in the number of performance measures and the types of fees negotiated. We also found that DOE had not determined whether giving higher fees to encourage superior performance by laboratory contractors is advantageous to the government.", "The National Research Council\u2019s 1999 report concluded that DOE has had limited success in establishing and managing performance-based contracts. In its 2001 follow-up report, the Council noted that DOE has yet to devise and implement either a contract performance measurement system or an information system that can track contracts and contractor performance while cycling information back into key decisions.", "DOE\u2019s Inspector General reported in April 2000 that performance-based incentives in the contract for DOE\u2019s Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory had not been fully successful in improving performance and reducing costs. For some incentives, performance declined or remained unchanged. For other incentives, performance improved, but the gains were overstated, the contractor was compensated twice, improvements either could not be linked directly to actions taken by the contractor during the incentive period or were made for a disproportionately high fee, and the contractor could not demonstrate any reduction in cost.", "DOE\u2019s Inspector General has also identified other areas where contract reforms have not been fully implemented, including the following:   A November 1998 audit determined that 16 of DOE\u2019s 20 major for-profit operating contracts did not incorporate liabilities provisions called for under contract reform.", "A December 1999 audit concluded that the department\u2019s award procedure \u201ceffectively circumvented federal requirements designed to promote and ensure the appropriate use of competition in contracting.\u201d", "A January 2000 audit of outsourcing opportunities at the Los Alamos National Laboratory determined that although the laboratory contractor found that only 4 of 184 support services could potentially be obtained at lower cost from outside entities, in fact at least 128 had outsourcing potential.", "A February 2000 audit found that only one of the four contractors reviewed had fully met a requirement to prepare \u201cmake-or-buy\u201d plans to obtain supplies and services on a least-cost basis.", "A January 2000 summary report on management challenges facing DOE pointed out that while incentives have been included in most contracts, reviews show systemic weaknesses in the way these incentives have been administered. Incentive fees have risen dramatically, but there has been no commensurate increase in financial risk to DOE\u2019s major contractors.", "DOE has also struggled to effectively implement its privatization program, which is intended to keep the department\u2019s environmental cleanup projects on schedule at budgeted costs. For example, the cleanup contracts were terminated at two noteworthy privatization projects\u2014the Hanford tank-waste project and the Idaho Pit 9 cleanup project\u2014because of concerns with rapidly escalating costs and the contractor performance.", "Finally, while DOE has increased the number of major site and facility contracts that it awards competitively, several major contracts have not been, including nine contracts with a combined value of $22 billion.

For example, some mission areas retain strong central control over their programmatic actions, as in the science area, while others delegate more of this responsibility to the field, as in the environmental area. Uncoordinated and inconsistent direction from program headquarters offices still places the burden of effectively integrating varying goals, objectives, and management styles on the field managers who must manage this diversity at shared facilities.", "The National Research Council\u2019s 1999 report on DOE project management noted that \u201ccultures, attitudes and organizational commitments have shaped service delivery, and as DOE\u2019s missions changed in response to external conditions, the diversity of cultures inherited by the department\u2019s collection of agencies did not necessarily change with it.\u201d This diversity of mission cultures under one roof has long prevented DOE from developing a consistent approach in its systems, structures, and interactions with contractors. For example, DOE\u2019s national security programs have a long history of operating in secret, which leads to practices that are quite different from DOE\u2019s science programs, which are more open and flexible\u2014yet these programs operate at shared facilities. This clustering of diverse programs has complicated lines of authority, thus diluting accountability among staff, and has impeded DOE\u2019s ability to oversee contractors.", "It has been difficult for DOE to meet all the priorities of its mission programs and the requirements of the department staff offices. For example, more management attention has sometimes been given to DOE contractors meeting nuclear weapons program goals than to operating safely and in an environmentally responsible manner.

DOE\u2019s contract with Los Alamos contained few incentives for controlling classified material but many rewards for high quality science work\u2014yet this work was taking place in a top-secret laboratory, whose primary mission is designing nuclear weapons.

Years of tinkering with reporting relationships between the offices that have a role in national nuclear security and the laboratories where most weapons-related work is performed have not yielded many positive results. For example, the Special Investigative Panel of the President\u2019s Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board noted in its 1999 report that \u201cconvoluted, confusing, and often contradictory reporting channels have made the relationships between DOE headquarters and the laboratories, in particular, tense, internecine, and chaotic.\u201d In addition, the panel found that much of the confusion centered on the role and power of the field offices.

According to DOE, the purpose of this review is to focus the department on activities that best support its \"overarching national security mission.\" DOE also listed several other steps that it said will help clarify roles and responsibilities, streamline its organizational structure, and instill stronger accountability among federal and contractor staff.  Further, DOE said it has launched initiatives to \"determine why previously identified problems have not been addressed.\" Finally, the department said that the sum of its ongoing initiatives should enable it to \"achieve the spirit\" of our recommendations to improve mission, structure, and accountability.", "DOE's many initiatives, if fully implemented, address several management challenges that have long plagued the department. However, while it is too early to assess the effectiveness of these initiatives, we are concerned that they may not adequately address the root causes of DOE\u2019s recurring performance problems, particularly those related to the department's diverse missions. For example, while we applaud the Secretary's efforts to provide a strategic focus to guide all program activities, it is unclear how a \u201cnational security\u201d mission can subsume each of DOE\u2019s highly diverse programs in science, environmental quality, and energy resources. Developing measurable national security objectives for environmental management, DOE\u2019s largest budget category, will be particularly challenging.", "Also, it appears that DOE's \"strategic mission review\" assumes that each of its many missions is still best managed by the department. As we noted in our report, many of DOE's structure and accountability problems stem from the nearly impossible task of managing diverse (and sometime conflicting cultures) within a common field structure.  The role and responsibility problems that result from this condition will likely persist, absent a comprehensive evaluation of how and where best to manage each mission.  The creation of NNSA was an attempt to resolve some of these issues internally, but the effectiveness of its management structure and associated processes is still highly uncertain.  In particular, DOE has still not clearly defined roles and responsibilities for NNSA\u2019s headquarters and field units or relationships with the rest of the department.  DOE's task of developing an integrated department is made more difficult by an expanding mission emphasis on safeguarding energy infrastructure and enhancing homeland defense against terrorist threats.  We believe that with these new mission emphases and the persistent questions about how NNSA will operate relative to other DOE programs, it is more important than ever for a strategic mission review to focus on determining whether some missions would be managed better if located elsewhere, combined with other agencies, or privatized.  As we explained in our report, a comprehensive mission assessment would require the Secretary to consult with the Office of Management and Budget and other federal agencies that might gain or lose missions if DOE were restructured.", "Many of the organizational changes cited by DOE are positive steps, such as clarifying the roles of the deputy and undersecretary, and creating a Field Management Council to facilitate cooperation among the department\u2019s diverse programs.  However, past experience has shown that such process changes have merely tinkered with a flawed structure. Without a serious effort to consider each mission for its proper placement in or out of DOE, the structural problems that have clouded roles and responsibilities will likely persist. Therefore, we reaffirm our recommendation that DOE develop a strategy for realigning its missions, followed by a proposal to the Congress.", "Finally, while DOE cited numerous initiatives to strengthen accountability, it is too early to judge whether these and other efforts adequately address our recommendation in this area.

Our response is included in the body of the report. 2.", "In our report, we acknowledge and support DOE\u2019s efforts to implement performance-based contracting practices and to competitively award more of its contracts.  As suggested, we have revised our report to note that the department has not been required to compete contracts to manage its Federally Funded Research and Development Centers. 3.  As we state in our report, our concern is that some of DOE's largest contracts, notably those with the University of California to manage several national laboratories, have never been opened to competitive bidding.  According to DOE, the decisions related to the most recent contract extension with this university were based on \"national security considerations \" and were not \"contract management decisions \u2026\" The benefits of competing contracts are widely accepted and espoused by DOE in its own policies.  Recent interest shown by another university in competing for the Sandia National Laboratory contract when it expires in 2003 suggests that there may be other capable competitors, and that national security considerations do not inhibit DOE from attracting new performers. 4.  We agree that DOE sponsors many \"unique\" projects that contain significant research and development that can impact cost and schedule assumptions, and we have incorporated this comment in our report.  Nevertheless, we concur with DOE that this circumstance should not be used as \"an excuse for the poor performance in project management\" that was cited in our report. 5.  We do not concur with DOE that the department\u2019s strategic planning process has worked effectively to organize and integrate its diverse missions.  As we said in our report, DOE told us that its strategic plan is a composite of plans that guides the program activities of the department's four \"business lines,\" each of which establishes its own objectives and management systems.  Acknowledging the unfocused nature of the department, the Secretary is just now taking steps to define an overarching departmental objective for all programs and to expand NNSA\u2019s new Planning, Programming, Budgeting and Evaluation system department-wide.  He is also creating a new office under the Chief Financial Officer that \"will analyze and evaluate plans, programs and budgets in relation to the department's objectives\u2026\" The department said that it expects this office will serve as the \"linchpin\" for making improvements in strategic planning in the future. 6.  We reported in 1998 that DOE's Strategic Laboratory Missions plan, which was published in 1996, was essentially a descriptive summary of current laboratory activities; it did not direct change.  Nor did the plan tie DOE's or the laboratories' missions to the annual budget process. As we previously reported, when we asked laboratory officials about strategic planning, most discussed their own planning capabilities, and some laboratories provided us with their own self-generated strategic planning documents.  None of the officials at the multiprogram laboratories we visited at the time mentioned DOE's Strategic Laboratory Missions plan as an essential document for their own strategic planning. 7.  We noted in our report that DOE is attempting to clarify roles and responsibilities.  We also noted that DOE's 1999 reorganization was similar to steps the department had taken previously without success. While we have not assessed the effectiveness of the new Field Management Council, we noted in our report that the establishment of the NNSA appears to have created, at least temporarily, additional confusion regarding roles, responsibilities, and reporting relationships within the department. 8.  We noted in our report that the department has been taking steps to address its workforce problems since the early 1990s, and it continues to do so today.  As we said, we are concerned by the lack of succession planning and progress by DOE in addressing known human capital deficiencies.  We have revised our report, however, to reflect that DOE published, in September 2001, its \"Five-Year Workforce Restructuring Plan.\"  According to DOE, the plan responds to an OMB requirement of all federal agencies and presents a \"corporate roadmap\" for reducing manager and organizational layers, increasing spans of control, and redeploying staff.  The plan describes a variety of ongoing and planned actions.  Regarding DOE's discussion of the many underlying factors affecting its staffing, we agree that building a quality workforce is very challenging.  As DOE notes, these challenges are made more difficult by the constant changes in mission focus that characterize DOE's history."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to those named above, Tom Laetz, Dan Feehan, William Lanouette, Tom Kingham, Linda Chu, James Charlifue, and Cynthia Norris made key contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
