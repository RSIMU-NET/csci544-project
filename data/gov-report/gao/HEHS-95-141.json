After extensive research, Dr. Gold proposed the use of hydrazine sulfate, a chemical that interrupts the abnormal sugar metabolism associated with weight loss, to arrest and reverse cancer cachexia.", "In 1973, Dr. Gold reported on results of animal tests indicating that hydrazine sulfate inhibited the growth of various rodent tumors and enhanced the antitumor action of some chemotherapeutic drugs. In 1975, Dr. Gold reported the results of hydrazine sulfate\u2019s use in cancer patients. Using reports from physicians whose advanced cancer patients were taking hydrazine sulfate, Dr. Gold noted several cases of tumor regression and subjective improvement in cancer patients treated with hydrazine sulfate. Additionally, Russian investigators have claimed some successes with hydrazine sulfate for more than 20 years. Although early clinical studies conducted in the United States found mixed results, later studies evaluating hydrazine sulfate as an anticachexia agent suggested that the drug benefited some cancer patients.", "In the 1980s, studies at the Harbor-University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) Medical Center indicated that adding hydrazine sulfate to a standard chemotherapy regimen improved the nutritional status and survival time of some cancer patients. Of particular interest was a randomized clinical trial\u2014involving 65 patients with advanced, inoperable non-small-cell lung cancer\u2014that compared chemotherapy and hydrazine sulfate with chemotherapy and placebo. Data from the study suggested that hydrazine sulfate may benefit some cancer patients. While overall survival differences between the two treatment groups were not significant, researchers found that hydrazine sulfate improved survival in a subset of study patients who began the trial in better overall condition.

One of these trials, in patients with advanced lung cancer, was conducted by the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) and led by a principal investigator at the Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation in San Diego, California. The other trial in advanced lung cancer patients, was conducted by the North Central Cancer Treatment Group (NCCTG) and led by a principal investigator at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.

Results from the three clinical trials were published in June 1994. The data showed that hydrazine sulfate therapy does not result in any significant benefit. Specifically, in two trials involving over 500 patients with inoperable non-small-cell lung cancer, the addition of hydrazine sulfate to a standard chemotherapy regimen resulted in somewhat worse quality of life, no effect on weight gain or loss, and a suggestion of decreased survival when compared with placebo.

NCI concluded that, at most, Russian animal data suggested that large doses of alcohol or barbiturate medications consumed with hydrazine sulfate can increase the total overall toxicity. NCI also concluded that unpublished animal data did not support the hypothesis that the short-term use of tranquilizing agents with hydrazine sulfate would increase toxicity or prevent clinical benefit. These conclusions were based on the assessment of NCI scientists in consultation with CALGB and NCCTG researchers. In addition, NCI officials told us that because the UCLA study did not specifically prohibit patients from taking barbiturates and tranquilizers or consuming alcohol, the NCI-sponsored confirmatory trials did not have to be any different in that regard.", "Nevertheless, in response to the issue of incompatibility, NCCTG investigators (at the Mayo Clinic) prohibited patients from taking barbiturates or consuming alcohol. Furthermore, patients were prohibited from taking tranquilizing agents, except for antiemetic purposes. The NCCTG principal investigator told us that he felt it would have been unethical to perform either of the Mayo clinical trials without allowing the use of antiemetic drugs, including drugs otherwise considered to be tranquilizers, by patients experiencing nausea or vomiting.", "CALGB investigators, however, decided that it was more important to replicate the UCLA trial than attempt to address concerns of incompatibility by prohibiting the use of tranquilizers, barbiturates, and alcohol.

Although CALGB investigators decided not to collect data on concurrent medications on their standardized research forms, some research associates voluntarily provided information on antiemetic usage. Data on the use of antiemetic medications for about half of the patients in our review were recorded on the research forms. Our analysis of research forms listing antiemetic medications revealed that 88 percent of the patients received benzodiazepine and 71 percent received phenothiazine tranquilizing agents. Generally, it appeared that most patients were prescribed tranquilizing medications for short-term emetic relief. In several instances, however, patients were prescribed tranquilizing agents on an \u201cas needed\u201d continual basis.

In the two clinical trials involving patients with advanced lung cancer, patients received chemotherapy in addition to hydrazine sulfate or placebo. Because the chemotherapeutic regimen used to treat advanced lung cancer induces severe nausea and vomiting in almost all patients, NCCTG and CALGB investigators did not deem it feasible or ethical to administer chemotherapy without the concurrent use of antiemetic drugs.", "During the time when NCCTG and CALGB were conducting their trials, the most effective antiemetic regimens available involved the use of tranquilizing agents. Accordingly, many study patients in both clinical trials were prescribed phenothiazines and benzodiazepines. Although patients in NCCTG\u2019s colon cancer trial were not undergoing chemotherapy, some patients with advanced colon cancer experience nausea and vomiting associated with their disease. NCCTG and CALGB investigators told us that they would not deny standard medical care to control nausea and vomiting in patients who were dying from cancer.", "Also, patients enrolled in the UCLA clinical trial reportedly received tranquilizing agents while taking hydrazine sulfate. Medical records for 40 study patients treated at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center indicated that 22 patients received hydrazine sulfate and chemotherapy. In addition, these patients received tranquilizing agents to control their chemotherapy-induced vomiting. Specifically, patients who received hydrazine sulfate also received a total of 16 doses of benzodiazepines and 20 doses of phenothiazines.

Their analyses suggested that the concurrent use of hydrazine sulfate with tranquilizing agents or barbiturates did not adversely affect the survival of lung cancer patients enrolled in the hydrazine sulfate trials. Also, their post-trial analyses did not change the conclusions originally drawn from the clinical trials: There was no benefit for patients who received hydrazine sulfate compared with those who received placebo.", "Because patients who entered later in NCCTG\u2019s lung cancer trial did not receive benzodiazepine tranquilizing agents as antiemetics, NCCTG investigators were able to retrospectively compare the clinical outcomes of patients who received benzodiazepines with those of patients who did not. The data showed no statistically significant differences in survival time between patients who received hydrazine sulfate and a benzodiazepine tranquilizer as an antiemetic and patients who received hydrazine sulfate and new non-benzodiazepine antiemetics.

Before completion of NCI\u2019s sponsored clinical trials, FDA approved more than 70 applications permitting the compassionate use of hydrazine sulfate.
