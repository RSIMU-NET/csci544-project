During that period, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) data show that management-level representation by minority men and women increased from 11.1 percent to 15.5 percent. Specifically, African-Americans increased their representation from 5.6 percent to 6.6 percent, Asians from 2.5 percent to 4.5 percent, Hispanics from 2.8 percent to 4.0 percent, and American Indians from 0.2 percent to 0.3 percent. The EEOC data also show that representation by white women remained constant at slightly more than one-third whereas representation by white men declined from 52.2 percent to 47.2 percent. Financial services firms and trade groups GAO contacted stated that they have initiated programs to increase workforce diversity, including in management-level positions, but these initiatives face challenges. The programs include developing scholarships and internships, establishing programs to foster employee retention and development, and linking managers' compensation with their performance in promoting a diverse workforce. However, firm officials said that they still face challenges in recruiting and retaining minority candidates. Some officials also said that gaining employees' \"buy-in\" to diversity programs was a challenge, particularly among middle managers who were often responsible for implementing key aspects of such programs. Research reports suggest that minority- and women-owned businesses have generally faced difficulties in obtaining access to capital for several reasons such as these businesses may be concentrated in service industries and lack assets to pledge as collateral. Other studies suggest that lenders may discriminate in providing credit, but assessing lending discrimination may be complicated by limited data availability. However, some financial institutions, primarily commercial banks, said that they have developed strategies to serve minority- and women-owned businesses. These strategies include marketing existing financial products specifically to minority and women business owners."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["At a July 2004 hearing before the Subcommittee on Oversight and  Investigations of the House Committee on Financial Services, some  members and witnesses expressed concern about the financial services  industry\u2019s lack of workforce diversity, particularly in key management- level positions.

Specifically,  our objectives were to discuss (1) what the available data show  regarding diversity at the management level in the financial services  industry from 1993 through 2004, (2) the types of initiatives that the  financial services industry and related organizations have taken to  promote workforce diversity and the challenges involved, and (3) the  ability of minority- and women-owned businesses to obtain access to  capital in financial markets and initiatives financial institutions have taken  to make capital available to these businesses. You also asked that we  include information about the accounting industry, which we address  separately in this report. In an earlier report, we defined workforce  diversity as ways in which people in a workforce are similar and different  from one another including background, education, and language skills.  For the purposes of this report, we focused the diversity discussion on  changes in management-level representation over time by racial/ethnic  minority groups (for both women and men), including African-Americans,  Asian/Pacific Islanders (Asians), Hispanics or Latinos (Hispanics), and  American Indians/Alaskan Natives (American Indians). We also discussed  changes in management-level representation by whites (both women and  men) over time. Finally, we defined raising capital as debt or equity capital  obtained in conventional financial markets, such as from commercial  banks or venture capital funds.", "To address objective one, we primarily analyzed the Equal Employment  Opportunity Commission\u2019s (EEOC) Employer Information Report (EEO-1)  data for the financial services industry for employers with 100 or more  employees for the years 1993, 1998, 2000, and 2004. The EEO-1 data  provide information on racial/ethnic and gender representation for various  occupations within a broad range of industries, including financial  services. We used the EEO-1 \u201cofficials and managers\u201d job category as the  basis for our discussion of management-level diversity within the financial  services industry, as well as for its various sectors, such as banking and  securities firms. EEOC defines the job category of \u201cofficials and managers\u201d  as occupations requiring administrative and managerial personnel, who set  broad policies, exercise overall responsibility for execution of these  policies, and direct individual departments or special phases of a firm\u2019s  operation. First-line supervisors who engage in the same activities as the  employees they supervise are reported in the same job category as the  employees they supervise rather than in the \u201cofficials and managers\u201d  category. To address objectives two and three, we collected publicly  available information and interviewed officials from a variety of financial  services firms, including commercial banks, securities firms, and private  equity/venture capital organizations. We also interviewed representatives  from industry trade organizations, such as the American Bankers  Association (ABA); the Securities Industry Association (SIA); Mortgage  Bankers Association (Association); and the Independent Insurance Agents  and Brokers of America (IIABA); federal agencies, including EEOC; the  U.S. Department of Commerce\u2019s Minority Business Development  Administration (MBDA); the Small Business Administration (SBA); and  federal bank regulators; academics; and organizations that represent  minority- and women-owned businesses, such as the U.S. Hispanic  Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Women Business  Owners.

MBA degrees are also  typically required for many management development programs,  according to an official from a commercial bank and an official from a  foundation that provides scholarships to minority MBA students. We  obtained data from the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of  Business (AACSB) on the percentage of students enrolled in MBA degree  programs in accredited AACSB schools in the United States from year  2000 to 2004. As shown in table 1, minorities accounted for 19 percent of  all students enrolled in accredited MBA programs in 2000 and 23 percent  in 2004. African-American and Hispanic enrollment in MBA programs was  generally stable during that period, and both groups accounted for 6 and 5  percent of enrollment, respectively, in 2004. Asian representation  increased from 9 percent in 2000 to 11 percent in 2004. Other data indicate  that MBA degrees awarded may be lower than the MBA enrollment data  reported by AACSB. For example, Graduate Management Admission  Council\u00ae (GMAC\u00ae) data indicate that minorities in its survey sample  accounted for 16 percent of MBA graduates in 2004 versus 23 percent  minority enrollment during the same year as reported by AACSB.  Because financial services firms compete with one another, as well as with  companies from other industries to recruit minority MBA graduates, their  capacity to increase diversity at the management level may be limited.", "Other evidence suggests that the financial services industry may not be  fully leveraging its \u201cinternal\u201d pipeline of minority and women employees  for management-level positions.

However, some financial  institutions, primarily commercial banks, have recently developed  strategies to market their loan products to minority- and women-owned  businesses or are offering technical assistance to them."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Research Suggests That Business Characteristics May Affect Minority- and Women-Owned Businesses\u2019 Access to Commercial Loans", "paragraphs": ["Reports issued by the MBDA, SBA, and academic researchers, as well as  interviews we conducted with commercial banks, minority-owned banks,  and trade groups representing minority- and women-owned businesses  suggest that minority- and women-owned businesses may face challenges  in obtaining commercial bank credit. The reports and interviews typically  cite several business characteristics shared by both minority-owned firms  and, in most cases, women-owned firms that may compromise their ability  to obtain bank credit as follows:    First, recent MBDA reports found that many minority-owned businesses in  the United States are concentrated in retail and service industries, which  have relatively low average annual capital expenditures for equipment.  Low capital expenditures are an attractive feature for start-up businesses,  but with limited assets to pledge as collateral against loans, these  businesses often have difficulty obtaining financing. According to the U.S.  Census Bureau\u2019s 2002 Survey of Business Owners, approximately 61  percent of minority-owned businesses and approximately 55 percent of  women-owned firms operate in the service sectors as compared to about  52 percent of all U.S. firms.", "Second, the Census Bureau\u2019s 2002 Survey of Business Owners indicated  that many minority- and women-owned businesses were start-ups or  relatively new and, therefore, might not have a history of sound financial  performance to present when applying for credit. Some officials from a  private research organization and a trade group official we contacted said  that banks are reluctant to lend to start-up businesses because of the costs  involved in assessing the prospects for such businesses and in monitoring  their performance over time.", "Third, the relatively small size and lack of technical experience of some  minority-owned businesses may affect their ability to obtain bank credit.  For example, an MDBA report stated that minority businesses often need  extensive mentoring and technical assistance such as help developing  business plans in addition to financing."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Studies Suggest That Discrimination May Limit Minority-Owned Businesses\u2019 Ability to Obtain Commercial Loans", "paragraphs": ["Several other studies suggest that discrimination may also be a reason that  minority-owned businesses face challenges obtaining commercial loans.  For example, a 2005 SBA report on the small business economy  summarized previous studies by researchers reporting on lending  discrimination. These previous studies found that minority-owned  businesses had a higher probability of having their loans denied and would  likely pay higher interest rates than white-owned businesses, even after  controlling for differences in creditworthiness and other factors. For  example, a study found that given comparable loan applications\u2014by  African-American and Hispanic-owned firms and white-owned firms\u2014the  applications by the African-American and Hispanic-owned firms were  more likely to be denied. Another study found that minorities had higher  denial rates even after controlling for personal net worth and  homeownership. The SBA report concludes that lending discrimination is  likely to discourage would-be minority entrepreneurs and reduce the  longevity of minority-owned businesses.", "Another 2005 report issued by SBA also found that minority-owned  businesses face some restrictions in access to credit. This study  investigated possible restricted access to credit for minority- and women- owned businesses by focusing on two types of credit\u2014\u201crelationship loans\u201d  (lines of credit) and \u201ctransaction loans\u201d (commercial mortgages,  equipment loans, and other loans) from commercial banks and nonbanks,  such as finance companies. The researchers found that minority business  owners were more likely to have transaction loans from nonbanks and less  likely to have bank loans of any kind. The researchers also found that  African-American and Hispanic business owners have a greater probability  of having either type of loan denied than white male owners. The  researchers did not find evidence suggesting that women or Asian  business owners faced loan denial probabilities different from those of  firms led by white, male-owned firms.", "Although studies have found potential lender discrimination against  minority-owned businesses, assessing such discrimination may be  complicated by limited data availability. The Federal Reserve\u2019s Regulation  B, which implements the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, prohibits financial  institutions from requiring information on race and gender from applicants  for nonmortgage credit products. Although the regulation was  implemented to prevent the information from being used to discriminate  against underserved groups, some federal financial regulators have stated  that removing the prohibition would allow them to better monitor and  enforce laws prohibiting discrimination in lending. We note that under the  Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA), lenders are required to collect  and report data on racial and gender characteristics of applicants for  mortgage loans. Researchers have used HMDA data to assess potential  mortgage lending discrimination by financial institutions. In contrast, the  studies we reviewed on lending discrimination against minority and small  business tend to rely on surveys of small businesses by the Federal  Reserve or the Census rather than on lending data obtained directly from  financial institutions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Many Minority- and Women-Owned Businesses May Also Face Difficulties Raising Equity Capital", "paragraphs": ["According to available research, many minority- and women-owned  businesses face challenges in raising equity capital\u2014such as, from venture  capital firms. For example, one study estimated that only $2 billion of the  $95 billion available in the private equity market in 1999 was managed by  companies that focused on supplying capital to entrepreneurs from  traditionally underserved markets, such as minority-owned businesses.  Moreover, according to a study by a private research organization, in 2003  only 4 percent of women-owned businesses with $1 million or more in  revenue had been funded through private equity capital as compared with  11 percent of male-owned businesses with revenues of $1 million or  more.", "According to studies and reports by private research organizations, some  of the same types of business characteristics that may affect the ability of  many minority- and women-owned businesses to obtain bank credit also  limit their capacity to raise equity capital. For example, industry reports  and industry representatives that we contacted state that venture  capitalists place a high priority on the management and technical skills  companies; whereas some minority-owned businesses may lack a proven  track record of such expertise.", "Although venture capital firms may not have traditionally invested in  minority-owned businesses, a recent study suggests that firms that do  focus on such entities can earn rates of return comparable to those earned  on mainstream private equity investments. This study, funded by a private  foundation, found that venture capital funds that specialize in investing in  minority-owned businesses were relatively profitable compared with a  private equity performance index. According to the study, the venture  capital funds that specialized in minority-owned businesses invested in a  more diverse portfolio of businesses than the typical venture capital fund,  which typically focuses on high-tech companies.

However, officials at a bank and a trade organization told us that the loan  products marketed to minority- and women-owned businesses did not  differ from those marketed to other businesses and that underwriting  standards had not changed.", "Bank officials also said that their companies had established partnerships  with trade and community organizations for minorities and women to  reach out to their businesses.

The EEO-1 data, which is  reported annually generally by firms with 100 or more employees, provides  information on race/ethnicity and gender for various occupations, within  various industries, including financial services. We used the racial/ethnic  groups specified by EEOC; whites, not of Hispanic origin (whites); Asians  or Pacific Islanders (Asians); Blacks, not of Hispanic origin (African- Americans); Hispanics or Latinos (Hispanics); and American Indians or  Alaskan Natives (American Indians) for our analysis. The EEO-1  occupations are officials and managers, professional, technicians, sales  workers, clerical workers, and others. The other category includes  laborers, craft workers, operatives, and service workers. We defined the  financial services industry to include the following five sectors: depository  credit institutions (including commercial banks), holdings and trusts  (including investment companies), non-depository credit institutions (such  as mortgage bankers), securities firms, and insurance (carriers and  agents). We also requested and analyzed EEO-1 data for the accounting  industry.", "We chose to use the EEO-1 database because it is was designed to provide  information on representation by a variety of groups within a range of  occupations and industries, covered many employers, and had been  collected in a standardized fashion for many years. Although the EEO-1  data generally do not capture information from small businesses with less  than 100 employees, we believe, due to their annual mandatory reporting,  they allow us to characterize the financial services industry of firms with  100 or more employees. We also corroborated the EEO-1 data with other  available studies, particularly a 2005 study by the Securities Industry  Association on diversity within the securities sector. We did consider  other sources of data besides EEO-1, but chose not to use them for a  variety of reasons including their being more limited or less current.", "We requested and analyzed the EEO-1 data, focusing on the \u201cofficials and  managers\u201d category, for the years 1993, 1998, 2000, and 2004 for financial  services firms having 100 or more employees. We compared that data from  the selected years to determine how the composition of management-level  staff had changed since 1993. We also analyzed the data based on the  number of employees in the firm or firm size. The four firm size categories  we used were 100 or more employees, 100-249 employees, 250-999  employees, and 1,000 or more employees. We also requested EEO-1 data  for the accounting industry for 2004, and therefore did not perform a trend  analysis. The scope of our work did not include developing appropriate  benchmarks to assess the extent of workforce diversity within the  financial services industry.", "EEOC collects EEO-1 data from companies in a manner that allowed us to  specify our data request and analysis by financial sector (e.g., commercial  banking or securities). EEOC assigns each firm a code based on its  primary activity (referred to as the North American Industry Classification  System  or the Standard Industrial Classification ). For  example, a commercial bank will have a specific code denoting  commercial banking, whereas a securities firm would have its own  securities code. In addition, EEOC assigns codes to companies and their  subsidiaries based on their primary line of business. For example, a  commercial bank with an insurance subsidiary would have a separate  code for that subsidiary. By requesting the EEO-1 data by the relevant  codes, we were able to separate the different financial services businesses  within a firm and then aggregate the data by sector. Although the NAICS  replaced the SIC in 1997, EEOC staff are to assign both codes to each firm  that existed prior to 2002 to ensure consistency.", "We conducted a limited analysis to assess the reliability of the EEO-1 data.  To do so, we interviewed EEOC officials regarding how the data are  collected and verified as well as to identify potential data limitations.  EEOC has conducted a series of data reliability analyses for EEO-1 data to  verify the consistency of the data over time. For example, EEOC reviewed  the 2003 EEO-1 data for its report on diversity in the financial services  industry. As part of this review, EEOC deleted 81 of the 13,000  establishments because the data for the deleted establishments were not  consistent year to year. The EEOC staff do not verify the EEO-1 data,  which are self-reported by firms, but they do review the trends of the data  submitted. For example, EEOC staff look for major fluctuations in job  classifications within an industry. On the basis of this analysis, we  concluded that the EEO-1 data are sufficiently reliable for our purposes.", "To address objective two, we interviewed a range of financial services  firms, including commercial banks and securities firms.
