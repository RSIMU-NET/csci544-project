The act is intended to eliminate or minimize employment disadvantages to civilian careers that can result from service in the uniformed services. This report examines the extent to which the Departments of Defense (DOD), Labor (DOL), Justice (DOJ), and the Office of Special Counsel (OSC) have achieved this purpose, specifically, the extent to which the agencies (1) have data that indicate the level of compliance with USERRA, (2) have efficiently and effectively conducted educational outreach, and (3) have efficiently and effectively addressed servicemember complaints."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Whether or not overall USERRA compliance has changed is difficult to firmly establish; however, the agencies that support or enforce USERRA have collected formal and informal complaint data and some employer support figures that provide limited insights into compliance. For example, DOL's formal complaint numbers show a possible relationship with the level of the use of the reserve components and the number of complaints. DOD data show that some employers exceed USERRA requirements, but these data have limitations. DOD has only 1 full year of informal complaint data, so it will be several years before DOD can identify any meaningful trends in informal complaints. Because informal complaint figures have not been captured on a consistent basis, agencies lack the data necessary to identify total complaint trends. Furthermore, data from a 2004 DOD survey showed that at least 72 percent of National Guard and Reserve members with USERRA problems never sought assistance for their problems. This raises questions as to whether complaint numbers alone can fully explain USERRA compliance or employer support. Some recently added employment questions on DOD's periodic surveys, if continued, offer the potential to provide insight into compliance and employer support issues. DOD, DOL, and OSC have educated hundreds of thousands of employers and servicemembers about USERRA, but the efficiency and effectiveness of this outreach is hindered by a lack of employer information. DOD's reserve component members who can be involuntarily called to active duty are required to enter their civilian employer information into a DOD database but the services have not enforced this requirement and as of August 2005, about 40 percent of the members had not entered the required information. Without information about the full expanse of servicemember employers, federal agencies have conducted general outreach efforts but have been limited in their ability to efficiently and effectively target educational outreach efforts to employers who actually have servicemember employees. Agency abilities to efficiently and effectively address servicemember complaints are hampered by incompatible data systems, a reliance on paper files, and a segmented process that lacks visibility. The systems that DOD, DOL, DOJ, and OSC use to track USERRA complaints are not compatible. As a result, data collection efforts are sometimes duplicated, and DOL relies on its paper files when transferring or reviewing complaints. This slows the transfer of complaints and limits the ability of DOL managers to conduct effective, timely oversight of complaint files. Furthermore, segmented responsibilities and lack of visibility have led agencies to focus on outputs rather than results. For example, agencies measure complaint processing times but not the elapsed time servicemembers actually wait to have their complaints fully addressed. GAO analysis of 52 complaints that had been closed and reopened two or more times found that recorded processing times averaged 103 days but the actual elapsed times that servicemembers waited to have their complaints fully addressed averaged 619 days."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act  (USERRA) of 1994 protects millions of individuals as they transition  between their federal duties and their civilian employment. Prior to  USERRA, reemployment rights were set forth in the Vietnam Era Veterans\u2019  Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974. Following the 1991 Gulf War,  military servicemembers and employers flooded the government with  questions and complaints concerning reemployment rights. In 1994,  following a review of the effectiveness of the 1974 act, Congress passed  USERRA to \u201cencourage non-career service in the uniformed services by  eliminating or minimizing the disadvantages to civilian careers and  employment which can result from such service.\u201d The act covers not only  the more than 2 million members who have served in the reserve  components of the armed services since the act was passed, but also large  numbers of active duty servicemembers and veterans, including those who  served before the act\u2019s passage. For example, citizens who left civilian jobs  and signed active duty enlistment contracts following the events of  September 11, 2001, retain reemployment rights under USERRA as long as  they meet a few basic requirements. Among the eligibility requirements are  (1) the absence of the receipt of a dishonorable or other disqualifying  discharge, (2) giving proper notice prior to departure and after return from  service, and (3) returning within 5 years of departure or immediately after  the expiration of their initial enlistment contracts, whichever is longer.", "Every individual in the country who serves in, has served in, or intends to  serve in the uniformed services is potentially covered by USERRA. The act  applies to a wide range of employers, including federal, state, and local  governments as well as for-profit and not-for-profit private sector firms.  Enforcement and implementation of USERRA is complex, with several  federal agencies having specific and sometimes overlapping outreach,  investigative, or enforcement roles. Along with the Department of Labor  (DOL), the Department of Defense (DOD) is responsible for informing  servicemembers and employers of their rights, benefits, and obligations  under USERRA. Much of DOD\u2019s outreach is accomplished through its  Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve (ESGR) organization. The  ESGR performs most of its work through volunteers and specially-trained  impartial ombudsmen who act as informal mediators for USERRA issues  that arise between servicemembers and their employers. DOL, through the  efforts of its Veterans' Employment and Training Service (VETS), is the  avenue through which servicemembers file formal USERRA-related  complaints against civilian employers. Representatives of VETS  investigate USERRA complaints and try to resolve disputes, but if they are  unable to resolve servicemember complaints, DOL informs the  servicemembers that they may request to have their complaints referred to  the Department of Justice (DOJ) or to the Office of Special Counsel (OSC).  Unresolved complaints against private sector or state or local government  employers are referred by DOL to DOJ to investigate, mediate, and litigate.  Prior to February 8, 2005, unresolved complaints against federal executive  agency employers were referred from DOL to OSC. Under a new  demonstration project, OSC now receives some USERRA complaints  directly from certain servicemembers.", "In light of the significant number of National Guard and Reserve members  serving in the Global War on Terrorism who will be demobilized, returned  to their civilian jobs, and possibly called back to duty, you requested that  we review the efforts of certain federal agencies to support and enforce  USERRA, specifically the activities of DOD, DOL, DOJ, and OSC. We agreed  to address your immediate needs by first reviewing issues surrounding  OSC\u2019s enforcement of USERRA in the federal sector. On October 6, 2004,  we issued U.S. Office of Special Counsel\u2019s Role in Enforcing Law to  Protect Reemployment Rights of Veterans and Reservists in Federal  Employment, GAO-05-74R. This report responds to your broader request to  review the actions of the four federal agencies involved in carrying out  USERRA responsibilities. Our objectives were to determine the extent to  which the agencies (1) have data that indicate the level of compliance with  USERRA, (2) have efficiently and effectively conducted educational  outreach, and (3) have efficiently and effectively addressed servicemember  complaints.", "To address our first objective, we collected, reviewed, and analyzed data  from a wide variety of sources, including the four federal agencies that  support and enforce USERRA. We analyzed the annual numbers of  complaints filed with DOL and those referred from DOL to DOJ and OSC  from fiscal year 1997 through the third quarter of fiscal year 2005 to  determine whether there were trends in the total referrals, or the referrals  to either agency. We also reviewed the tabulations of responses from DOD\u2019s  Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC) May 2004 projectable survey of  reserve component members. We also conducted original analysis on the  survey responses that addressed employment issues. In addition, we  conducted a survey of the ESGR\u2019s ombudsmen to obtain information about  their backgrounds and training as well as the numbers of complaints they  had handled and resolved. We also reviewed data related to the ESGR\u2019s  outreach and employer recognition programs. To address our second  objective, we reviewed USERRA to determine agency roles and  responsibilities in educating servicemembers and employers concerning  USERRA, and we interviewed agency officials from DOD and DOL to  determine how they carry out their USERRA educational outreach  responsibilities. We also collected and analyzed data concerning DOD\u2019s and  DOL\u2019s outreach activities. We interviewed DOJ and OSC officials to  determine whether they were involved in any outreach activities. To  address our third objective, we reviewed USERRA and the Veterans  Benefits Improvement Act of 2004 to determine agency roles and  responsibilities in processing USERRA complaints. We interviewed  headquarters officials from the four agencies to determine how they pass  complaint information among various offices. Further, we interviewed the  ESGR ombudsmen and customer service center representatives, state  ombudsmen coordinators, DOL investigators, and officials at two of DOL\u2019s  regional offices and two of its solicitor\u2019s offices. We reviewed DOL hard  copy files in two regional offices and compared the data in those files to  electronic data from DOL\u2019s USERRA Information Management System. We  also reviewed agency procedures for collecting and reporting information  about the time required to address USERRA complaints. We determined  that the agency data used in this report were sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of this review, though the complaint data systems had some  limitations that we discuss further in the report. We conducted our work  from October 2004 through August 2005 in accordance with generally  accepted government auditing standards.

USERRA applies to public and private employers in the United States,  regardless of size, and includes federal, state, and local governments, as  well as for-profit and not-for profit private sector firms. It also applies in  overseas workplaces that are owned or controlled by U.S. employers.", "Generally, servicemembers are entitled to the reemployment rights and  benefits provided by USERRA if they meet certain conditions.  These  include having held a civilian job prior to call-up, serving fewer than 5  years of cumulative military service with respect to that employer,  providing their employer with advance notice of their service requirement  when possible, leaving service under honorable conditions, and reporting  back to work or applying for reemployment in a timely manner. Provided  servicemembers meet their USERRA requirements, they are entitled to  prompt reinstatement to the positions they would have held if they had  never left their employment, or to positions of like seniority, status, and  pay;   health coverage for a designated period of time while absent from their  employers, and immediate reinstatement of health coverage upon  return;   training, as needed, to requalify for their jobs;   periods of protection against discharge based on the length of service;   non-seniority benefits that are available to other employees who are on  leaves of absence.", "Figure 1 is a flowchart that shows servicemembers\u2019 options for receiving  federal assistance with their USERRA complaints.

Some  servicemembers have used members of their military chain-of-command to  help them resolve problems with their employers. In addition, the ESGR is  available to provide information and informal mediation of USERRA- related employment problems.  The DOL offers assistance similar to the  ESGR in that it provides information to employers and employees, and  works to informally resolve USERRA-related employment problems.  The  DOL also receives formal complaints from servicemembers under  USERRA.  Another option that is available to servicemembers at any time is  to hire a private attorney and to file a complaint against their employer in  court (for private employers and state and local governments) or before the  Merit Systems Protection Board (for federal employers).

The ESGR  carries out this responsibility for DOD. The ESGR was established in 1972  to manage activities that maintain and enhance employers\u2019 support for the  reserve components, and it has a goal to inform servicemembers and their  employers of their respective USERRA rights and responsibilities. The  Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Personnel and Readiness)  develops the policies, plans, and programs that manage the readiness of  both active and reserve forces, and within that office, the Assistant  Secretary of Defense for Reserve Affairs oversees the activities of the  ESGR.", "The ESGR has a staff of about 55\u201418 civilians and 37 military personnel\u2014 at its national headquarters in Arlington, Virginia. However, much of the  ESGR\u2019s work is done through its more than 4,000 volunteers who are  organized into state committees. These volunteers help to educate both  employers and servicemembers about USERRA, and a specially trained  subgroup of about 800 volunteers serve as impartial ombudsmen who work  to informally mediate USERRA issues that arise between servicemembers  and their employers. While many volunteer ombudsmen are attorneys,  human relations specialists, or have other backgrounds that assist them in  their mediation work, all of the ESGR\u2019s ombudsmen are required to attend  a 3-day training course before they handle servicemember complaints.   (App. II contains additional information about the backgrounds of these  volunteer ombudsmen.) Most USERRA-related complaints come to the  ESGR through its toll-free telephone number (1-800-336-4590), which is  answered at the ESGR\u2019s Customer Service Center in Millington, Tennessee.  The customer service representatives in Tennessee screen calls, fill  requests for information, and forward complaints that appear to have merit  to volunteer ombudsmen, who are generally located geographically near  the servicemembers. The complaints are often channeled through state  ombudsmen coordinators. The ESGR\u2019s volunteer ombudsmen attempt to  resolve pay-related USERRA complaints within 7 days and other USERRA  complaints within 14 days.

This  responsibility is carried out primarily through the efforts of VETS. VETS is  led by an assistant secretary who is supported by headquarters, regional,  and state staff as well as local investigators. When a servicemember leaves  active duty and a USERRA-related complaint develops against the  servicemember\u2019s civilian employer, the servicemember can file a formal  complaint at www.vets1010.dol.gov, or can file a printed copy of the  complaint form, such as the one included in appendix III, with the  Secretary of Labor. The complaint is then assigned to one of VETS\u2019s  approximately 125 investigators, generally an investigator who is located  close to the employer. These VETS investigators examine USERRA  complaints and try to help the servicemembers and employers resolve their  differences. The investigators also typically have a host of other  responsibilities that support veterans\u2019 programs but that are not directly  related to USERRA. The law gives DOL subpoena power over records and  individuals to aid in its investigations, but officials note that subpoenas are  used infrequently because the threat alone is usually enough to gain  cooperation. The statute also states that the Secretary of Labor may use the  assistance of volunteers and may request assistance from other agencies  engaged in similar or related activities. When DOL is unable to resolve  servicemember complaints, DOL informs the servicemembers that they  may request to have their complaints referred. A complaint is referred to  DOJ if it involves state or local governments or private employers or to  OSC if it involves a federal executive agency.

Projections also show that more  than 32 percent receive medical benefits that are not required by USERRA,  and more than 30 percent receive other benefits above and beyond those  required by USERRA. While these data indicate that some employers are  exceeding USERRA, the DMDC data were collected only in 2004 and  therefore cannot establish whether overall employer support is improving,  steady, or declining.", "The ESGR data show increases in both employer awards and statements of  support, but these increasing figures cover a relatively small group of  employers. Servicemembers are increasingly nominating their employers  for the ESGR\u2019s various employer support awards. \u201cPatriot Award\u201d  employers may be recognized for simply complying with USERRA.  However, higher level awards typically require support above and beyond  USERRA requirements. According to the ESGR officials, award  nominations have increased over the years, and in fiscal year 2004  servicemembers nominated their employers for more than 20,000 awards.  The ESGR\u2019s \u201cAbove and Beyond\u201d award is one of the higher level awards. It  is awarded annually by the ESGR\u2019s state committees and recognizes  employers who have exceeded USERRA requirements. Many employers  have received this award over the years, and in fiscal year 2004 the ESGR\u2019s  state committees recognized 1,058 employers with \u201cAbove and Beyond\u201d  awards. In addition to increases in awards, the ESGR figures show  increases in the numbers of employers signing the ESGR \u201cstatements of  support.\u201d In signing statements of support, employers acknowledge that  they will comply with USERRA. Between 2000 and 2002, 575 employers  signed statements of support. In 2003, 1,228 employers signed the  statements, and by July 26, 2005, the ESGR records showed that almost  6,000 employers had signed statements of support. The ESGR continues to  solicit statements of support, but is now focusing its outreach efforts on a  \u201c5-star\u201d program, which encourages employers to move beyond simple  USERRA compliance to increasingly higher levels of employer support.  (See app. IV for additional details.)

It will be several  years before the ESGR can identify any meaningful trends in informal  complaint numbers because the ESGR has only 1 full year of informal  complaint data in its central database. Until October 2003, the ESGR had a  manual complaint tracking system that relied on monthly reports from its  state committees to its national headquarters. Our 2002 reportreviewed  the ESGR\u2019s effectiveness and found that the ESGR did not have an accurate  count of the complaints handled by its ombudsmen. We found that  reporting by ombudsmen had been sporadic and some states had gone an  entire year without reporting any complaints at all. In 2003, the ESGR  began funneling calls to its ombudsmen through a central call center where  the complaint information is logged into a centralized database before  assigning the complaint to an ombudsman. As a result of the changed  procedures, the ESGR is now able to track the complaints handled by each  of its nearly 800 ombudsmen. After they have been assigned a complaint,  ombudsmen can access, review, update, and close assigned complaints, but  they cannot create new complaint files in the database.

We conducted a survey to collect information about the workload,  backgrounds, and training of the ESGR\u2019s ombudsmen because the ESGR  lacked complete and accurate ombudsmen data. We surveyed all of the 831  ombudsmen that the ESGR headquarters officials told us were available to  handle complaints as of April 6, 2005. Of the 831 ombudsmen, 618  responded to our survey but 52 said they were not available to handle  complaints as of April 6, 2005.

Survey responses showed that the ombudsmen who were available to  handle complaints on April 6, 2005, had handled 37,684 complaints.  Although this figure does not cover a specific time period, it far exceeds the  22,204 formal complaints handled by DOL between 1989 and 2004.

When complaint numbers are large, managers can exercise more efficient  and effective oversight of electronic complaint files that are stored in  automated systems with query capabilities than of geographically  dispersed paper complaint files. Of the four federal agencies we reviewed,  only the agencies that deal with large numbers of complaint files\u2014DOD  and DOL\u2014had electronic complaint files that were stored in automated  systems with query capabilities that facilitate oversight.

From the time informal complaints are filed with the  ESGR through the final resolution of formal complaints at DOL, DOJ, or  OSC, no one has visibility over the entire process. The segmented  complaint resolution process means that the agency officials who handle  the complaint at various stages of the process generally have limited or no  visibility over the other parts of the process for which they are not  responsible. This prevents any one agency from monitoring the length of  time it takes for a servicemember\u2019s complaint to be fully addressed, and  leads agencies to focus on output figures for their portion of the complaint  process rather than on overall federal responsiveness to complaints. As a  result, agencies have developed goals that are oriented toward outputs of  their agency\u2019s portion of the process rather than toward results for an  individual servicemember\u2019s complaint. For example, agency goals address  complaint processing times at different stages of the process, but  agencies do not measure a result of primary concern to servicemembers\u2014 the elapsed time between the bringing of a complaint to a federal agency  and the complaint\u2019s final resolution.

To highlight the difference between agency focuses  on processing times and servicemember concerns with elapsed times, we  reviewed complaints that had been closed and later reopened by VETS  investigators. Between October 1, 1996, and June 30, 2005,  servicemembers filed 10,061 formal complaints with DOL. More than 430 of  these complaints were closed and later reopened, and 52 of the 430  complaints were closed and reopened two or more times. For example, one  investigator opened a complaint file on September 30, 2001, and then  closed and reopened the complaint six times before finally referring the  complaint to the VETS regional office on September 9, 2002. We analyzed  the processing times and elapsed times for the 52 complaints that had been  closed and reopened two or more times and found substantial differences  between the figures. DOL\u2019s system assigned separate complaint numbers to  the 52 complaints each time the complaint was opened or reopened. As a  result, the system recorded the average processing time as 103 days.  However, from the servicemembers\u2019 perspectives, it took much longer for  DOL, DOJ, and OSC to address their complaints. The servicemembers  who filed the 52 complaints actually waited an average of 619 days from the  time they first filed their initial formal complaints with DOL until the time  the complaints were fully addressed by DOL, DOJ, or OSC. Because  agency officials do not have visibility over the entire complaint resolution  process and no one has information about the time it takes federal agencies  to fully address servicemember complaints, the Secretary of Labor,  Attorney General, and Special Counsel cannot evaluate the full range of  administrative or legislative actions that may be necessary to effectively  implement USERRA, and the Secretary of Labor\u2019s annual report to  Congress cannot be as accurate and complete as required."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Informal and formal complaint data from the agencies responsible for  enforcing and implementing USERRA do not support the analysis needed  to determine if employer compliance with USERRA and support for the  act\u2019s purpose has improved since passage of the act in 1994.

As a result, officials from different agencies sometimes  spend time collecting information that has already been provided to  another agency. This slows the complaint resolution process. In addition,  because data systems are incompatible, formal referrals from VETS  investigators to DOJ or OSC must be accompanied by a paper file, which is  first routed through a VETS regional office and a DOL solicitor\u2019s office.

These paper  reviews are time consuming. In addition, paper files can be misplaced or  lost when they are moved from office to office. Until VETS switches to  electronic files, investigators will continue the inefficient practice of  maintaining duplicate records and managers will be limited in their ability  to provide timely oversight and effective corrective actions for any  problems that arise.", "The responsibility for enforcing and implementing USERRA is complex,  involving several federal agencies. A single complaint can start at DOD and  flow through three different DOL offices before finally being resolved at  DOJ or OSC. The segmented complaint resolution process means that the  agency officials who handle the complaint at various stages of the process  generally have limited or no visibility over the other parts of the process for  which they are not responsible. As a result, agency officials have not  addressed complaint processing issues that cut across federal agencies or  set outcome\u2013oriented goals. Instead, agencies have focused their goals on  outputs from their particular portions of the complaint process rather than  focusing on overall federal responsiveness to USERRA complaints.  Meanwhile, the servicemember knows how much time is passing since the  initial complaint was filed. Under USERRA, specific outreach,  investigative, and enforcement roles are assigned to DOD, DOL, DOJ, and  OSC. However, no agency has visibility over the entire complaint process.   Therefore, it is difficult for the responsible agencies to achieve their  common goal\u2013to minimize the employment disadvantages that can result  from service in the uniformed service, and the time servicemembers wait to  have their complaints fully addressed\u2013which is of great importance to  servicemembers.

DOJ reviewed a draft of this report and had no  comments on this report.  DOD deferred to DOL, DOJ, and OSC regarding  our recommendation for the agencies to develop procedures or systems to  enable the electronic transfer of complaint information between agencies.   DOL and OSC commented on our matter for congressional consideration  that Congress should consider designating a single office to maintain  visibility over the entire conflict resolution process.", "In DOD\u2019s written comments, the department concurred with our  recommendation for the Secretary of Defense to include questions on  servicemembers\u2019 employment issues in DOD\u2019s continuing Status of Forces  surveys that would address (1) the extent to which servicemembers  experience USERRA-related problems; (2) from whom the servicemembers  sought assistance if they experienced such problems; (3) if they did not  seek assistance, why not; and (4) the extent to which the servicemembers\u2019  employers provide support beyond that required by law. DOD stated that  the department\u2019s May 2004 Status of Forces survey asked a series of  questions about reemployment after activation that included the areas  addressed in our recommendations.  We disagree.  For this report, we used  results from the May 2004 survey that showed at least 72 percent of the  Selected Reserve members who had experienced USERRA-related  problems never filed a complaint, informal or formal, to seek assistance in  resolving the problem.  However, the survey did not cover all the areas  addressed in our recommendation. For example, the survey did not ask  those servicemembers who had experienced USERRA-related problems  and never filed a complaint, informal or formal, why they did not seek  assistance in resolving the problem.  We believe that this would be valuable  information, if gathered regularly, to gauge the effectiveness of federal  actions to support USERRA by identifying trends in compliance and  employer support. DOD also stated that, at the request of DOL, it has  agreed to include the series of questions about reemployment after  activation in future surveys. OSC generally concurred with this  recommendation, but had no specific comment. DOL did not comment on  this recommendation.", "DOD also concurred with our recommendation for the Secretary of  Defense to (1) take steps to enforce compliance with servicemembers\u2019  reporting of their civilian employer information and maintain employer  information, and (2) share employer information from the database with  other federal agencies that educate employers about USERRA.  DOD stated  that the first objective of this recommendation had already been  accomplished. We disagree.  In our report, we noted that compliance with  the requirement to enter Selected Reserve member employment  information into the database has risen substantially during this review\u2014 from 13 percent in October 2004, to 58 percent in April 2005, to 73 percent  in August 2005. We also noted that compliance varies by component, with  the Army Reserve and the Marine Corps Reserve each having the lowest  percentage of compliance\u201466 percent.  Further, we noted that compliance  rates are substantially lower for the Individual Ready Reserve and the  Inactive National Guard\u2014about 24 percent. Individual Ready Reserve and  Inactive National Guard members are subject to be recalled to active duty.  About 9,500 Individual Ready Reserve members were called to duty  between September 11, 2001, and June 30, 2005.  Outreach to employers of  Individual Ready Reserve members may be even more important than  outreach to Selected Reserve members\u2019 employers. Individual Ready  Reserve members do not participate in regular drilling and their employers  may be unaware of the employees\u2019 military obligations and USERRA rights.  As the war on terrorism continues, DOD may rely more upon Individual  Ready Reserve members. DOD also noted that enforcement of compliance  is a high priority and is already monitored.  As noted in our report,  responsible officials told us that as far as they knew, the military  departments had not enforced the requirement for servicemembers to  comply with reporting their civilian employer information by subjecting  any member to punishment or administrative action for failing to comply.  We believe DOD has more to accomplish in this area. With regard to the  second objective of this recommendation, DOD stated that it is working  collectively with DOL and the Department of Veterans Affairs to ensure  that their respective systems facilitate consistent reporting capabilities.  OSC generally concurred with both objectives of this recommendation, but  had no specific comments. DOL did not comment on this recommendation.", "DOD deferred to DOL, DOJ, and OSC regarding our recommendation for  the Secretary of Defense, along with the Secretary of Labor, the Attorney  General, and the Special Counsel, to develop procedures or systems to  enable the electronic transfer of complaint information between agencies.   DOD stated that the department only tracks \u201cinformal inquires,\u201d not  complaints that are filed with DOL, with possible referral to the DOJ or the  OSC. Therefore, establishment of a complaint database would fall within  the purview of those agencies.  DOD noted that it would support the  sharing of USERRA information received by DOD with responsible  agencies.  We note that DOD\u2019s system can contain extensive ombudsmen  notes and details about informal complaints, not just inquires for  information that are tracked separately, and would be beneficial and time  saving to DOL if an informal complaint becomes a formal complaint filed  with DOL.  DOL concurred with this recommendation and noted that DOL  has initiated internal discussions on ways in which DOL offices can  ultimately use one electronic case management system.  DOL stated that  the department will work closely with DOD, DOJ, and OSC in advancing an  electronic shared system configured to fit the agencies\u2019 responsibilities  under USERRA. OSC also concurred with this recommendation, noting that  OSC\u2019s ability to enforce USERRA has not been adversely affected by the  transfer of information by other than electronic means.  Nevertheless, OSC  noted that the office was dedicated to improving USERRA services to  servicemembers and thus generally concurred with the recommendation,  although OSC indicated that the development of USERRA-specific  electronic files may require additional funding from Congress.", "DOL concurred with our recommendation for the Secretary of Labor to  develop a plan to reduce agency reliance on paper files and fully adopt the  agency\u2019s automated complaint file system.  DOL noted that the  establishment of such electronic files would enhance DOL\u2019s ability to more  efficiently and effectively share documents and other case-specific data  with other agencies, thus advancing accomplishment of our  recommendation for DOD, DOL, DOJ, and OSC to develop procedures or  systems to enable the electronic transfer of complaint information between  agencies.", "DOL and OSC commented on our matter for congressional consideration  that Congress should consider designating a single office to maintain  visibility over the entire complaint resolution process from DOD through  DOL, DOJ, and OSC. DOL noted that the mandated OSC demonstration  project is ongoing, and therefore, it would be premature to make any  suggestions or recommendations for congressional or legislative action  until the pilot has been completed. However, DOL stated that its office is  uniquely suited to provide an overview of the entire complaint resolution  process. OSC supported our matter and stated that OSC has unparalleled  experience and expertise in administering federal sector employment  complaints and prosecuting meritorious workplace violations before the  Merit Systems Protection Board.

Specifically, we  obtained historical data on the numbers of formal complaints handled by  DOL and then analyzed the data to determine whether the data showed any  trends and whether it was sufficient to demonstrate overall USERRA  compliance or employer support. We also analyzed the annual numbers of  formal complaints referred from DOL to DOJ and OSC between fiscal year  1997 and the third quarter of fiscal year 2005 to determine whether there  were trends in the total referrals, or the referrals to either agency.  We also  followed up on our 2002 report to determine whether the ESGR had  improved its collection of informal complaint data. We interviewed the  ESGR headquarters officials and ombudsmen who handled informal  complaints. We observed training for the ESGR\u2019s new database and we  observed data entry procedures at the ESGR\u2019s Customer Support Center.   In addition, we analyzed DMDC\u2019s projectable Status of Forces Survey of  Reserve Component Members, which was conducted in the spring of 2004.  This survey included more than 20 questions about servicemember  employment and USERRA-related issues.  We also analyzed results from  the Reserve Officers Association\u2019s annual surveys of Fortune 500  companies, which asked about policies that support servicemember  employees.  We discussed the agency data related to USERRA compliance  or employer support, along with the practices and methods used to collect  these data, with responsible officials from the   Department Of Labor, Washington, D.C.;  Department Of Labor, Veterans Employment and Training Service, Field  Offices in Memphis, TN, and Norfolk, VA; and regional offices in  Philadelphia, PA; and Atlanta, GA;  Department Of Labor, Office of the Solicitor, Washington, D.C.; and  Regional Offices in Philadelphia, PA, and Atlanta, GA;  Department of Justice, Washington, D.C.;  Office of Special Counsel, Washington, D.C.;  Department Of Defense, Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve,  Arlington, VA; and  Department Of Defense, Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve,  Customer Service Center, Millington, TN.", "We also discussed these issues with   The ESGR\u2019s State Ombudsmen Coordinators from AR; IL; KY; MD; TN;  UT; and Washington, D.C.,  and with officials who were present at  The ESGR\u2019s Basic Ombudsman Training Session held in Meridian, MS.", "To gauge the impact of the ESGR\u2019s ombudsmen program, we conducted a  survey of ombudsmen nationwide. We wished to survey all ombudsmen  who were available to handle servicemember complaints as of April 6, 2005  (the \u201ctarget\u201d population).  To do this, we obtained the list that the ESGR  was using to assign USERRA complaints to ombudsmen on that date (the  \u201cstudy\u201d population), which presumably included all of the individuals who  were available to handle complaints. We conducted seven pretests of our  ombudsmen questionnaire prior to administering the survey.  During the  pretests we asked the ombudsmen whether (1) the survey questions were  clear, (2) the terms used were precise, and (3) the questions were unbiased.  We made changes to the content and format of the final questionnaire  based on pretest results.", "The ombudsmen surveys were conducted using self-administered  electronic questionnaires posted on the World Wide Web.  The survey  questionnaire consisted of 12 questions, and asked ombudsmen how many  USERRA complaints they had received and personally resolved. (App. V  contains a copy of the survey and the survey results.) On May 3, 2005, we  used a list supplied by the ESGR headquarters to send E-mail notifications  to 831 ombudsmen in 54 states and territories to inform them that a survey  would be forthcoming. Then, on May 9, 2005, we activated the survey,  sending each of the 831 members of the study population a unique  password and username by E-mail so they could enter and complete the  Web-based questionnaire. To encourage ombudsmen to respond, we sent  two additional E-mail messages over the following 3 weeks.  Those  ombudsmen who were unable to complete the survey online were given the  option to respond via fax, phone, or mail.  We closed the survey on June 9,  2005.", "Although all members of the study population were surveyed, not every  member replied to our survey.  Specifically, 618 of the 831 members of the  study population replied.  In addition, 52 of the 618 respondents were out of  scope because they indicated they were not serving as volunteer  ombudsmen as of April 6, 2005.  Table 2 contains a summary of the survey  disposition for the surveyed cases.  The response rate for our survey was 74  percent.", "We obtained responses from volunteer ombudsmen across the country.   Although the response rate of ombudsmen differed somewhat across  states, we have no reason to expect that the responses on the issues  studied in our survey would be associated with the ombudsmen\u2019s states.  Therefore, our analysis of the survey data treats the respondents as a  simple random sample of the population of the ESGR volunteer  ombudsmen across the country.", "Assuming that the respondents constitute a random sample from the study  population, the particular sample of ombudsmen we obtained was only one  of a large number of such samples that we might have obtained.  To  recognize the possibility that other samples might have yielded other  results, we express our confidence in the precision of our particular  sample\u2019s results as a 95 percent confidence interval.  Unless otherwise  noted, the percentage estimates from the survey have a margin of error of  plus or minus 3 percent or less with a 95 percent level of confidence.  All  numerical estimates other than percentages have a margin of error of plus  or minus 14 percent or less of the value of those numerical estimates with a  95 percent level of confidence, unless otherwise noted.", "The practical difficulties of conducting any survey may introduce errors,  commonly referred to as nonsampling errors. For example, difficulties in  how a particular question is interpreted, in the sources of information that  are available to respondents, or in how the data are entered into a database  or were analyzed, can introduce unwanted variability into the survey  results. We took steps in the development of the questionnaire, the data  collection, and the data analysis to minimize these nonsampling errors.  For  example, social science survey specialists designed the questionnaire in  collaboration with GAO staff with subject matter expertise. Then, the draft  questionnaire was pretested to ensure that the questions were clearly  stated and easy to comprehend. When the data were analyzed, a second,  independent analyst checked all computer programs. Since this was a Web- based survey, most respondents entered their answers directly into the  electronic questionnaire. This eliminated the need to have the data keyed  into a database, thus removing an additional source of error. A GAO analyst  entered responses into our database from those ombudsmen who were  unable to complete the survey on-line and responded via fax, phone, or  mail. All these data were independently verified by a second analyst to  ensure their accuracy.", "We also assessed the reliability of the data from the May 2004, Status of  Forces Survey of Reserve Component Members, by (1) interviewing agency  officials from    the Defense Manpower Data Center, Washington, D.C., and   the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Reserve Affairs, Washington,  who were knowledgeable about the data, (2) reviewing existing  information about the data and the system that produced them, and  (3) performing electronic testing of required data elements.  The response  rate for the survey was 39 percent. To the extent that respondents and  nonrespondents had different opinions on the questions asked, the  estimates from this survey have the potential to be biased. DOD has  previously conducted and reported on research to assess the impact of  response rate on overall estimates. DOD found that, among other  characteristics, junior enlisted personnel (E1 to E4), servicemembers who  do not have a college degree, and members in services other than the Air  Force, were more likely to be nonrespondents. We have no reason to  believe that potential nonresponse bias not otherwise accounted for by  DOD\u2019s research is substantial for the variables we studied in this report. All  percentage estimates cited from the survey have sampling errors of plus or  minus 2.3 percentage points or less, unless otherwise noted.  The at least 72  percent of National Guard and Reserve members who never sought  assistance for their USERRA problems represents the lower bound of a 95  percent confidence interval around a point estimate (77 percent) that has a  plus or minus 5 percent margin of error.  Ranges cited from the survey  represent a 95 percent confidence interval around point estimates. We used  the weighting factors and the sampling error methodology provided by the  Defense Manpower Data Center to develop estimates and sampling error  estimates, and determined that the data from the May 2004 Status of Forces  Survey of Reserve Component Members were sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of this report.", "To asses the efficiency and effectiveness of federal educational outreach  efforts, we reviewed Section 4333 of Title 38 of the United States Code to  determine which agencies have outreach responsibilities under USERRA.  We interviewed agency officials to determine whether their agencies had  any significant educational outreach efforts. Although only two of the four  agencies we reviewed had outreach responsibilities under the law\u2014DOD  and DOL\u2014officials from three agencies said that they had significant  outreach activities\u2014DOD, DOL, and OSC. We obtained information about  each agency\u2019s activities, and analyzed the available outreach figures for  individual programs and total agency outreach. Because DOD has at least  nine different formal outreach programs, we devoted an entire appendix  (app. IV) to the details of DOD\u2019s programs. We also followed up on issues  related to the collection of servicemember employer information, which  we raised in our 2002 employer support report. Specifically, we reviewed  DOD\u2019s policy memoranda that were issued after our 2002 report and which  mandated that Ready Reserve members supply information about their  civilian employers. We also monitored and analyzed figures that showed  servicemember rates of compliance with the estimates from this survey on  these reporting requirements. These compliance figures covered each of  the reserve components and various reserve categories.", "To asses how efficiently and effectively DOD, DOL, DOJ, and OSC  addressed servicemember complaints, we obtained and analyzed  information about complaint processing practices, including applicable  guidance, regulations, or operations manuals. We also obtained and  reviewed the memorandums of understanding between DOL and DOJ,  OSC, and the ESGR. To further analyze the entire process, we gathered and  analyzed information about how the agencies share information from  USERRA complaint files with one another. We exported data from the  VETS USERRA Information Management System and analyzed the data to  look for trends in processing times. We specifically focused our analysis on  cases that had been closed and later reopened, and on cases that had been  referred from DOL to DOJ or OSC. We performed multiple sorts of the  entire data set, and data subsets, to determine whether there were any  common characteristics in complaint files from the group of complaints  that remained open for long time periods, or in the complaint files from the  group of complaints that were quickly resolved. For example, we sorted  complaint data by: type of employer, regional office, type of  servicemember, and type of complaint. We used many of the other more  than 70 data fields to perform data sorts but much of our analysis did not  yield reportable results because substantial amounts of information were  missing for certain data fields. However, our analysis of date fields was not  hampered by missing data and we were able to calculate elapsed times and  processing times from the available data.", "We assessed the reliability of formal complaint data provided by DOL, DOJ,  and OSC by (1) reviewing existing information about the data and the  systems that produced them and (2) interviewing and obtaining written  responses from agency officials knowledgeable about the data.  We  compared data obtained from DOJ and OSC to that captured in the DOL  USERRA Information Management System. We also compared data drawn  from DOL\u2019s USERRA Information Management System at different time  periods to determine the consistency of the data.  In addition, where  available, we compared information from 59 hard copy complaint files to  data recorded in the DOL system to assess how accurately information was  being entered into the database.  We also discussed informal complaint  data and its reliability with knowledgeable ESGR officials.  On the basis of  these assessments, we determined that the data were sufficiently reliable  for the purposes of this report, though agency data systems had some  limitations that we discussed in the report.", "We conducted our work from October 2004 through August 2005 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Professional Backgrounds of the ESGR\u2019s Volunteer Ombudsmen", "paragraphs": ["Between May 9, 2005, and June 9, 2005, we surveyed the ESGR\u2019s volunteer  ombudsmen who were available to handle servicemember complaints as of  April 6, 2005.

Tables 2  shows that about 58 percent of the volunteer ombudsmen were employed  in full-time jobs, and about 30 percent were retired.", "Table 3 shows the distribution of ombudsmen by their primary employers.  About 44 percent worked for the government or military, and about 56  percent worked for private employers, including the approximately 21  percent who were self-employed.", "In addition to the general background employment questions, our survey  asked respondents to specify their occupations or backgrounds that they  felt were particularly relevant to their ombudsmen duties.

Currently in its first year, the 5-Star Program seeks to get  employers more actively involved in the management of their National  Guard and Reserve employees.

They also provide employers with opportunities to observe military  training, some of which may be directly related to their employees\u2019  civilian jobs.
