The broader National Resources Inventory is an inventory of land cover and use, soil erosion, prime farmland, wetlands, and other natural resource characteristics on nonfederal lands in the United States. It provides a record of the nation\u2019s conservation accomplishments and future program needs. The National Resources Inventory has been conducted at 5-year intervals to determine the conditions and trends in the use of soil, water, and related resources nationwide and statewide. However, it is now making the transition to an annualized inventory process.", "Each inventory uses the wetlands data it collects to produce estimates of the nation\u2019s remaining wetlands acreage and the rate of wetlands gains and losses. The estimates made by each inventory are based on sampling. However, the two inventories use different sampling techniques and their estimates cover different time periods. The inventories also have used different land-cover/land-use classifications categories for the causes of wetlands losses. Although both reported that the rate of wetlands loss has declined, as shown in table 1, the estimates produced by FWS\u2019 National Wetlands Inventory and NRCS\u2019 National Resources Inventory are not completely consistent.", "As the table shows, the two inventories differ, sometimes substantially, in their estimates. Although the two inventories\u2019 estimates of the nation\u2019s total remaining wetlands acreage varied only about 10 percent, their estimates in other categories varied more significantly. For example, FWS reported that agricultural activities were responsible for the loss of over 1.4 million acres of wetlands\u2014more than 4 times the loss attributed to agriculture by NRCS. NRCS, on the other hand, estimated that development was responsible for the loss of 886,000 acres\u2014about 11 times the number of acres that FWS reported.", "Questions have been raised about the validity of the wetlands acreage estimates made by both inventories. Officials from each of the agencies responsible for the inventories have questioned the estimates made by the other, and officials from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have expressed concern about the estimates of both inventories.

For example, depending upon the agency, the term \u201crestoration\u201d has different meanings and different results. At Interior\u2019s FWS, restoration is considered the reestablishment of a degraded wetland to its former state and therefore generally would not result in a net gain of wetlands acres. At Agriculture\u2019s NRCS, restoration is considered to be the reestablishment of a wetland where it previously existed and would result in a gain of wetlands acres.", "The agencies also often include nonwetlands acreage when reporting their accomplishments. Nonwetlands acreage, such as adjacent uplands, are often included in wetlands project totals but are not identified or listed separately. For example, the NRCS\u2019 Wetlands Reserve Program, which acquires wetlands easements from landowners and shares in the cost of restoration, might report that a wetlands restoration project restored a total of 25 acres. However, the 25 acres reported might include not only 10 acres of former wetlands that were restored but also 10 acres of existing degraded wetlands whose functions were enhanced and 5 acres of adjacent uplands. The FWS\u2019 North American Wetlands Conservation Program also includes nonwetlands acreage in its project totals. Program officials estimate that about 75 percent of the acreage reported by habitat restoration projects are uplands.", "Adding to these reporting problems is the double counting of accomplishments. Federal and state agencies and private conservation organizations are often involved in joint projects. When each reports the accomplishments resulting from these joint projects, the actual accomplishment is overstated. For example, the total number of wetlands acres that FWS\u2019 North American Waterfowl Management Plan reports as restored includes the results of activities that involve FWS and other federal agencies, such as the Forest Service and the NRCS, and other state and private conservation organizations.

However, to further clarify the roles of the various federal agencies in wetlands-related activities, we revised the caption in the report to highlight that agencies are involved to varying degrees and included a statement in this section to indicate the nature of the wetlands-related activities of the other 30 agencies. 2. We reviewed the administration\u2019s national wetlands plan during the course of our work and made several references to it in our report. However, we did not include a more in-depth discussion of the plan because the administration\u2019s national wetlands plan dealt primarily with streamlining and improving the wetlands regulatory program, not improving wetlands data. 3. The report acknowledged not only the different mandates and methods used by the National Wetlands Inventory and the National Resources Inventory, but also recognized that both have reported a decline in the rate of wetlands loss. However, as we point out, the estimates of wetlands acreage made by the two inventories are not completely consistent\u2014a fact also recognized in the administration\u2019s Clean Water Action Plan. Furthermore, the previous efforts of interagency task forces as well as the current efforts by the Interagency Wetlands Working Group, taken in response to the Clean Water Action Plan, emphasize the need to reconcile the differences in the estimates of the two inventories.", "We added information to the report recognizing the effort undertaken by the Interagency Wetlands Working Group to reconcile the two inventories and produce a single wetlands status and trends report. We also included a copy of the Interagency Wetlands Working Group\u2019s May 1998 action plan in appendix VII. 4. The agencies provided editorial changes, technical corrections, and clarifying information that have been incorporated in our final report where appropriate. 5. We revised the report to reflect the development of the Interagency Wetlands Working Group\u2019s May 1998 action plan. This plan addresses how one of the three actions intended to improve wetlands data contained in the administration\u2019s 1998 Clean Water Action Plan will be accomplished. Details of how the other actions will be accomplished have not been developed. 6. We did not revise the title or first sentence of this section as suggested by EPA. However, its comment indicates that EPA generally agrees that the consistency and reliability of wetlands acreage data reported by federal agencies are questionable. 7. We revised this sentence to clarify our point that the estimates produced by the two inventories are not completely consistent. As we previously noted, the report already acknowledges the different mandates and methods used by the National Wetlands Inventory and the National Resources Inventory as well as recognizing that both have reported a decline in the rate of wetlands loss. 8. The numbers shown in table 1 were provided by FWS and NRCS, respectively. The numbers shown in this table served as the basis for FWS\u2019 September 17, 1997, news/press release in which the Service reported that the annual rate of wetlands loss had declined to about 117,000 acres. Subsequent to receiving agency comments on our draft report, we contacted FWS and were told that the FWS numbers shown in the table were correct and had not been withdrawn. However, FWS noted that in its final report only one wetlands loss number will be shown. The losses attributed to the various causes, e.g., agriculture, development, etc., will not be reported. In addition, as we have previously noted, we revised our report to reflect the recent efforts undertaken by the Interagency Wetlands Working Group to reconcile the differences in the two inventories\u2019 estimates and produce a single wetlands status and trends report. 9. The information presented in this section is merely to provide the purpose(s) for which the various task forces were established. Therefore, we did not add the additional material provided by EPA. 10. We did not revise the title of our report because we believe that it accurately reflects the current situation. Although we recognize that the administration has recently undertaken efforts to resolve the wetlands data problems identified in our report, these actions will not be completed for several years. 11. The estimates presented in our report for the NRI are the 1982-1992 NRI wetlands estimates. As noted in our report, questions and concerns about the NRI\u2019s 1992 estimates were raised by officials from both the National Wetlands Inventory and EPA. 12. The section in question provides supporting details for our finding that the consistency and reliability of the estimates made by the two federal resource inventories and the data reported by the agencies on their accomplishments are questionable. USDA may be correct in its assertion that users of inventory data incorrectly add figures to the inventory estimates and cause overstating of accomplishments. However, as this section points out, the current reporting practices of the agencies include the double counting of accomplishments as well as a lack of consistency in the use of terms and the inclusion of nonwetlands acreage. 13. We revised the report to reflect the development of an action plan by the Interagency Wetlands Working Group. However, although the action plan addresses one of the actions contained in the administration\u2019s Clean Water Action Plan\u2014the development of a single wetlands status and trends report\u2014it does not address how the administration plans to accomplish the other actions it announced. In addition, the success of the Working Group\u2019s efforts will require a long-term commitment as well as considerable time and effort by the agencies. We have therefore revised our conclusions to reflect that although the administration has undertaken efforts, much remains to be done before the administration has resolved the wetlands data problems identified in our report. 14.
