This program, commonly known as AmeriCorps, is administered by a new federal Corporation for National and Community Service (the Corporation) that combined two independent agencies\u2014the Commission on National and Community Service and ACTION. For AmeriCorps*USA grants and national service education awards, the Corporation\u2019s budget was about $249 million in fiscal year 1994, and the administration has requested about $619 million for fiscal year 1996. In congressional testimony, the Corporation estimated AmeriCorps*USA\u2019s cost per participant at $18,800 for 1995 operations. The Corporation did not include contributions that AmeriCorps*USA grantees receive from other federal agencies, state and local governments, and private sources. Not knowing the total resource commitment currently supporting AmeriCorps*USA programs led to concern on the part of some members of Congress about authorizing significantly higher program appropriations.", "Because of this concern, you asked us to provide information on the public and private resources currently being used to support the Corporation\u2019s AmeriCorps*USA program. In addition, you asked us to express those resources on a per-participant and per-service-hour basis, considering the program\u2019s different resource streams. Because most programs will not complete an entire operating year before September 1995, we agreed to report on the amount of funds and in-kind contributions available for expenditure to support AmeriCorps*USA participants. In the absence of actual cost data, this information may be indicative of the level of federal and other resources that ultimately will support AmeriCorps*USA participants each year. Finally, you asked us to provide information on AmeriCorps*USA\u2019s program objectives and anticipated benefits along with examples of achievements to date.", "In developing our information on resources available for the AmeriCorps*USA program, we identified both the amount and source of funding devoted to supporting AmeriCorps*USA grantees\u2019 programs for program year 1994-95. As a first step, we held extensive meetings with Corporation officials; examined legislation establishing the Corporation and national service programs; and reviewed Corporation program policies, guidance, and reports as well as its program evaluation plans.", "At the Corporation, we reviewed grant files for all grantees\u2019 programs the Corporation told us received fiscal year 1994 appropriations. Each file typically included the application submitted by the AmeriCorps*USA grantee, the amount of the grant award, and matching contributions proposed and budgeted by the grantee. The Corporation grant files, however, did not contain information on the source of these matching contributions. To obtain detailed information on matching contributions, we constructed a random sample of 80 nonfederal AmeriCorps*USA grantees. For each program in our sample, we collected information as of May 1995 from project administrators on the amounts, sources, and types of resources\u2014cash versus in-kind contributions\u2014obtained or certain to be received by the end of the program year to match Corporation grant funds. In addition, we collected information on the number of currently enrolled participants and the number of additional participants the grantees expected to enroll before the end of the first program year. The data we received were self-reported by program officials and not independently verified with other sources. We used this information to project the amount and source of resources available and the number of participants involved in AmeriCorps*USA programs nationwide. Our sample was drawn to make the results statistically representative of the 284 grantee programs administered by nonprofit, state, and local organizations. At the 95-percent confidence level, our estimates have a sampling error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.", "Because of the small number of federal sponsors, we collected resource information from all 13 federal agencies that were grantees. We met with agency officials and obtained information on the amounts, sources, and types of funding and in-kind contributions used to support their programs and the number of participants enrolled and expected to be enrolled.", "Finally, we visited seven judgmentally selected AmeriCorps*USA grantees\u2019 programs in Maryland, Massachusetts, Vermont, and Washington. These programs represented a mix of grantee characteristics, such as mission and scale, and our visits provided insight into program operations, actual sources of funds, and program benefits.", "Appendix I provides a more detailed description of the methodology we used to obtain and analyze funding information, along with data and analysis limitations.

For fiscal year 1994, the Congress appropriated $370 million for the Corporation plus $207 million for programs under the former ACTION agency that the Corporation now administers."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The AmeriCorps*USA Program", "paragraphs": ["AmeriCorps*USA allows participants to earn education awards to help pay for postsecondary education in exchange for performing community service that matches priorities established by the Corporation. Participants earn an education award of $4,725 for full-time service or half of that amount for part-time service. A minimum of 1,700 hours of service within a year is required to earn the full $4,725 award. The Corporation requires that programs devote some portion, but no more than 20 percent, of participants\u2019 service hours to nondirect service activities, such as training or studying for the equivalent of a high school diploma. To earn a part-time award, a participant must perform 900 hours of community service within 2 years (or within 3 years in the case of participants who are full-time college students). Individuals can serve more than two terms; however, they can only receive two education awards. The awards, which are held in trust by the U.S. Treasury, are paid directly to qualified postsecondary institutions or student loan lenders and must be used within 7 years after service is completed.", "In addition to the education award, AmeriCorps*USA participants receive a living allowance stipend that is at least equivalent to, but no more than double, the average annual living allowance received by VISTA volunteers\u2014about $7,640 for full-time participants in fiscal year 1994. Additional participant benefits include health insurance and child care assistance for participants who need them.", "Individuals can join a national service program before, during, or after postsecondary education. A participant must be 16 or older and be a citizen, a national, or a lawful permanent resident of the United States. A participant must also be a high school graduate, agree to earn the equivalent of a high school diploma before receiving an education award, or be granted a waiver by the program. Selection of participants is not based on financial need. In its fiscal year 1994 appropriations, the Corporation anticipated fielding about 18,350 full- and part-time AmeriCorps*USA participants."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "AmeriCorps*USA Grantees", "paragraphs": ["The Corporation awarded about $149 million of its fiscal year 1994 appropriations to make about 300 grants to nonprofit organizations and federal, state, and local government agencies to operate AmeriCorps*USA programs. About two-thirds of the grant dollars were awarded through state commissions on national service set up by the 1993 act to provide oversight to state programs. The remaining one-third of the AmeriCorps*USA grant monies was awarded directly by the Corporation to national nonprofit organizations and federal agencies. Grantees were to be selected on the basis of their proposed national service programs\u2019 quality, innovation, and sustainability. Sustainability was evaluated on the basis of community support for a program and a grantee\u2019s ability to raise other funds from multiple sources, including the private sector.", "Grant recipients use grant funds to pay up to 85 percent of the cost of participants\u2019 living allowances and benefits (up to 100 percent of child care expenses) and up to 75 percent of other program costs, including participant training, education, and uniforms; staff salaries, travel, transportation, supplies, and equipment; and program evaluation and administrative costs. Grants are based in part on the number of participants the program estimates it will enroll during the year. If participants leave the program during the year, the Corporation may either allow the program to redirect participant stipend and benefit funds to other program expenses or take back any unused portion of the grant. To ensure that federal Corporation dollars are used to leverage other resources for program support, grantees must also obtain support from non-Corporation sources to help pay for the program. This support, which can be cash or in-kind contributions, may come from other federal sources as well as state and local governments, and private sources. In-kind contributions include personnel to manage AmeriCorps*USA programs as well as to supervise and train participants; office facilities and supplies; and materials and equipment needed in the course of conducting national service projects.", "Consistent with the legislation, federal agencies can receive grants to support AmeriCorps*USA volunteers who perform work furthering the agencies\u2019 missions. Federal agency grantees are to use their own resources in addition to the Corporation grant to integrate national service more fully into their mission work. Furthermore, as is the case with nonfederal agency programs, Corporation regulations state that federal agencies are ultimately intended to support their service initiatives without Corporation resources."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "AmeriCorps*USA Primarily Supported by Public Resources", "paragraphs": ["In its first program year, AmeriCorps*USA relied heavily on public support. The Corporation\u2019s appropriations accounted for slightly less than two-thirds of resources available for AmeriCorps*USA grantees. When Corporation appropriations were combined with resources from other federal agencies and state and local governments, the public sector provided about 88 percent of the $351 million in total program resources available. Federal resources accounted for 74 percent (about $260 million), while state and local government contributions made up 14 percent ($50 million). Private cash and in-kind contributions constituted the smallest share of resources, amounting to about 12 percent (or about $41 million).", "Most of the Corporation\u2019s funding for AmeriCorps*USA projects went to providing operating grants and education awards. Of the Corporation\u2019s funding, 61 percent financed operating grants. Slightly over one-quarter supported participants\u2019 education awards, while the remainder went toward Corporation program management and administration.", "Most of the matching contributions AmeriCorps*USA programs have received came from public as opposed to private sources. About 69 percent of all matching resources came from either a federal or a state or local government source, with the split between cash and in-kind contributions being about 43 percent (about $57 million) and 26 percent (about $34 million), respectively. The remaining 31 percent of matching resources were from private sources, with cash and in-kind contributions accounting for 17 percent (about $23 million) and 14 percent (about $18 million), respectively.", "In calculating resources available on a per-participant and per-service-hour basis (see table 1), we found that average resources available from all sources per AmeriCorps*USA participant amounted to about $26,654 (excluding in-kind contributions from private sources). This amounted to about $16 per service hour or about $20 per direct service hour, assuming 20 percent of the 1,700 hours of total service was nondirect service time. Although these figures represent resources available for all program expenses, they are not the equivalent of annual salaries or hourly wages for participants. See appendix II for more detailed results and appendix III for sampling error and sensitivity analysis results.", "It is important not to equate our funding information with cost data. Because most AmeriCorps*USA programs are still in their first year of operations, actual cost cannot yet be determined. Funding and in-kind contributions from sources other than the Corporation were reported to us in May 1995 as resources already received or those that program directors were certain of receiving by the end of their current operating year. Therefore, actual resource and expenditure levels may prove to be higher or lower than indicated by the estimates reported to us.", "During the course of our review, Corporation officials expressed several concerns about our calculations. First, they believed our estimate should be adjusted to reflect start-up costs incurred in the first program year. The Corporation\u2019s position was that because AmeriCorps*USA programs incur initial-year start-up costs that will not recur in the future, first-year costs will be overstated unless start-up costs are capitalized over several years.", "We did not attempt to systematically identify start-up costs since we focused on resource availability and not cost data. Moreover, during our site visits, we saw little evidence of start-up costs so high that, unless capitalized, they would cause a significant distortion. Most start-up costs consisted of intangible items, such as curricula development and program planning, rather than conventional capital acquisitions like buildings and machinery.", "Second, Corporation officials said it is likely that not all education award money will be used. Thus, they believed our estimate for education award funding may be overstated. However, we found no reliable data or basis to make such an estimate to adjust our per-participant estimates. We have included the full value of the awards in our calculations because the Congress appropriates funds specifically for these awards and the funds are held in trust and available to those who earn them for 7 years. Moreover, our methodology is identical to the way the Corporation calculates its own cost estimates.", "Third, Corporation officials believed our per-hour calculations are overstated. The Corporation believes participants will complete substantially more than the 1,700 service hours required by law. As support, they provided us information on participants serving in the VISTA program and preliminary figures about some participants who have completed their AmeriCorps*USA service. We used the 1,700 figure because this is the minimum established by law, and program participants are required to only attain, not exceed, it. Also, from discussions with officials at the seven programs visited, we found that while some participants might exceed these hours, many others would have difficulty meeting the requirement. This is particularly true in programs that started later in the year than expected. In addition, we do not consider the VISTA participant data appropriate because VISTA is a different type of program, with participation requirements and target populations that differ from AmeriCorps*USA\u2019s. The data the Corporation provided on AmeriCorps*USA participants was based on about 1,000 of an estimated 18,350 current AmeriCorps*USA participants, or about 5 percent. These participants may not be representative of those still serving.", "The Corporation also believes participants will spend substantially less than 20 percent of their service hours on nondirect service activities. In calculating resources per direct service hour, we used 80 percent of the total 1,700 hours (or 1,360 hours) as the basis for estimating direct service. While we recognize that the Corporation\u2019s regulations make 20 percent the maximum amount of service time that may be spent on training, programs we visited appeared likely to use the full 20 percent for training. In addition, because programs have not all completed their first year, the Corporation could not provide us with data on the portion of time spent on nondirect service."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Agency Programs Are Most Resource Intensive", "paragraphs": ["We found significant differences in levels of resources available for nonfederal versus federal programs (see table 2).

In contrast, programs sponsored by federal agencies received about $31,000 in cash and in-kind contributions per participant\u2014about 20 percent more than programs administered by nonfederal grantees. In addition, federal agencies relied far more on non-Corporation federal resources than their counterparts. On average, federal agency grantees had about $15,500 in cash and in-kind contributions available per participant from federal sources other than the Corporation. Non-Corporation federal funds accounted for about 50 percent of total resources available to federal grantees.

We observed participants renovating inner-city housing, assisting teachers in elementary schools, maintaining and reestablishing native vegetation in a flood control area, analyzing neighborhood crime statistics to better target prevention measures, and developing a program in a community food bank for people with special dietary needs.

For example, a multifamily house being renovated was formerly a congregating spot for drug dealers. Program officials believe that after completion, it will encourage other neighborhood improvements. Another team built a community farm market and renovated a municipal stadium, both of which a town official stated will continue to provide economic and social benefits to the community.", "Another way to meet this objective was to have participants with diverse backgrounds working together. Participants of several programs we visited spanned a wide age range, from teenagers to retirees. Teams also showed diversity in educational, economic, and ethnic backgrounds.

We saw evidence of this at programs such as one where participants devoted half of each Friday to working on community service projects they devise and carry out independently. Participants at another program, in which they organized meetings to establish relationships between at-risk youth and elderly people, commented that this work had taught them how to organize programs, experience they believed would be helpful as they took on roles in their communities. Training periods included conflict resolution techniques and team-building skills."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Expanding Opportunities", "paragraphs": ["Both the AmeriCorps legislation and the Corporation\u2019s mission identified expanding opportunities as an objective. In practice, individuals who participate in national service have their educational opportunities expanded by the education awards, which help them pursue higher education or job training. At the sites we visited, participants indicated that the education award was an important part of their decision to participate in AmeriCorps*USA.", "Programs also supported participants in obtaining high school degrees or the equivalent. According to Corporation regulations, a full-time participant who does not have a high school diploma or its equivalent generally must agree to earn one or the other before using the education award. In one program, a general equivalency diploma (GED) candidate was receiving classroom instruction and individual tutoring. She had recently passed the preliminary GED test after failing the GED test five times. After doing some extra preparation for the math portion, she will take the actual GED test again. A larger program that recruited at-risk youth, most of whom do not have high school degrees, provided classroom instruction related to the service that participants performed, such as a construction-based math curriculum. Program officials said most of the participants are enrolled in high school equivalency courses and that at least five have already passed the GED test.", "We also saw programs that offer participants the chance to get postsecondary academic credit. One such program, affiliated with a private college, offered participants the option of pursuing an environmental studies curriculum through which they can earn up to six upper-level credits at a reduced tuition. Half of the participants have chosen to do so. A second program allowed participants to earn 36 credit hours toward an associate\u2019s degree in the natural sciences through their service, which can lead to state certification as an environmental restoration technician.", "In addition to formal education opportunities, some participants said they were attracted to AmeriCorps*USA programs because the programs provide service in specific fields. We spoke with several participants who wanted experience in those fields to improve their skills and expand their opportunities. For example, a community policing program attracted 15 participants who are pursuing law enforcement careers. Similarly, in a youth conservation corps program in which most participants have environmental science degrees, many participants sought practical experience to complement their formal education.", "For more detailed results from our site visits, see appendix V."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["In commenting on a draft of this report, the Corporation agreed with the amount we reported as federal (Corporation and non-Corporation) cash resources made available to AmeriCorps*USA programs.

Other program resources we included were in-kind resources provided by federal agencies and cash and in-kind resources provided by state and local governments as well as by private contributors. The Corporation also disagreed with the methodology we employed to develop and report on total available resources per participant and per service hour. The Corporation believed we should have excluded resources other than federal cash from our calculations because these resources were not a burden to the federal taxpayer, AmeriCorps*USA programs were legally required to obtain these resources, and these resources should have been considered benefits rather than costs.", "As we have clearly noted in our report, our objective was not to determine whether AmeriCorps*USA was cost-effective. We drew no conclusions about the cost of the program, the value of program benefits, or whether the program was meeting its objectives. Contrary to the Corporation\u2019s view, we believed that ignoring significant amounts of AmeriCorps*USA program resources would undermine the importance that these resources play in fielding AmeriCorps*USA participants. In our view, an accounting of the total resources available to support an AmeriCorps*USA participant provides a useful perspective on the program. This report presents the only information available to date on total resources available to AmeriCorps*USA programs nationwide and captures this information by resource stream\u2014that is, by federal, state and local, and private sources.

The Corporation raised concerns about our including private cash contributions, in-kind resources, and any state or local government resources in our calculations because in its view these resources represent benefits, not an additional cost to the federal government. Our objective, however, as clearly stated in the report, was not to identify what is or is not a cost or benefit but rather to identify the various resources available to AmeriCorps*USA programs, including all nonfederal funds and other support.", "In the report, we categorized all resources by their sources. For example, those resources provided by nongovernment sources were labeled as private cash and in-kind contributions. Similarly, in-kind contributions from all levels of government were identified separately from cash contributions. These resources, which are permitted to be counted toward the programs\u2019 required match, included such things as salaries of federal agency personnel who monitored AmeriCorps*USA programs and administered grants, state natural resource managers\u2019 time to supervise participants, and uniforms provided by a local police department. By including these contributions, we were recognizing that they represent resources available to the programs\u2014resources on which those programs depend. 2. The Corporation noted that in our calculations we assumed all participants will use their full education awards. We included the full education award amount as resources available because the Congress appropriates funds specifically for this purpose and funds are held in trust and available to those who earn them for 7 years. Interestingly, in calculating its own cost estimates, the Corporation used the full education award amount, too. Even if we had wanted to predict actual education award usage, there was insufficient experience with the program to date to do so, as the Corporation noted in its response. 3. The Corporation raised three concerns with the methodology we used to develop a calculation of resources per direct service hour: (1) we used the minimum required service hours\u20141,700 hours; (2) we reduced the 1,700-service-hour figure by 20 percent in calculating direct service hours; and (3) we did not include service hours worked by related but uncompensated volunteers.", "We used the 1,700-hour figure because it was the minimum established by law and participants were only required to attain it, not exceed it. Although at the time of our site visits comprehensive data were not available on completed service hours, the data we were able to collect on participants indicated that while some would exceed the required 1,700 hours, many others would need to put in extra hours to meet the requirement. Regarding the specific information the Corporation provided on the Washington Service Corps in an enclosure to its letter, the average of more than 1,800 hours worked may represent the experience only of early completers. As we stated in the report (see p. 9), early information on those completing the program may not be indicative of results of programs that are still under way. Information from our site visits indicated that when considering all participants, it is likely the average will be closer to 1,700 hours.", "We reduced total service hours by 20 percent in calculating direct service hours because the Corporation allows programs to allocate that amount of time to education, training, or similar activities. Several programs we visited were on track to spend 20 percent of their service time on such activities. Recognizing that the Corporation does not yet have actual data on the portion of time spent on nondirect service, we used the allowed amount in our calculations. In calculating resources per direct service hour, we included all resources, including those used on nondirect activities such as training, because those activities are an integral part of the program and required by legislation. The Corporation, in its comments, also recognized that nondirect service is a required part of the program. It follows that resources spent on nondirect service need to be included when analyzing resources per direct service hour. At the specific program the Corporation mentioned as devoting less than 20 percent of participants\u2019 time to nondirect service (the Washington Conservation Corps), formal training was expected to be about 10 percent of the required hours. However, that figure does not include additional informal training at worksites.", "In our calculations of resources per service hour, we did not include, as the Corporation suggested we should, hours worked by uncompensated volunteers who were not AmeriCorps*USA participants. Because our objective was to identify the resources needed to field an AmeriCorps*USA participant, including hours of service generated by other volunteers was not relevant. It should be noted that the Corporation in its own estimates of cost per participant did not include such volunteers. 4. The Corporation expressed concern that our estimate of $31,000 in available resources per participant at federal agency grantee programs was higher than its estimates. The Corporation suggested that our calculations did not discount resources for participant attrition. It provided data to us that showed an estimate of $27,600 per participant calculated by using programs\u2019 budgeted resources and expected numbers of participants\u2014data it obtained from grant files. Unlike the Corporation\u2019s estimate, ours was based on resources programs were certain to receive and actual numbers of participants that programs reported about halfway through the program year; we did adjust our estimate for participant attrition. Because the Corporation used expected participants, a higher figure than the actual number, its resources-per-participant figure was lower than ours. The example the Corporation presented (which it identified as the Vermont Anti-Hunger AmeriCorps program but whose figures related to the Vermont Youth Corps - National Service Academy program) indicated that the grantee, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), will reduce the resources it contributes to the program to reflect attrition. However, Youth Corps officials reported to us in June 1995 and confirmed in July 1995 that they expected to receive the full $450,000 in cash from USDA despite attrition. 5. The Corporation expressed several methodological concerns: (1) that many of the data we used were self-reported, (2) that programs may have overstated the resources they hoped to raise, and (3) that we \u201cexpensed\u201d start-up costs and capital costs in the first year. As to the first point, we used the only data available\u2014those which we obtained from the programs themselves\u2014because the Corporation did not have reliable data available. As to the second point, the data programs reported do not appear to be overestimated. In fact, the amount of non-Corporation resources the programs we sampled told us they expected to actually receive for the program year totaled only about 93 percent of the resources these programs\u2019 grant applications indicated that they would raise. As to the third point, in our report, we clearly stated why we chose to treat start-up costs as we did (see p. 8). Interestingly, the Corporation in its cost estimates included all expenses programs were expected to incur in the first year\u2014including start-up costs\u2014without allocating them over future periods. 6. The Corporation also was concerned about our inclusion of all resources available to programs when some may not be used and suggested that we should adjust the non-Corporation resources for participant attrition. We disagreed. We obtained our information in May 1995, late enough in the programs\u2019 operating year for them to predict available resources and participant levels. (In contrast, the Corporation\u2019s funding was committed to the programs at the start of the operating year before any participation rates were known; therefore, we chose to adjust the amount of these funds.) 7. The Corporation stated that it is not certain that all of the resources in the \u201cstate and local\u201d category are from public sources. Evidence we obtained showed that about 90 percent of the resources were clearly from public sources; the remaining 10 percent were from public postsecondary institutions. Given the reliance of public postsecondary institutions on public support, it was therefore appropriate in our view to categorize the resources they contributed to AmeriCorps*USA programs as public. In any event, our sensitivity analysis showed that categorizing resources from public postsecondary institutions as private resources had very little impact on our estimate (see app. III)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to those named above, the following individuals made important contributions to this report: C.
