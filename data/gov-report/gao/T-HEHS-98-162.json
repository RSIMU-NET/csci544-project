In 1996 we reported to you that beneficiaries received little or no comparative information on Medicare health maintenance organizations (HMO). Among other things, we recommended that HCFA produce plan comparison charts, require plans to use standard formats and terminology in key aspects of their marketing materials, and publicize readily available plan performance indicators such as disenrollment rates. In addition, Medicare+Choice provisions under the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) authorize new health plan options for Medicare beneficiaries and mandate that HCFA provide beneficiaries with comparative information about the Medicare+Choice options.", "My remarks today will focus on the extent to which HCFA\u2019s Medicare+Choice information development efforts are likely to (1) enable beneficiaries to readily compare benefits and out-of-pocket costs using plan brochures and (2) facilitate the agency\u2019s approval of plans\u2019 marketing materials and other administrative work required of both HCFA and the health plans. I am basing these remarks on our ongoing work for this Committee. I will also discuss the findings from our recent report on HMO disenrollment rates and how data that HCFA already collects, but does not publish, may be useful to beneficiaries.", "In summary, HCFA has begun making certain plan-specific information available to beneficiaries. For example, in March of this year, HCFA posted summary information on health plans\u2019 premiums, out-of-pocket costs, and benefits on the Internet. HCFA is also working to provide a printed version of this information directly to beneficiaries and meet other BBA information dissemination requirements.", "These efforts, however, do not address the problem beneficiaries face in trying to carefully evaluate their health plan choices using the plans\u2019 summaries of benefits and other marketing materials. These materials are a major source of health plan information. Currently, plans use widely varied formats and definitions of benefits in the materials they distribute to beneficiaries. As we reported in 1996, this lack of common formatting and language made it difficult, if not impossible, for beneficiaries to rely on HMOs\u2019 marketing literature to compare benefits and premiums. Preliminary results from our current work on HMOs\u2019 prescription drug benefit\u2014a benefit that attracts many Medicare beneficiaries to managed care\u2014suggest this situation continues to exist. Our current work also suggests that critical information is sometimes missing from plans\u2019 marketing materials.", "The diverse formats and terms also cause problems for health plans and HCFA staff. Without HCFA\u2019s specifying common standards for plans\u2019 marketing materials, agency staff have wide discretion when deciding to approve or reject these documents. Plan representatives and HCFA staff we spoke with said that this latitude leads to inconsistent HCFA decisions, unnecessary delays, and extra costs. The lack of required standards similarly affects the efficient development of comparative benefits information. Under current circumstances, agency staff must comb through dissimilar information submitted by plans for HCFA\u2019s contract approval process and contact the plans to clarify the information before producing benefit comparison summary charts.", "To help beneficiaries evaluate their health plan options, HCFA could move faster to publish readily available plan performance indicators such as plans\u2019 disenrollment rates. With this information, beneficiaries could then decide to seek more information about a plan before enrolling.", "HCFA could better serve beneficiaries, reduce burdens on health plans, and leverage its own resources by setting information standards for health plans\u2019 marketing literature. We believe, therefore, that HCFA should adopt the recommendations we made in 1996 and require plans to use standard formats and terminology in their benefit descriptions. In addition, HCFA should use plan performance data it already collects to help inform beneficiaries\u2019 health plan decisions."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Most beneficiaries live in areas where they can choose to receive Medicare benefits either through a managed care plan or through traditional fee-for- service Medicare. Of the 6 million beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare managed care, approximately 90 percent are in \u201crisk-contract\u201d HMOs.Medicare pays these HMOs a fixed, per beneficiary fee, regardless of what the HMO spends for each beneficiary\u2019s health care. These plans are called \u201crisk\u201d HMOs because the HMO assumes the financial risk of providing care for the amount Medicare pays.", "Although HMOs are required to cover all traditional Medicare benefits, many also provide additional services, such as outpatient prescription drugs, routine physical examinations, and hearing aids. In addition, plan costs can vary: some HMOs charge a monthly premium (in addition to Medicare\u2019s part B premium), but others do not. Except for emergency services, HMO enrollees must generally receive all covered care through health care professionals designated by their plans.", "The number of Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in risk HMOs has more than doubled in the last 3 years, from 2.3 million in December 1994 to 5.2 million in December 1997. The number of Medicare risk HMOs also increased, from 154 to 307, in the same time period. The growth in Medicare managed care enrollees and plans is expected to continue, fueled in part by the BBA, which provided for new types of Medicare managed care plans and increased plan payments in many areas that previously lacked a fee-for-service alternative.", "Unlike other large health care purchasing organizations, HCFA has not routinely provided plan-specific information directly to beneficiaries. However, the BBA now requires HCFA to distribute comparative information that can help beneficiaries interested in managed care select a health plan. In addition, HMOs will continue to advertise and distribute summaries of benefits as part of their marketing efforts to enroll new members.", "HCFA, through its regional offices, approves the HMOs\u2019 marketing materials before plans use them. HCFA regional offices also oversee HMO marketing and enrollment efforts by reviewing plans\u2019 sales practices and responding to beneficiaries\u2019 complaints. HMOs must include certain explanations in their marketing materials, such as provider restrictions, but otherwise have wide latitude in what information is included and how it is presented.", "Each year, as part of the contracting process, HMOs submit to HCFA detailed information on their proposed benefits, premiums, and other beneficiary out-of-pocket costs. HCFA\u2019s central office reviews these proposals for compliance with Medicare regulations and approves the contracts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Standard Benefit Descriptions Could Help Beneficiaries Compare Plans\u2019 Benefits and Ease Burden on Plans and Agency Staff", "paragraphs": ["Although HCFA has efforts under way to publish comparative information on Medicare+Choice plans, it has not taken the steps needed to enable beneficiaries to make similar comparisons using individual plans\u2019 marketing materials. The absence of standards for format and terminology used to describe benefits and out-of-pocket costs limits the usefulness of these materials for comparison purposes. Such standardization would help beneficiaries in comparing health plans and lessen the administrative burden on both HCFA and the plans.

In March 1998, HCFA made available a database it calls \u201cMedicare Compare,\u201d which posts summary information on the Internet comparing health plans\u2019 benefits and out-of-pocket costs. HCFA intends to update the database and add plan performance indicators as they become available in the coming months and years. In addition, HCFA plans to include comparison charts in the next Medicare Handbook to be mailed to beneficiaries.

In contrast, HCFA does not require Medicare HMOs to use standardized formats or terms, including definitions, in their marketing materials. Consequently, Medicare beneficiaries cannot easily use plans\u2019 marketing materials to compare benefit packages.", "Neither HCFA\u2019s Medicare HMO/Competitive Medical Plan (HMO/CMP) Manual nor its supplemental Medicare Managed Care National Marketing Guide requires standardization in plan materials. In fact, the manual, which provides guidance on the contents of plans\u2019 marketing materials and HCFA\u2019s process for reviewing these materials, specifically states, \u201cHCFA does not mandate a format or style for . . . marketing materials other than requiring that the member rules be written and that the marketing materials . . . be understandable to the average beneficiary.\u201d HCFA\u2019s marketing guidelines do contain model language and documents HMOs can adopt, but plans are not required to use the models. Without required standards from HCFA, HMOs are left to their individual discretion, as we reported in 1996.", "We recently asked the eight Medicare HMOs serving the Tampa, Florida, area to send us their marketing materials. We received a wide array of brochures, pamphlets, and other written documents. Although all plans provided benefit summaries, the formats and benefit categories varied considerably from plan to plan. This lack of consistency may impair a beneficiary\u2019s ability to compare benefits and related costs. For example, we found that only five Tampa plans mention mammograms in their benefit summaries\u2014even though all plans covered mammograms. Most plans listed mammograms under the benefit category of preventive services. One plan, however, listed mammograms under hospital outpatient services. Consistent presentation is important because beneficiaries may rely on plans\u2019 benefit summaries for coverage and out-of-pocket cost information. Beneficiaries typically do not receive more detailed benefit descriptions until after they enroll in a plan.", "The HMOs we reviewed also differed in the terms they used to describe the same benefit. Some plans used technical terms but did not define them. Consequently, beneficiaries could misinterpret important out-of-pocket costs or benefit restrictions. For example, some plans used the term \u201cformulary\u201d in describing their drug benefit but did not explain what it meant. Beneficiaries reading a plan\u2019s marketing materials may not understand that use of nonformulary drugs may result in substantially higher out-of-pocket costs. To learn what \u201cformulary\u201d means when it is not defined in the marketing literature, beneficiaries would have to ask plan representatives or read the plan\u2019s \u201cevidence of coverage\u201d\u2014a document normally provided to beneficiaries after they enroll in a plan."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Lack of Standards for Marketing Materials Can Result in Misleading Comparisons", "paragraphs": ["Seemingly straightforward benefit comparisons may be misleading because plans\u2019 marketing materials sometimes omit key details. Plan descriptions of prescription drug coverage, a benefit offered by many HMOs, illustrate how missing information can lead to erroneous conclusions about the value of plans\u2019 benefits.", "Under the best of circumstances, the relative value of plans\u2019 prescription drug coverage may be hard to compare. For example, plans that have formularies often set one copayment amount for formulary drugs and another, higher copayment for nonformulary drugs. Beneficiaries\u2019 out-of-pocket costs for such plans depend both on the specific drugs included in the formularies and the two copayment amounts.", "Beneficiaries may use a plan\u2019s stated annual dollar limit, or cap, to judge the drug benefit\u2019s consumer value. For example, beneficiaries may assume that an HMO offering prescription drug coverage up to a $1,200 annual cap has a more generous benefit than another HMO offering coverage up to $1,000. This comparison may be misleading, however. Plans differ in how they calculate the dollar amount of drugs used by beneficiaries. Some plans use retail prices to compute this amount. Others may use drugs\u2019 average wholesale prices (AWP) or a lower price discounted from AWP to calculate a member\u2019s total drug usage in dollars.", "One HMO gave us an illustration of how the value of a drug benefit depends on whether drug cost is measured by retail prices, AWP, or discounted AWP. The HMO used the drug Prilosec for the example because it is one of the brand-name drugs most commonly prescribed for its Medicare members. According to the plan, the retail price of Prilosec is $123 and the AWP is $101. The HMO said it computes the dollar amount of a member\u2019s Prilosec usage using a discounted AWP of about $91 per prescription. If the plan used AWP, or the even higher retail price, members would receive fewer prescriptions before reaching the annual dollar coverage limit. The consumer value of a drug benefit could vary substantially between two HMOs with the same annual cap if they used different prices to compute drug usage.", "In addition, HMOs\u2019 marketing materials do not always disclose key details that beneficiaries need to make accurate comparisons. For example, marketing materials from several Tampa HMOs did not mention what prices plans used (that is, retail, AWP, or some price below AWP) to compute the dollar amount of members\u2019 drug use. One-half of the plans did not disclose that their prescription benefits involve formularies. Similarly, plan materials often failed to inform members that they face higher out-of- pocket costs if they choose a brand-name drug when a generic drug is available."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Lack of Standards Slows HCFA Review of Plans\u2019 Marketing Materials", "paragraphs": ["HCFA\u2019s lack of standards for benefit descriptions also complicates HCFA\u2019s review of marketing materials and delays their distribution.

It does little to ensure that HCFA\u2019s regional office staff will review plans\u2019 marketing materials consistently and uniformly nationwide\u2014a problem we noted in 1996 when the guidelines were being developed.", "Individual HCFA staff have wide discretion in approving and rejecting plans\u2019 marketing materials. HMOs report that this discretion leads to inconsistent decisions and unnecessary delays in the development and distribution of plan materials. For example, plans report that HCFA reviewers frequently require changes to materials that were previously approved by other HCFA reviewers. These changes may delay printing or limit the use of materials already printed and increase plans\u2019 costs. Plans report being particularly disturbed by inconsistent HCFA decisions based on individual reviewers\u2019 preferences. For example, one reviewer may require a plan to use the term \u201ccontracting provider\u201d instead of \u201cparticipating provider,\u201d even though both terms are approved by HCFA\u2019s marketing guidelines. The rework caused by inconsistent reviews is time consuming and costly for both HCFA and the plans.", "HMO representatives reported that corporate purchasers often require plans to use standard language. The HMO representatives suggested that Medicare information standards could reduce the amount of time HCFA and plan staff spend reviewing and reworking marketing materials.

HCFA\u2019s Center for Health Plans and Providers reviews these packages and approves plans\u2019 Medicare contracts. However, HMOs are not required to conform to standard formats, language, or descriptions in their contract submissions. Consequently, it is difficult for the Center for Beneficiary Services (CBS), HCFA\u2019s new unit responsible for providing information to beneficiaries, to develop benefit comparison summaries from these contract submissions. Instead, CBS has to recontact HMOs and request benefit information for its own use. Moreover, HCFA regional offices, which must review plans\u2019 marketing materials for accuracy, cannot easily rely on contract submissions to confirm required premiums, copayments, and benefits.", "HCFA recognizes that the agency needs to standardize the information that plans submit for contract approval. HCFA staff said this would reduce the administrative burden on health plans and the agency. It addition, the agency could more readily produce comparison charts and check HMOs\u2019 marketing materials for accuracy.

Our analyses, contained in our 1996 report and our most recent report, showed that disenrollment rates vary widely among HMOs that serve the same market.

We also restated our recommendation that HCFA publish plans\u2019 disenrollment rates.", "Our most recent report shows that many HMOs nationwide had relatively high voluntary disenrollment rates. In many markets, the highest disenrollment rates exceeded the lowest rate by more than fourfold. In a few markets, the range in disenrollment rates was even wider. For example, in Houston, Texas, the highest disenrollment rate was nearly 56 percent, while the lowest rate was 8 percent.", "The BBA includes provisions requiring HCFA to publish plans\u2019 disenrollment rates. HCFA officials told us they intend to meet that requirement by publishing rates sometime in 1999. HCFA could act sooner, however, to provide this information to beneficiaries. Because HCFA already collects the necessary data, plans would not be burdened by providing additional data. HCFA could publish disenrollment rates this year. In fact, some HCFA regional offices have periodically distributed these data to HMOs. Medicare HMOs would have a strong incentive to improve their performance if HCFA published the disenrollment rates for all plans.", "Rates of complaints to HCFA from HMO enrollees can also indicate relative satisfaction levels.
