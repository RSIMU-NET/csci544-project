The intent of the survey was to identify, assess, and prioritize historic properties and to initiate a coordinated effort to support the restoration of the properties that were deemed the highest priority. However, only about half of the schools responded to the survey. The respondents identified 144 properties in need of restoration but were not asked to identify the cost of making the restorations.", "Because the response to this NPS initiative was low and the total funding requirements to restore the historic properties were not identified, you were concerned about whether sufficient information was available to prioritize the funding of restoration for historic properties at HBCUs. As a result, you asked us to provide information on (1) the number of historic properties located at the HBCUs and (2) the estimated cost to restore and preserve these properties. We also collected data on the methods used to estimate the costs and the credentials of those who prepared the cost estimates. To obtain this information, we sent a survey to all 103 HBCUs. Some of the historic property data and all of the estimated cost data presented in this report are based on self-reported data by the HBCUs. As discussed later in this report, self-reported data are subject to certain limitations.

The National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 authorized the National Register of Historic Places, the official list of the nation\u2019s districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects significant in American history, architecture, archeology, engineering, and culture. The National Register, administered by NPS, is part of a program to identify, evaluate, and protect the nation\u2019s cultural resources.", "Properties may be nominated for inclusion on the National Register by states and federal agencies. State nominations, which may be prepared by local citizens, are submitted to a state review board, which makes an approval/disapproval recommendation to the state historic preservation officer (SHPO). If the SHPO approves the nomination, it is forwarded to NPS to be considered for listing. If the nomination is approved by NPS, the property is officially entered on the National Register.", "In addition to their role in the nomination process, the SHPOs are responsible for surveying and evaluating properties within their states that they believe are eligible for the National Register. The National Register\u2019s criteria for evaluating properties include a determination that the property is significant in American history, architecture, archeology, engineering, and culture and that it possesses integrity of location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, and association. In addition, at least one of the following must be present for the property to be considered historic: (1) have an association with historic events or activities; (2) have an association with the lives of people significant in the nation\u2019s past; (3) have distinct characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction; be the work of a master; have high artistic values; or be a significant, distinguishable entity; or (4) have yielded, or may likely yield, information important about prehistory or history. In addition, the property generally has to be 50 years of age or more.", "The National Historic Preservation Act also established a program to provide matching grants to the states and other entities for the preservation and protection of properties on the National Register. Since the act went into effect in 1966, NPS has provided $4.3 million in grants appropriated by the Congress to HBCUs for restoring historic properties. In addition, the Congress authorized $29 million under the Omnibus Parks and Public Lands Management Act of 1996 to fund the restoration of historic properties at selected HBCUs. As of December 1, 1997, $4 million has been appropriated for this purpose.

These methods were an original feasibility report, an updated feasibility report, a contractor\u2019s quotation or proposal, a cost-estimating guidebook, a cost-per-square-foot calculation, and a Consumer Price Index inflator. If the schools used other methods, we asked them to explain what they were. An original or updated feasibility report is typically prepared by an architectural or engineering firm and generally describes what is feasible to restore and how much the work would cost. A contractor\u2019s quotation or proposal is an estimate prepared by a contractor to restore a property for the stated price or bid. A cost-estimating guidebook is a reference guide prepared by the architectural engineering industry that gives probable restoration costs by the type of work to be done, such as roof repair, and the materials used. The cost-per-square-foot method uses the industry\u2019s average restoration cost for a locality multiplied by the number of square feet that need to be restored. A Consumer Price Index inflator is a percentage increase each year based on the inflation rate; this method is used to adjust estimates that have already been prepared.", "Generally, the most comprehensive methods of estimating restoration costs would be an original or updated feasibility report, followed by a contractor\u2019s quotation or proposal. The cost-estimating guidebook, cost-per-square-foot, and Consumer Price Index inflator methods are generally less accurate because they represent guidance, or averages, rather than estimates on specific properties. Even though an original or updated feasibility report is most likely to be more accurate, some of the schools we visited stated that the cost of paying architect or engineering firms or contractors to provide such estimates was prohibitive and that the estimates could not be completed in the time necessary to respond to our survey. As a result, some schools used other methods, such as the cost-per-square-foot method, to avoid incurring excessive costs and still meet our survey deadline. It should be pointed out that estimating the amount of restoration and preservation needed can be a very complex undertaking. As a result, estimates, even those done by professionals under the best of circumstances, cannot be exact. Many restoration problems, particularly those involving major repairs or renovations, are not visible to the naked eye and may not be uncovered until the restoration actually takes place. In addition, cost estimates to restore and preserve properties are just that, estimates, and are subject to revisions until the work is completed.", "We asked the schools to identify whether one or a combination of methods was used in calculating their estimates. Of the 673 properties that had restoration costs (39 properties had none), 474 had estimates made using a single method, such as the cost-per-square-foot method.

We asked each HBCU to verify the existence of these properties, to delete properties that no longer existed or that the school never or no longer owned, and to add properties that the school believed met the criteria to be eligible for the National Register.

We requested that the estimate include only capital improvement costs and not normal day-to-day operating and maintenance costs. We also requested that the capital improvement costs include only costs after June 1, 1997. In other words, if an HBCU was restoring a property, expenditures prior to June 1, 1997, were not to be included in the estimate.
