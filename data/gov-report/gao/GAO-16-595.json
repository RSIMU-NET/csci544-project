However, the percentage of inspections resulting in warning letters remained relatively small as the number of inspections also increased. Moreover, seven establishments that were linked to widespread shortages and received warning letters all had previous indications of difficulty complying with manufacturing standards.", "Shortages of sterile injectable anti-infective and cardiovascular drugs in 2012, 2013, and 2014 were strongly associated with certain factors GAO examined. Two factors\u2014a decline in the number of suppliers and failure of at least one establishment making a drug to comply with manufacturing standards resulting in a warning letter\u2014suggest that shortages may be triggered by supply disruptions. A third factor\u2014drugs with sales of a generic version\u2014suggests that due to relatively low profit margins for generic drugs, manufacturers are less likely to increase production, making the market vulnerable to shortages.

When available drug supplies are insufficient to meet medical  needs, patient care may be adversely affected. Drugs in shortage include  those that are essential therapies, such as antibiotics, chemotherapy  agents, cardiovascular drugs, and pain medications. Shortages can result  in delayed patient care and medication errors. They may also result in  rationing, which can lead to the use of less effective treatments and force  providers to make difficult choices, such as deciding which cancer  patients should start or complete a round of chemotherapy.

In addition to this immediate cause, for our  2014 report, we conducted a literature review and from that we also  identified potential underlying causes of shortages that were particular to  the economics of the generic sterile injectable drug market, such as low  profit margins limiting infrastructure investments or leading some  manufacturers to exit the market. Also cited in the literature we reviewed  as causes of shortages were more rigorous inspections of drug  manufacturing establishments by FDA and an increase in warning letters  issued by the agency. Proponents of this view maintained that warning  letters caused shortages as establishments slowed or shut down  production in response to receiving the letters. Opponents of this view  counter that manufacturers encountered quality problems resulting from  noncompliance with manufacturing standards, which led to both the  issuance of these letters and shortages.", "To help address some shortages, regardless of the cause, FDA has  stated in its drug shortages strategic plan that it prioritizes its review of  submissions from drug sponsors seeking approval to bring a similar drug  to market. These submissions may include applications to market an  additional generic version of a drug in shortage or supplemental  applications, requests to make certain changes to already approved  generic or brand-name drug applications. An example of a supplemental  application requiring FDA approval would be one that adds a new  manufacturing site.", "Congress included a provision in the Food and Drug Administration  Safety and Innovation Act for us to review several different aspects of  drug shortages. Our February 2014 report examined these issues, and  this report continues to explore drug shortages and FDA\u2019s management  of them in more detail. Specifically, this report examines  1.  trends in recent drug shortages;  2.  FDA\u2019s prioritization of reviews of drug submissions to address drug  3.  trends in FDA warning letters issued to sterile injectable drug  manufacturing establishments for noncompliance with manufacturing  standards; and   4.  the relationship between certain factors and shortages in the sterile  injectable drug market.", "To examine trends in recent drug shortages, we analyzed data from the  University of Utah Drug Information Service (UUDIS) to identify drugs that  were in short supply from January 2010 through December 2015, which  were the most recent data available at the time we conducted our work.  These data are generally regarded as the most comprehensive and  reliable source of drug shortage information for the time period we  reviewed. Although UUDIS and FDA both track and maintain information  about drug shortages, we used the data maintained by UUDIS because  part of the time period we reviewed predates FDA\u2019s establishment of a  data tracking system. (See app. I for a comparison of FDA and UUDIS  drug shortage data.) UUDIS\u2019s data are also what we used in preparing  our 2011 and 2014 reports on drug shortages. We reviewed all UUDIS  data used for reasonableness, outliers, and consistency, and based on  our review, determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for our  purposes. We also obtained information from representatives of the 10  national associations representing health care providers, including  physicians and pharmacists that we interviewed for our 2014 report  regarding their experiences with drug shortages in recent years. We  asked them to respond to open-ended questions and did not  independently validate their responses.", "To examine FDA\u2019s prioritization of reviews of drug submissions to  address drug shortages, we analyzed data from FDA\u2019s Document  Archiving, Reporting, and Regulatory Tracking System on all  submissions\u2014drug applications and drug application supplements\u2014for  which FDA prioritized its review to address drug shortages. Specifically,  we analyzed all the submissions that FDA received and prioritized for this  reason from January 2010 through July 2014, the most recent data  available when we began our analysis. In response to a shortage or  potential shortage of one drug, FDA can prioritize more than one  submission. To examine FDA\u2019s prioritization process in greater detail, we  selected a subset of the prioritized submissions. To select this subset, we  first identified all submissions for which FDA prioritized its review during a  shorter time period\u2014January 2013 through June 2013. As we used the  drug as the unit of analysis, we next identified the number of drugs  associated with those prioritized submissions. The submissions that  FDA prioritized for review during this shorter time period were associated  with 38 drugs. Finally, as FDA may have prioritized its review of other  submissions related to these 38 drugs outside of this short time frame, we  identified any additional submissions for these drugs for which FDA  prioritized its review from January 2010 through July 2014. In total, the 38  drugs were associated with 153 prioritized submissions. We compared  the data on these prioritized submissions to FDA\u2019s drug shortage data,  which include information on actual shortages and shortages FDA  classifies as prevented, to determine whether at least one submission for  each drug may have contributed to the prevention or resolution of a  shortage of the drug. For the purposes of this analysis, we determined  that a submission may have contributed to the prevention or resolution of  a shortage if it was approved before the shortage of that drug was  prevented or resolved. The status of each submission\u2014such as whether  FDA had approved it or whether it was still under review at FDA\u2014was as  of October 30, 2014, the date FDA extracted the data. To assess the  reliability of FDA\u2019s prioritized review data and drug shortage data we  reviewed related documentation, interviewed knowledgeable agency  officials, and reviewed the data for missing information, discrepancies, or  logical errors. We found these data sufficiently reliable for the purposes of  our report. Lastly, we reviewed FDA guidance and policies regarding  prioritized reviews and interviewed relevant FDA officials about the  agency\u2019s approach to prioritizing reviews of submissions to address  shortages.", "To examine trends in FDA warning letters issued to sterile injectable drug  establishments for noncompliance with manufacturing standards, we  obtained 2009 and 2014 drug registration and listing data from FDA to  identify all foreign and domestic establishments that were listed as  manufacturing at least one sterile injectable product. We also obtained  inspection data from FDA\u2019s Field Accomplishments and Compliance  Tracking System on drug manufacturing establishment inspections that  were conducted from October 2006 through September 2013. Using the  registration and listing data, we identified inspections of foreign and  domestic establishments manufacturing sterile injectable drugs and non- injectable drugs. We also obtained data on warning letters citing non- compliance with manufacturing standards that were issued to human drug  manufacturing establishments following inspections conducted from  October 2006 through September 2013. Using the registration and listing  data, we identified warning letters issued to foreign and domestic  establishments manufacturing sterile injectable drugs and non-injectable  drugs. To assess the reliability of FDA\u2019s drug registration and listing,  inspection, and warning letter data, we reviewed related documentation,  interviewed knowledgeable agency officials, and performed electronic  data testing for missing information, outliers, or logical errors. For our  inspection and warning letter data we also compared our counts to  published data and compared a selection of our warning letter data to  source documents. We found all of these data sufficiently reliable for our  purposes. We also analyzed UUDIS data on shortages of sterile  injectable drugs from October 2006 to September 2013. In addition to  analyzing these data, we interviewed FDA officials and reviewed FDA  policies and procedures related to selecting establishments for inspection,  conducting inspections, classifying the results of establishment  inspections, and issuing warning letters. Finally, FDA and others have  linked seven major sterile injectable manufacturing establishments to  widespread shortages. For this group of seven establishments, we  examined materials related to the recommendation for, internal review of,  and issuance of all warning and untitled letters associated with  inspections of these establishments conducted from October 2006  through September 2013.", "To examine the relationship between certain factors and sterile injectable  drug shortages, we used data from IMS Health to identify all sterile  injectable anti-infective and cardiovascular drugs with sales\u2014118 drugs  total\u2014from 2010 through 2014, the most recent data available when we  began our analysis. We chose these two therapeutic classes of drugs  because they both have been subject to multiple and prolonged  shortages and prior studies have focused on other classes such as  oncology. We estimated a regression model using 3 years of shortage  history for each drug in our study to examine the relationship between  whether a drug was in shortage during 2012, 2013, or 2014 (dependent  variable), and four factors (the explanatory variables). We based our  dependent variable for drug shortages on UUDIS data. We classified a  drug as being in shortage if it was in shortage any time during a given  calendar year, including shortages that started in a prior year and  remained ongoing. We used IMS Health data to create three of the binary  explanatory variables: sales of a generic version, a decline in the number  of suppliers, and price decline. We created the fourth binary explanatory  variable, noncompliance with manufacturing standards by an  establishment that resulted in the receipt of a warning letter, using FDA\u2019s  drug registration and listing data and warning letter data. This is a unique  explanatory variable that provides a direct measure of compliance with  FDA\u2019s manufacturing standards. See appendix II for more on the data  sources and methodology for this analysis. We took several steps to  ensure that the data used to produce this analysis were sufficiently  reliable. Specifically, we assessed the reliability of the IMS Health  National Sales PerspectivesTM data by interviewing officials at IMS Health.  We also reviewed relevant documentation and examined the data for  obvious errors, such as missing values and values outside of expected  ranges.", "Our analysis of the relationship between certain factors and drug  shortages has some limitations. First, our findings are limited to data for  sterile injectable anti-infective and cardiovascular drugs that were  marketed and sold from 2010 through 2014 and shortages in these two  therapeutic classes from 2012 through 2014. Our findings are not  generalizable to drugs in other routes of administration, other therapeutic  classes, or shortages during other time periods. Second, missing  manufacturing location data may have caused us to underestimate or  overestimate the relationship between shortages and noncompliance with  manufacturing standards resulting in a warning letter. For the drugs in our  study that were missing manufacturing location data, we could not always  identify whether the drugs were manufactured by at least one  establishment that received a warning letter. Therefore, we may have  misclassified some drugs that were manufactured by establishments that  received a warning letter as drugs manufactured by establishments that  did not receive a warning letter. Whether we may have overestimated or  underestimated the relationship depends on whether the potentially  misclassified drugs were in shortage. If these potentially misclassified  drugs were in shortage, our model may underestimate the relationship  between shortages and receipt of a warning letter. If these potentially  misclassified drugs were not in shortage, our model may overestimate the  relationship between shortages and receipt of a warning letter. The extent  to which we may have underestimated or overestimated this relationship  is unclear. For 57 of the 118 drugs in our study, we found partial  manufacturing location data, and for 3 drugs we found no manufacturing  location data. We were not able to identify these data for drugs if the IMS  data did not include a national drug code for a particular product or if the  manufacturer was not listed in FDA\u2019s drug registration and listing data.", "We conducted this performance audit from June 2014 to July 2016 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

To obtain FDA\u2019s approval  to market a brand-name drug, sponsors must submit a new drug  application (NDA) containing data on the safety and effectiveness of the  drug as determined through clinical trials and other research. To obtain  FDA\u2019s approval to market a generic drug, sponsors must submit an  abbreviated new drug application (ANDA). The ANDA must contain data  showing, among other things, that the generic drug is bioequivalent to, or  performs in the same manner as, a drug approved through the NDA  process. If a sponsor wants to change any part of its original NDA or  ANDA after its approval\u2014such as changes to manufacturing location or  process, the type or source of active ingredients, or the labeling\u2014it must  generally submit an application supplement to notify FDA of the change. If  the change has a substantial potential to adversely affect factors such as  the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of the drug, the sponsor  must obtain FDA approval. As part of the application and application  supplement review process, FDA may conduct an inspection of the  establishment where the drug will be manufactured to verify the accuracy  and authenticity of the data contained in the application, to determine that  the establishment is following commitments made in the application, and  to verify that the establishment is prepared to make the drug named in the  application or supplement.", "After approving brand-name and generic drugs for marketing in the  United States, FDA\u2019s oversight responsibilities continue, as it is charged  with monitoring their safety, effectiveness, quality, and promotion. FDA  periodically inspects drug manufacturing establishments, including those  manufacturing brand-name, generic, and over-the-counter drugs to  assess their ongoing compliance with current good manufacturing  practice regulations. In addition to these surveillance inspections, FDA  may also conduct for-cause inspections when the agency receives  information indicating problems in the manufacture of marketed drugs,  among other reasons. FDA may conduct an inspection that includes  multiple components (e.g., both preapproval and surveillance) during a  single visit to an establishment. Based on the agency\u2019s findings during an  inspection, FDA classifies the inspection as either (1) no action indicated,  when insignificant or no deficiencies were identified; (2) voluntary action  indicated, when deficiencies were identified and must be corrected, but  the agency is not prepared to take regulatory action; or (3) official action  indicated, when serious deficiencies were found that warrant regulatory  action.", "Specifically, if FDA identifies a violation of law or regulations during an  inspection and therefore finds the establishment to be out of compliance  with manufacturing standards, the agency may issue a warning letter.  FDA issues warning letters when the agency has identified violations that  may lead to enforcement action if not promptly and adequately corrected.  Recommendations to issue a warning letter are either made by staff in  FDA\u2019s district offices or by staff in FDA\u2019s Center for Drug Evaluation and  Research. Multiple levels of the Center\u2019s staff review all warning letter  recommendations. It is FDA policy to consider many factors in  determining whether to issue a warning letter. For example, the agency is  to consider the compliance history of the establishment, the nature of the  violation (e.g., whether the establishment was aware of the violation, but  failed to correct it), and the risk associated with the product and the  impact of the violation on such risk. FDA is also to consider corrective  actions taken or promised by the establishment since the inspection, and  it may decide not to issue a letter if an establishment\u2019s corrective actions  are adequate and the violations that would have supported the letter have  been corrected. To determine whether actions planned or taken by an  establishment to correct violations are adequate FDA may, among other  activities, review documentation describing proposed or completed  corrective actions or hold meetings with representatives of the  establishment to discuss these actions. FDA is also required by law to  consider whether issuing the warning letter could reasonably cause or  exacerbate a shortage of a life-saving drug. If it determines a shortage  could occur or an existing shortage could worsen, the agency must  evaluate the risks associated with the impact of such a shortage upon  patients and the risks associated with the violation before taking action,  unless there is an imminent risk of serious health consequences or death  from not taking action.

FDA is notified of actual and potential drug shortages by  manufacturers, health professionals, and the public. Once DSS  becomes aware of a potential or actual shortage, DSS attempts to  determine whether the total supply of the drug and any pharmaceutical  equivalents is inadequate to meet demand. To verify that a shortage is in  effect or a potential shortage is pending, DSS contacts all manufacturers  of the drug to collect up-to-date information on the inventory and demand  for the drug and manufacturing schedules. DSS also analyzes market  research data from IMS Health to compare current supply of the drug with  historical demand.", "DSS coordinates as needed with several other FDA offices including the  Office of Generic Drugs and the Office of Compliance to address drug  shortages. Once DSS verifies a shortage or potential shortage of a drug,  it may seek assistance from these offices to address that shortage,  including the following:  identifying the extent of the shortage and determining whether other  manufacturers are willing and able to increase production of the  shortage drug; prioritizing reviews of drug applications, supplements, and inspections  for manufacturers attempting to restore, increase, or begin production  of the shortage drug; and applying regulatory discretion, such as refraining from taking  enforcement action to stop the distribution of a drug that is in shortage  despite a labeling or quality issue.", "For example, DSS provides the Office of Generic Drugs with drug  shortage information so that the office can identify ANDAs or ANDA  supplements it can prioritize its review of to address a shortage.", "While there are a number of steps FDA can take to address a shortage,  FDA cannot require manufacturers to start producing or continue to  produce a drug. It also cannot require manufacturers to maintain or  introduce manufacturing redundancies in their establishments to provide  them with increased flexibility to respond to shortages. Finally, FDA  cannot control the prices of marketed drugs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Characteristics of the Sterile Injectable Drug Industry", "paragraphs": ["In our February 2014 report, we identified unique characteristics of the  sterile injectable drug industry that may make these drugs susceptible to  shortages. These characteristics include limited inventory, need for  regulatory approval, production complexity, and constrained  manufacturing capacity.", "Limited inventory. The widespread use of \u201cjust-in-time\u201d inventory  practices can increase the vulnerability of the supply chain to  shortages. For example, according to one manufacturer  representative, manufacturers typically have about 2 to 3 months of  inventory on hand, wholesale distributors usually have about 1 month,  and providers only have a few weeks of inventory. Consequently,  when a manufacturer stops production, a shortage can result quickly.", "Regulatory approval. New manufacturers may not be able to quickly  enter the market to produce a drug in shortage because FDA\u2019s  approval of an ANDA\u2014which can take more than a year\u2014is required.  Further, even existing manufacturers of the drug need FDA approval  of changes to manufacturing conditions or processes that have a  substantial potential to adversely affect factors such as the identity,  strength, quality, purity, or potency of the drug before the drug  manufactured under the new conditions or processes can be  marketed. For example, FDA approval of an application supplement  may be required for changes in location of a manufacturing site or the  source of the raw materials or components for manufacturing a drug.", "Production complexity. Costly, specialized equipment is required to  manufacture prescription drugs and production processes are  complex, particularly for sterile injectables. Maintaining sterility  throughout the production process is challenging, yet it is particularly  important for these drugs as serious injury can occur if contaminated  drugs are injected into patients. Some generic sterile injectable drugs  need to be manufactured on lines or in facilities dedicated solely to  those drugs, thus creating challenges for new manufacturers to enter  the market. We previously found that sterile injectable anti-infective  and oncology drugs require lines, and sometimes whole facilities, that  are limited to the production of such drugs. For example, some anti- infective drugs, such as penicillin, can trigger serious allergic  reactions at very low levels and as a result, may be limited to specific  manufacturing lines.", "Constrained manufacturing capacity. The generic sterile injectable  drug industry is highly concentrated and this limited manufacturing  capacity has been challenged in recent years as the industry has  expanded the number of generic products it manufactures. The  pressures to produce a large number of drugs on only a few  manufacturing lines leaves the manufacturers that do participate in  the generic sterile injectable market with little flexibility when one  manufacturer ceases production of a particular drug. For example,  manufacturer representatives told us that manufacturing  establishments schedule the production of each drug in their product  line for specific time periods, often months in advance. An  establishment that produces a particular drug may not be able to  produce additional quantities in response to a shortage until the next  time the particular product is scheduled for production\u2014which could  be months after a shortage begins. If a manufacturing establishment  has available production capacity, the manufacturer also faces risks  when deciding to ramp up production to address a shortage. In  particular, one manufacturer representative said that manufacturers  do not know how long their competitors will be out of the market. If the  manufacturer that left the market quickly restarts production of the  drug, the manufacturer that made the investment to ramp up  production to address the shortage may face a financial liability if it is  unable to sell the additional product it manufactured.", "Another capacity-related issue is that the company whose name is on  the drug label, which we term the supplier, may or may not be the  same as the company that actually manufactures the drug. Rather  than produce the drug themselves, some suppliers enter into a  relationship with a contract manufacturer to produce the drug on their  behalf. Therefore, the number of suppliers of a particular drug may  not be the same as the number of manufacturers of that drug. The  number of suppliers could also be different than the number of  manufacturers if the name on the drug\u2019s label is that of a repackager,  a distributor, or the parent company of the manufacturer."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "New Drug Shortages Have Decreased Since 2011, but Many Shortages Persist for Multiple Years", "paragraphs": ["New drug shortages continue to be reported, although the number of new  shortages each year has generally decreased since 2011.

Meanwhile, since  2012, the number of ongoing shortages (shortages that began in prior  years) has remained high with over 250 ongoing shortages each year  from 2012 through 2015. (See fig. 1.) As a result, the majority of drug  shortages each year since 2012 have been ongoing shortages rather  than newly reported shortages. For example, in 2015, 68 percent of the  shortages (291 out of 427) were ongoing shortages that began in a prior  year.", "Since 2013, the majority of the ongoing shortages in a given year were  first reported at least 2 years earlier.

The average duration of all shortages reported during this  time period was 418 days. The fact that some shortages have lasted 3 or  more years suggests that manufacturers and FDA have had difficulty  addressing the issues behind these persistent shortages. For example,  FDA stated that some drugs have been in shortage for multiple years  because manufacturers have been unable to address the issues that led  to the shortage or have chosen not to continue producing the drugs.", "The experiences of providers dealing with shortages every day generally  supports the trend seen in the UUDIS data that shortages persist.

Twenty-four percent (92) of the prioritized submissions were for drugs in  capsule or tablet form, while the remaining 9 percent (34) were for drugs  in other dosage forms, such as ointments or patches.", "Overall, FDA had completed at least one review cycle for approximately  80 percent of the 383 prioritized submissions as of October 30, 2014.  FDA\u2019s review of a submission may span several review cycles before the  agency makes a decision regarding its approval, and once the review of a  submission is prioritized any subsequent reviews of it are also prioritized.  An additional review cycle may occur if, for example, to ensure the safety  and efficacy of the product, FDA asks a sponsor to supply additional data,  analyses, or other information to address concerns identified in its  review. According to FDA it has historically taken, on average, about  four review cycles to approve an ANDA. As of October 30, 2014, 43  percent (164) of the 383 prioritized submissions had been approved and  FDA had completed at least one review for another 37 percent (140).

When we examined the subset of prioritized submissions  that were associated with 38 drugs, we found that 15 of the drugs  were associated with at least one prioritized submission that was  approved before the shortage was resolved or a potential shortage  was prevented. The timing of FDA\u2019s approvals of these submissions  suggests that this strategy may have contributed to addressing  shortages of these 15 drugs, although it does not establish a causal  link. Specifically, the approved submissions for these 15 drugs may  have helped resolve 12 shortages, prevent 2 shortages, and mitigate  1 shortage. These approved submissions were for drugs in several  therapeutic classes (including anti-infective, oncology, and central  nervous system drugs) and used to treat a variety of conditions  (including bacterial infections, breast cancer, and attention deficit  hyperactivity disorder). Conversely, another 13 of the 38 drugs did not  have any prioritized submissions approved prior to the shortage  resolution or prevention date, so submissions for those drugs could  not have contributed to addressing a shortage. However, for 9 of  these 13 drugs at least one prioritized submission was approved after  the shortage was resolved or prevented, which FDA determined may  have helped to reduce supply vulnerabilities and prevent future  shortages. In addition, submissions for 2 of the 38 drugs were not  approved as of October 2014 and the shortages the submissions  were prioritized to address remained active. Finally, the submissions  for 8 of the 38 drugs were not associated with a specific shortage at  the time of prioritization, although the majority of these drugs had  previously been in shortage or were otherwise vulnerable to shortage.  (See table 3.)", "Time to approval for approved submissions. The median time to  approval from the date prioritized differed for the 26 submissions that  may have contributed to the prevention or resolution of a shortage,  compared to the 24 submissions approved after the associated  shortage was prevented or resolved. This difference was more  pronounced for ANDAs than for supplements. Specifically, the median  time to approval for ANDAs that may have helped to prevent or  resolve a shortage was almost 4 months faster than it was for ANDAs  that were not approved until after the prevention or resolution of the  associated shortage.", "For the 26 submissions that may have contributed to the  prevention or resolution of a shortage, the median time to  approval was 494 days for ANDAs and 87 days for supplements.", "For the 24 submissions that were not approved until after the  associated shortage was prevented or resolved, the median time  to approval was 613 days for ANDAs and 80 days for  supplements.", "Given that the median time to approval for prioritized ANDAs is over a  year, prioritizing reviews of ANDAs to address drug shortages is generally  not a strategy for addressing shortages in the short term. However, this  strategy may be useful to address drug shortages that have persisted  across multiple years or recurred multiple times in a few years. This may  also be a helpful approach if FDA is notified as early as possible about  potential shortages. FDA\u2019s drug shortages strategic plan states that early  notification of potential supply disruptions is critical because it puts the  agency in a better position to use all of its available strategies to address  drug shortages, including prioritizing its reviews of ANDAs from sponsors  who want to enter the market for a drug that is vulnerable to shortage or  already in shortage. The success of this strategy, however, also  depends on whether sponsors are willing or able to submit ANDAs for  drugs that are vulnerable to shortage or already in shortage, which is  beyond FDA\u2019s control."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Number of Warning Letters FDA Issued to Sterile Injectable Drug Establishments Increased, Including Letters to Establishments Linked to Widespread Shortages", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Number of Warning Letters FDA Issued to Sterile Injectable Drug Manufacturers Increased, but the Percentage of Inspections Resulting in Letters Was Relatively Small", "paragraphs": ["The number of warning letters FDA issued annually to sterile injectable  drug manufacturing establishments found to be out of compliance with  manufacturing standards generally increased from fiscal year 2007  through fiscal year 2013.

(See table 4.) Both the number of warning  letters and the number of shortages were particularly high in fiscal years  2010 and 2011. While a corresponding rise in warning letters and  shortages in certain years could reflect an increase in FDA inspection  rigor, as was suggested by some sources in the literature review  conducted for our prior report, it could also indicate growing  manufacturing problems. Such problems could lead to shortages as  establishments recalled defective products or shut down or slowed  production to correct manufacturing problems. What is not known is  whether establishments experiencing such manufacturing problems  would have shut down or slowed production in the absence of an FDA  warning letter.", "FDA officials disputed the notion that the agency\u2019s issuance of warning  letters to establishments found to be out of compliance with  manufacturing standards caused shortages. First, FDA officials noted that  some shortages are unrelated to manufacturing problems and therefore  could not have been caused by FDA\u2019s issuance of warning letters for  manufacturing violations. This notion is consistent with our prior analysis  of FDA shortage data, which found that from January 2011 through June  2013, 30 percent of shortages were reportedly caused by issues  unrelated to manufacturing, such as increased demand or unavailability of  raw materials or components. Second, although the agency does have  other enforcement powers to stop distribution of a product, FDA officials  stated that warning letters issued for noncompliance with manufacturing  standards do not order a stop in production or distribution. Finally, FDA  officials stated that it is important to put warning letter data in perspective  by considering the reason that FDA conducted the inspections that  resulted in warning letters. According to FDA officials, if the inspections  that resulted in warning letters were inspections with a for-cause  component and thus were conducted to investigate potential  manufacturing problems, then any underlying manufacturing problems  that led to the warning letter could also have caused shortages. For  example, officials told us that during this time frame, inspections of sterile  injectable drug manufacturers were often conducted because of reports of  problems with particulates, such as a number of voluntary recalls  conducted in response to glass fragments in sterile injectable drugs in  2010 and 2011.", "Our analysis of 7 years of FDA data on inspection type does not reveal a  clear trend in terms of the relationship between shortages, warning  letters, and one indication of potential manufacturing problems\u2014the  frequency of inspections with a for-cause component. Our analysis  shows that between fiscal years 2007 and 2013 the percentage of  inspections with a for-cause component was consistently higher for sterile  injectable drug manufacturing establishments than it was for non- injectable establishments. (See fig. 5.) FDA officials told us that they  evaluate the health hazards of all reports of potential manufacturing  problems that they receive. However, because of the potentially serious  health consequences of using a sterile product that has been  contaminated, the agency may be more likely to conduct a for-cause  inspection in response to reports of potential manufacturing problems at a  sterile injectable drug establishment than at one that manufactures non- injectable drugs. Across this time period, the percentage of sterile  injectable drug establishment inspections with a for-cause component  varied. After declining from its fiscal year 2007 peak, the percentage of  sterile injectable drug establishment inspections with a for-cause  component grew to 17 percent of fiscal year 2011 inspections. Fiscal year  2011 was also both the peak in new sterile injectable drug shortages and  warning letters issued to sterile injectable drug establishments. While the  number of warning letters issued to sterile injectable drug establishments  was equally high a year earlier in fiscal year 2010 and new shortages  were at their second highest, the percentage of inspections with a for- cause component was at its lowest\u201410 percent. Thus, comparing the  trend in inspections with a for-cause component to the trends in  shortages and in warning letters provides support for FDA officials\u2019  contention that there were underlying manufacturing problems that could  have led to shortages and warning letters in some years, but not others."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Seven Sterile Injectable Drug Establishments Linked to Widespread Shortages Received Warning Letters and All Had Previous Indications of Difficulty Meeting Manufacturing Standards", "paragraphs": ["From fiscal year 2010 through fiscal year 2012, seven sterile injectable  drug manufacturing establishments that received warning letters for  noncompliance with manufacturing standards slowed or shut down  production. FDA and others said these slowdowns and shutdowns led to  widespread shortages. For example, the fiscal year 2012 voluntary  shutdown of one of the seven establishments reportedly led to the actual  or potential shortage of more than 100 drugs. Another of the seven  establishments manufactured more than 300 different drugs, so its  production slowdown also led to multiple shortages.", "FDA issued warning letters to all seven establishments after finding that  the establishments were not in compliance with manufacturing standards  during inspections conducted from fiscal year 2007 through fiscal year  2011. Although FDA did not require the establishments to shut down or  slow production, the agency noted in a letter to a member of Congress  about this issue that when products manufactured under problematic  conditions pose a safety threat to patients\u2014such as glass shards or metal  shavings in vials of injectable drugs or fungal contamination\u2014 manufacturers generally must stop production to resolve the problem.  Such problems were experienced by six of the seven establishments  linked to widespread shortages when particulates were discovered in their  sterile injectable products. For example, a drug at one establishment was  found to contain microscopic particles that were \u201cstringy, amorphous, and  globular\u201d and sterile injectable drugs at two other establishments  contained stainless steel particles. The presence of metal particles in  sterile injectable drugs can cause serious injury to patients when injected.  Following the receipt of reports of serious injury and illness, a drug  manufactured at the seventh establishment was discovered to contain  endotoxin, a component of certain bacteria, which may cause severe  fever and death if present in a drug.", "FDA documents and data indicate that all seven of these establishments  had difficulty meeting manufacturing standards prior to FDA\u2019s issuance of  a warning letter, which, at least for these establishments, runs counter to  the claim that the increase in warning letters was an indication that the  agency began to apply manufacturing standards more rigorously. For  example, FDA staff previously recommended issuing warning letters to  two of the establishments, but after further internal review, FDA issued an  untitled letter to one establishment and did not issue a warning letter to  the other. (See fig. 6.) For two other establishments, the inspections  preceding the inspection that resulted in the warning letter often included  a for-cause component. For example, one of the two establishments was  inspected six times between fiscal year 2007 and the inspection that  resulted in the warning letter and each inspection was conducted in  response to manufacturer reports of potential manufacturing problems  submitted to FDA, complaints from consumers or health care providers,  or both.", "Our analysis of FDA documents also shows that, for four establishments,  the same manufacturing violations that led FDA to issue a warning letter  had also been observed during previous FDA inspections. In the case of  one of the four establishments, FDA documents show that the agency  had expressed concerns about one violation 5 years prior to the  inspection that resulted in the warning letter.", "For nearly all of the seven establishments linked to widespread  shortages, there were continued indications of difficulty meeting  manufacturing standards following their receipt of a warning letter. In  addition to issuing one establishment a warning letter, FDA subsequently  sought and obtained an injunction against this establishment to prevent it  from manufacturing and distributing most drugs until FDA determined that  the establishment was compliant with the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic  Act. An agency press release about the injunction noted that inspections  of the establishment found several product quality problems, including  facility cleaning issues and poor equipment maintenance practices  resulting in equipment shedding particles into some sterile injectable  products. Despite investments to address these issues, this  establishment decided to cease manufacturing all drugs and was  permanently closed in 2013. Subsequent inspections of four other  establishments resulted in the classification of official action indicated,  signifying that FDA continued to identify serious deficiencies that  warranted regulatory action. With these continued indications of potential  manufacturing problems at multiple sterile injectable establishments  manufacturing such medically necessary drugs as those used to treat  cancer, administer anesthesia, and prevent blood clots, shortages of  multiple sterile injectable drugs persist. FDA officials told us that these  seven establishments all made improvements and in many cases are now  helping to prevent and resolve some shortages. However, as of April  2016, five of these seven establishments continue to cause shortages,  according to FDA officials."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Shortages of Sterile Injectable Anti- infective and Cardiovascular Drugs Were Strongly Associated with Certain Factors", "paragraphs": ["Shortages of sterile injectable anti-infective and cardiovascular drugs  during 2012, 2013, and 2014 were strongly associated with certain factors  we examined. We estimated a regression model to examine the  relationship between drug shortages and four factors: (1) a decrease in  the number of suppliers, (2) sales of a generic version, (3) the failure of  an establishment making the drug to comply with manufacturing  standards resulting in a warning letter, and (4) price decline. We found all  factors but price decline to be strongly associated with shortages of the  drugs in our study. For each factor, table 5 displays the estimated  percentage point increase in the probability of a shortage when the factor  is present for all drugs relative to the mean probability of a shortage  predicted for all drugs in our study by our model. These estimates show  that the presence of a single factor increases the probability of a drug  shortage by as much as 16.8 percentage points from what the model  otherwise predicts for all drugs in our study.", "The strong association between shortages and both (1) a decrease in the  number of suppliers and (2) the failure of an establishment making the  drug to comply with manufacturing standards resulting in a warning letter  suggests that shortages may be triggered by supply disruptions.  Characteristics of the sterile injectable drug industry may make these  drugs susceptible to shortage when the number of suppliers decreases.  For example, a supplier may decide to permanently discontinue an  unprofitable product or the unavailability of raw materials may lead to  production delays. Further, failure to comply with manufacturing  standards resulting in a warning letter could also trigger a supply  disruption if a manufacturer chooses to temporarily shut down production  in a particular establishment to correct the conditions that led to a warning  letter. In this industry, there is limited inventory in the supply chain,  manufacturing capacity is constrained because production is scheduled  months in advance, new manufacturers must receive regulatory approval  before entering the market, and the production process is complex. After  a supply disruption for any reason, if other manufacturers are not able to  increase supply in a timely manner, a shortage may ensue.", "For the drugs in our study, the association between noncompliance with  manufacturing standards resulting in a warning letter and shortages is  largely driven by the structure of the generic injectable manufacturing  industry. The warning letters received by three large manufacturing  establishments for failure to comply with manufacturing standards appear  to be driving our finding that failures to comply with manufacturing  standards resulting in warning letters were strongly associated with  certain sterile injectable drug shortages. In this industry, establishments  produce multiple drugs and so one establishment\u2019s failure to comply with  manufacturing standards that results in receipt of a warning letter could  affect many drugs. For example, 69 percent of the 118 drugs in our study  were manufactured by at least one of nine establishments. Thus, if one of  these nine establishments failed to comply with manufacturing standards,  many drugs in our study could be affected. For example, in 2012 one  establishment that failed to comply with manufacturing standards and  received a warning letter manufactured 22 drugs in our study. (See table  6.)", "While the strong association between failure to comply with  manufacturing standards resulting in the receipt of a warning letter and  shortages could support the contention that FDA regulatory activity  triggered some shortages, it could also support the contention that there  were growing manufacturing problems and possibly related quality  concerns that both precipitated the warning letters and led to shortages.  The findings of one study indicate that supply disruptions that led to  recent shortages of generic sterile injectable drugs were often linked to  quality problems. According to this study, quality problems stem from  various sources, including insufficient maintenance, outdated or  inadequate design of sterile manufacturing processes, and poor oversight  that does not test for or respond adequately to indicators of potential  quality problems.", "Additionally, our finding that sales of a generic version were associated  with shortages suggests that relatively low profit margins may also trigger  shortages for sterile injectable drugs. Specifically, compared with drugs  for which there were only brand-name sales and thus only one supplier,  drugs sold generically may have multiple suppliers and relatively lower  profit margins. The 88 drugs in our study sold generically were available  from an average of four suppliers during 2013, and 10 drugs had eight or  more suppliers. Researchers have found that prices, and consequently  profit margins, decline for generic drugs as the number of suppliers  increase. Relatively low profit margins may cause suppliers to exit the  market for less profitable drugs in favor of more profitable ones or may  make it unprofitable to increase supply, which could make the market  vulnerable to shortages.", "Lastly, though we did not find a price decline in the previous year to be  significantly associated with shortages of the anti-infective and  cardiovascular drugs in our study from 2012 through 2014, other  evidence indicates that price may influence the amount of drugs  produced. Research indicates that price influences a supplier\u2019s profit  margins, which may affect a supplier\u2019s decision to stay in the market or  invest in the manufacturing establishments. Further, research on  shortages in another therapeutic class examined price trends and found  that the average price of oncology drugs decreased every year leading up  to a shortage, whereas the average price stayed the same or increased  for oncology drugs that were not in shortage.

Consequently, they do not always determine the same drugs  are in shortage and they do not generally report the same number of  shortages overall. Specifically, the Food and Drug Administration Safety  and Innovation Act, which FDA implements, defines a drug shortage as a  period of time when the demand or projected demand for a drug within  the United States exceeds the supply of the drug. In determining whether  a shortage exists, FDA focuses on the overall market for a specific drug,  meaning that even if a particular manufacturer does not have product  available, it is not a shortage if the other manufacturers of that product  can meet the projected demand for the whole market. For example, if  Manufacturer A has no product available, and Manufacturer B is able to  manufacture enough product to satisfy the entire market demand, FDA  would not consider this situation a drug shortage, even if Manufacturer  B\u2019s product is a different strength and package size as long as it views  the different sizes and strengths as clinically interchangeable. In contrast,  UUDIS defines a shortage as a supply issue that affects how pharmacies  prepare and dispense a product or that influences patient care when  prescribers must choose an alternative therapy because of supply issues.", "According to a UUDIS official, the organization therefore focuses on the  supply of drugs by national drug code, which is a code that uniquely  identifies specific drug products for a given manufacturer. Focusing on  the supply of drugs by national drug code means that if one manufacturer  does not have enough supply of all strengths and package sizes to meet  demand for a period of time it will be considered a shortage.

Though UUDIS acknowledged that Manufacturer C had this drug  available, as did Manufacturer B at times, it posted extensive clinical  alternatives on ASHP\u2019s website for those providers that were unable to  obtain the available drug. FDA did not consider methylprednisolone  sodium succinate injection to be in shortage at this time because the  agency determined that manufacturers other than Manufacturer A had the  same strength and package size of the drug available to meet demand.", "Overall, the 28 UUDIS shortages that FDA did not consider to be  shortages lasted from 6 days to over 2 years, according to UUDIS\u2019s  data. In the case of the 5 UUDIS shortages that FDA stated were short- term supply disruptions rather than shortages, the duration ranged from  about a month to over 2 years\u2014one shortage was still active as of  December 2015. FDA officials described a short-term supply disruption as  a situation where manufacturers report a disruption, but that inventory in  the supply chain remains available and FDA has not received any reports  of shortage from the public. FDA officials said that these types of  disruptions commonly involve delays in importing drugs manufactured at  foreign establishments or other short-term delays involving transport. FDA  also said that it prevented 3 of the 28 shortages that UUDIS identified.  According to UUDIS data, those 3 shortages lasted from about 8 months  to over 2 years. Lastly, though FDA did not determine that these 28  situations met its criteria to be a drug shortage, UUDIS deemed 13 of  these shortages critical, a designation made because alternative  medications were unavailable, the shortages affected multiple  manufacturers, or the shortages were widely reported.", "There were also 4 shortages that FDA identified from January 2013  through March 2013 that UUDIS did not determine to be in shortage.  UUDIS did not consider these drugs to be in shortage because it (1) was  never notified that these drugs were in short supply or (2) heard from  suppliers that they had full stock.

We limited the analysis to sterile injectable drugs because we  previously found that approximately 65 percent of all critical shortages  from January 2009 through June 2013 were for sterile injectable drugs.  We selected anti-infective and cardiovascular drugs because in our prior  reports we found that approximately one-fourth of all critical drug  shortages reported from January 2009 through June 2013 were for drugs  in these therapeutic classes.

For  example, UUDIS would consider acyclovir injection to be in shortage if the  20 mL package size was available, but the 10 mL package size was not  because health care providers would need to draw out 10 mL doses from  a 20 mL vial, which may create a safety issue.

First, our findings are limited to data  for sterile injectable anti-infective and cardiovascular drugs that were  marketed and sold from 2010 through 2014 and shortages in these two  therapeutic classes from 2012 through 2014. Our findings are not  generalizable to drugs in other routes of administration, other therapeutic  classes, or shortages during other time periods. Second, missing  manufacturing location data may have caused us to underestimate or  overestimate the relationship between shortages and noncompliance with  manufacturing standards resulting in a warning letter. For the drugs in our  study that were missing manufacturing location data, we could not always  identify whether the drugs were manufactured by at least one  establishment that received a warning letter. Therefore, we may have  misclassified some drugs that were manufactured by establishments that  received a warning letter as drugs manufactured by establishments that  did not receive a warning letter. Whether we may have overestimated or  underestimated the relationship depends on whether the potentially  misclassified drugs were in shortage. If these potentially misclassified  drugs were in shortage, our model may underestimate the relationship  between shortages and receipt of a warning letter. If these potentially  misclassified drugs were not in shortage, our model may overestimate the  relationship between shortages and receipt of a warning letter. The extent  to which we may have underestimated or overestimated this relationship  is unclear. For 57 of the 118 drugs in our study, we found partial  manufacturing location data, and for 3 drugs we found no manufacturing  location data. We were not able to identify these data for drugs if the IMS  data did not include a national drug code for a particular product or if the  manufacturer was not listed in FDA\u2019s drug registration and listing data.  Finally, our proxy for average transaction price for the drugs in our study  applies to all strengths and package sizes of the drug, because we  defined a drug to include all products with the same active ingredient and  route of administration, regardless of strength or package size.
