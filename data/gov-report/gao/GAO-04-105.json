Judges determine a specific sentence based on an applicable sentencing guideline range, such as 57 to 71 months, provided in the guidelines. Judges may impose sentences that fall anywhere within the range, above it (upward departures), or below it (downward departures). For some offenses, Congress established mandatory minimum sentences. Judges may also sentence below the minimum in certain circumstances. We examined the differences in drug offense departures from sentencing guidelines and mandatory minimum sentences among federal courts and the documents the USSC used to record and analyze sentences."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Generally, downward departures are defined as (1) substantial assistance departures, made at the prosecutor's request because the offender provided substantial assistance to the government; and (2) other downward departures made for other reasons, such as a plea agreement, a judge's consideration of mitigating factors, or early disposition, i.e., \"fast track\" programs initiated by prosecutors for low-level drug trafficking offenses. Of federal sentences for drug-related offenses in fiscal years 1999-2001, the majority (56 percent) was within applicable guideline ranges. Downward sentencing departures were more frequently due to prosecutors' substantial assistance motions (28 percent) than for any other reasons (16 percent). For federal drug sentences that carried a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment, more than half of the drug sentences imposed fell below a mandatory minimum. Of these, half fell below a minimum due to prosecutors' substantial assistance motions and half due to other reasons. After adjusting for differences in offense and offender characteristics among judicial circuits and districts, our analysis showed variations among certain circuits and districts in the likelihood an offender received a substantial assistance departure, other downward departure, or a sentence falling below a mandatory minimum. However, these variations did not necessarily indicate unwarranted sentencing departures or misapplication of the guidelines because data were not available to fully compare the offenders and offenses for which they were convicted. For drug sentences nationally, USSC receives 96 percent or more of the three key documents, including the statement of reasons (SOR), used to record sentence length and departures. For a small percentage of drug cases in USSC's database, information is missing, incomplete, or too difficult for USSC to interpret, principally affecting sentencing analyses in districts where the missing or incomplete data are most prevalent."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 established the independent U.S.  Sentencing Commission (USSC) and charged it with developing the  Federal Sentencing Guidelines. The guidelines were intended to avoid  unwarranted disparities in sentences among defendants with similar  criminal records who were found guilty of similar criminal conduct  without eliminating the thoughtful imposition of individualized sentences.To foster this goal, the guidelines specify sentencing guideline ranges\u2014a  range of time (in months)\u2014that offenders should serve given the nature of  their offense and other factors but also permit sentences to depart upward  or downward from guideline ranges due to aggravating or mitigating  circumstances. For certain types of offenses, including certain drug and  weapons offenses, Congress has statutorily specified mandatory minimum  sentences that supplant the otherwise applicable guidelines range (see fig.  1). Judges may impose sentences that depart downward from established  guidelines or fall below a mandatory minimum at the request of the  prosecution because the defendant has provided substantial assistance to  the government.  USSC designates sentences departing downward for this  reason as substantial assistance departures.  A judge may also depart  downward as a result of accepting a plea agreement or after considering  characteristics of the offender or the offense not fully covered in the  guidelines, such as extraordinary rehabilitation efforts after the offense  but prior to sentencing. To distinguish such sentences from substantial  assistance sentences, USSC designates them as \u201cother downward  departures\u201d as part of its data gathering efforts.", "As you requested, this report discusses downward departures for federal  drug offenses. We identified the extent to which federal drug sentences  departed downward from a guideline range determined by the court or fell  below an applicable mandatory minimum in fiscal years 1999-2001. Our  objectives were to (1) identify the percentage of federal sentences, and,  specifically, those for drug-related offenses, departing downward due to  substantial assistance motions or other reasons; (2) identify the  percentage of federal drug sentences that fell below an applicable  mandatory minimum due to substantial assistance motions or other  reasons; (3) compare the likelihood across judicial circuits and districts  that offenders received downward departing sentences or sentences  below a mandatory minimum; and (4) identify limitations, if any, of USSC\u2019s  sentencing data for drug offenses.", "To meet these objectives, we obtained USSC\u2019s sentencing database for  fiscal years 1999 through 2001 and used its coding scheme to identify  (1) sentences departing downward due to a prosecutor\u2019s substantial  assistance motion (substantial assistance departures); (2) sentences that  departed downward for other reasons (other downward departures); and  (3) sentences that fell below an applicable mandatory minimum. We used  the offender and offense characteristics in USSC\u2019s database to statistically  control for major differences among circuits and districts in the types of  offenders sentenced and the offenses for which they were sentenced.  However, it is important to note that a variety of other variables, such as  an offender\u2019s extraordinary rehabilitation efforts after the offense but  prior to sentencing, could affect departure decisions, but data for these  variables are not readily available.", "We also reviewed the types of documents USSC staff used to identify  departures, the reasons for those departures, and the number of missing  documents by circuit and district. We interviewed officials at USSC and  the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts (AOUSC), the administrative  arm of the federal judiciary, and the Chair, Committee on Criminal Law of  the Judicial Conference of the United States, the judiciary\u2019s principal  policymaking body. We conducted our work between March and August  2003 in Washington, D.C., in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards. Appendix I includes a more detailed  description of our scope and methodology. Appendixes II and III provide  more detailed descriptions of how we applied our methodology."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The United States is divided into 94 federal judicial districts, each  containing the federal trial courts, where criminal and civil cases are tried.  Congress placed each of the 94 districts in 1 of 12 regional circuits, each  containing a court of appeals, to which district court decisions may be  appealed. Figure 2 is a map of the United States showing the geographical  boundaries of the 94 district courts and the 12 regional circuit courts of  appeals (including 11 numbered circuits and the District of Columbia  Circuit.). There is also a Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit with  nationwide jurisdiction for specific types of cases, such as patent appeals.  This court does not hear cases involving the federal sentencing guidelines.", "In 1984, to help ensure that similar crimes committed by similar criminals  were punished with similar sentences, Congress, under the Sentencing  Reform Act, established the U.S. Sentencing Commission (USSC) and  directed that it develop a comprehensive sentencing scheme for federal  crimes. USSC established guideline ranges for the length of federal prison  sentences taking into account offender and offense characteristics to  establish appropriate sentence terms. The sentencing guidelines cover  more than 90 percent of all felony and Class A misdemeanor cases in the  federal courts. The sentencing guidelines do not apply to Class B or C  misdemeanors or infractions, offenses with a maximum prison exposure  of 6 months or less.", "Applying USSC\u2019s guidance, federal district judges in the 94 federal district  courts determine the appropriate sentencing guideline range for an  offender based on various factors related to (1) the offense and (2) the  offender. The offense is assigned an offense level, which for drug offenses  is based on several factors such as the quantity and type of drug involved  and whether the offense involved violence. The offender is also assigned a  criminal history category based on the number of criminal history points.  Criminal history points reflect the severity of an offender\u2019s prior criminal  record. Taken in combination, the offense level and criminal history  category correlate with a sentencing guideline range, which is expressed  in months. In addition, for some drug offenses where a mandatory  minimum sentence applies, the applicable mandatory minimum sentence  supplants the lower end of the applicable guidelines sentencing range. For  example, as shown in figure 3, a convicted offender whose offense of  conviction is assigned an offense level of 25 and who has a \u201ccriminal  history category I\u201d should be sentenced between a maximum of 71 months  and a minimum of 57 months under the sentencing guidelines unless a  mandatory minimum greater than 57 months (e.g., 60 months) is required.  A sentence less than 60 months falls below the applicable mandatory  minimum.", "The guidelines also permit sentences that fall above or below an  applicable guidelines range, often called upward or downward departures,  respectively, in certain circumstances. As illustrated in figure 3, a sentence  of more than 71 months would depart upward from the applicable  guideline range while a sentence of less than 57 months would depart  downward, falling below the lower end of the guideline range.", "At the request of the prosecution, the judge may depart downward  because the defendant has provided substantial assistance to the  government\u2014what USSC designates as substantial assistance departures.  But the guidelines also provide that a judge may depart downward if the  court finds certain mitigating circumstances exist that were not adequately  taken into consideration by USSC in formulating the guidelines that should  result in a sentence below the guideline range. To assist sentencing  courts, the guidelines list both encouraged departure factors (such as  coercion or duress, diminished capacity, or aberrant behavior of non- violent offenders) and discouraged though permissible departure factors  (such as age, physical condition, family responsibilities, or prior good  works). Judges may also consider other, unmentioned factors that were  not adequately considered by the guidelines (such as extraordinary  rehabilitation after the offense but prior to sentencing). USSC designates  consideration of encouraged, discouraged, and unmentioned factors as  \u201cother departures.\u201d Judges are required to explain the reasons for  departing from the guidelines. The recently enacted PROTECT Act of 2003  makes clear that the reasons must be specific, written, and provided to  USSC.", "USSC maintains a database that records a variety of data on the offenders  and offenses for which sentences are imposed. Judges must comply with  USSC\u2019s data collection needs by furnishing a written report of the  sentence, and the PROTECT Act makes clear that specific sentencing  documents must accompany that report. Included in these data is  information on whether the sentences imposed fell within or outside the  applicable sentencing guidelines range as determined by the sentencing  judge. Information on the incidence of sentencing outside of the guideline  ranges is used by USSC to identify areas where the sentencing guidelines  may need adjustment. Congress, under the PROTECT Act, directed USSC  to review the grounds of downward departures that are authorized by its  sentencing guidelines, policy statements, and official commentary, and to  promulgate amendments to ensure that the incidence of downward  departures is substantially reduced. The required amendments to the  sentencing guidelines are due October 27, 2003.", "As previously noted, various drug offenses carry a mandatory minimum.For such offenses, the mandatory minimum precludes judges from  sentencing at a lower guideline range minimum or from granting a  downward departure that might otherwise be available, unless one of two  statutory provisions applies. First, a judge may impose a sentence below  the applicable mandatory minimum if the government (the federal  prosecutor) files a motion with the court for such sentencing relief  because of the defendant\u2019s \u201csubstantial assistance\u201d in the investigation or  prosecution of another person. The discretion to make such a motion  rests solely with the prosecutor. Second, in the absence of a substantial  assistance motion, the \u201csafety valve\u201d provision affords relief from any  otherwise applicable mandatory minimum sentence for drug offenders  who have minimal criminal history (i.e., no more than 1 criminal history  point); were not violent, armed, or high-level participants; and provided  the government with truthful information regarding the offense. In these  cases, the court is directed by statute to impose a sentence pursuant to the  sentencing guidelines without regard to a mandatory minimum.", "As incorporated in USSC\u2019s sentencing guidelines, both the substantial  assistance and the safety valve provision may affect sentencing for  offenders whose offense of conviction does not carry a mandatory  minimum sentence\u2014that is, whose sentences are solely governed by the  application of the sentencing guidelines. For such offenders, a substantial  assistance motion permits the judge to depart downward from the  applicable guidelines range. With respect to the safety valve, the  sentencing guidelines provide offenders who are convicted of certain drug  offenses and who meet the legislative safety valve requirements a 2-level  decrease to their base offense level, for example, from level 25 to level 23."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Drug Sentences Departed Downward More Often Due to Substantial Assistance than for Other Reasons", "paragraphs": ["The majority of federal sentences fell within an applicable guideline range,  but when sentences departed downward, or fell below a guideline range,  they did so about as often due to substantial assistance as to other  reasons. Of the 162,090 federal sentences from fiscal years 1999-2001 for  which complete sentencing information was available, most were within  the guideline ranges determined by the court (64 percent), and about an  equal proportion of sentences departed downward due to substantial  assistance (18 percent) as for other reasons (17 percent).", "Similar to federal sentences overall, of the 69,279 drug sentences for which  complete departure information was available, we found that most  sentences were within guideline ranges (56 percent). Unlike federal  sentences overall, from fiscal years 1999 to 2001, federal drug sentences  departed downward more frequently due to substantial assistance  (28 percent) than other reasons (16 percent), as shown in table 1. Other  reasons that drug sentences departed downward included early  disposition, that is, fast track, programs initiated by prosecutors; plea  agreements; and judges\u2019 consideration of mitigating circumstances. See  appendix IV for more information on the frequency of reasons cited for  other downward departures.", "Prosecutors\u2019 substantial assistance motions resulted in downward  departing sentences that were on average 49 percent of the average lowest  sentence drug offenders otherwise would have received under the  guidelines.

See appendix I for  more detailed information on sentence reductions.", "The percentage of drug sentences that departed downward due to  prosecutors\u2019 substantial assistance motions or for other reasons varied  across judicial circuits in fiscal years 1999\u20132001, as shown in figure 4.", "The percentages of drug sentences departing downward differed notably  across the 94 districts, even in some cases among districts within the same  circuit. Figure 5 shows the 94 judicial districts grouped according to the  percent of sentences imposed in districts that departed downward due to  substantial assistance and for other reasons. In 55 districts, more than  30 percent of sentences departed downward due to substantial assistance,  while in only 5 districts more than 30 percent of the sentences departed  downward due to other reasons.

(See fig. 6.)", "Nearly all of the mandatory minimum drug sentences carried either a  5-year (48 percent) mandatory minimum or a 10-year minimum  (49 percent). On average, prosecutors\u2019 substantial assistance motions  reduced drug offenders\u2019 5-year mandatory minimum sentence by  33 months. Sentences lowered for other reasons, such as the safety valve,  that would otherwise be subject to a 5-year mandatory minimum were  reduced by an average of 26 months. On average, prosecutors\u2019 substantial  assistance motions reduced drug offenders\u2019 10-year mandatory minimum  sentences by 63 months, and sentences lowered for other reasons that  would otherwise be subject to a 10-year mandatory minimum were  reduced by an average of 52 months. See appendix I for more detailed  information on sentence reductions.", "Figure 7 provides a summary of the number and percent of federal drug  sentences that fell below a mandatory minimum or guideline range  compared with sentences that did not carry a mandatory minimum.

For example, in addition to the number of  deportable aliens potentially affecting the percent of other downward  departures, some circuits and districts, when compared with others, could  sentence a greater proportion of offenders who possessed and shared  information of the crime that assisted the government in the investigation  or prosecution of others. Therefore, a larger percent of offenders in those  circuits and districts could have received a decrease in their sentence due  to substantial assistance. Recognizing that judicial circuits and districts  differed in the types of offenders sentenced and the offenses for which the  offenders were sentenced, our analysis adjusted for differences such as  race, gender, offense, criminal history, and offense severity (see appendix  I for a complete list of variables included in our analysis). Although these  are the major factors that could affect the likelihood of an offender  receiving a departure, they are not all-inclusive.", "We used adjusted odds ratios to estimate how circuits and districts vary in  sentencing practices. An adjusted odds ratio in this case indicates whether  a departure is statistically less likely, as likely, or more likely to occur in  one circuit as in another. We can describe how much more likely or less  likely a substantial assistance departure was to occur in one jurisdiction  versus another; for instance, we can estimate that a substantial assistance  departure was 20 percent less likely to occur or 3.6 times more likely to  occur in one circuit compared with another. Our analysis focused on  adjusted odds ratios since they provide us with our best estimates of  differences across circuits and districts after taking into account the  differences in drug cases handled across jurisdictions.", "Using adjusted odds ratios to estimate the likelihood of an offender  receiving a substantial assistance departure, we can see that percentage  differences can be misleading. In comparing percentages of substantial  assistance sentences in the Eighth Circuit (37 percent) with other circuits,  it appears that in 5 circuits \u2013D.C. (30 percent), the Second (32 percent),  Fourth (33 percent), Seventh (31 percent), and Eleventh Circuits  (30 percent)\u2014 fewer offenders received substantial assistance departures.  But taking into account differences of offenders and offense  characteristics, adjusted odds ratios show that in D.C., the Fourth and  Eleventh circuits, offenders were actually as likely to receive a substantial  assistance motion as in the Eighth Circuit. Although the Second Circuit\u2019s  percentage of substantial assistance departures was lower than the Eighth  Circuit\u2019s, after adjusting for offender and offense characteristics, offenders  in the Second Circuit were 1.4 times more likely to be granted a  substantial assistance departure than offenders in the Eighth Circuit. In  another example, the First Circuit appears to grant more other downward  departures (10 percent) than the Eighth (8 percent), but the adjusted odds  ratios imply that offenders in the First Circuit are actually 22 percent less  likely to be granted an other downward departure than similar offenders in  the Eighth Circuit.", "After adjusting for differences in drug offenses and offender  characteristics, the likelihood of an offender receiving a lower sentence  due to either a prosecutor\u2019s substantial assistance motion or for other  reasons varied substantially across the 12 U.S. circuits and the 94 U.S.  district courts. For example, drug offenders sentenced in the Third Circuit  from fiscal years 1999-2001 were over 3 times more likely to receive a  substantial assistance departure at a prosecutor\u2019s initiative than drug  offenders sentenced in the First Circuit during that same time period. The  likelihood a drug offender would be granted an other downward departure  also varied substantially. Adjusting for differences in offender and offense  characteristics, drug offenders sentenced in the Ninth Circuit from fiscal  years 1999-2001 were over 18 times more likely to have received an other  downward departure than similar drug offenders sentenced in the Fourth  Circuit during that same time period.", "The likelihood of courts to impose a sentence that fell below a mandatory  minimum due to substantial assistance or other reasons also varied  substantially across the 12 U.S. circuits and the 94 U.S. district courts,  even after taking into account offense and offender characteristics for  drug offenses. See appendix III for more details about the statistical  likelihood of drug sentences departing downward or falling below a  mandatory minimum and the variation in those likelihoods across all  circuits and districts.", "Our analysis shows variation\u2014in some cases substantial differences\u2014  among circuits and districts in the likelihood that offenders convicted of  drug offenses would receive substantial assistance or other downward  departures in fiscal years 1999-2001. However, these differences, in and of  themselves, may not indicate unwarranted sentencing departures or  misapplication of the sentencing guidelines. Empirical data on all factors  that could influence sentencing were not available, and so an analysis that  could fully explain why sentences varied was not possible."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Opportunities Exist to Improve Sentencing Data Collection and Reporting", "paragraphs": ["USSC data were generally sufficient for our analyses of downward  departures and mandatory minimum sentences across circuits and for  most districts. USSC\u2019s sentencing data are based on information from five  documents usually produced for each case during the sentencing process.  USSC requires that district courts send them these documents for each  sentence imposed but principally relies on three of them\u2014the Judgment  and Commitment Order (J&C), Statement of Reasons (SOR), and  Presentence Report (PSR)\u2014to identify the length of sentences imposed,  departures, and the reasons for departures. Nationally for drug cases,  USSC received 96 percent or more of each of these documents from the  district courts. The percentage of documents missing varied by circuit and  districts within circuits. For example, among the circuits the percentage of  missing SORs ranged from less than 1 percent to more than 7 percent.  Among districts within the Ninth Circuit, the percentage of missing SORs  ranged from less than 1 percent to more than 58 percent. Although USSC  received most of the requested documents, some were missing key  information or contained unclear information that was difficult to  interpret. For instance, among the 12 circuits, departure data were missing  for 1 percent to 7 percent of all drug sentences imposed in fiscal years  1999-2001. See appendix IV for more detailed information.", "In districts where the missing documents or information are concentrated  analysis of departures could be affected. Missing or unclear data also  limited our ability to determine when the safety valve was used as the  basis for sentencing below a mandatory minimum. For example, in our  preliminary analysis, we found that of the 11,256 federal drug sentences  for which the offense of conviction carried a mandatory minimum and fell  below that minimum, about 1,600 (14 percent) were coded by USSC as  falling below the applicable mandatory minimum but not involving either  the safety valve or substantial assistance. We discussed this issue with  USSC. After reviewing the underlying documents used for coding these  1,600 sentences, USSC determined that over 900 sentences were miscoded.  These miscoded sentences were recoded in a variety of ways, including  some coded as involving the safety valve, some coded as involving  substantial assistance, some coded as having a changed drug quantity that  affected the applicable mandatory minimum, and some coded as missing  safety valve information. USSC did not recode 681 sentences; these  sentences remained coded as falling below a mandatory minimum but  involving neither the safety valve nor substantial assistance. In addition,  safety valve information was determined to be missing from 770 sentences  for which the offense of conviction carried and fell below a mandatory  minimum.", "AOUSC and USSC officials offered several explanations for missing  documents and information or unclear information on documents that was  difficult to interpret and code consistently. AOUSC officials noted that  judges may not submit documents due to security concerns in cases where  the record has been sealed or the offender placed in the witness  protection program. Processing a high volume of drug cases could  potentially affect document submission, they also noted. Of the four  circuits with the highest volume of drug cases, two\u2014the Fourth and the  Ninth\u2014also had the highest percentage of missing SORs, 7.4 percent and  6.6 percent, respectively. Although AOUSC developed a standard SOR  form for judges to use, USSC officials said that judges submit information  to USSC using a variety of forms and formats. In USSC\u2019s view, this may  contribute to missing information on documents (e.g., forms that do not  prompt for an applicable mandatory minimum) or unclear information on  the forms that is difficult to interpret.", "In addition to these explanations, USSC and AOUSC officials said no  information had been provided to judges and other court officials on how  sentencing documents are used by USSC to create its database or how to  clearly and completely prepare forms such as the SOR to meet USSC\u2019s  data collection needs. USSC relies almost exclusively on the SOR to  determine whether the sentence imposed departed from the guidelines  range, met a mandatory minimum, or involved substantial assistance.  Thus, missing, incomplete, or difficult to interpret information on that  form can affect the completeness and accuracy of the data in USSC\u2019s  database.", "USSC has taken steps to reduce the number of missing documents and  information, but opportunities for improvements exist. For instance, USSC  sends an annual letter to the courts identifying those cases in which there  appear to be missing documents. However, USSC officials said they do not  inform courts of documents that, while received by USSC, contained  missing or unclear information. In addition, USSC collaborates with the  AOUSC and the Federal Judicial Center, the judiciary\u2019s research and  education body, to educate judges and court officials on how to apply the  sentencing guidelines, but they do not offer programs or workshops on  how to complete forms such as the SOR and other documents used by  USSC.", "Although the AOUSC has also taken steps to improve the quality of  sentencing data captured on the SOR, opportunities for improvements  remain. At its September 2003 meeting, the Judicial Conference of the  United States, the federal judiciary\u2019s principal policymaking body,  approved a new standard SOR form.  The Conference designated the new  form as the mechanism by which courts comply with the requirements of  the PROTECT Act to report reasons for sentences to USSC. The form was  revised in part because AOUSC officials and the Chair of the Judicial  Conference\u2019s Committee on Criminal Law stated that the previous SOR  provided an imprecise measure of judicial discretion. It did not collect  information on other downward departures that are initiated by the  prosecution. The form was revised in consultation with USSC to better  meet its data collection needs. However, a USSC official said that the new  SOR does not specifically prompt for information on the application of the  safety valve or whether the offense of conviction carried a mandatory  minimum. In addition, judges will not be required to use this form  although USSC believes that the most effective step to improving the  completeness of the data the district courts report is for all courts to use a  single, standard SOR. AOUSC officials said that while the Judicial  Conference has endorsed the new form, they do not believe that the  Conference has the authority to require judges to use the new SOR.  However, AOUSC officials stated that with additional education they  believe judges will see the benefits of the new form and routinely use it."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The judiciary provided and USSC collected and interpreted sentencing  information for the vast majority of the 72,283 drug sentences imposed  during fiscal years 1999-2001.

More could  be done to help reduce the number of documents that are missing,  incomplete, or too difficult for USSC to interpret. Evaluating how USSC  interprets sentencing data was beyond the scope of this work.

We provide these numbers and percentages in  appendix II.", "The simple differences in the percentage of drug sentences that fall below  the guidelines range or below the mandatory minimum may not, without  some adjustment, provide an appropriate basis for making comparisons  across circuits and districts. Characteristics of the offenses and offenders  sentenced can vary from one circuit or district to the next, and these  differences may affect the number or percent of sentences that fall below  applicable guideline ranges or a mandatory minimum. Judges in some  circuits or districts, for example, may sentence a greater proportion of  offenders who possessed and shared information of the crime that assisted  the government in the investigation or prosecution of others or whose  offenses were less serious.  Differences in these characteristics might  produce differences in sentences that have little to do with the exercise of  discretion. Therefore, the unadjusted differences in the percent of  sentences below the guidelines range or mandatory minimum might result  from judges sentencing different offenders, rather than from judges  sentencing offenders differently. Table 3 shows the offense and offender  characteristics we considered in the multivariate analyses we conducted  to adjust for such differences and re-estimate differences across circuits  and districts after taking them into account. It also provides the numbers  and percentages of all drug offenders or drug offenses that possessed each  of these characteristics.", "Our primary focus in this report involved understanding how departure  sentences vary across circuits and districts. Some of this variability across  circuits and districts in the percentages of substantial assistance  departures and other downward departures in the sentencing of drug  offenders results from differences in the characteristics of offenses and  offenders sentenced across circuits and districts. Moreover, the  prosecution has sole authority to initiate a downward departure for  substantial assistance, and all offenders are potentially eligible for such  consideration. If an offender receives a substantial assistance departure,  USSC codes the case as a substantial assistance departure and does not  reflect any other downward departures that the judge may have granted in  that particular case. Because of this coding convention, the percentage of  other downward departures is partly a function of the percentage of  downward departures for substantial assistance, which result from  prosecutorial motions. To understand how these percentages are derived,  it is useful to consider the following two hypothetical districts and the  numbers of sentences of each type in each district shown in table 4.", "The prosecution makes its selection for substantial assistance motions  after screening the total universe of 100 offenders sentenced in each  district. In our hypothetical example, the prosecutor offered and the court  accepted substantial assistance motions for 20 percent of 100 offenders in  district A and 50 percent of 100 offenders in district B\u2014or 30 percent less  in district A. Because USSC\u2019s coding convention distinguishes substantial  assistance cases from other downward departures, the universe of  offenders who could be coded as receiving other downward departures is  equal to the number of offenders who did not receive substantial  assistance departures. In district A this would be 80 offenders (100 minus  20 substantial assistance departures) and in district B it would be 50  (100 minus 50 substantial assistance departures). Using this universe of  offenders for our calculation, we would conclude that district A involves  10 percent fewer other departures than district B (40/80=50 percent versus  30/50=60 percent). While we offer percentages in some of the following  tables that, following standard procedures, are based on the total number  of offenders, we also use odds and odds ratios to describe the likelihoods  of sentences departing.

We first calculated the odds on  substantial assistance falling below a guideline range among all sentences,  and then calculated the odds on other downward departures for those  sentences that did not involve departures for substantial assistance. In  both cases odds were compared across circuits and districts by taking  their ratios. In our simple two district example above, the odds on  substantial assistance departures in districts A and B would be 20/80=0.25  and 50/50=1.0, respectively, and the odds ratio of 1.0/0.25=4.0 indicates  that the likelihood of substantial assistance departures were 4 times as  great in district B as in district A.

After  adjusting for differences across circuits in offense and offender  characteristics, the odds on substantial assistance departures were  significantly greater in three circuits than the Eighth Circuit.

Four circuits were not significantly different  from the Eighth Circuit in terms of the likelihood of sentences departing  for substantial assistance, and in the remaining 4 circuits substantial  assistance departures were significantly less likely. In the First Circuit, for  example, substantial assistance departures were less likely by a factor of  0.64, or 36 percent less likely, than in the Eighth Circuit. The fact that  some circuits are less likely than the Eighth Circuit while others are more  likely than the Eighth Circuit to depart for substantial assistance implies  that some differences between other circuits are larger than those  explicitly indicated by these ratios. For example, these ratios imply that  substantial assistance departures in the Third Circuit are 2.2/0.64=3.4  times as likely as in the First Circuit.", "Table 9 also shows that for those sentences that do not involve substantial  assistance departures, (and again after adjusting for offense and offender  characteristics), other downward departures are significantly more likely  in 4 circuits than in the Eighth Circuit, significantly less likely in 6 circuits  than in the Eighth Circuit, and no different in the other one. The fact that  other downward departures are 6.87 times more likely in the Ninth Circuit  than in the Eighth Circuit, but less likely by a factor of 0.37 in the Fourth  Circuit than in the Eighth Circuit, implies that such departures are  6.87/0.37 = 18.6 or 19 times as likely in the Ninth Circuit as in the Fourth  Circuit.", "Table 10 shows that both the adjusted odds ratios on substantial  assistance departures and other downward departures also varied  substantially and significantly across districts.

Twenty-three districts were not significantly  different from the Minnesota District in terms of the likelihood of  sentences departing for substantial assistance, and in the remaining 29  districts substantial assistance departures were significantly less likely. In  the Illinois Southern District, for example, substantial assistance  departures were less likely by a factor of 0.11, which implies that the  likelihood of substantial assistance departures were 9 times higher in the  Minnesota District than they were there. Other districts, these odds imply,  were even more disparate from one another. For example, these ratios  imply that substantial assistance departures in the New York Northern  District were 5.5/0.11=49.5 or 50 times more likely than in the Illinois  Southern District.", "Table 10 also shows that for those sentences that do not involve  substantial assistance departures, other downward departures are  significantly more likely in 7 districts than in the Minnesota district,  significantly less likely in 62 districts than in the Minnesota district, and no  different in the remaining 23 districts. The fact that other downward  departures are 15 times more likely in the California Southern District than  in the Minnesota district, but less likely by a factor of 0.09 in the South  Carolina District than in the Minnesota District, implies that such  departures are 15/0.09 = 167 times as likely in the California Southern  District as in the South Carolina District.", "Tables 11 and 12 pertain to mandatory minimum sentences and show that  substantial and often significant variation in the likelihood of sentences  falling below an otherwise applicable mandatory minimum exists even  after controls for differences in offense and offender characteristics  across circuits and districts. If we focus on the adjusted ratios in table 11  first, which estimate the differences among circuits after controls, we find  that there were some circuits in which the odds on sentences falling below  an otherwise applicable mandatory minimum due to substantial assistance  were significantly higher than in the Eighth Circuit, and others in which  those odds were significantly lower.", "The same is true of the likelihood of sentences falling below an otherwise  applicable mandatory minimum for reasons other than substantial  assistance.

USSC officials also said that they  rely almost exclusively on the SOR to obtain data on the basis for the  sentence, such as whether the sentence imposed fell within or outside the  applicable sentencing guidelines range as determined by the court, the  reason(s) for any departure, and whether a substantial assistance motion or safety valve adjustment was used. If the SOR is missing, USSC coding  procedures have required document analysts to record the departure  status as missing, although other documents, such as the plea agreement,  may have information that indicate whether and why the sentence  departed. USSC is initiating some changes in its coding procedures as  discussed below. From the PSR, which is drafted by a district probation  officer, USSC obtains demographic and other background information  about offenders, an initial sentencing recommendation according to the  guidelines, and other sentencing information such as whether the offense  of conviction had a mandatory minimum (should this information not be  noted in the J&C), and whether the safety valve could potentially be  applied (in certain limited circumstances where this information has not  been recorded in a SOR)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "USSC Receives Most of Requested Sentencing Documents", "paragraphs": ["Our analysis shows that district courts provided these five sentencing  documents to USSC for the great majority of drug sentences imposed in  fiscal years 1999-2001.

According  to USSC data, a lower percentage of plea agreements (89 percent) and  indictments (87 percent) were submitted during this time period. During  the period of our review, USSC did not primarily rely on these two  documents for departure information. Table 13 shows, by circuit, the  percentage of each type of sentencing document USSC did not receive in  fiscal years 1999-2001.", "Among the 12 circuits, the rate of missing SORs\u2014the principal document  used to determine the reason for a sentencing departure\u2014ranged from  less than 1 percent to about 7 percent. Two of the 4 circuits in which the  highest number of drug sentences were imposed were also missing the  highest percent of their SORs\u2013the 9th Circuit at 6.6 percent and the Fourth  Circuit at 7.4 percent. A circuit\u2019s average can mask wide differences  among the districts within the circuit.

USSC also attempts to identify  guidelines cases for which the courts may not have submitted any  sentencing documents. By linking data from a database maintained by  AOUSC with the data on cases in its database, USSC develops a list of  cases for which it has not yet received documentation.

As shown in table 14, among the circuits  imposed in fiscal years 1999-2001. In addition, for 4 percent to 15 percent of sentences, information was missing on whether the safety value was  used as the basis for sentencing below a mandatory minimum.", "Nationally, of the 72,283 federal drug sentence imposed in fiscal years  1999-2001, 3,004 (4 percent) were coded as missing information necessary  to determine whether the sentence departed from an applicable guideline  range. Of these, 2,118 sentences were missing information because the  SOR had not been received, and for 570, the SOR was received but did not  include departure information.", "Missing or unclear data also limited our ability to determine when the  safety valve was used as the basis for sentencing below an otherwise  applicable mandatory minimum. For example, in our preliminary analysis,  we found that of the 11,256 federal drug sentences for which the offense of  conviction carried a mandatory minimum and fell below that minimum,  about 1,600 (14 percent) were coded by USSC as falling below the  applicable mandatory minimum but not involving either the safety valve or  substantial assistance. We discussed this issue with USSC. After reviewing  the underlying documents used for coding these 1,600 sentences, USSC  determined that over 900 sentences were miscoded. These miscoded  sentences were recoded in a variety of ways, including some coded as  involving the safety valve, some coded as involving substantial assistance,  some coded as having a changed drug quantity that affected the applicable  mandatory minimum, and some coded as missing safety valve information.  USSC did not recode 681 sentences; these sentences remained coded as  falling below a mandatory minimum but involving neither the safety valve  nor substantial assistance. In addition, safety valve information was  determined to be missing from 770 sentences for which the offense of  conviction carried and fell below a mandatory minimum. A USSC official  said that there is no specific prompt on the SOR asking for information on  the application of the safety valve or whether the offense of conviction  carried a mandatory minimum.", "On the basis of our analysis, missing or incomplete sentencing information  is unlikely to affect analyses nationally or by circuit but could affect the  analysis of departures in districts where the missing documents or  information are concentrated. Missing or incomplete sentencing  information may also affect USSC\u2019s records for individual judges and thus  USSC\u2019s ability to provide accurate judge-specific sentencing analysis were  Congress to request this information under the auspices of the PROTECT  Act."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "USSC Actions to Improve Coding", "paragraphs": ["USSC officials told us that they have not generally followed-up with  district courts to obtain information that is missing from submitted  documents or is unclear (e.g., whether the safety valve provision was the  basis for a sentence below an applicable mandatory minimum).

As a result of coding issues we  identified during this review, USSC plans to implement new quality control  and review procedures for sentences where information on the SOR is  missing, incomplete, or unclear. These include identifying common errors  for coding staff, using technology to develop automatic edit checks for  apparently contradictory coding information for a sentence (e.g., those  below an applicable mandatory minimum whose reason for departure is  not substantial assistance or the safety valve), and having a staff attorney  review sentences in which the coding supervisor is unable to determine  the appropriate coding."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Multiple Reasons Cited for Missing Documentation and Information", "paragraphs": ["Officials from USSC, the AOUSC, and the Judicial Conference Committee  on Criminal Law cited several reasons that sentencing documents or  information on sentencing documents were missing. First, USSC and  AOUSC officials told us that some judges do not provide all the  documents, in part because judges may be unclear whether documents  under court seal or that pertain to individuals in the federal witness  protection program are to be forwarded to USSC.", "Second, USSC relies almost exclusively on the SOR to determine whether  the sentence departed, met a mandatory minimum, or involved substantial  assistance. If the SOR is missing, USSC\u2019s coding procedures require  document analysts to record the departure status as missing, even if other  documents, such as the plea agreement, suggests that a departure may by  recommended by the government. As a result, incomplete information  prevents USSC from collecting some sentencing data, as illustrated below  by two examples drawn from drug sentences imposed during fiscal years  1999-2001:", "In one case, the SOR did not indicate the reason the court sentenced the  offender to 97 months\u2014a sentence below the applicable 10-year (120  month) mandatory minimum. Without this information on the SOR, under  the coding conventions used, USSC document analysts could not record  substantial assistance as the reason that the sentence of 97 months fell  below a mandatory minimum even though the plea agreement (prepared  by the parties) and the PSR (prepared by the probation officer) indicated  that a substantial assistance motion was to have been made.", "In another case, the SOR stated that the court was crediting the offender  for time served but failed to state the specific amount of time being  credited. Unable to determine the amount of time being credited, and thus  the sentence length being imposed, USSC document analysts could not  determine whether the sentence departed or met an applicable mandatory  minimum.", "Third, judges report the information using different versions of the SOR  forms that can make consistent interpretation more difficult. For example,  some jurisdictions provide one-page, single-spaced narratives that report  the sentence and, in rare cases, others provide a transcript of the  sentencing hearing instead of an SOR. According to USSC officials,  interpreting multiple forms that report sentencing information in different  ways and in different locations complicates the process of coding  sentencing data such as departure status and use of the safety valve and  may lead to missing sentencing information. USSC officials stated the  single most effective step towards improving the completeness of data the  courts report and USSC\u2019s ability to code it would be the increased use of a  standard SOR. The Judicial Conference at its September 2003 meeting  accepted revisions to the standard SOR. The Conference designated the  revised form as the mechanism by which courts comply with the  requirements of the PROTECT Act to report reasons for sentences to  USSC. The Committee plans to encourage judges to use it through  education about the benefits of its use, but the Chair of the Committee  stated that the Committee does not believe it has the authority to require  the use of the new SOR. Officials from AOUSC and the Committee said  they believe that with additional education judges will routinely use the  new standard SOR, resulting in more useful and higher quality data  reported to USSC.", "Last, according to officials from AOUSC and the Criminal Law Committee,  judges and other court officials lack an awareness of how to complete the  SORs with a level of detail that would allow USSC to collect sentencing  information. The Committee official said that education for judges and  other court officials is needed on how to properly complete the SOR. In  addition, no feedback mechanism is in place to inform judges that  information on the SOR was incomplete or unclear to USSC and,  therefore, cases are coded as missing sentencing information. Although  USSC contacts the courts to request missing sentencing documents be  submitted, it does not provide a similar list of documents that contained  information coded as missing. Without knowing which cases are coded as  missing sentencing information, judges cannot clarify or complete  information needed by USSC.", "While USSC and the Federal Judicial Center offer programs and  workshops on application of the guidelines to judges and other court  officials, no education programs are provided on how to complete the SOR  in ways that provide clear, complete information. Officials from USSC,  AOUSC, and Criminal Law Committee said that education on how to apply  increasingly complex guidelines has been their focus, not educating judges  and other officials to correctly complete the SOR. Officials also said that in  the future it would be possible to provide programs at judicial workshops  or through the Federal Judicial Center that educates judges and other  court officials on how to provide clear, complete reports on sentencing."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Downward Departures Do Not Solely Reflect Judicial Discretion", "paragraphs": ["The category \u201cother downward departures\u201d generally thought to represent  judicial discretion may also reflect downward departures resulting from  prosecutorial discretion and initiative. In this report we classified  departures as either \u201csubstantial assistance\u201d or \u201cother downward\u201d  departures. Substantial assistance departures can be viewed as a measure  of prosecutorial discretion because only the prosecutor has the authority  to initiate and recommend to the court that an offender be given a reduced  sentence for substantial assistance to the prosecution. Neither the judge  nor defense counsel may do so. The remaining departures, \u201cother  downward departures,\u201d are generally considered to be an indication of  judicial discretion. AOUSC officials suggested, however, that the category  \u201cother downward departures\u201d provides an imprecise measure of judicial  discretion.

We did not confirm this statement with  federal prosecutors. USSC documents in its database up to three reasons  judges provide for an other downward departure.
