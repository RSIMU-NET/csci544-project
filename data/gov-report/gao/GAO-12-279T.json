The Congressional Budget Office estimated in 2011 that the Recovery Act would cost $840 billion, including more than $40 billion in science-related activities at the Department of Energy (DOE), Department of Commerce, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and the National Science Foundation (NSF). These activities support fundamental research, demonstrate and deploy advanced energy technologies, purchase scientific instrumentation and equipment, and construct or modernize research facilities. The Recovery Act assigned GAO with a range of responsibilities, such as bimonthly reviews of how selected states and localities used funds, including for science-related activities.

This testimony is based on prior GAO work updated with agency data as of September 30, 2011."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["As of September 30, 2011, DOE, Commerce, NSF, and NASA had obligated about 98 percent of the more than $40 billion appropriated for science-related activities identified at those agencies. They had spent $22 billion, or 54 percent of appropriated funds. DOE received the majority of this funding, and the four agencies vary in the amount of Recovery Act funds they have obligated and spent for their programs, as well as the challenges they have faced in implementing the Recovery Act. For example: 1) Loan Guarantee Program for Innovative Technologies. As of September 30, 2011, DOE had obligated about 78 percent of the nearly $2.5 billion provided for this program, which among other things guarantees loans for projects using new or significantly improved technologies as compared with commercial technologies already in use in the United States and reported spending about 15 percent of those funds. In a July 2010 report (GAO-10-627), GAO made four recommendations for DOE to improve its evaluation and implementation of the program. DOE has begun to take steps to address our recommendations but has not fully addressed them, and GAO continues to believe DOE needs to make improvements to the program. 2) Weatherization Assistance Program. As of September 30, 2011, DOE had obligated the full $5 billion of Recovery Act funding provided for the Weatherization Assistance Program, which enables low-income families to reduce their utility bills by making long-term energy-efficiency improvements to their homes, and reported spending about 72 percent of those funds. In a May 2010 report (GAO-10-604), GAO made eight recommendations to DOE to clarify guidance and production targets. To date, DOE has implemented two of those recommendations: (1) it issued guidance on multi-family buildings and (2) clarified the definition of income and strengthened income eligibility requirements. 3) Commerce, NASA, and NSF. As of September 30, 2011, Commerce, NASA, and NSF each had obligated nearly all of their science-related Recovery Act funding. Commerce spent about 62 percent, NASA spent about 95 percent, and NSF spent about 46 percent of this funding. GAO has reported several times on the use of these funds and the challenges agencies faced. In a February 2010 report (GAO-10-383), GAO found that some recipients of Commerce's Recovery Act grants faced challenges complying with Recovery Act reporting and other federal requirements and had to delay or recast certain scheduled activities as a result. In a March 2009 report (GAO-09-306SP), GAO found that NASA's large-scale projects, including those that received Recovery Act funds, had experienced significant cost and schedule delays. In a March 2011 report, (GAO-11-239SP), GAO found that Recovery Act funds allowed NASA to reduce the impact of cost increases on some projects and to address problems being experienced by others. In GAO's October 2010 report (GAO-11-127R), it found that NSF's program to increase investment in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education took steps to evaluate the long-term effectiveness of its projects and developed goals and metrics for that evaluation."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss our oversight of science-related  funding provided by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of  2009 (Recovery Act).

In that  report, we found that more than 65 percent of EECBG funds had been  obligated for three types of activities: (1) energy-efficiency retrofits (36.8  percent), which includes activities such as grants to nonprofit  organizations and governmental agencies for retrofitting their existing  facilities to improve energy efficiency; (2) financial incentive programs  (18.5 percent), which includes activities such as rebates, subgrants, and  revolving loans to promote recipients\u2019 energy-efficiency improvements;  and (3) energy-efficiency and conservation programs for buildings and  facilities (9.8 percent), which includes activities such as installing storm  windows or solar hot water technology.", "We also found that DOE did not always collect information on the various  methods that recipients use to monitor contractors and subrecipients.  As a result, DOE does not always know whether the monitoring activities  of recipients are sufficiently rigorous to ensure compliance with federal  requirements. In addition, DOE officials have experienced challenges in  assessing the extent to which the EECBG program is reducing energy  use and increasing energy savings. Most recipients report estimates to  comply with program reporting requirements, and DOE takes steps to  assess the reasonableness of these estimates but does not require  recipients to report the methods or tools used to develop estimates. In  addition, while DOE provides recipients with a software tool to estimate  energy savings, DOE does not require that recipients use the most recent  version.", "Based on these findings, we recommended that DOE (1) explore a  means to capture information on recipients\u2019 monitoring activities and (2)  solicit information on recipients\u2019 methods for estimating energy-related  impact metrics and verify that recipients who use DOE\u2019s estimation tool  use the most recent version. DOE generally agreed with our  recommendations and has taken steps to implement them. DOE  took action on our first recommendation by collecting additional information  related to subrecipient monitoring, in order to help ensure that they  comply with the terms and conditions of the award. These changes will  help improve DOE\u2019s oversight of recipients. DOE implemented our  second recommendation by making changes to the way it collects data to  apply a unified methodology to the calculation of impact metrics.

DOE designated 80 percent of this funding to  speed cleanup activities at four large sites: the Hanford Site in Washington  State, Idaho National Laboratory, the Oak Ridge Reservation in Tennessee,  and the Savannah River Site in South Carolina. DOE generally chose to use  Recovery Act funds for cleanup projects that could be started and finished  quickly. The majority of the projects selected also had existing contracts,  which allowed the department to update and validate new cost and schedule  targets within a short time frame. DOE generally funded four types of  projects: (1) decontaminating or demolishing facilities, (2) removing  contamination from soil and groundwater, (3) packaging and disposing of  transuranic and other wastes, and (4) supporting the maintenance and  treatment of liquid tank wastes. According to DOE officials, as of the end of  May 2011, DOE had completed 28 Recovery Act projects.", "In July 2010, we reported that DOE has faced challenges in both  managing Recovery Act projects and measuring how Recovery Act  funding has affected cleanup and other goals. that one-third of Recovery Act-funded environmental cleanup projects did  not meet cost and schedule targets, which DOE attributed to technical,  regulatory, safety, and contracting issues. DOE took steps aimed at  strengthening project management and oversight for Recovery Act  projects, such as increasing project reporting requirements and placing  tighter controls on when funds are disbursed to sites. By October 2010,  DOE had made improvements in both cost and schedule performance.", "GAO, Recovery Act: Most DOE Cleanup Projects Appear to Be Meeting Cost and  Schedule Targets, but Assessing Impact of Spending Remains a Challenge, GAO-10-784  (Washington, D.C., July 29, 2010). very different and potentially misleading information. Second, DOE had  not yet developed a clear means of measuring how cleanup work funded  by the act would affect environmental risk or the land and facilities  requiring DOE cleanup. Third, it is unclear to what extent Recovery Act  funding will reduce the costs of cleaning up the DOE sites over the long  term. DOE\u2019s estimate of $4 billion in life-cycle cost savings resulting from  Recovery Act funding was not calculated in accordance with Office of  Management and Budget\u2019s guidance on benefit-cost analysis or DOE\u2019s  guidance on life-cycle cost analysis.

In  one instance, DOE specifically disagreed with our findings: the  department maintained that applicants are treated consistently within  solicitations. Nevertheless, the department stated that it is taking steps to  address concerns identified in our report. For example, with regard to  appeals, DOE indicated that its process for rejected applications should  be made more transparent and stated that the LGP continues to  implement new strategies intended to reduce the need for any kind of  appeals, such as enhanced communication with applicants and allowing  applicants an opportunity to provide additional data to address  deficiencies DOE has identified in applications.

Initially, DOE  provided each recipient with the first 10 percent of its allocated funds,  which could be used for start-up activities, such as hiring and training  staff, purchasing equipment, and performing energy audits of homes.  Before a recipient could receive the next 40 percent, DOE required it to  submit a plan for how it would use its Recovery Act weatherization funds.

We also recommended that DOE  develop and clarify weatherization program guidance that establishes  best practices for how income eligibility should be determined and  documented and that does not allow the self-certification of income by  applicants to be the sole method of documenting income eligibility. In  response to our recommendation, DOE issued guidance that clarified the  definition of income and strengthened income eligibility requirements. For  example, the guidance clarified that self-certification of income would only  be allowed after all other avenues of documenting income eligibility are  exhausted. Additionally, for individuals to self-certify income, a notarized  statement indicating the lack of other proof of income is required. Finally,  DOE agreed with our recommendation that it have a best practice guide  for key internal controls, but DOE officials stated that there were sufficient  documents in place to require internal controls, such as the grant terms  and conditions and a training module, and that because the guidance is  located in on the website, a best practice guide would be redundant.  Therefore, DOE officials stated that they do not intend to fully implement  our recommendation.
