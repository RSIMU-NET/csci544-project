According to BOP officials, delays resulted from problems with selecting and approving the sites for the prisons and with the availability of funding. BOP officials stated that they expected costs to increase by the inflation rate during the delay period, but did not anticipate that market forces would cause the construction costs to increase above the inflation rate, as they did. For example, steel prices rose about 60 percent and oil prices rose by almost 170 percent between the time that BOP prepared the initial cost estimates for these projects and when construction was ready to begin. In addition, because BOP estimates initial project costs early in the planning process, generally before an actual prison location is selected, variance from the initial estimates would be expected to some extent, even if the projects are not delayed. BOP, like other agencies, is not required to communicate how much it expects costs may vary from its estimates in its budget documents. Without such information, Congress and other stakeholders do not know the extent to which additional funding may be required to complete the project, even absent any project delays. BOP eliminated or reduced portions of two projects to remain within the amount that was funded and plans to use its construction management policies and procedures to control further cost increases and schedule delays. When awarding the contract for FCI Mendota in 2007, BOP eliminated a UNICOR facility, which would have provided additional employment and job skills training opportunities for inmates, and the minimum-security prison camp. At FCI Berlin, BOP eliminated the UNICOR facility when it awarded the contract in 2007, but subsequently added a smaller UNICOR facility to the project, which will be paid for by UNICOR. Intended to reduce costs, these changes also reduced the functionality of the two prisons, deviating from what BOP planned and requested funding for. In the subsequent budget submission to Congress and other stakeholders, BOP did not clearly communicate these changes, since BOP does not provide such detailed project information. Now that BOP has awarded the construction contracts for the three projects, BOP officials believe that their construction management policies and procedures will allow them to control cost increases and schedule delays. These policies and procedures reflect current government and industry project management practices to monitor and track projects, and to report on their status. Furthermore, BOP officials said that they plan to continue to avoid making changes that would increase construction costs after construction begins. GAO did not evaluate the effectiveness of BOP's construction policies and procedures in controlling cost increases and schedule delays on these projects because while construction contracts were awarded, little construction had been done."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP), within the Department of Justice  (DOJ), is responsible for the custody and care of more than 201,000 federal  offenders.

BOP is organized into six regions of the  country\u2014Mid-Atlantic, North Central, Northeast, South Central,  Southeast, and Western. BOP manages the construction of and operates  institutions at five security levels\u2014minimum, low, medium, high, or  administrative security\u2014to confine offenders in an appropriate manner.  Institutions constructed for a given security level generally have the same  design and features. For example, FCIs, which are medium-security  institutions, generally have strengthened perimeter fencing, cell-type  housing, and a wide variety of work and treatment programs. As such, FCI  construction projects typically include a UNICOR facility that employs and  provides job skills training to inmates. UNICOR is a government  corporation administered by DOJ, with the Director of the Bureau of  Prisons as its Chief Executive Officer. FCI construction projects also  generally include an adjacent work- and program-oriented minimum- security Federal Prison Camp, where inmates help serve the labor needs of  the larger, higher-security FCI.", "We have previously reported that BOP follows a centralized, long-term  capacity planning process, with the aim of ensuring sufficient institutional  capacity while maintaining prison populations at safe-and-secure targeted  levels. BOP has two planning committees that are involved in the capital  decision-making process to identify new facility prison construction  projects: the Capacity Planning Committee (CPC) and the Long-Range  Planning Committee (LRPC). According to BOP headquarters officials,  CPC proposes new projects by BOP region using the Capacity Plan, which  provides projections of inmate population and rates of prison  overcrowding. BOP develops initial budget estimates for the projects that  CPC proposes, and LRPC ranks the proposed new prison facility  construction projects and makes specific funding recommendations to the  Director of BOP. The new construction projects are ranked on the basis of  agency need, funding, and the speed with which the projects can be  constructed.", "BOP includes its proposed new construction projects in its annual Federal  Prison System budget request made to DOJ. As part of the DOJ annual  congressional budget submission, BOP also provides its Federal Prison  System Status of Construction report (status report), which provides  information on the status of construction for major projects that have  received funding. The specific information provided is as follows: each  project\u2019s descriptive title, with name, type, and location; the amounts  funded, by fiscal year; the total project cost estimates; the funds obligated  to date; the estimated year of use; and a brief status of the project.

Given that its prisons for a specific  security level generally have the same design features, BOP uses cost and  pricing information from a previous project to create a national average  cost for construction as the basis for its initial estimate of a new project.  To develop an initial cost estimate, BOP adjusts its national average cost  by assumptions for various factors, such as the difference in construction  costs for different regions of the country, the difficulty of construction,  and the expected inflation until construction is planned to begin. For  example, in 1999, BOP created a national average construction cost for an  FCI on the basis of the average of the 1998 bids for FCI Petersburg,  Virginia, the most recently available FCI construction cost information.  BOP adjusted FCI Petersburg\u2019s pricing information to take into account  inflation between 1998 and 1999 and the relative construction costs in  Petersburg.

BOP used this estimate as the basis for  requesting funding.", "BOP\u2019s process of using cost information from an earlier project to  estimate the cost of a similar proposed project is one of the types of  estimates discussed in OMB\u2019s guidance.

When BOP  initially estimated the cost for this project, it expected the contract to be  awarded in fiscal year 2001 and the construction to begin in fiscal year  2002. However, BOP did not award the contract to design and construct  the prison until fiscal year 2004. Mendota was selected as the prison site in  fiscal year 2002, at which time BOP changed the project to a medium- security FCI. Subsequent environment impact studies and approvals,  which included review and approval by the Environmental Protection  Agency (EPA), were completed in fiscal year 2004. In addition, the  continued availability of funding for this project came into question in  fiscal year 2004, when Congress rescinded almost $52 million of funding.  Furthermore, in fiscal year 2005 an amendment to the President\u2019s Budget  proposed canceling $55 million from the unobligated balances in the  Buildings and Facilities Account previously provided for the FCI Mendota  project.", "Despite this disruption in the available funding, BOP continued with the  FCI Mendota project because it expected that the rescinded funds would  be restored the following year. Partly as a result of the rescission, BOP  officials separated the work for this project into several pieces. This  decision enabled BOP to award a single contract for the project\u2019s design  and construction in September 2004. The contract was structured for the  contractor to begin with design and allowed BOP to decide when and what  pieces of the construction would be done on the basis of the availability of  funding. In December 2004, with the funding it had, BOP directed the  contractor to construct the central utility plant, water tower, and general  housing units. The contract required BOP to award the remaining pieces  necessary to complete the facility\u2014such as the support structures,  UNICOR factory, and Federal Prison Camp\u2014no later than 2006 or the  option to do this work under the contract would expire. BOP did not  exercise the contract option because it had not received additional funds.  As a result, when the contractor completed its work, BOP could not house  prisoners at FCI Mendota.

For example, BOP could analyze the design documents  or itemized costs that contractors on previous projects included in their  bills.

Underestimating projects can lead an agency to request less  resources than it will actually need to complete the project, potentially  leading to a significant reduction in the project scope, termination of the  project, or the shifting of funds from other projects. Inaccurate estimates  also reduce confidence in the accuracy of future estimates provided by an  agency.

To  accomplish these tasks, BOP\u2019s Construction Management Guidelines  provides additional guidance, which identifies the processes that BOP staff  must follow to monitor the requirements and implementation of BOP  construction projects.

For example, this guidance requires the use of critical path method  scheduling that breaks a project down into a sequence of necessary  activities, which are placed into a project schedule that the project  manager can closely monitor. With this management tool, BOP has the  ability to monitor and track a project\u2019s current progression of work in  relation to its initial schedule. This tool also gives the project manager the  ability to evaluate proposed construction changes or modifications to the  project and to understand their resulting impacts on the project\u2019s  schedule.

Our review showed that  BOP\u2019s construction management policies and procedures required systems  for monitoring, tracking, analyzing, forecasting, and reporting the status of a  project. For example, we found that BOP has procedures for reporting  important project information\u2014such as cost and schedule, and their  deviations from trends\u2014to the appropriate personnel, including management.  Furthermore, BOP has procedures for corrective actions when deviations in  cost and schedule occur as well as procedures for controlling project changes  or modifications.", "In addition to the guidance, BOP officials said that the use of the Design- Build delivery system for two of these projects will help to reduce the risk  of additional costs being incurred during construction. This type of  project delivery system places the project design and construction under  one contract. This can reduce the risk of design errors being identified  during construction and leading to project delays or cost increases. To  provide some context to the extent that Design-Build contracting is  effective in managing construction, we reviewed the National Institute of  Standards and Technology and the CII study of the performance of the  Design-Build delivery method versus the traditional Design-Bid-Build  delivery system. The study found that for maintaining the project\u2019s  schedule, as well as for managing any changes or rework needed during  the project\u2019s construction, when the project was managed by its owner the  Design-Build system performed better than the Design-Bid-Build system.", "BOP officials stated that they have more ability to control costs while the  project is under construction, and that for the FCI Mendota, FCI Berlin,  and FCI McDowell prison projects, they plan to continue to carefully  consider and approve changes after construction has begun to stay within  its budget. Since construction of the projects has just begun, it is too early  to evaluate the effectiveness of BOP\u2019s construction policies and  procedures in controlling cost increases and schedule delays."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["When BOP asks Congress or other stakeholders to fund or support  projects, it is important for them to be aware of the extent to which actual  project costs may vary from the initial estimate. Given the continual  competition for limited funds, understanding that a proposed project may  need an additional 30 percent in funding as opposed to an additional 10  percent may influence their approval and funding decisions. In addition,  BOP is developing its estimates and requests funding on the basis of the  various facilities it intends to include in each project. If elements of a  proposed and funded project that can affect its functionality are  eliminated, the project may not fulfill decision makers\u2019 expectations. In  addition, later construction of the omitted facilities would likely cost more  than if they had been constructed as one project. As the need for prison  space continues to grow, BOP\u2019s ability to complete projects within budget  and with the elements initially anticipated will be important to  demonstrating BOP\u2019s ability to manage its construction program. By  providing information on the accuracy of its cost estimates and clearly  communicating changes that could impact the projects functionality, BOP  would establish more accountability and transparency to its stakeholders."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To improve accountability and transparency, we are making two  recommendations to the Attorney General of the United States to instruct  the Director of BOP to clearly communicate to Congress and other  stakeholders in DOJ\u2019s annual congressional budget submission, in which  BOP provides its requests for funding and reports on the status of  construction projects:  the extent to which project costs may vary from initial estimates and   changes that may impact the functionality of projects."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Department of Justice for its  review and comment.
