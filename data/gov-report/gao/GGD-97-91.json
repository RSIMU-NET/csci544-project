With respect to the tribes\u2019 federally chartered corporations, IRS takes the view that no taxable entity separate from the tribes exists.

Thus, IRA allowed for a dual mechanism by which the governmental affairs of an Indian tribe are conducted under a constitution and bylaws adopted under IRA section 16 and the commercial matters are handled by a business corporation organized under section 17.", "IRA section 16 provided that \u201cIn addition to all powers vested in any Indian tribe by existing law, the constitution shall also vest in such tribe or its tribal council .\u201d An early opinion of the Solicitor for the Department of the Interior considered the issue of what powers are incorporated in the constitution and bylaws of an Indian tribe by this reference to \u201cpowers vested in any Indian tribe or tribal council.\u201d The opinion concluded that the vested powers are those powers of local self-government that have never been terminated by law or waived by treaty, including the power to: (1) adopt a form of government, create offices, and prescribe the duties thereof; (2) regulate the domestic relations of tribal members; (3) levy dues, fees, or taxes upon tribal members; and (4) regulate the use and disposition of all property within the jurisdiction of the tribe.", "The opinion noted that the list was based on general legislation and judicial decisions of general application and was subject to modification with respect to particular tribes, in light of particular powers granted or particular restrictions imposed by special legislation. \u201ca striking indication on the part of Congress and the executive department of the Government charged with administering various Indian laws that Indian tribes as such have been recognized as political agencies and have never lost their inherent powers of limited sovereignty . . .  an Indian tribe, as such, is not a taxable entity within the purview of the income tax provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.\u201d", "This principle forms the basis for the IRS policy on the income tax status of Indian tribes, as set forth in the series of revenue rulings. IRS has determined, however, that although Indian tribes are governments, they are not political subdivisions of the United States, individual states, or territories for purposes of the Code provisions that apply special tax treatment to these governmental units. These include the state exemptions from excise taxes, the income tax exemption for interest on municipal bonds, and the deduction of charitable contributions to governmental units for estate tax purposes. In 1982, Congress enacted the Indian Tribal Tax Status Act (Tribal Tax Act), treating tribal governments as states for a number of specified tax provisions, including provisions relating to tax-exempt bonds, charitable contribution deductions, and certain excise tax provisions.

IRS has determined that federally chartered tribal corporations organized under IRA section 17 are not subject to federal income taxation, regardless of where the income is earned. In Rev. Rul. 81-295, IRS found that a federally chartered Indian tribal corporation has the same tax status as the tribe and is not taxable. The revenue ruling described a particular federally chartered Indian tribe. The tribe was formally organized under a constitution and bylaws pursuant to IRA section 16. In addition, at the time of formal organization, the tribal members had ratified a corporate charter as permitted by IRA section 17. The Secretary of the Interior had approved the tribe\u2019s constitution and bylaws and the corporation\u2019s charter. This principle was affirmed in Rev. Rul. 94-16.", "Further, in Rev. Rul. 94-65, IRS concluded that a tribal corporation organized under the Oklahoma Indian Welfare Act section 3 is not subject to federal income taxation on the income earned in the conduct of commercial business in or outside of Indian-owned lands.", "State-chartered Tribal Corporations Are Subject to Federal Income Tax. IRS has determined that a corporation organized by an Indian tribe under state law is subject to federal income tax regardless of the location of the activities that generate the income. In Rev. Rul. 94-16, IRS reasoned that a corporation organized by an Indian tribe under state law is not the same as an Indian tribal corporation organized under IRA section 17 and does not share the same tax status as the tribe for federal income tax purposes.", "Wholly-owned Tribal Law Corporations Generally Have Not Been Subject to Administrative Attempts to Impose Income Taxes. Although IRS has addressed the tax status of federally recognized Indian tribes and federally chartered corporations, it has not issued a published ruling on the tax status of wholly-owned corporations chartered under tribal law.

Although IRS has not issued published rulings, IRS officials are not aware of any administrative attempt to date to impose federal income taxes on wholly-owned tribal corporations.", "Payment of Other Federal Taxes. IRS has determined that Indian tribal governments have no inherent exemption from excise taxes, but section 7871 of the Code provides them with a limited exemption. In Rev. Rul. 94-82, 1994-2 C.B. 412, IRS cited Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs Reservation v. Kurtz, in which the court found that an Indian tribe did not fit within the excise tax exemption for \u201cany State, any political subdivision of a State, or the District of Columbia.\u201d The court reasoned that since the tribe did not derive authority from the state, the state government exemption is not applicable to the tribe.", "Section 7871 specifically provides that a tribal government is to be treated as a state for purposes of certain excise taxes if the transaction involves the exercise of an essential governmental function. Consequently, Indian tribes performing essential governmental functions share the same excise tax exemptions as states for many excise taxes. However, both Indian tribes and states are subject to wagering excise taxes. The states are, however, exempt from excise taxes on lotteries.", "Payments to Tribal Members Are Taxable. No provision of the Internal Revenue Code exempts individual Indians from the payment of federal income tax; thus, exemptions must be based on a treaty or an act of Congress. In some cases, a tribal member may receive general welfare payments from the tribe. Although amounts paid for general welfare may not be taxable, payments made pro rata to all tribal members are evidence that the payments are not based on need and, thus, probably will not qualify for the general welfare exclusion.", "The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988 provided that the net revenues from any tribal gaming are not to be used for purposes other than to (1) fund tribal government operations or programs, (2) provide for the general welfare of the Indian tribe and its members, (3) promote tribal economic development, (4) donate to charitable organizations, or (5) help fund operations of local government agencies.", "IGRA also provided that net revenues from gaming may be used to make per capita payments to members of the Indian tribe, but only if the tribe has prepared a revenue allocation plan to allocate revenues to uses authorized by IGRA. The plan must be approved by the Secretary of the Interior as adequate, particularly with respect to the funding of tribal government operations or programs and promoting tribal economic development. IGRA also required that the interests of minors and other legally incompetent persons entitled to receive any of the payments be protected and preserved. Because the payments are per capita distributions of gaming proceeds, they are generally subject to taxation when distributed. Additionally, IGRA itself provides that the per capita payments are subject to federal taxation, and the act requires that tribes notify their members of the tax liability when payments are made.", "Section 3402(r) of the Internal Revenue Code provides that every person making a payment to a member of an Indian tribe from the net revenues from class II or class III gaming activity must withhold income taxes from the payment. The withholding is capped at 31 percent. Tribal governments must report the total amount of taxable per capita payments made to each tribal member on Form 1099-Misc.

In addition, to determine the economic impact of gaming on the tribes, several factors would need to be considered, such as poverty levels and other revenues generated by the tribes; we did not address these factors because they were beyond the scope of this report.

Class III facilities relied primarily on casino games and slot machines, and this was also the case for Nevada and Atlantic City casinos.
