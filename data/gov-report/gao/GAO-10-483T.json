Congress and the President need reliable, useful, and timely financial and performance information to make sound decisions and conduct effective oversight of federal government programs and policies. The federal government began preparing the CFS 13 years ago. Over the years, certain material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting have prevented GAO from expressing an opinion on the accrual-based consolidated financial statements. Unless these weaknesses are adequately addressed, they will, among other things, continue to (1) hamper the federal government's ability to reliably report a significant portion of its assets, liabilities, costs, and other related information; and (2) affect the federal government's ability to reliably measure the full cost as well as the financial and nonfinancial performance of certain programs and activities. This testimony presents the results of GAO's audit of the CFS for fiscal year 2009 and discusses certain of the federal government's significant near- and long-term fiscal challenges."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["For the third consecutive year, GAO rendered an unqualified opinion on the Statement of Social Insurance (SOSI). Given the importance of social insurance programs like Medicare and Social Security to the federal government's long-term fiscal outlook, the SOSI is critical to understanding the federal government's financial condition and fiscal sustainability. Three major impediments continued to prevent GAO from rendering an opinion on the federal government's consolidated financial statements other than the SOSI: (1) serious financial management problems at the Department of Defense, (2) federal entities' inability to adequately account for and reconcile intragovernmental activity and balances, and (3) an ineffective process for preparing the consolidated financial statements. In addition to the material weaknesses underlying these major impediments, GAO noted material weaknesses involving improper payments estimated to be at least $98 billion for fiscal year 2009, information security, and tax collection activities. The recession and the federal government's unprecedented actions intended to stabilize the financial markets and to promote economic recovery have significantly affected the federal government's financial condition. The resulting substantial investments and increases in liabilities, net operating cost, the unified budget deficit, and debt held by the public are reported in the U.S. government's consolidated financial statements for fiscal year 2009. The ultimate cost of these actions and their impact on the federal government's financial condition will not be known for some time in part because the valuation of these assets and liabilities is based on assumptions and estimates that are inherently uncertain. Looking ahead, the federal government will need to determine the most expeditious manner in which to bring closure to its financial stabilization initiatives while optimizing its investment returns. In addition, problems in the nation's financial sector have exposed serious weaknesses in the current U.S. financial regulatory system. If those weaknesses are not adequately addressed, we could see similar or even worse crises in the future. Consequently, meaningful financial regulatory reform is of utmost concern. The federal government faces a long-term fiscal challenge resulting from large and growing structural deficits that are driven on the spending side primarily by rising health care costs and known demographic trends. GAO prepares long-term fiscal simulations that include projections of revenue and expenditures for all federal programs. As a result, these simulations present a comprehensive analysis of the sustainability of the federal government's long-term fiscal outlook. Many of the pressures highlighted in GAO's simulations, including health care cost growth and the aging population, have already begun to affect the federal budget--in some cases sooner than previously estimated--and the pressures only grow in the coming decade. For example, Social Security cash surpluses have previously served to reduce the unified budget deficit; however, the Congressional Budget Office recently estimated that due to current economic conditions the program will run small temporary cash deficits for the next 4 years and then, similar to the Trustees' estimates, run persistent cash deficits beginning in 2016. The fluctuation and eventual disappearance of the Social Security cash surplus will put additional pressure on the rest of the federal budget."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I appreciate the opportunity to be here today to discuss our report on the  U.S. government\u2019s consolidated financial statements for fiscal years 2009  and 2008.

In addition, the federal government reported incurring  additional significant liabilities (e.g., liquidity guarantees to Fannie Mae  and Freddie Mac) and related net cost resulting from these actions.

Consequently, meaningful financial regulatory reform is of utmost  concern. In crafting and evaluating proposals for financial regulatory  reform, it will be important for Congress and others to be mindful of the  need to use a framework that facilitates a comprehensive assessment of  the relative strengths and weaknesses of each proposal. GAO has  previously set forth such a framework that involves nine key elements that  are critically important in establishing the most effective and efficient  financial regulatory system possible: (1) clearly defined regulatory goals;  (2) appropriately comprehensive; (3) systemwide focus; (4) flexible and  adaptive; (5) efficient and effective; (6) consistent consumer and investor  protection; (7) regulator provided with independence, prominence,  authority, and accountability; (8) consistent financial oversight; and (9)  minimal taxpayer exposure."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Near- and Long-Term Fiscal Challenges", "paragraphs": ["The economic downturn and the nature and magnitude of the actions  taken to stabilize the financial markets and to promote economic recovery  will continue to shape the federal government\u2019s near-term budget and debt  outlook. Actions taken to stabilize financial markets\u2014including aid to the  automotive industry\u2014increased borrowing and added to the federal debt.  The revenue decreases and spending increases enacted in the Recovery  Act also added to borrowing and debt. As shown in figure 1, the  President\u2019s budget projects debt held by the public growing from 53.0  percent of GDP in fiscal year 2009 to 63.6 percent by the end of fiscal year  2010 and 68.6 percent by the end of fiscal year 2011. While deficits are  projected to decrease as federal support for states and the financial sector  winds down and the economy recovers, the increased debt and related  interest costs will remain.", "Further, all of this takes place in the context of the current long-term fiscal  outlook. The federal government faced large and growing structural  deficits\u2014and hence rising debt\u2014before the instability in financial markets  and the economic downturn. While the drivers of the long-term fiscal  outlook have not changed, the sense of urgency has.

The  fluctuation and eventual disappearance of the Social Security cash surplus  will put additional pressure on the rest of the federal budget. With the  passage of time the window to address this challenge narrows.", "The federal government is on an unsustainable long-term fiscal path driven  on the spending side primarily by rising health care costs and known  demographic trends. The Statement of Social Insurance, for example,  shows that the present value of projected scheduled benefits exceed  earmarked revenues for social insurance programs (e.g., Social Security  and Medicare) by approximately $46 trillion over the 75-year period.  Since GAO\u2019s long-term fiscal simulations include projections of revenue  and expenditures for all federal programs, they present a comprehensive  analysis of the sustainability of the federal government\u2019s long-term fiscal  outlook. Figures 2, 3, and 4 show the results of our most recent long-term  fiscal simulations that were issued in March 2010.", "Absent a change in policy, federal debt held by the public as a share of  GDP could exceed the historical high reached in the aftermath of World  War II by 2020 (see fig. 2) \u201410 years sooner than our simulation showed  just 2 years ago. As a result, the administration and Congress will need to  apply the same level of intensity to the nation\u2019s long-term fiscal challenge  as they have to the recent economic and financial market issues. Although  the economy is still fragile, there is wide agreement on the need to begin  to change the long-term fiscal path as soon as possible without slowing the  recovery because the magnitude of the changes required grows with time.  Congress recently enacted a return to statutory PAYGO\u2014a budgetary  control requiring that the aggregate impact of increases in mandatory  spending or reductions in revenue generally be offset. Although this can  prevent further deterioration of the fiscal position, it does not deal with  the existing imbalance. In February, the President established a  commission to identify policies to change the fiscal path and stabilize the  debt-to-GDP ratio.", "One quantitative measure of the long-term fiscal challenge is called the  \u201cfiscal gap.\u201d The fiscal gap is the amount of spending reductions or tax  increases, over a certain time period such as 75 years, that would be  needed to keep debt as a share of GDP at or below today\u2019s ratio. Another  way to say this is that the fiscal gap is the amount of change needed to  prevent the kind of debt explosion implicit in figure 2. The fiscal gap can  be expressed as a share of the economy or in present value dollars.", "Under GAO\u2019s Alternative simulation, closing the fiscal gap would require  spending cuts or tax increases, or some combination of the two averaging  9.0 percent of the entire economy over the next 75 years, or about $76.4  trillion in present value terms. To put this in perspective, closing the gap  solely through revenue increases would require annual increases in federal  tax revenues of about 50 percent on average, or to do it solely through  spending reductions would require annual reductions in federal program  spending (i.e., in all spending except for interest on the debt held by the  public, which cannot be directly controlled) of about 34 percent on  average over the entire 75-year period.", "Policymakers could phase in policy changes so that tax increases or  spending cuts or both would grow over time allowing time for the  economy to recover and for people to adjust to the changes. However, the  longer action to deal with the long-term outlook is delayed, the greater the  risk that the eventual changes will be disruptive and destabilizing.", "Comprehensive long-term fiscal projections will be required in the federal  government\u2019s financial statements beginning in fiscal year 2010, under a  new accounting standard. Such reporting will include information about  the long-term fiscal condition of the federal government and annual  changes therein, and will expand upon the information currently provided  in the Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis section of the Financial  Report.", "It is not only the federal government that faces a long-term fiscal  challenge. Figure 4 shows the federal and combined federal, state, and  local surpluses and deficits as a share of GDP from our most recent  simulation results."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Closing Comments", "paragraphs": ["In closing, even though progress has been made in improving federal  financial management activities and practices, much work remains given  the federal government\u2019s near-and long-term fiscal challenges and the need  for Congress, the administration, and federal managers to have reliable,  useful, and timely financial and performance information to effectively  meet these challenges.", "The need for such information and transparency in financial reporting is  clearly evident. The recession and the federal government\u2019s  unprecedented actions intended to stabilize the financial markets and to  promote economic recovery have significantly affected the federal  government\u2019s financial condition, especially with regard to certain of its  investments and increases in its liabilities and net operating cost.  Importantly, while such increases are reported in the U.S. government\u2019s  consolidated financial statements for fiscal year 2009, the valuation of  certain assets and liabilities is based on assumptions and estimates that  are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty arising from the  uniqueness of certain transactions and the likelihood of future changes in  general economic, regulatory, and market conditions. Going forward, a  great amount of attention will need to be devoted to ensuring (1) that  sufficient internal controls and transparency are established and  maintained for all financial stabilization and economic recovery initiatives;  and (2) that all related financial transactions are reported on time,  accurately, and completely.", "Further, sound decisions on the current and future direction of all vital  federal government programs and policies are more difficult without  reliable, useful, and timely financial and performance information. In this  regard, for DOD, the challenges are many. We are encouraged by DOD\u2019s  efforts toward addressing its long-standing financial management  weaknesses and its efforts to achieve auditability. Consistent and diligent  top management oversight toward achieving financial management  capabilities, including audit readiness, will be needed. Moreover, the  civilian CFO Act agencies must continue to strive toward routinely  producing not only annual financial statements that can pass the scrutiny  of a financial audit, but also quarterly financial statements and other  meaningful financial and performance data to help guide decision makers  on a day-to-day basis. Federal entities need to improve the government\u2019s  financial management systems to achieve this goal.", "Moreover, of utmost concern are the federal government\u2019s long-term fiscal  challenges that result from large and growing structural deficits that are  driven on the spending side primarily by rising health care costs and  known demographic trends. This unsustainable path must be addressed  soon by policymakers.", "Finally, I want to emphasize the value of sustained congressional interest  in these issues, as demonstrated by this Subcommittee\u2019s leadership. It will  be key that, going forward, the appropriations, budget, authorizing, and  oversight committees hold the top leadership of federal entities  accountable for resolving the remaining problems and that they support  improvement efforts.", "Madam Chairwoman and Ranking Member Bilbray, this concludes my  prepared statement.
