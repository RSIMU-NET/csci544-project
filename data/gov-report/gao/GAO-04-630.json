The Financial Institutional Reform,  Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 sought to reform, recapitalize, and  consolidate the federal deposit insurance system. The act created the Bank  Insurance Fund and the Savings Association Insurance Fund, both of which  are responsible for protecting insured bank and thrift depositors,  respectively, from loss due to institutional failures. The act also created the  FSLIC Resolution Fund to complete the affairs of the former FSLIC and  liquidate the assets and liabilities transferred from the former Resolution  Trust Corporation. It also designated FDIC as the administrator of these  funds. As part of this function, FDIC has an examination and supervision  program to monitor the safety of deposits held in member institutions.", "FDIC insures deposits in excess of $3.3 trillion for about 9,200 institutions.  Together, the three funds have about $49.5 billion in assets. FDIC had a  budget of about $1.1 billion for calendar year 2003 to support its activities  in managing the three funds. For that year, it processed more than 2.6  million financial transactions.", "FDIC relies extensively on computerized systems to support its financial  operations and store the sensitive information it collects. Its local and wide  area networks interconnect these systems. To support its financial  management functions, it relies on several financial systems to process and  track financial transactions that include premiums paid by its member  institutions and disbursements made to support operations. In addition,  FDIC uses other systems that maintain personnel information for its  employees, examination data for financial institutions, and legal  information on closed institutions. At the time of our review, about 6,300  individuals were authorized to use FDIC\u2019s systems. FDIC\u2019s chief  information officer (CIO) is the corporation\u2019s key official for computer  security. The CIO is responsible for establishing, implementing, and  overseeing a corporatewide information security program.", "Information security is a critical consideration for any organization that  depends on information systems and networks to carry out its mission or  business. Without proper safeguards, there is enormous risk that  individuals and groups with malicious intent may intrude into inadequately  protected systems and use this access to obtain sensitive information,  commit fraud, disrupt operations, or launch attacks against other computer  systems and networks.", "We have reported information security as a governmentwide high-risk area  since February 1997. Our previous reports, and those of agency inspectors  general, describe persistent information security weaknesses that place a  variety of federal operations, including those at FDIC, at risk of disruption,  fraud, and inappropriate disclosure.", "Congress and the executive branch have taken actions to address the risks  associated with persistent information security weaknesses. In December  2002, the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), which is  intended to strengthen information security, was enacted as Title III of the  E-Government Act of 2002. In addition, the administration undertook  important actions to improve security, such as integrating information  security into the President\u2019s Management Agenda Scorecard.

Although FDIC has made significant progress in  correcting these weaknesses and has taken other steps to   improve security, our testing in our calendar year 2003 audit identified  additional control weaknesses. Specifically, FDIC had not adequately  limited the access granted to all authorized users or completely secured  access to its network. Further, FDIC had not yet completed a program to  fully monitor user activities for unusual or suspicious patterns that could  indicate unauthorized access. As a result, critical FDIC financial and  sensitive personnel and bank examination information was at risk of  unauthorized disclosure, disruption of operations, or loss of assets\u2014 possibly without detection.

Specifically, FDIC  reduced user access to sensitive program libraries and critical financial   strengthened security over certain network platforms,  expanded its application software change control procedures to include   developed and implemented disaster recovery plans for all its major  systems and incorporated unannounced testing procedures into its  service continuity process, and  enhanced system software change control processes.", "In addition to responding to previously identified weaknesses, FDIC  established several other computer controls to enhance its information  security. For example, it established procedures for securing new remote  access and private network services. In addition, it strengthened security  procedures over its system that handles large files submitted to FDIC by  banking institutions.

Organizations  can protect this critical information by granting employees the authority to  read or modify only those programs and data that they need to perform  their duties and by periodically reviewing access granted to ensure it is  appropriate. Effective access controls should be designed to restrict access  to computer programs and data and prevent and detect unauthorized  access. These controls include assigning user access rights and  permissions and ensuring that access remains appropriate on the basis of  job responsibilities.", "Although FDIC restricted access to certain data and programs on its  systems, we identified instances in which access to sensitive data and  programs had not been sufficiently restricted. For example:  Many users had unnecessary access to production systems that includes  financial and bank information. These users were inadvertently granted  access to the systems that could allow these users to gain access to  critical financial management information. This vulnerability was  further heightened because an undetermined number of the users were  system developers. These developers have detailed knowledge of the  systems\u2019 processing functions; knowledge that could allow them to  improperly add, alter, or delete critical financial and sensitive  information or programs\u2014possibly without detection.", "A large number of users had access that allowed them to read a  powerful user identification (ID) and password used to transfer data  among FDIC production computer systems. With this ID and password,  the users could gain unauthorized access to financial and sensitive  corporation information\u2014possibly without detection.", "FDIC did not adequately restrict users from viewing sensitive  information. For example, all network users had unrestricted read  access to sensitive bank information. Failure to adequately control  access to this type of information could result in users gaining  unauthorized access to privileged information.", "Although FDIC has initiated actions to correct these weaknesses, the  access vulnerabilities continue because the corporation has not yet fully  established a process for reviewing the appropriateness of individual  access privileges. Specifically, FDIC\u2019s process did not include a  comprehensive method for identifying and reviewing all access rights  granted to any one user. Such reviews would have allowed FDIC to identify  and correct inappropriate access.", "In response, FDIC said that it has since taken steps to restrict access to  critical financial data and programs and related sensitive information.  Further, the corporation stated that it enhanced its process for identifying  and reviewing user access granted and was establishing a policy that will  require quarterly reviews of users with broad access privileges."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Network Security Improved, but Some Weaknesses Continue", "paragraphs": ["Networks are a series of interconnected devices and software that allow  individuals to share data and computer programs. Because sensitive  programs and data are stored on and transmitted along networks,  effectively securing networks is essential for protecting computing  resources and data from unauthorized access, manipulation, and use.", "Organizations can secure their networks, in part, by limiting the services  that are available on the network and by installing and configuring network  devices that permit authorized network service requests and deny  unauthorized requests. Network devices include (1) firewalls designed to  prevent unauthorized access into the network, (2) routers that filter and  forward data along the network, (3) switches that filter and forward  information among parts of a network, and (4) servers that host  applications and data. Insecurely configured network services and devices  can make a system vulnerable to internal or external threats, such as  hackers, cyberterrorist groups, and denial-of-service attacks. Since  networks provide the entry point for access to electronic information  assets, failure to secure them increases the risk of the unauthorized use of  sensitive data and systems.", "FDIC continued to take steps to secure its network through enhancements  to its firewall and specific network platforms. Further, it established  processes to strengthen the security of its local area network and password  management. In addition, FDIC initiated a testing cycle to review the  effectiveness of information system controls for specific network  resources. Nonetheless, we identified weaknesses in the way that FDIC  managed network services, controlled network connectivity, and  maintained network software, as the following examples demonstrate.", "A network service was not configured to restrict access to sensitive  network resources. As a result, anyone\u2014including contractors\u2014with  access to the FDIC network could obtain copies or modify configuration  files containing control information such as access control lists.

With connectivity to these key resources, an unauthorized  user could attempt to exploit network vulnerabilities and gain control of  key segments of the network.", "Certain network connections to off-site locations were not adequately  controlled. These connections are essential to securing operations of  the network they serve. Ineffectively secured network connections  could expose the internal network to unauthorized access and make it  easier for this access to go undetected.", "Further, FDIC did not consistently secure its network against known  software vulnerabilities or minimize the operational impact of potential  failure in a critical network device. Failure to address known  vulnerabilities increases the risk of system compromise, such as  unauthorized access to and manipulation of sensitive system data,  disruption of services, and denial of service.", "In responding to our findings, FDIC\u2019s CIO said that the corporation had  taken steps to improve network security.

Such a program to monitor access would include routinely  reviewing user access activity and investigating failed attempts to access  sensitive data and resources, as well as unusual and suspicious patterns of  successful access to sensitive data and resources.", "To effectively monitor user access, it is critical that logs of user activity be  maintained for all critical processing activities. This includes collecting and  monitoring activities on all critical systems, including mainframes, network  servers, and routers. A comprehensive monitoring program should include  an intrusion-detection system (IDS) that monitors all key network  resources and automatically logs unusual activity, provides necessary  alerts, and terminates access. Further, to safeguard IDS operations and the  access information it collects, the duties and responsibilities of staff  assigned to the monitoring program should be adequately segregated.", "Although FDIC has made progress in developing systems to identify  unauthorized or suspicious access activities for both its mainframe and  network systems, its program as implemented does not fully monitor for  such activities. As a result, there are weaknesses in FDIC\u2019s monitoring  program that could result in significant breaches to its computer security  environment. For example, the network IDS did not monitor all network  traffic originating from certain locations. Further, certain network  resources were not configured to monitor network traffic, which lessens  the corporation\u2019s ability to identify anomalies. In addition, responsibilities  for operating the IDS were not appropriately segregated. For example, the  corporation assigned the responsibilities for design, implementation, and  maintenance to one individual. By assigning these functions to one person,  it did not adequately ensure a system of checks and balances. Thus, FDIC is  at risk that its program designed to monitor access activities for unusual or  suspicious activities could be altered to allow unauthorized system actions  that could go undetected.", "In response to our findings, FDIC\u2019s CIO said that the corporation had  developed and begun implementation of a monitoring strategy for  information technology security. This includes monitoring, event  correlations, and incident identification and response.

Our May 1998 study of security management best practices  determined that a comprehensive information security management  program is essential to ensuring that information system controls work  effectively on a continuing basis. The recently enacted FISMA, consistent  with our study, describes certain key elements of a comprehensive  information security management program. These elements include  a central security management structure to provide overall security  policy and guidance along with oversight to ensure compliance with  established policies and reviews of the effectiveness of the security  environment;  policies and procedures that (1) are based on risk assessments, (2) cost- effectively reduce risks, (3) ensure that information security is  addressed throughout the life cycle of each system, and (4) ensure  compliance with applicable requirements;   security awareness training to inform personnel, including contractors  and other users of information systems, about information security risks  and the responsibilities of these individuals in complying with agency  policies and procedures;  periodic assessments of the risk and magnitude of the harm that could  result from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption,  modification, or destruction of information and information systems;  and  periodic testing and evaluation of the effectiveness of information  security policies, procedures, and practices\u2014to be performed with a  frequency depending on risk, but no less than annually\u2014that include  testing of management, operational, and technical controls of major  information systems.", "During the past year, FDIC made substantial progress in establishing a  comprehensive computer security management program. As discussed  below, FDIC has (1) strengthened its central security management  structure, (2) updated its security policies and procedures, (3) enhanced its  security awareness training, and (4) developed a risk assessment program.", "Central security management structure. FDIC strengthened  accountability and authority for its previously established central  security management function by appointing a permanent CIO who  reports directly to the chairman. Further, FDIC realigned its security  management function so that it reports directly to the CIO. Also, FDIC  provided additional staff management resources to oversee its  certification and accreditation process, system test and evaluation  program, computer security incident response team activities, and  firewall administration.  Additionally, other staff resources were added  to maintain and enhance security policies and procedures and provide  oversight to the corporation\u2019s newly established risk assessment and  test and evaluation programs.", "Security policies and procedures. FDIC enhanced its overall security  policies covering network security, computer center access, mainframe  controls, and security management. For example, it developed new  policies covering controls for the use of wireless networks and  requirements for patch management. In addition, it developed network  security procedures to ensure compliance with policy on the use of  default vendor accounts, restrictions on network services, and  adherence to network password standards. Further, FDIC strengthened  its policies on requesting and granting access to its computer center and  provided updated requirements to address weaknesses in its  configuration management procedures for financial system changes.  Also, the corporation issued new policies on performing risk  assessments of its security program and information systems.", "Security awareness training. FDIC enhanced its current security  awareness program for employees and contractors. Specifically, it  updated the program to reflect FISMA security requirements, new  policies and procedures developed to mitigate newly identified security  risks, and discussions of internal threats. The corporation also  developed specialized security awareness training to address the needs  of selected technical staff and enhanced its reporting process to ensure  that all security awareness training is reported.", "Risk assessments. Recently, FDIC developed a framework for assessing  and managing risk on a continuing basis. This framework specifies (1)  how the assessments should be initiated and conducted, (2) who should  participate in the assessment, (3) how disagreements should be  resolved, (4) what approvals are needed, and (5) how these assessments  should be documented and maintained. At the completion of our audit,  the corporation had performed risk assessments on all of its major  systems.", "Although FDIC has made substantial progress in each of the elements  discussed above, it only recently established a program to test and evaluate  its computer control environment, but this program was incomplete. Test  and evaluation is a key element of an information security program that  includes ongoing reviews, tests, and evaluations of information security to  ensure that systems are in compliance with policies and procedures and to  identify and correct weaknesses that may occur. FDIC began implementing  this program during 2003. In October 2003, the corporation used a  contractor to (1) develop a self-assessment process that includes annual  general and application control reviews and (2) begin to perform ongoing  quarterly tests of its systems. Still, FDIC\u2019s test and evaluation program does  not address all key areas.  Specifically, the program does not include the  following provisions.", "All key computer resources supporting FDIC\u2019s financial systems are  routinely reviewed and tested, as appropriate.  FISMA requires  agencies to develop, document, and implement an agencywide  information security program that includes routine security reviews of  key computer resources supporting critical information systems, such  as those supporting the corporation\u2019s financial systems. These reviews  should include those managed by other agencies or contractors.  Although it initiated a program of tests and evaluations, this program did  not yet address all key computer resources. For example, FDIC relies  extensively on contractors to support its financial systems, and  accordingly, provides them with connections and access to its internal  network. Yet, during the past 2 years, the corporation has performed  only limited security reviews of these contractor connections\u2014a key  computer resource. Further, FDIC did not schedule a review of these  contractor connections in conjunction with its newly established self- assessment process. Without routine tests and evaluations of all key  computer resources, including contractor connections, the  corporation\u2019s financial or sensitive bank information is at risk of  unauthorized disclosure, disruption of operations, or loss of assets.", "Information security weaknesses detected are analyzed for systemic  solutions. To ensure that actions taken to correct identified security  weaknesses are effective, security management best practices prescribe  that procedures should include an assessment of systemic causes of  related security weaknesses. Although FDIC has been very proactive in  addressing the individual information security weaknesses identified, it  currently lacks an ongoing process to collectively analyze related  weaknesses for systemic problems that could adversely affect critical  financial and bank information systems. A comprehensive assessment  of related weaknesses, such as those related to user access privileges,  which is a recurring security weakness we have reported to FDIC, could  assist in identifying systemic causes of security weaknesses and result  in remediation efforts that could be more effective in addressing  security vulnerabilities. Further, such an assessment provides an  organization with a process of identifying emerging problems, assessing  the effectiveness of current policies and awareness efforts, and  determining the need for stepped-up education or new controls to  address problem areas.", "Corrective actions are independently tested. FISMA requires that  agencies establish a process to document and track remedial actions  taken to address security deficiencies in agency operations. This  process includes requirements for independent testing to ensure that  prescribed remediation actions are effective. Although FDIC has  established a system for documenting and tracking corrective actions, it  has not developed a specific process for independently testing or  reviewing the appropriateness of the corrective actions taken.", "Newly identified weaknesses or emerging security threats are  incorporated into the test and evaluation process. To ensure an  effective test and evaluation program, security management best  practices prescribe that the scope of information system control tests  include an evaluation of recently identified weaknesses and an  assessment of emerging security threats to the computer control  environment. FDIC\u2019s self-assessment process includes provisions for  updating its annual review of information system controls to evaluate  control weaknesses that were identified in prior audits. However, the  process does not specifically include provisions for weaknesses  reported in other audits or those identified internally in connection with  operational issues. Further, there are no procedures to ensure that  emerging security threats are considered for inclusion in the self- assessment reviews. For example, in our current review at FDIC, we  identified network security weaknesses that are linked to specific new  security threats that had not been addressed by FDIC. To perform a  comprehensive review of information system controls, it is critical that  all previously identified weaknesses and emerging security threats be  considered as part of the test and evaluation process to ensure that  these weaknesses have been corrected.", "Incorporating these key areas into its test and evaluation program should  allow FDIC to better identify and correct security problems, such as those  identified in our 2003 audit."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["FDIC has made significant progress in correcting the computer security  weaknesses we previously identified and has taken other steps to improve  security.
