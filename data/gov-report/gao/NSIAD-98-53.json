DOD assessed its intertheater requirements in the 1992 Mobility Requirements Study. This study was updated in 1995 based on the results of the 1993 Bottom-Up Review. According to Joint Staff officials, intratheater requirements were addressed in the July 1996 Intratheater Lift Analysis (ILA), which was DOD\u2019s first published intratheater lift requirements study since the 1988 Worldwide Intratheater Mobility Study. The ILA was sponsored by the Joint Staff, with representatives from the Office of the Secretary of Defense for Program Analysis and Evaluation, military services, U.S. Central Command, U.S. Forces Korea, U.S. Pacific Command, and U.S. Transportation Command.

The time-phased force deployment data process, which sets out the mode and timing of transportation of each unit, typically concentrates on the intertheater leg of the deployment. Intratheater lift requirements depend more on the combat situation and the theater concept of operations, which may not be known until the start of hostilities and are always subject to change. Intertheater lift transports troops, equipment, and supplies from U.S. airfields and seaports or prepositioned locations to the airfields and seaports in the theater of operations. The intratheater lift phase transports the troops and equipment from these airfields and seaports to the tactical assembly areas and foxholes in the theater.

Officials from the Joint Staff and the Office of the Secretary of Defense for Program Analysis and Evaluation said that the ILA is the official DOD study that the military services should use in developing their procurement plans for intratheater lift assets. The Army plans to spend about $1.7 billion through fiscal year 2003 to implement the ILA\u2019s recommendations for tactical wheeled vehicles; if the airlift recommendations were implemented as well, another approximately $2.7 billion (fiscal year 1996 dollars) could be spent.", "According to Joint Staff officials, a new Mobility Requirements Study is expected to be completed in 1999.

Even with their additional requirement, the C-130 fleet still exceeds the number needed for intratheater lift. However, on the basis of analyses by the Air Force Studies and Analyses Agency, the ILA recommended using additional C-17s beyond the planned procurement of 120 (a squadron of 14, according to DOD officials) to augment the C-130s by providing outsize cargo capability. This recommendation has been supported by the Defense Science Board Task Force on Strategic Mobility (in a 1996 report) and by theater commanders. The Air Force analyses, however, do not support this recommendation because they only demonstrated that the C-17 could move cargo more quickly than the C-130 under certain circumstances. No intratheater requirement was established based on the C-17\u2019s contribution to meeting TACWAR timelines, and the relative cost-effectiveness of the two aircraft was not taken into account.", "The Air Force is not currently planning to acquire more than the planned 120 C-17s so that a squadron could be dedicated to an intratheater role.

RAND\u2019s National Defense Research Institute evaluated intratheater concepts of operations for the planned C-17 fleet of 120 aircraft. In a 1997 Documented Briefing,RAND identified the advantages of using the C-17 in an intratheater role and concluded that about one squadron of C-17s could be used effectively in each of the two theaters of operation. These C-17s would be part of the planned procurement of 120 aircraft and would be based in the theater, unavailable to fly intertheater missions. RAND acknowledged that deploying these C-17s as intratheater assets would slow the flow of intertheater cargo, but stated that this effect would be offset by the improved intratheater deliveries afforded by the C-17. DOD officials commented that, during the halting phase, a delay in the strategic airlift flow may not be acceptable. RAND also determined that fewer C-17s would need to be dedicated to the theater if some C-17s arriving in the theater were delayed to perform intratheater missions and then re-entered the intertheater airlift flow.

The analysis found that about 50 percent more cargo could be delivered with only two-thirds as many sorties. However, because the C-130 fleet was more than sufficient to deliver the ILA workload, the faster deliveries resulting from the addition of C-17s were not necessary to meet the TACWAR battle requirements.", "The ILA also stated that, on the basis of its capability to deliver bulk cargo,every additional C-17 could replace three C-130s.

In Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm, HNS included commercial cargo line haulers, fuel tankers, personnel transporters, and HETS. Of the 1,404 HETS used in the Persian Gulf conflict, 333 were provided by Saudi Arabia. DOD reported that support from host and other nations during the conflict was critical and that it gave the United States the flexibility to deploy substantial amounts of combat power early in the contingency\u2014when the risks were the greatest\u2014while reducing the amount of tactical wheeled vehicles that needed to be deployed from the United States.", "The 1995 Mobility Requirements Study Bottom-Up Review Update, based on the same TACWAR battle as the ILA, assumed that HNS in Southwest Asia and Korea would include commercial cargo line haulers, fuel tankers, and HETS. However, the potential HNS tactical wheeled vehicle contribution to intratheater lift was not modeled in the ILA. Thus, ILA assumptions are inconsistent with the assumptions made in the updated 1995 Mobility Requirements Study. According to the ILA, HNS was not modeled because of a lack of signed agreements with some of the host nations. In addition, theater commanders wanted the ILA to model a worst case scenario without any HNS offsetting U.S. force structure. The ILA, however, notes repeatedly that HNS has the potential to reduce some of the reported lift shortfalls in several categories of tactical wheeled vehicles. HNS would also limit the amount of equipment required to be moved into the theater. Because it did not reflect HNS, the ILA depicted the worst case scenario as the only scenario for intratheater lift.", "The theater commanders\u2019 operation plans portray HNS as very important, if not critical, to the successful outcome of wars in Southwest Asia and Korea. Even the lack of formal HNS agreements in Southwest Asia does not limit the operation plans\u2019 expectations of substantial HNS. The Southwest Asia operation plans assume that HNS will be available in either the amounts received during Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm or in amounts negotiated and approved bilaterally between the host nations and the United States. The plans note that outsourcing logistical requirements within the theater of operations may completely preclude the need to deploy some logistical assets or units from the United States. The operation plans for a war in Korea state that U.S. Pacific Command forces can expect to receive significant wartime HNS from the Republic of Korea. The United States negotiated a wartime HNS agreement with the Republic of Korea in 1991. Cargo transportation was one of the components of this agreement, which also included medical, bulk fuel transport, maintenance, engineering, and ammunition support.", "The key factors in making HNS successful are availability of the right numbers of assets when and where they would be needed and the commitment of host nation drivers and other equipment operators to perform their assigned missions. Members of the defense community, including the military services, theater commanders, the Joint Staff, and the Office of the Secretary of Defense, are debating the extent to which HNS should offset U.S. force requirements.

Although the C-5 and C-17 are intertheater lift assets, they can also be used for intratheater lift if warranted, assuming that airfields can accommodate them. However, the ILA did not model the potential contribution of the C-5 and considered the planned 120 C-17s as an offset to the C-130 fleet only in Southwest Asia. Use of the existing airlift fleet for intratheater missions as needed could increase flexibility and decrease the need to procure additional outsize airlift capability. Although the C-5 and C-17 are primarily intertheater airlifters, the ability to divert them for intratheater missions is recognized in Air Force operational documents.", "The Air Force has highlighted the C-17\u2019s ability to deliver outsize cargo to small, austere airfields as a key factor in its dual role as an intertheater and intratheater airlifter. Small, austere airfields usually have a short runway and are limited in one or a combination of the following factors: taxiway systems, ramp space, security, materiel handling equipment, aircraft servicing, navigation aids, weather observing sensors, and communications. If delivering outsize cargo to small, austere airfields is necessary, the C-17 would likely be needed. However, if the airfields could accommodate the C-5, it could accomplish the mission. For example, the C-5 can quickly facilitate unit relocations. A Patriot battalion requires only 9 C-5 sorties compared with 15 sorties for the C-17.", "Of the 67 airfields in the ILA, 46 have been surveyed by the Air Mobility Command and are listed in its Airfield Suitability and Restrictions Report. Analysis of the 46 airfields common to the ILA and the Airfield Suitability and Restrictions Report showed that 34 airfields, or 74 percent, are suitable for all types of airlifters, including the C-5. In Korea, the C-5 can use 70 percent of the airfields, and in Southwest Asia, the C-5 can use 77 percent of the airfields.

That study, issued in November 1996 (4 months after the ILA), found uncertainty among planners at the theater commands about the capability and availability of watercraft for intratheater operations. The Army has developed a long-range fleet management plan that includes an acquisition strategy to procure more watercraft, but the role and capability of watercraft to help meet intratheater requirements have not been addressed at the joint level.", "At the end of fiscal year 1997, the Army had 245 watercraft in its fleet, according to an Army official. Some of these watercraft, such as the Logistics Support Vessel and the Landing Craft, Utility-2000 (LCU-2000), provide intratheater movement of equipment, cargo, and combat vehicles and transport cargo from ship to shore. The Logistics Support Vessel can self-deploy anywhere in the world to provide intratheater transport of large quantities of cargo, tracked and wheeled vehicles, and equipment. These vessels provided intratheater transport during Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. The LCU-2000 can perform tactical resupply missions to remote or underdeveloped coastlines and inland waterways. During Operation Uphold Democracy in Haiti, this vessel transported about 38,548 tons of equipment and supplies to fishing villages that had small piers or ramps.", "Army watercraft employment is phased to meet the theater commanders\u2019 requirements to offload combat and support forces during major regional contingencies. During the first 3 weeks of a conflict, Army watercraft operations would focus on port operations and offloading combat and support equipment from prepositioned ships and large strategic sealift ships. After the first 3 weeks, watercraft would continue port operations and begin to transition to sustainment operations, which include establishing intracoastal main supply routes and transporting equipment and cargo to forward areas in the theater. During Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm, for example, watercraft delivered main battle tanks, ammunition, and other cargo to several locations on the Persian Gulf coast. Thus, although the port operations are the key mission for Army watercraft during the first part of a contingency, watercraft can contribute significantly to intratheater lift missions during later phases.", "In several cases, the ILA demonstrated how Army watercraft could be used to offset reliance on rail, tactical wheeled vehicles, and HNS by repositioning forces in the theater of operations and moving tanks prepositioned on land to tactical assembly areas.

A more flexible mobility study that reflected requirements with and without HNS would better assist decisionmakers in determining the effects of HNS on U.S. mobility requirements. U.S. Central Command officials agree, acknowledging that requirements stated with and without HNS would have added flexibility to the ILA.
