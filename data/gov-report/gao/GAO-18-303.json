In recent years, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)  has taken actions to help improve the effectiveness and efficiency of  grant-making across the federal government. Specifically, in 2011, OMB  created the Council on Financial Assistance Reform, an interagency  council charged with providing policy-level leadership for the grants  community and supporting reforms to improve the effectiveness and  efficiency of federal grants. Further, in December 2014, OMB\u2019s Uniform  Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements  for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance) became effective for new grant  awards after being adopted by federal grant-making agencies, including  Interior. The Uniform Guidance requires, among other things, that federal  agencies design and execute a merit review process for competitive grant  applications. A merit review process is characterized by the  establishment of criteria applied by the agency to evaluate the merit of  competitive grant applications and seeks to ensure that grant applications  are reviewed in a fair, competitive, and transparent manner. The Uniform  Guidance also requires certain monitoring activities for federal grants,  such as requiring grant recipients to submit financial and performance  reports.", "You asked us to review WSFR\u2019s management of its competitive grant  programs.

To determine the reliability of these data,  we interviewed agency officials and conducted electronic testing of the  data, and we determined the data were sufficiently reliable for our  purposes.", "To examine how WSFR awards competitive grants and how this  compares with relevant regulations, we reviewed agency regulations and  guidance along with the Uniform Guidance. We also reviewed award  documents for the fiscal year 2016 grant cycle for the competitive grant  programs we identified. These documents included the Notice of Funding  Opportunity (NOFO), which describes the funding opportunity to  applicants; documentation of the scoring of applications; and memos that  documented the results of the scoring process. We also reviewed eight  complete grant files for grants awarded in 2016. In addition to looking at  these fiscal year 2016 documents, we also examined memos that  documented the results of the award process for the grants awarded in  fiscal years 2012 through 2015.

We asked these officials about the role  they played in awarding and monitoring competitive grants. In addition,  we interviewed other officials at FWS and nongovernmental organizations  involved in awarding or monitoring competitive grants. We also  interviewed grant applicants, including state fish and wildlife agency  officials and nongovernmental organizations, to learn about their  experiences during the award and monitoring process for WSFR grants.

The award process generally  involves announcing the grant opportunities, reviewing applications, and  making award decisions. During the monitoring process, the agency  oversees the implementation of the grant project and periodically reviews  financial and performance reports from grant recipients. In our past  reports, we have found that it is important for federal agencies to employ  a fair and transparent process to make award selections for competitive  grant programs and to monitor federal grant funds to ensure that they are  used properly and effectively to achieve program goals.", "In general, WSFR awards two types of grants: formula and competitive  grants.", "Formula grants: WSFR awards these grants to recipients in amounts  based on required formulas. The two largest formula grant programs  WSFR manages are the Wildlife Restoration Program and Sport Fish  Restoration Program, which provided $699 million and $356 million,  respectively, in grants to states in fiscal year 2016. According to  WSFR documents and officials, these grants are often used by states  to help their fish and wildlife agencies restore, enhance, and manage  wildlife and sport fish resources and provide public access to those  resources. Each state\u2019s use of certain funds and each state\u2019s wildlife  and sport fish activities are to be audited every 5 years, and these  audits have generally been conducted by Interior\u2019s Office of Inspector  General (OIG). According to Interior OIG officials, these audits have  been conducted since 2002, and each state has been audited three  times over the past 15 years.", "Competitive grants: WSFR awards these grants to eligible  applicants for specific projects based on a competitive process in  which grant applications are scored against certain criteria.  Competitive grants comprise a much smaller portion of the grant  funding that WSFR awards; in fiscal year 2016, WSFR awarded about  $54 million in competitive grants. Competitive grants, unlike the  formula grants, are not required under their program-specific statutes  to be regularly audited. According to the Interior OIG and WSFR  officials, the OIG has conducted few audits of these programs.", "Funding for most of WSFR\u2019s grant programs comes from two sources: the  Wildlife Restoration Account and the Sport Fish Restoration and Boating  Trust Fund. These accounts are generally funded by industries paying  excise taxes and import duties on certain equipment and gear  manufactured for purchase by hunters, anglers, boaters, archers, and  recreational shooters, including pistols, bows and arrows, and fishing rods  and reels, among other items. Federal taxes on fuel for motorboats and  small engines are also a source of funding.", "In administering grant programs, WSFR adheres to federal laws and  regulations, as well as agency policies and guidance.", "Federal laws: The 1937 Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act  and the 1950 Dingell-Johnson Sport Fish Restoration Act established  the Wildlife Restoration Program and the Sport Fish Restoration  Program, respectively. The Pittman-Robertson and Dingell-Johnson  Acts have been amended to, among other things, establish additional  grant programs, many of which are competitive programs. For  example, the Clean Vessel Act of 1992 amended the Dingell-Johnson  Act and created the Clean Vessel Act Grant Program. In addition, in  1998, the Sportfishing and Boating Safety Act amended the Dingell- Johnson Act and established the Boating Infrastructure Grant  Program.", "Federal government-wide grant regulations: The Uniform  Guidance, issued by OMB and adopted by federal grant-making  agencies, includes requirements for several aspects of the federal  grants management process, including the award and monitoring  processes. For example, sections 327 and 328 lay out general  requirements for financial and performance reporting by grant  recipients.", "Agency regulations: Some of the WSFR grant programs have  specific regulations that, among other things, define eligible activities,  application procedures, and the conditions for using grant funding. For  example, the Boating Infrastructure Grant Program, the Clean Vessel  Act Grant Program, and the National Coastal Wetlands Conservation  Grant Program have program-specific regulations that govern aspects  of the grant process, such as the eligible uses of grant funding.", "Agency policies and guidance: WSFR also has agency guidance  found in the FWS Service Manual, along with other guidance on  grants.

For example, the  FWS Service Manual contains a chapter focused on the Multistate  Conservation Grant Program that reiterates or clarifies requirements,  including program-specific statutory requirements as well as those  found in the Uniform Guidance. In addition to the FWS Service  Manual, the FWS, and WSFR within it, is subject to grant  management guidance issued by the Department of the Interior. For  example, in December 2014, Interior\u2019s Office of Acquisition and  Property Management issued a memorandum that required (1)  maximum competition in grant awards through a fair and impartial  competitive process, and (2) a comprehensive, impartial, and  objective grant application review process based on criteria contained  in the grant award announcement."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "WSFR Program Awards and Monitors Five Competitive Grant Programs", "paragraphs": ["WSFR awards and monitors five competitive grant programs, according  to agency documents and officials we interviewed.

The seven  performance reports we reviewed for the Multistate Conservation Grant  Program followed this template and, as a result, all contained the  information required by the Uniform Guidance. We also found that Region  8 developed a suggested template for performance reports, but the  template did not explicitly ask for grant recipients to explain why the goals  of a grant had not been met. The lack of a clear performance report  template may have contributed to 2 of the 10 performance reports from  region 8 we reviewed not including clear explanations of why the goals of  the grant had not been met, as required by the Uniform Guidance.  According to WSFR officials, the agency is planning to develop a more  standardized reporting process for performance reports but the timeline  for completion of this has not been formally established and remains  uncertain.", "According to Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government,  management should design control activities to achieve objectives and  respond to risks. This includes designing mechanisms to help monitor  performance to ensure the objectives of the program are being  achieved. As noted previously, the Uniform Guidance specifies that  grant performance reports contain a comparison of actual  accomplishments to the goals of the project, and the reasons why the  goals were not met, as appropriate. The absence of a clear format for  these reports may have contributed to some reports not containing all the  information needed to comply with federal grant requirements. Without a  template or some other standardized method for performance reporting  across competitive grant programs, WSFR grant recipients may continue  to submit performance reports to WSFR that do not meet all of the  content requirements of the Uniform Guidance and do not convey all the  information needed for FWS to oversee its competitive grant programs."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["WSFR awards and monitors five competitive grant programs and, in  general, WSFR\u2019s process for awarding and monitoring these grants is  consistent with regulations for federal grants established in OMB\u2019s  Uniform Guidance.

In particular, we reviewed the 1937 Pittman-Robertson  Wildlife Restoration Act and the 1950 Dingell-Johnson Sportfish  Restoration Act and amendments to these laws, along with associated  regulations for these laws. We also reviewed OMB\u2019s Uniform  Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements  for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance) for federal grant awards. In  addition, we reviewed agency guidance and information on grant  programs; agency budget documents; and grant program descriptions in  the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance, a compilation of federal  assistance programs that includes grants. Based on our review of these  materials, we developed an initial list of grant programs that WSFR had a  role in managing, and we spoke with WSFR officials to gather information  on which competitive grant programs met the criteria of WSFR being  responsible for both awarding and monitoring grants. We corroborated  this list of grant programs with WSFR officials. We analyzed data on the  competitive grant programs we identified from Interior\u2019s Financial and  Business Management System for fiscal years 2012 through 2016, the  most recent five-year period for when the award process had been  completed. To determine the reliability of these data, we interviewed  agency officials and conducted electronic testing of the data, and we  determined the data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes.", "To examine the process WSFR uses to award competitive grants and the  extent to which this is consistent with relevant federal regulations, we  reviewed relevant agency regulations and guidance along with relevant  sections of the Uniform Guidance. To assess the extent to which the  award process is consistent with relevant regulations, we compared the  process WSFR uses to award grants with OMB\u2019s Uniform Guidance. In addition, we reviewed award documents for grants awarded in fiscal year  2016 for the competitive grant programs we identified. We selected fiscal  year 2016 because it was the most recently completed award cycle.  These documents included the Notice of Funding Opportunity, which  described the funding opportunity to applicants; documentation of the  scoring of applications; and memos that documented the results of the  scoring process. We also reviewed the entire grant files for eight grants  awarded in fiscal year 2016 to determine what documents were contained  in these files. In selecting this non-probability sample of files, we selected  at least one file for each of the grant programs we examined and at least  one file from each of the FWS regional offices that had a grant awarded in  fiscal year 2016. However, one of these files was misclassified under an  incorrect grant program, so we excluded it from our review. As a result,  we did not examine an entire file from the FWS Region 8 office. We  reviewed the award documents and files using a standard document  review tool to examine specific parts of these documents, such as the  descriptions of the process used to review and score applications. To  ensure that this review tool was filled out correctly, two GAO staff  members reviewed the documents: one filled out the data collection  instrument and the other verified this work. In addition to looking at award  documents for fiscal year 2016, we also examined memos that  documented the results of the grant scoring process for fiscal years 2012  through 2015 for the grant programs we identified. We reviewed the grant  scoring memos from fiscal years 2012 through 2016 grants cycles  because they comprise the most recent five-year period for when the  award process had been completed.", "To examine the process WSFR uses to monitor competitive grants and  the extent to which those processes are consistent with relevant federal  regulations, we reviewed relevant agency regulations and guidance along  with relevant sections of the Uniform Guidance. To assess the extent to  which the monitoring process is consistent with relevant regulations, we  compared the process WSFR uses to monitor grants with OMB\u2019s Uniform  Guidance. We used a standard document review tool to review financial  and performance reports for 32 of 129 grants that were awarded in fiscal  year 2015 to determine the extent to which these reports contained  information required by the Uniform Guidance. We selected fiscal year  2015 to ensure that enough time had elapsed under these grants for financial and performance reports to have been required and submitted.  In selecting this non-probability sample of files, we ensured that we had at  least one file for each of the grant programs and at least one file from  each of the eight FWS regional offices. For financial reports, we  determined whether reported financial information on the grant award and  matching funds aligned with the dollar amounts in their award letters,  whether the reports were submitted by their due dates, and whether they  were submitted on the correct form. For performance reports, we  determined whether they were submitted by their due dates and whether  they contained information on the grant project\u2019s goals, progress toward  those goals, and an explanation why the goals had not been met, if  applicable. The Uniform Guidance requires this information to be in  performance reports. The results from our analysis of these documents  are not generalizable to all monitoring documents for grants awarded in  fiscal year 2015, but allowed us to examine how WSFR monitored  selected grants.", "For all three objectives, we interviewed WSFR staff responsible for  managing WSFR grant programs. These included WSFR program  leaders at headquarters and WSFR staff in each of the eight FWS  regional offices that are responsible for the five competitive grant  programs we reviewed. We asked these officials about the role they  played in awarding and monitoring competitive grants. In addition, we  interviewed other FWS officials that were involved with managing grants  and officials from select third party organizations that played a role in  awarding grants, including the Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies  and the Sport Fishing and Boating Partnership Council. We also  interviewed grant applicants, including state fish and wildlife agency  officials and nongovernmental organizations to learn about their  experiences during the award and monitoring process for WSFR grants.  We selected applicants that had various experiences with the grant  programs in fiscal year 2016, including those that applied and did not  receive funding and those that applied and received funding. The results  of the interviews with grant applicants cannot be generalized to other  applicants, but were used to obtain perspectives on the grant award and  monitoring processes.", "We conducted this performance audit from March 2017 to February 2018  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
