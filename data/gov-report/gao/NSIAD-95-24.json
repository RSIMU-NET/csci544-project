However, ship activations were not as timely as planned\u2014only 25 percent of the activated ships met their assigned readiness goals. Although insufficient fiscal year 1990 maintenance funding has been cited as a major reason for many late activations, a Department of Transportation Inspector General report attributed ships\u2019 mechanical and crewing problems as the primary reasons the RRF ships were not able to meet specified activation times.", "Mechanical problems were attributed to (1) the poor condition of the ships when they were purchased for the RRF, (2) the age of the ships\u2019 equipment, (3) improper steps taken to deactivate the ships, (4) the ships\u2019 lack of use, (5) shipyard repairs and upgrades not being tested upon completion, and (6) uncorrected deficiencies identified during the periodic Coast Guard inspections and during specified fleet maintenance procedures.

For example, to reduce corrosion in boiler tubes\u2014a problem for steam-powered ships laid up in colder climates\u2014some boiler panels are now left uncovered, and fans and heaters are installed to improve the circulation of dehumidified air to prevent freezing. These new techniques, however, have raised the cost of standard maintenance procedures."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Ship Manager Controls Were Strengthened", "paragraphs": ["Some ship managers contributed to activation delays during the war because of their lack of capability. For example, two ship managers were unable to activate their ships due to their lack of knowledge. (These managers\u2019 contracts were subsequently canceled.) As a result of this and other contract management difficulties during the war, MarAd expanded and clarified ship managers\u2019 contractual responsibilities at an estimated annual cost increase of $18,000 per ship.

Up-to-date inventories of vital components and spare parts were also not available for the aging machinery on the RRF ships, which caused activation delays while some parts had to be manufactured and shipped to the activation sites.", "After the war, MarAd implemented automated systems for tracking maintenance, repairs, and spare parts inventories. A Maintenance and Repair Tracking System has been developed by MarAd officials and contractors, and all repair funding requests must now be supported by deficiencies recorded in this system. Contractors have also developed an automated system for maintaining spare parts records and are completing inventories of shipboard spares to update the system\u2019s records.

Although half the RRF ships were outported\u2014berthed at locations other than the three MarAd reserve fleet sites\u2014they were not necessarily located near a shipyard. During activation for the war, the number of ships requiring simultaneous activation in a given location sometimes exceeded the capacity of the local shipyards. As a result, queuing occurred, and some ship activations were delayed.", "When reassigning ships to a particular location, MarAd officials considered factors such as towing time; likely congestion in shipyards; and, for high-priority ships, transit times to likely seaports of embarkation. By fiscal year 1994, MarAd had reassigned most RRF ships accordingly. For example, 5- and 10-day ships have been better distributed according to shipyard facilities for activation, and the high-priority 4-day ships have been positioned closer to their ports of embarkation because they do not require shipyard services to be activated."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Key Personnel Are Being Assigned to Ships in Reduced Operating Status", "paragraphs": ["To address the problems of identifying crews and transporting them to the ships in a timely manner, MarAd placed the highest priority ships in reduced operating status (ROS) with permanent, nucleus crews onboard. These crews form the core of the required operating crew, which ensures that key personnel needed for swift activation are onboard ships. According to MarAd, about 50 percent of the senior engineers and 34 percent of the junior engineers required by the RRF are already serving onboard ROS ships.", "The current crew structure on a ROS ship consists of a Chief Engineer; 1st, 2nd, and 3rd assistant engineers; a qualified member of the Engineering Department; an electrician; a chief mate; a bosun; a steward/cook; and a steward/utility. The crew\u2019s familiarity with the ship\u2019s particular operating systems and characteristics can avoid costly and time-consuming activation delays. For example, during the war, one newly assigned crew could not keep the steam propulsion system operating shortly after the ship had been loaded and left the port. The ship had to be towed back to port, where shipyard personnel that assisted in the ship\u2019s activation restored the system within 30 minutes.

Military Sealift Command, American Bureau of Shipping, and MarAd officials agree that the improved readiness of RRF ships is largely due to the extensive repairs made during and after the war.", "Six of the 20 ships were activated without prior notice to test their readiness and therefore the tests were the most realistic tests of the RRF\u2019s ability to meet defense requirements. All six ships were activated on time or earlier than the time required, and the average cost to activate them was about $1 million less than during the war.

After the war, MarAd spent almost $5.6 million improving the ship\u2019s habitability and overhauling its steam engine and other major equipment. In 1993, the ship was activated without prior notice and, according to the after-action report, overall ship systems operated well during the activation and the sea trial.", "The Comet, a steam-powered ship built in 1958, was added to the RRF in 1985, and laid up until its wartime activation in August 1990. During this activation, the ship encountered numerous problems with its steam plant, ballast tank pumps and indicators, salt water service systems, electrical equipment, and service generator. During postwar deactivations, MarAd spent almost $5.6 million overhauling the ship. When the ship was activated without notice in 1993, no major deficiencies were reported during the activation or the sea trial.", "The remaining 14 ships we reviewed were activated on less demanding schedules for either sea trials or operations.

MarAd believes that these strategies should provide reasonable assurance that MarAd can activate RRF ships within required time frames.

MarAd cannot be certain that funding will be available in the future to continue all of its preferred maintenance strategies and has begun examining variations within its overall RRF maintenance program.

To make up this difference, only 11 of the designated 22 4-day ships currently have permanent, nucleus crews. Also, the number of planned maintenance test activations was reduced from 93 in accordance with mobility study standards to 32. MarAd officials concluded that reduced funding in fiscal year 1994 would not result in a great degradation of readiness.

For example, the introduction of automated boiler controls during the mid-1960s and diesel-powered ships during the 1970s reduced crew size. As a result, the number of shipboard jobs decreased. For example, in 1970, the 843 ships in the U.S.-registered, ocean-going fleet provided around 40,000 jobs. By 1993, the number of ships had declined to 350, and only about 9,300 jobs were available.
