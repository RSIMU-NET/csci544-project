At the end of fiscal year 2017, the fund's assets declined to $49.8 billion and unfunded liabilities rose to $62.2 billion. Based on Office of Personnel Management (OPM) projections requested by GAO, the fund is on track to be depleted in fiscal year 2030 if the United States Postal Service (USPS) continues to make no payments into the fund. Annual payments of $1 billion or $2 billion into the fund would extend the projected depletion date by 2 to 5 years (see figure). USPS has said that its required payments to the fund are unaffordable relative to its current financial situation and outlook. For the past 11 years USPS has incurred large operating losses that it expects will continue. Additionally, USPS has stated that its opportunities for revenue generation and cost-cutting are limited. USPS reported that it did not make required fund payments in 2017 in order to preserve liquidity and cover operational costs. If the fund becomes depleted, USPS would be required by law to make the payments necessary to cover its share of health benefits premiums for current postal retirees. Current law does not address what would happen if the fund becomes depleted and USPS does not make payments to cover those premiums. Depletion of the fund could affect postal retirees as well as USPS, customers, and other stakeholders, including the federal government. About 500,000 postal retirees receive health benefits and OPM expects that number to remain about the same through 2035.", "GAO identified three categories of policy approaches for postal retiree health benefits, based on legislative proposals and pertinent literature. First, some approaches, such as generally requiring eligible postal retirees to participate in Medicare, would shift costs to the federal government. Second, some approaches would reduce benefits or increase costs to postal retirees and/or employees. Third, some approaches would change how benefits are financed (see table). All of these approaches have different potential effects and would require congressional action. Thus, it is up to Congress to consider the merits of different approaches and determine the most appropriate action to take. It would be preferable to take action when careful consideration is possible, rather than wait until lack of adequate funding could disrupt postal retiree health benefits."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["Congress should consider passing legislation to put postal retiree health benefits on a more sustainable financial footing.

USPS is responsible for a specific percentage of  premiums, the federal government is responsible for paying a prorated  share, and retirees are responsible for the rest. The funding  requirements for these benefits changed in 2006. Before then, a \u201cpay-as- you-go\u201d system governed USPS\u2019s payments, which required USPS to pay  its share of premiums for current postal retirees. The 2006 Postal  Accountability and Enhancement Act (PAEA) required USPS to start fully  \u201cprefunding\u201d retiree health benefits. This meant that USPS was required  to make annual prefunding payments to a newly established fund to build  up funds to cover USPS\u2019s share of future postal retiree health benefit  costs. PAEA also established the RHB Fund as a new fund in the U.S.  Treasury for USPS to deposit money into, and specified that beginning in  fiscal year 2017, the fund would be used by OPM to pay USPS\u2019s share of  postal retiree premiums for health benefits.

These proposals  would establish a program within FEHBP for active postal employees and  postal retirees. Under these bills, Medicare-eligible postal retirees  enrolled in this program would generally also be required to be enrolled in  Medicare Parts A, B, and D. According to CBO analyses, the bills would  have resulted in USPS savings, in part because increased participation in  Medicare would shift primary responsibility for covering certain health  care services to Medicare for those who enroll. As we have previously  reported, the primary policy decision for Congress to make is whether to  increase postal retirees\u2019 use of Medicare.", "Supplemental federal appropriations: If the RHB Fund becomes depleted  and USPS does not fill the financial gap, supplemental federal  appropriations could be an alternative if Congress wants benefits to  continue at the same level.

The effects would  depend on the specific changes and whether they were made to apply to  current retirees, current employees, or future hires. Depending on the  extent of the changes, this approach would reduce USPS\u2019s liability for  postal retiree health benefits and thereby reduce its unfunded liability.", "Increase premium payments by postal retirees and/or postal employees:  As some companies and state governments have done, premium  payments for postal retiree health benefits by postal retirees and/or postal  employees could be increased. For example, as others have reported,  some companies and state governments have required retirees to pay  100 percent of the health insurance premium for their retiree health  benefits. Similarly, a larger share of retiree health premiums could be  borne by postal retirees or postal employees could be required to pay  for retiree health benefits before they retire. Such changes would require  changes to current law that allocates specific financial responsibility for  payments among USPS, the federal government, and retirees  participating in FEHBP, as active postal employees make no payment for  retiree health benefits under current law.", "The expenses of the RHB Fund could be decreased by these approaches  that shift costs to postal retirees, postal employees, or both. Depending  on how much of the costs are shifted, the additional costs could increase  the challenge for retirees to ensure their accumulated resources last  throughout retirement, or for postal employees to save for retirement.  Further, as we have reported, rising health care costs can increase the  overall amount individuals may need to save to ensure they have an  adequate income once they retire.", "Change the federal contribution to a fixed subsidy: As some companies  and state governments have done, postal retiree health benefits could be  shifted to a structure with a fixed amount subsidizing the benefit. This  amount could be adjusted over time; any adjustments might or might not  keep up with costs. Depending on the initial size of the fixed subsidy and  any adjustments over time, this approach could reduce the expenses of  the RHB Fund and USPS\u2019s required payments. RHB Fund expenses  could be reduced over time if the fixed subsidy increases less than postal  retiree health premiums. This approach would require changes to current  law and regulations that prescribe the federal government\u2019s financial  contribution to FEHBP. For example, CBO recently identified one option  to change FEHBP\u2019s statutory structure from a premium-sharing structure  that is required by law to fixed subsidies for health benefits. Under this  option, the fixed subsidies would grow at the rate of inflation rather than at  the average rate of growth for FEHBP premiums; CBO stated this change  would be expected to slow the growth of federal contributions to FEHBP.  A fixed subsidy for retiree health benefits could increase incentives for  retirees to make less costly decisions with respect to health care.  However, this approach could result in greater cost exposure for retirees,  who may face difficult decisions regarding their health care, particularly if  their financial resources are limited. As we have reported, individuals face  the risk that rising and unpredictable health care or long-term care costs  may lead them to draw down their retirement savings faster than  expected.", "Establish a non-federal voluntary employees\u2019 beneficiary association  (VEBA) for postal retiree health benefits: As some companies have done  to provide retiree health benefits separately from the employer, a VEBA  outside the federal government could be established to manage postal  retiree health benefits. This approach means that postal retiree health  benefits would be provided through the VEBA instead of through the  OPM-administered FEHBP. The non-federal VEBA would administer the  postal retiree health benefits program, including determining the specific  benefits that would be provided and the level of contributions from the  VEBA members\u2014who could include retirees and employees\u2014and the  investing of its assets. Such an approach would require determining the  VEBA\u2019s governance structure, funding sources, level of funding, type of  investments, and associated market risks. One issue could be  determining the source and level of initial funding for a new VEBA for  postal retiree health benefits, such as whether initial funding would come  from the RHB Fund, the Treasury, or both. Other issues could be what  funds would be provided to the VEBA going forward, including the  source(s) and level of funding, and what the benefit levels would be. If the  entire RHB Fund were transferred into a VEBA, the current level of  benefits would ultimately not be sustainable unless further funding is  provided from one or more sources, such as from USPS, retirees, active  employees, or the federal government.

As previously discussed in this report, state  governments either do not prefund their retiree health benefits or generally have a low level of prefunding. We have expressed concern  about a proposed 80 percent funding target for postal retiree health  benefits that would have the effect of carrying a permanent unfunded  liability equal to roughly 20 percent of USPS\u2019s liability, which could be a  significant amount. As we previously reported, an alternative could be to  build in a schedule to achieve 100 percent funding in a later time period  after the 80 percent level is achieved. Although USPS payments with an  80 percent funding target would reduce USPS\u2019s required payments, fully  funded benefits protect against an inability to make payments later, make  promised benefits less vulnerable to cuts, and protect USPS\u2019s long-term  viability. Further, reducing the funding target is unlikely to have any  effect as long as USPS continues to make no payments to the RHB Fund,  as discussed earlier.", "We continue to believe that as long as USPS is required by law to pay its  share of retiree health benefits premiums, it is important for USPS to  prefund its retiree health benefit liability to the maximum extent that its  finances permit. We recognize that multiple options exist to prefund  benefits and amortize unfunded liability and that no prefunding approach  will be viable unless USPS can make the payments and maintain liquidity.  As we have reported, making affordable prefunding payments would  protect the viability of USPS by not saddling it with bills later on, when  employees are already retired and no longer helping it to generate  revenue; making payments can also make the promised benefits more  secure. We also have reported that deferring payments can pass costs  from current to future postal ratepayers. To the extent prefunding is  postponed by using a lower funding target, larger payments will be required later, when they likely would be supported by lower levels of  profitable First-Class Mail volume.", "Outside investment: Proposed legislation would initially require 25 percent  of the RHB Fund to be invested in index funds modeled after those used  for federal Thrift Savings Plan investments. The objective of investing  RHB Fund assets outside of U.S. Treasury securities would be to seek a  greater rate of return on these assets in an attempt to reduce unfunded  liabilities and the amount of required prefunding payments. Such outside  investment would require legislation because current law limits RHB Fund  assets to U.S. Treasury securities that are backed by the full faith and  credit of the federal government. A higher rate of return on RHB Fund  assets could reduce long-term funding needs. However, there are other  considerations. For example, we have reported that if fund assets were  invested in non-Treasury securities, the fund may experience losses in a  market downturn and would thus have reduced assets available for health  care. Assuming there would be no explicit federal guarantee of the  value of the invested assets, we stated that USPS is not well positioned  to deal with a potentially significant decline in their value, given its  significant operating losses and continuing decline in mail volume. We  also reported that the impact of any asset losses could be magnified  because a market downturn that negatively affects asset value could be  associated with a more general economic downturn that negatively  affects USPS mail volume and revenues."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["About a half million postal retirees receive retiree health benefits. Postal  retirees have provided a vital service to the nation, and resolving a key  aspect of their future situation warrants congressional action. Failure to  address the poor financial outlook of the RHB Fund could pose serious  consequences for these retirees as well as USPS, postal customers, and  other stakeholders, including the federal government. It is reasonable to  believe that USPS will not be able to fill the financial gap once the RHB  fund is depleted\u2014a situation that could occur in as little as 12 years under  the status quo. There is no certainty on what actions should be taken to  address this problem. However, we have identified multiple approaches  that could be used, individually or in combination, that Congress could  consider to help address the financial shortfall in this area. All of these  approaches have different potential effects, and it is up to Congress to  consider the merits of the approaches and determine the most  appropriate action to take. It would be preferable to take action when  careful consideration is possible, rather than wait until lack of adequate  funding could disrupt postal retiree health benefits."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Matter for Congressional Consideration", "paragraphs": ["Congress should consider passing legislation to put postal retiree health  benefits on a more sustainable financial footing."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to OPM and USPS for their review and  comment. OPM provided technical comments, which we incorporated as  appropriate. USPS provided a written response, which is reproduced in  appendix II of this report.", "In its written response, USPS stated that it concurred with our matter for  congressional consideration that congressional action is necessary to  achieve a financially sustainable Postal Service Retiree Health Benefits  Fund (RHB Fund). However, USPS said our discussion of potential policy  approaches for postal retiree health benefits would benefit from additional  context and balance. USPS also put forth additional information for three  of the potential policy approaches highlighted in our report. Our report  presents a high-level overview of eight potential policy approaches. It was  not designed to be a comprehensive catalog of possible options with an  analysis of the various considerations relevant to each.", "With regard to the Medicare integration approach, USPS stated that  increased Medicare participation by postal retirees is not limited to the  \u201cfull Medicare integration option,\u201d as represented in our report and  identified variations of such an approach. USPS said readers would  benefit from a fuller picture of Medicare integration practices, stating that  among employers that continue to provide retiree health benefits, full  Medicare integration is a uniform best practice. USPS cited a 2014 report  that said Medicare integration is the most common arrangement for  employer-provided retiree health benefits, adding that retiree health  benefits for Medicare-eligible employees are assumed to be merely  supplemental to Medicare as a matter of course. Our report discussed  Medicare integration by state governments, but did not present recent  data on the percentage of private companies that coordinate their retiree  health benefits with Medicare because such data are not publicly  available. Additionally, USPS said our report framed the issue of  Medicare integration as \u201csolely\u201d a tradeoff between USPS and Medicare  costs while there are other factors to consider, such as the relative  benefits to USPS compared to the overall cost for the Medicare program.  As we noted in our report, the eight potential policy approaches were not  designed to be mutually exclusive, nor an exhaustive list of possible  approaches. Additionally, we recognize there are various factors related  to this approach, but that the primary one is whether to increase postal  retirees\u2019 use of Medicare which would lead to further increasing Medicare  costs.", "Second, USPS said it believed our statements about approaches for  changing the level of prefunding for retiree health benefits below the 100  percent level were misplaced, citing \u201cuniversally accepted practices\u201d for  other entities to \u201cpay-as-you-go\u201d (i.e., not prefund at all), or to prefund at  much lower levels. We have reported on such funding levels in the past  as well. However, a proposed 80 percent funding target for postal  retiree health benefits would have the effect of carrying a permanent  unfunded liability equal to roughly 20 percent of USPS\u2019s liability, which could be a significant amount. As we previously reported, an alternative  could be to build in a schedule to achieve 100 percent funding in a later  time period after the 80 percent level is achieved. As our report also  explained, although USPS payments with an 80 percent funding target  would reduce USPS\u2019s required payments, fully funded benefits protect  against an inability to make payments later, make promised benefits less  vulnerable to cuts, and protect USPS\u2019s long-term viability.", "Finally, USPS said that our statements about potential risks associated  with investment of assets outside the U.S. Treasury seem  disproportionate given USPS\u2019s view that diversification of assets set aside  for retiree health benefits is \u201cuniversally accepted\u201d as a best practice. We  recognize that a higher rate of return on RHB Fund assets could reduce  long-term funding needs for the RHB Fund. However, there are  considerations specific to USPS. For example, assuming there would be  no explicit federal guarantee of the value of the invested assets, we  stated that USPS is not well positioned to deal with a potentially  significant decline in their value, given its significant operating losses and  continuing decline in mail volume. We also noted that, as we have  previously reported, the impact of any asset losses could be magnified  because a market downturn that negatively affects asset value could be  associated with a more general economic downturn that also negatively  affects USPS mail volume and revenues.", "In summary, we believe our report presents a balanced description of a  wide range of possible policy options; it does not endorse or recommend  any particular option for Congress. As we concluded, all of these  approaches have different potential effects, and the information we  present, as well as the additional views presented by USPS, provide  critical information for congressional decision-makers to assess as they  consider the merits of the approaches and determine the most  appropriate action to take.", "As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.
