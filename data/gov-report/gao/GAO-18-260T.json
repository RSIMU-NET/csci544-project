The five VAMCs GAO selected for review collectively required review of 148 providers from October 2013 through March 2017 after concerns were raised about their clinical care. GAO found that these reviews were not always documented or conducted in a timely manner. GAO identified these providers by reviewing meeting minutes from the committee responsible for requiring these types of reviews at the respective VAMCs, and through interviews with VAMC officials. The selected VAMCs were unable to provide documentation of these reviews for almost half of the 148 providers. Additionally, the VAMCs did not start the reviews of 16 providers for 3 months to multiple years after the concerns were identified. GAO found that VHA policies do not require documentation of all types of clinical care reviews and do not establish timeliness requirements. GAO also found that the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) does not adequately oversee these reviews at VAMCs through its Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN), which are responsible for overseeing the VAMCs. Without documentation and timely reviews of providers' clinical care, VAMC officials may lack information needed to reasonably ensure that VA providers are competent to provide safe, high quality care to veterans and to make appropriate decisions about these providers' privileges.", "GAO also found that from October 2013 through March 2017, the five selected VAMCs did not report most of the providers who should have been reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) or state licensing boards (SLB) in accordance with VHA policy. The NPDB is an electronic repository for critical information about the professional conduct and competence of providers. GAO found that", "selected VAMCs did not report to the NPDB eight of nine providers who had adverse privileging actions taken against them or who resigned during an investigation related to professional competence or conduct, as required by VHA policy, and", "none of these nine providers had been reported to SLBs.", "GAO found that officials at the selected VAMCs misinterpreted or were not aware of VHA policies and guidance related to NPDB and SLB reporting processes resulting in providers not being reported. GAO also found that VHA and the VISNs do not conduct adequate oversight of NPDB and SLB reporting practices and cannot reasonably ensure appropriate reporting of providers. As a result, VHA's ability to provide safe, high quality care to veterans is hindered because other VAMCs, as well as non-VA health care entities, will be unaware of serious concerns raised about a provider's care. For example, GAO found that after one VAMC failed to report to the NPDB or SLBs a provider who resigned to avoid an adverse privileging action, a non-VA hospital in the same city took an adverse privileging action against that same provider for the same reason 2 years later."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss our recent report on provider  quality and safety concerns at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).  VA\u2019s Veterans Health Administration (VHA) operates one of the largest  health care systems in the nation, and nearly 40,000 providers hold  privileges at its 170 VA medical centers. Like other health care facilities,  VA medical centers are responsible for ensuring that their providers  deliver safe care to patients. As part of this responsibility, VA medical  centers are required to investigate and, if warranted, address any  concerns that may arise about the clinical care their providers deliver.  Concerns about a provider\u2019s clinical care can be raised for many reasons,  ranging from providers not adequately documenting information about a  patient\u2019s visit to practicing in a manner that is unsafe or inconsistent with  industry standards of care. If VA medical centers fail to properly review  and address concerns that have been raised about their providers, they  may be exposing veterans to unsafe care.", "Depending on the nature of the concern and the findings from their  review, VA medical center officials may take adverse privileging actions  against providers that either limit the care the providers are allowed to  deliver at the facility or prevent the providers from delivering care  altogether. VA medical center officials are required to report the providers  against whom they take adverse privileging actions to the National  Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB). The NPDB is used by other VA medical  centers, non-VA hospitals, and other health care entities to obtain  information on a provider\u2019s history of substandard care and misconduct.  VA medical center officials are also required to report providers to state  licensing boards when there are serious concerns about the providers\u2019  clinical care. State licensing boards can then investigate and determine if  the providers\u2019 conduct or ability to deliver care warrants action against the  providers\u2019 medical license.", "My testimony today summarizes the findings from the report, which  analyzed the implementation and oversight of VHA processes for  reviewing and reporting providers after quality and safety concerns have  been raised at selected VA medical centers. Accordingly, this testimony  addresses:  1.  VA medical centers\u2019 reviews of providers\u2019 clinical care after concerns  are raised and VHA\u2019s oversight of these reviews, and  2.  VA medical centers\u2019 reporting of providers to the NPDB and state  licensing boards and VHA\u2019s oversight of these processes.", "To conduct our work, we reviewed VHA policies and guidance related to  reviewing and reporting clinical care concerns about providers and  interviewed relevant VHA officials. We also visited a nongeneralizable  selection of five VA medical centers, selected based on the complexity of  the medical services they offer veterans and to achieve variation in  geography. At each VA medical center we reviewed documentation and  interviewed medical center staff to 1) identify providers whose clinical  care was reviewed after a concern was raised about that care and 2)  determine whether the VA medical center took an adverse privileging  action against any of these identified providers. In addition, we evaluated  the extent to which each medical center adhered to applicable VHA  policies from October 2013 through the time we completed our site visits  in March 2017. We also interviewed officials from the five Veterans  Integrated Service Networks (networks) that oversee the five selected  medical centers. We compared VHA and the networks\u2019 oversight of the  VA medical centers\u2019 reviewing and reporting of providers to VHA\u2019s related  policy requirements and to federal standards for internal control related to  monitoring. Further details on our scope and methodology are included  in our report. The work this statement is based on was performed in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Selected VA Medical Centers\u2019 Reviews of Providers\u2019 Clinical Care Were Not Always Documented or Timely", "paragraphs": ["We found that from October 2013 through March 2017, the five selected  VA medical centers required reviews of a total of 148 providers\u2019 clinical  care after concerns were raised about their care, but officials at these  medical centers could not provide documentation to show that almost half  of these reviews were conducted. We found that all five VA medical  centers lacked at least some documentation of the reviews they told us  they conducted, and in some cases, we found that the required reviews  were not conducted at all. Specifically, across the five VA medical  centers, we found the following:", "The medical centers lacked documentation showing that one type of  review\u2014focused professional practice evaluations (FPPE) for  cause\u2014had been conducted for 26 providers after concerns had been  raised about their care. FPPEs for cause are reviews of providers\u2019  care over a specified period of time, during which the provider  continues to see patients and has the opportunity to demonstrate  improvement. Documentation of these reviews is explicitly required  under VHA policy. Additionally, VA medical center officials confirmed  that FPPEs for cause that were required for another 21 providers  were never conducted.", "The medical centers lacked documentation showing that retrospective  reviews\u2014which assess the care previously delivered by a provider  during a specific period of time\u2014 had been conducted for 8 providers  after concerns had been raised about their clinical care.", "One medical center lacked documentation showing that reviews had  been conducted for another 12 providers after concerns had been  raised about their care. In the absence of any documentation, we  were unable to identify the types of reviews, if any, that were  conducted for these 12 providers.", "We also found that the five selected VA medical centers did not always  conduct reviews of providers\u2019 clinical care in a timely manner. Specifically,  of the 148 providers, the VA medical centers did not initiate reviews of 16  providers for 3 months, and in some cases, for multiple years, after  concerns had been raised about the providers\u2019 care. In a few of these  cases, additional concerns about the providers\u2019 clinical care were raised  before the reviews began.", "We found that two factors were largely responsible for the inadequate  documentation and untimely reviews of providers\u2019 clinical care we  identified at the selected VA medical centers.", "First, VHA policy does not require VA medical centers to document all types of reviews of providers\u2019 clinical care, including retrospective reviews, and VHA has not established a timeliness requirement for initiating reviews of providers\u2019 clinical care.", "Second, VHA\u2019s oversight of the reviews of providers\u2019 clinical care is  inadequate. Under VHA policy, networks are responsible for  overseeing the credentialing and privileging processes at their  respective VA medical centers. While reviews of providers\u2019 clinical  care after concerns are raised are a component of credentialing and  privileging, we found that none of the network officials we spoke with  described any routine oversight of such reviews. This may be in part  because the standardized tool that VHA requires the networks to use  during their routine audits does not direct network officials to ensure  that all reviews of providers\u2019 clinical care have been conducted and  documented. Further, some of the VISN officials we interviewed told  us they were not using the standardized audit tool as required.", "Without adequate documentation and timely completion of reviews of  providers\u2019 clinical care, VA medical center officials lack the information  they need to make decisions about providers\u2019 privileges, including  whether or not to take adverse privileging actions against providers.  Furthermore, because of its inadequate oversight, VHA lacks reasonable  assurance that VA medical center officials are reviewing all providers  about whom clinical care concerns have been raised and are taking  adverse privileging actions against the providers when appropriate. To  address these shortcomings, we recommended that VHA 1) require  documentation of all reviews of providers\u2019 clinical care after concerns  have been raised, 2) establish a timeliness requirement for initiating such  reviews, and 3) strengthen its oversight by requiring networks to oversee  VA medical centers to ensure that such reviews are documented and  initiated in a timely manner. VA concurred with these recommendations  and described plans for VHA to revise existing policy and update the  standardized audit tool used by the networks to include more  comprehensive oversight of VA medical centers\u2019 reviews of providers\u2019  clinical care after concerns have been raised."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Selected VA Medical Centers Did Not Report All Providers to the NPDB or to State Licensing Boards as Required", "paragraphs": ["We found that from October 2013 through March 2017, the five VA  medical centers we reviewed had only reported one of nine providers  required to be reported to the NPDB under VHA policy. These nine  providers either had adverse privileging actions taken against them or  resigned or retired while under investigation before an adverse privileging  action could be taken. None of these nine providers were reported to  state licensing boards as required by VHA policy.", "The VA medical centers documented that these nine providers had  significant clinical deficiencies that sometimes resulted in adverse  outcomes for veterans. For example, the documentation shows that one  provider\u2019s surgical incompetence resulted in numerous repeat surgeries  for veterans. Another provider\u2019s opportunity to improve through an FPPE  for cause had to be halted and the provider was removed from providing  care after only a week due to concerns that continuing the review would  potentially harm patients.", "In addition to these nine providers, one VA medical center terminated the  services of four contract providers based on deficiencies in the providers\u2019  clinical performance, but the facility did not follow any of the required  steps for reporting providers to the NPDB or relevant state licensing  boards. This is concerning, given that the VA medical center documented  that one of these providers was terminated for cause related to patient  abuse after only 2 weeks of work at the facility.", "Two of the five VA medical centers we reviewed each reported one  provider to the state licensing boards for failing to meet generally  accepted standards of clinical practice to the point that it raised concerns  for the safety of veterans. However, we found that the medical centers\u2019  reporting to the state licensing board took over 500 days to complete in  both cases, which was significantly longer than the 100 days suggested in  VHA policy.", "Across the five VA medical centers, we found that providers were not  reported to the NPDB and state licensing boards as required for two  reasons.", "First, VA medical center officials were generally not familiar with or  misinterpreted VHA policies related to NPDB and state licensing board  reporting. For example, at one VA medical center, we found that  officials failed to report six providers to the NPDB because they were  unaware that they had been delegated responsibility for NPDB  reporting. Officials at two other VA medical centers incorrectly told us  that VHA cannot report contract providers to the NDPB. At another VA  medical facility, officials did not report a provider to the NPDB or to any  of the state licensing boards where the provider held a medical license  because medical center officials learned that one state licensing board  had already found out about the issue independently. Therefore, VA  officials did not believe that they needed to report the provider. This  misinterpretation of VHA policy meant that the NPDB and the state  licensing boards in other states where the provider held licenses were  not alerted to concerns about the provider\u2019s clinical practice.", "Second, VHA policy does not require the networks to oversee whether VA medical centers are reporting providers to the NPDB or state licensing boards when warranted. We found, for example, that network officials were unaware of situations in which VA medical center officials failed to report providers to the NPDB. We concluded that VHA lacks reasonable assurance that all providers who should be reported to these entities are reported.", "VHA\u2019s failure to report providers to the NPDB and state licensing boards  as required facilitates providers who provide substandard care at one  facility obtaining privileges at another VA medical center or at hospitals  outside of VA\u2019s health care system. We found several cases of this  occurring among the providers who were not reported to the NPDB or  state licensing boards by the five VA medical centers we reviewed. For  example, we found that two of the four contract providers whose contracts  were terminated for clinical deficiencies remained eligible to provide care  to veterans outside of that VA medical center. At the time of our review,  one of these providers held privileges at another VA medical center, and  another participated in the network of providers that can provide care for  veterans in the community. We also found that a provider who was not  reported as required to the NPDB during the period we reviewed had their  privileges revoked 2 years later by a non-VA hospital in the same city for  the same reason the provider was under investigation at the VA medical  center. Officials at this VA medical center did not report this provider  following a settlement agreement under which the provider agreed to  resign. A committee within the VA medical center had recommended that  the provider\u2019s privileges be revoked prior to the agreement. There was no  documentation of the reasons why this provider was not reported to the  NPDB under VHA policy.", "To improve VA medical centers\u2019 reporting of providers to the NPDB and  state licensing boards and VHA oversight of these processes, we  recommended that VHA require its networks to establish a process for   overseeing VA medical centers to ensure they are reporting to the NPDB  and to state licensing boards and to ensure that this reporting is timely.  VA concurred with this recommendation and told us that it plans to  include oversight of timely reporting to the NPDB and state licensing  boards as part of the standard audit tool used by the networks."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["If you or your staff members have any questions concerning this  testimony, please contact me at (202) 512-7114 (williamsonr@gao.gov).
