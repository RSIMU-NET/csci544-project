In fiscal years 2010\u20132016, FHA auctioned off approximately 111,000 loans to private purchasers under DASP. DASP helped reduce a backlog of federally insured defaulted loans stemming from the 2007\u20132011 financial crisis and was intended to protect the MMI Fund by paying insurance claims before the costly foreclosure process.", "GAO was asked to evaluate DASP. This report examines, among other things, certain DASP procedures, including verifying loan eligibility criteria, and documentation; FHA's evaluation of the identified outcomes of sold loans and how these compare with similar, unsold loans; and the potential effects that changes to DASP might have on the MMI Fund. GAO reviewed FHA policies, contracts, and reports, and interviewed FHA officials, selected servicers and purchasers based on sales participation, and other stakeholders. GAO also conducted a statistical analysis comparing outcome data for sold loans and similar loans that remained FHA-insured and analyzed the effect of loan pool characteristics on bidder participation."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) Federal Housing Administration (FHA) uses multiple entities to check loan eligibility for the Distressed Asset Stabilization Program (DASP)\u2014in which FHA accepts assignment of eligible, defaulted single-family loans from servicers in exchange for claim payments and sells the loans in competitive auctions. After servicers submit loans for sale, FHA and its contractors concurrently check loan data for completeness, validity, and eligibility. FHA relies on servicers to check eligibility a few weeks before and again after the bid date. The status of delinquent loans can be fluid, and a change in eligibility status close to this date may not be detected. GAO's analysis of fiscal year 2016 default data indicates about 2.67 percent of loans that FHA sold were ineligible based on length of delinquency or loss mitigation status. Without checking loan eligibility closer to bidding, FHA risks selling ineligible loans, and borrowers could lose access to benefits.", "FHA does not evaluate outcomes for sold loans against similar unsold loans. GAO found that, in aggregate, sold defaulted loans were more likely to experience foreclosure than comparable unsold defaulted loans (see figure). However, GAO's analysis identified varying outcomes by purchasers and sales. For example, some purchasers' loans had higher probabilities of avoiding foreclosure, with borrowers making regular payments again by 24 months after the transfer of loans. Also, loans sold in 2016 sales were less likely to experience foreclosure compared to unsold loans. HUD policy states that the agency's evaluations isolate program effects from other influences. Evaluating outcomes for sold loans against similar unsold loans could help FHA determine whether DASP is meeting its objective of maximizing recoveries to the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund (MMI Fund) and understand the extent to which DASP helps borrowers.", "Changing some of FHA's auction processes may help the MMI Fund. FHA could increase participation and MMI Fund recoveries in its auctions by communicating upcoming sales earlier. One purchaser said that additional notice would allow it time to plan for the capital needed to bid. Also, FHA set reserve prices (minimum acceptable price) based on the amount it expected to recover after loans completed foreclosure\u2014yet GAO estimates that some of these loans will avoid foreclosure (see figure). As a result, FHA risks recovering less for the MMI Fund in loan sales than if the loans had not been sold."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making nine recommendations to FHA, including establishing specific time frames to check loan eligibility, evaluating loan outcome data, and changing auction processes to help protect the MMI Fund.

The mortgage insurance allows FHA-approved private lenders to provide  qualified borrowers with mortgages and generally compensates them for  nearly all of the losses incurred on such loans. The Mutual Mortgage  Insurance Fund (MMI Fund), which covers almost all FHA single-family  mortgages, is statutorily required to maintain at least a 2 percent capital  ratio, defined as the economic value of the fund divided by the amortized  insurance-in-force.", "The housing crisis of 2007\u20132011 resulted in historic rates of mortgage  defaults and foreclosures. Since the beginning of the crisis, the federal  government has directly or indirectly supported more than two-thirds of  the value of new mortgage originations in the single-family housing  market. For example, many of these defaulted mortgages were insured  by FHA or securitized by the government-sponsored enterprises (the  enterprises) Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. FHA sold pools of defaulted  loans in auctions through the Distressed Asset Stabilization Program  (DASP). DASP is a program in which FHA accepts assignment of  eligible, defaulted single-family mortgage loans in exchange for claim  payments to servicers\u2014which cover the unpaid mortgage balance and  associated costs\u2014and terminates FHA insurance. FHA then sells the  loans in competitive auctions to qualified purchasers. DASP has helped to  reduce FHA\u2019s backlog of defaulted loans and was intended to help  maximize recoveries to the MMI Fund by avoiding the costly foreclosure  process. According to a HUD Office of Inspector General (OIG) report,  from 2010 through 2016 FHA used DASP to sell approximately 111,000  defaulted mortgage loans with an unpaid principal balance of about $19  billion. Insurance claims for sales from 2013 through 2016 accounted for  about 20 percent of FHA claims to lenders over the period.", "You asked us to review DASP. This report examines (1) the changes  FHA has made to the program over time; (2) certain DASP procedures,  including those associated with loan eligibility, and documentation; (3)  FHA\u2019s evaluation of the identified outcomes for loans that have been sold  through DASP and how these compare with similar, unsold loans; and (4)  the potential effects that changes to DASP might have on the MMI Fund.", "To address all of the objectives, we reviewed relevant laws, FHA policies,  contracts, and agency reports. We interviewed officials of FHA and its  contractors, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), and the  enterprises, as well as representatives of companies that service or  purchase mortgages and other industry stakeholders. To address the first  objective, we examined Participating Servicer Agreements (servicer  agreements) and Conveyance, Assignment, and Assumption Agreements  (purchaser agreements) from 2010 through 2016\u2014the last year in which  a DASP sale was held; HUD\u2019s OIG Reports on DASP; and press releases  on HUD\u2019s website regarding changes to the program. We also  interviewed FHA staff and asked them to provide us with a list of changes  to the program from 2010 through 2016.", "To address the second objective, we reviewed agreements between FHA  and mortgage servicers and statements of work for FHA\u2019s contractors to  identify procedures in place to monitor loan eligibility. We analyzed the  default status data for loans sold in 2016 at the submission and bid dates  to determine whether loans had eligible status for sale. To assess the  reliability of the default status data, we performed electronic checks for  consistency and validity. We found the data to be sufficiently reliable for  determining default status and length of delinquency. Additionally, we interviewed FHA and contractor officials to discuss their procedures for  monitoring loan eligibility.", "To address the third objective, we used multiple FHA data sources to  match loans sold through DASP to similar, unsold loans and compare  outcomes across the groups. Specifically, we identified a comparison  group of unsold loans that closely resembled sold loans on characteristics  that could affect the likelihood of foreclosure. To compare outcomes, we  identified common categories of possible outcomes for sold and unsold  loans. Using postsale reports from purchasers for sold loans and default  status reports from servicers for unsold loans, we tracked the outcomes  at monthly intervals. To assess the reliability of loan and outcome status  data, we performed various electronic tests on the logic of the data. We  excluded a small percentage of loans with invalid data and found the  remaining data to be sufficiently reliable for matching sold loans to unsold  loans and comparing outcomes. We also evaluated the loan modifications  offered by individual purchasers from the 2013\u20132016 DASP sales. We  obtained pre- and postmodification payment data from FHA and  calculated the change in borrowers\u2019 monthly mortgage payments. To  assess the reliability of the modification data, we checked for missing and  invalid data entries across different modification fields. We found the data  to be sufficiently reliable for the purpose of assessing the modifications.", "To address the fourth objective, we identified key characteristics that may  make loan pools attractive to certain purchasers from interviews with  industry stakeholders. We built regression models to determine the extent  to which loan pool characteristics were associated with bidder  participation for FHA loan sales and the enterprises\u2019 defaulted loan sales.  We obtained data from FHA and the enterprises on bids and the timing of  sales. We generated FHA pool characteristics from loan level data in the  Aggregate Loan Database (submitted loan database) and supplemented  them with FHA default status data. For the enterprises, we used pool  characteristics from a published FHFA report. This report provided a  range of characteristics to compare to those of FHA\u2019s pools. To assess  the reliability of the FHA data, we performed reasonableness checks,  which resulted in the removal of 4 percent of FHA\u2019s pools. We determined  that data for the remaining pools were sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of examining association with bidder participation. To calculate  pool reserve prices, we obtained FHA quarterly loss severity data by  disposition method for 2013\u20132016. Using our results from the outcomes  comparison analysis, we calculated pool-level reserve prices and  compared them to the winning pool-level bids.", "To assess the effect that changing FHA\u2019s auction design could have on  the MMI Fund, we reviewed economics literature on auction structures  and auction descriptions in business and commercial literature. We  developed a detailed description of FHA\u2019s current auction structure and  participants and assessed the benefits and drawbacks of various auction  design details. We interviewed DASP stakeholders about potential  changes to FHA auctions. We interviewed purchasers on their potential  interest in these changes and examined FHA sale data following an  instance of a single purchaser winning all the pools in a sale. In addition,  we compared FHA\u2019s DASP auction structure against key characteristics  of successful auctions that we identified in economics and business  literature.

Loan servicers\u2014which can  be large mortgage finance companies or commercial banks\u2014are  responsible for accepting payments from borrowers and managing  mortgages. FHA requires the servicers to provide monthly reports on  each loan with one or more missed payments through its Single Family  Default Monitoring System (default monitoring system). Before initiating  foreclosure actions, FHA requires servicers to contact the borrower,  collect information on the borrower\u2019s finances, and evaluate the borrower  using the following ordered steps, referred to as the waterfall of loss  mitigation priorities:  informal forbearance through an oral agreement allowing for reduced  or suspended payments for a period of 3 months or less;  formal forbearance with written repayment plans, which combine a  suspension or reduction in monthly mortgage payments with a  repayment period;  special forbearance of up to 12 months for borrowers who are  unemployed;", "FHA-Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP), which works to  get a borrower to return to making regular payments (reperforming);  FHA-HAMP offers qualified borrowers a loan modification that results  in an affordable monthly payment amount that does not exceed 40  percent of the borrower\u2019s gross monthly income by reamortizing the  debt for a new 30-year term at a fixed interest rate at or below the  market rate and, under certain circumstances, deferring the payment  of principal through the use of a partial claim; and non-retention disposition methods, including a preforeclosure sale  (also known as a short sale) in which the borrower sells a property  and the mortgage is satisfied for less than the amount that is owed, or  deed-in-lieu of foreclosure in which the borrower voluntarily transfers  a property to FHA to release all mortgage obligations; FHA may also  provide move-out incentive payments to borrowers for short sales and  deeds-in-lieu of foreclosure.", "To qualify for most of these actions, borrowers must be in default. A  servicer must evaluate a borrower for the loss mitigation options monthly,  but a borrower may not qualify for any option. However, a borrower\u2019s  circumstances are fluid and eligibility can change. For example,  borrowers who previously did not qualify for any loss mitigation options  could be eligible to be evaluated for loss mitigation options again after  starting a new job. FHA provides servicers with incentive payments of  varying size for taking certain loss mitigation actions.", "FHA generally requires servicers to either use a loss mitigation option for  which a borrower qualifies or initiate foreclosure within 6 months of the  default date, but a loan also may become eligible for disposition through a  DASP sale when loss mitigation has been exhausted and it meets other  eligibility criteria. FHA provides servicers with a list of loan eligibility  criteria in the servicer agreement for each sale. Servicers use the criteria  to identify which loans are eligible for a DASP sale. For example,  eligibility criteria include that a loan must be FHA-insured, have no more  than four dwelling units, and have an unpaid principal balance (amount  owed) greater than $20,000. Other criteria relate to length of delinquency,  loan-to-value (LTV) ratio, and the condition of the property. Loans that  qualify for loss mitigation or have a foreclosure date scheduled or  completed during the sale period are not eligible for DASP. Information  on changes to loan eligibility criteria throughout the history of the program  can be found later in this report.", "Each of the disposition methods FHA uses when loss mitigation on  defaulted loans is exhausted has different costs to FHA\u2019s MMI Fund (see  table 1). For the nonretention disposition methods of short sale, deed-in- lieu of foreclosure, third-party sale, or foreclosure\u2014which we refer to as  \u201cout of home\u201d methods\u2014FHA pays a claim to the servicer in the amount  of the unpaid mortgage balance and other expenses.

During this phase, FHA or its  contractor notifies interested servicers and communicates loan eligibility  criteria to servicers through the servicer agreement. Servicers that plan  to participate in the sale identify a list of eligible loans, certify the accuracy  and eligibility of the loans, and provide the list to FHA for review through  the Claim Submission Report. The servicer uploads information on the  loans submitted to FHA. FHA creates the submitted loan database, which  includes each accepted loan\u2019s current unpaid balance, payment history,  and an estimate of the underlying property value. According to FHA  staff, FHA reviews the eligible loans submitted by servicers and, with the  advice of its transaction specialist contractor, groups them into pools  based on geography and other factors. FHA sells loans in national pools  or Neighborhood Stabilization Outcome (NSO) pools, for which  purchasers must meet specific neighborhood stabilization outcomes for  50 percent or more of the properties in the pool.", "Next, an FHA contractor notifies prospective purchasers about the  upcoming sale via email, and notices are posted in the Federal Register,  industry publications, and newspapers. Purchasers can include private  equity firms, hedge funds, rental housing companies, and nonprofit  organizations. Prospective purchasers must submit to FHA a  Confidentiality Agreement and a Qualification Statement. FHA reviews  the documentation to determine whether the purchaser qualifies to  participate in the sale.", "Figure 4 depicts the due diligence and bid phase of a DASP sale. During  this phase, prospective purchasers receive access to the data room\u2014a  shared data website\u2014to review materials including the loan information  provided by servicers (due diligence materials); bid instructions; and sale  agreement that describes representations, warranties, and postsale  requirements, among other things. The servicer, FHA staff, and FHA  contractors continue to verify the eligibility of the loans. Prospective  purchasers place bids on each loan in a pool and deposit a percentage of  their total bid amount. FHA evaluates the bids and selects the highest  bidder for each pool based on the total of the loan-level bids. FHA then  notifies that bidder and provides an executed purchaser agreement that  describes postsale servicing and reporting requirements. Purchasers  must agree to follow the terms of the purchaser agreement including  avoiding finalizing foreclosures for 6 or 12 months (depending on whether  the sale occurred prior to July 2015), evaluating borrowers for loan  modification, and reporting outcomes to FHA.", "Figure 5 depicts the postsale phase. During the postsale phase, FHA  provides the list of sold loans to the servicer and winning purchaser,  which together determine servicing transfer dates. After bid day, servicers  verify that loans continue to meet eligibility criteria for the sale and begin  submitting insurance claims to FHA. Purchasers pay FHA for the loans  that are sold, and servicers transfer loan information and complete  mortgage files to the purchasers. When servicers submit claims to FHA  for sold loans, they must report the reason any loans are not transferred.  For example, a loan might not be transferred due to ongoing loss  mitigation activity or another reason, such as no longer meeting  delinquency eligibility criteria, and would remain with the servicer and  FHA insured. Following the final transfer of loan documentation, servicing  is transferred from the servicer to the purchaser. The servicer notifies the  borrowers of the transfer of servicing and termination of their FHA  mortgage insurance. Following the transfer, the purchaser sends the  borrowers a similar notice of transfer and any required disclosures.", "Following the final settlement date, the purchaser submits the first of 16  quarterly reports on the status of the sale portfolio using the format  provided in FHA\u2019s Post-Sale Reporting tool. If a purchaser demonstrates  a pattern of failing to report, FHA may disqualify the purchaser from future  sales. During the first 12 months of the reporting period, purchasers must  evaluate borrowers for a HAMP modification or a substantially similar  modification. Additionally, the purchaser must avoid foreclosure for 12  months unless the home is vacant or there are extenuating  circumstances.", "The purchaser agreement allows the purchaser 10 months starting with  the servicing transfer date to notify HUD of any alleged breach of FHA\u2019s  representations and warranties on purchased loans. For example, a  breach could be that a loan does not meet eligibility requirements, is not  covered by a valid hazard insurance policy, or has an outstanding  mechanic\u2019s lien. After notifying the original servicer and reviewing any  response, FHA determines whether there is a breach and the appropriate  remedy. The breach remedy can include a cure of the breach (such as by  the servicer paying an outstanding lien), reduction in claim payment, or  repurchase by the servicer. The servicer has 60 days to comply with the  remedy. If a breach results in the repurchase of the loan by the original  servicer, the purchaser will transfer servicing back to the original servicer."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Program Requirements and Processes for DASP Have Changed over Time", "paragraphs": ["FHA made changes to DASP by adding borrower protections and made  efforts to increase the participation of nonprofit organizations.

In particular, about 2.67 percent of these loans did not  meet eligibility criteria based on their default status on the bid date.  These loans were ineligible for varied reasons, including because they did  not meet FHA\u2019s length of delinquency requirement, were involved in  certain types of bankruptcy, or were undergoing loss mitigation and  therefore should have remained under FHA insurance protection.", "Ineligible loans may have been sold because the status of loans changed  after the servicer and FHA completed their eligibility checks.

FHA officials told us that FHA relies on the  servicers to perform eligibility checks a few weeks before bid day and  again after the sale when the servicer submits the claim. However, the  status of delinquent loans can be very fluid. According to our analysis of  FHA data, 23 percent of loans from 2010 to 2016 were removed between  the bid date and the claim date. FHA officials told us that servicers  remove loans after FHA\u2019s reviews to maintain compliance with  representations and warranties under the servicer agreement.

We found that  some changes in the eligibility of loans could be missed due to the length  of time between eligibility checks and data updates.

FHA requires servicers  to self-report the status of defaulted loans on a monthly basis to the  default monitoring system, usually within the first 5 days of the month, but  servicers may report changes throughout the month if a loan\u2019s status  changes. However, FHA officials told us that the system updates once a  month. FHA\u2019s eligibility checks may have occurred before the updates  were posted to the default monitoring system. FHA officials told us that  FHA relies on the controls in place and contractual agreements with the  servicers that require them to ensure that loans are eligible when  submitted to FHA for sale and when they file a claim with FHA. As a  result, FHA may not be aware of a change in loan eligibility that was  reported in the default monitoring system after its eligibility checks were  completed.", "Federal internal control standards require that management design  control activities to achieve objectives and respond to risks. Control  activities can be either preventive or detective. A preventive control  activity prevents an entity from failing to achieve an objective or address a  risk. Although FHA has implemented a number of controls to prevent  ineligible loans from being sold, these controls may miss loans that  change status after the eligibility check because FHA staff and  contractors do not have a designated time in the process to conduct the  eligibility check. Without spacing the timing of the various checks  throughout the process, including some checks that occur closer to the  bid date, FHA staff and contractors do not have the most reliable and  updated data from which to make decisions regarding loan eligibility, and  FHA could be selling some ineligible loans.

In contrast, FHA does not  hold regular sales or signal to the market when it will hold its next sale  through its outreach because DASP remains a pilot program. FHA  officials said they change program parameters with each sale, so it is  difficult to schedule sales in advance. We previously noted that, even  implementing DASP as a pilot program, FHA could use performance data  to establish criteria for the timing of sales and to help optimize the use of  the program to achieve its objectives. Similarly, by communicating long- range notice of upcoming sales to market participants, FHA could  encourage bidder participation and potentially help meet its objective of  maximizing recoveries to the MMI Fund.

A recent HUD OIG  report found that for loans sold in 2015 and 2016, FHA experienced a 3  percent lower loss rate compared with similar loans that were foreclosed  and the associated property placed into FHA\u2019s REO inventory. Loss  estimates have varied over time and by location of the property  associated with the loan, but generally an REO disposition results in the  greatest loss to the MMI Fund. For example, FHA\u2019s Office of Risk  estimated that from fiscal year 2013 through the first quarter of 2017, FHA  lost 61 percent (recovering about 39 percent) of the unpaid balance on  REO dispositions compared to about 46 percent (recovering 54 percent)  of the unpaid balance on other nonloan sale dispositions.", "FHA officials stated that unsold defaulted loans would likely result in  foreclosure and being placed in the REO inventory. However, our  analysis of outcomes showed that comparable unsold loans resulted in a  range of outcomes, not just foreclosure and REO disposition. Specifically,  our analysis of outcomes in sales between 2013 and 2016 showed that  about 66 percent of unsold loans with characteristics similar to sold loans  resulted in foreclosure or remained unresolved. The remaining 34  percent of these unsold loans resulted in a range of nonforeclosure  outcomes (including returning the loan to performing status), all of which  could produce smaller losses to the MMI Fund compared with REO  disposition. Further, our analysis found that about 14 percent of the loans  returned to performing status or were terminated as paid in full, thereby  generating very little to no loss to the MMI Fund.", "FHA may be setting its reserve prices too low in some cases. FHA sets a  loan\u2019s reserve price considering the percentage of the unpaid balance it  expects to recover through an REO disposition to guarantee the minimum  recovery proceeds to the MMI Fund. However, when the expected losses  to the MMI Fund for some loans are smaller\u2014such as in the case of a  different disposition method or a terminated loan\u2014the reserve price  would need to be higher to guarantee the minimum recovery proceeds to  the MMI Fund. If FHA could recover more of the unpaid loan balance  through a non-REO disposition method, setting the reserve price at the  expected recovery of the unpaid balance from an REO disposition would  be too low. See figure 13 for an illustrative example of how reserve prices  could be affected based on different expectations of loan dispositions.", "The extent to which the MMI Fund could be negatively affected depends  on how reserve prices compare to the actual winning bids. In figure 13,  if FHA set the reserve price of pool A at $3,900,000, FHA would sell the  pool to the highest bidder that bid at least $3,900,000. If the highest bid  was less than $3,900,000, FHA may not sell the pool. If the highest bid for  the pool was at least $3,900,000 but less than $5,054,000, the MMI Fund  would be negatively affected because FHA could have recovered more by  not selling the pool. If the highest bid was at least $5,054,000, the MMI  Fund may not be negatively affected by the sale. Using a simplified  method to calculate reserve prices that does not consider differences in  local housing markets, we estimate that 31 percent of the loan pools FHA  sold in its 2013\u20132016 sales had winning bids greater than FHA reserve  prices but less than our calculated reserve prices.

However, FHA is not considering information on  the range of potential outcomes for loans in setting its reserve pricing  because it expects all sold loans to result in foreclosure and REO  disposition.

FHA  has analyzed bid amounts from previous sales and made changes to  eligibility criteria related to length of delinquency and LTV ratio, in part,  intended to increase MMI Fund recoveries. For example, using analysis  of its 2014 sales, FHA determined the LTV ratios that produced the  highest loan-level recoveries relative to REO dispositions and changed  the loan eligibility criteria for the minimum LTV ratios by state for its 2015  sale. According to FHA, this change was intended to make more loans  eligible for disposition through DASP sales in certain states that had long  foreclosure processes.", "However, FHA does not analyze its portfolio of defaulted loans to identify  characteristics of loans that, if sold, would minimize the loss to the MMI  Fund relative to all other disposition methods to inform eligibility criteria  for sales. FHA may have missed an opportunity to evaluate when loan  sales would be the most effective disposition method to maximize  recoveries to the MMI Fund\u2014a financial objective of the program. FHA  contracted with CoreLogic in 2016 to develop a tool to determine the  lowest-cost disposition for defaulted loans in FHA\u2019s portfolio but did not  include loan sales as a potential disposition method. The tool is intended  to generate estimates of property values and holding costs and determine  the lowest cost disposition method for a given loan at a given time. Used  broadly, this information could help FHA identify loan criteria for which  DASP sales would be the most effective disposition method and set loan  eligibility criteria for DASP loans. However, FHA excluded DASP  because, according to the contractor, the data on DASP had been too  inconsistent to be reliably included in the CoreLogic tool. Therefore, FHA  cannot use the tool to identify loan characteristics for which DASP could  be the lowest-cost disposition method or to inform its decisions in setting  loan eligibility criteria.", "Further, FHA determines eligibility criteria before considering current  market information. FHA\u2019s transaction specialist gathers market  information before the sale, but FHA does not consider it before setting  eligibility criteria and soliciting eligible loans from servicers.

FHA generally analyzes how to maximize sales proceeds  after setting loan eligibility criteria and reviewing the servicers\u2019 submitted  loans because servicers select the loans, voluntarily participate, and may  not submit all eligible loans. Further, setting loan eligibility criteria that  increase servicers\u2019 cost to identify loans may reduce servicer  participation. In addition, FHA does not use current market information  because, according to officials, they use data from past sales to  determine market preferences and their primary concern is the effect on  the MMI Fund. However, FHA has not held a sale since 2016, so market  preferences may have changed. Additionally, purchaser participation may  decline if loans do not match their preferences. Generally, fewer bidders  indicate less interest in the pools and could result in decreased prices,  which would reduce returns to the MMI Fund.", "By implementing DASP, HUD intended to maximize recoveries to the  MMI Fund.

For example, an analysis by DebtX, a loan sale advisor,  showed that FHA would have earned higher proceeds in a prior DASP  sale if it had awarded based on single-loan bids rather than the pool-level  bids. However, our interviews with FHA officials and purchasers  revealed uncertainty in how proceeds from single-loan bids would  compare to bids for pooled loans. For example, FHA officials said they  benefit from economies of scale when offering larger pools and that  administrative costs associated with servicing transfers would be higher if  FHA sold loans individually. Furthermore, purchasers may decline to bid  on individual loans. Purchasers we interviewed expressed interest in sets  of loans rather than individual loans, in part to manage risk.

Such a structure could result in increased  bid amounts. In a winner-take-all option, each bidder would choose to  either participate at the sale level or pool level in the winner-take-all  option. In either case, the bidder would place loan-level bids that would  be rolled up to the pool or sale level. If a winner-take-all bid exceeds the  aggregate of the highest pool-level bid for each pool, all pools are  awarded to the winner-take-all bidder. By definition, if a winner-take-all  bidder won the auction, the resulting bid would increase FHA\u2019s overall  sale proceeds.", "However, a winner-take-all structure could discourage bidder  participation, which could lead to reduced bid amounts. Smaller entities  and larger nonwinning bidders may be less likely to participate in future  sales because of the costs associated with participating. According to  auction theory, the higher the cost of performing due diligence and  qualifying for and participating in the auction, the more bidder  participation will be discouraged. Although the extent of purchasers\u2019 due  diligence checks differed, all the purchasers we interviewed told us that  they expend funds to purchase property valuations on at least a sample  of loans to check whether the valuations listed in the servicer data were  reasonable. Some purchasers also expend funds to examine servicing  records or perform legal searches related to the loans. Additionally,  bidders are required to submit deposits with their bids that FHA will return  if the bidder is not awarded the pool or pools. One purchaser told us it  was reluctant to spend the money on due diligence if it did not have a  reasonable chance at winning the pool or pools.

FHA also stated that its management agrees to include a  schedule of eligibility checks in its procedures. We acknowledge that  servicers check loan eligibility throughout the process, as stated in the  report. However, we maintain that FHA and its contractors should also  space their own checks throughout the process, specifically scheduling  some closer to the bid date, and not rely exclusively on the servicers for  this function at the end of the sale process.", "FHA neither agreed nor disagreed with our recommendation that FHA  should clearly define DASP objectives and develop measurable targets  for all program objectives.

We attempted to minimize  differences between the sold and unsold loans by matching loans  across several variables that could affect the likelihood of foreclosure  or foreclosure avoidance. We found a high rate of similarity between  the two groups and indirectly controlled for any differences in the  extent of loss mitigation by including length of delinquency as one of  the matching variables. According to the FHA servicing handbook,  servicers are generally required to either use a loss mitigation option  for which a borrower qualifies or initiate foreclosure within 6 months of  the default date.", "In its technical comments, FHA also noted that our matching of  comparison loans omitted important variables. In particular, FHA  noted that the analysis did not hold constant several factors related to  the risk of foreclosure, including default risk as measured by FICO  scores, debt-to-income ratios, home price appreciation, and loan  amount and term. However, we indirectly controlled for loan term and  home prices by matching loans by origination years and indirectly  controlled for loan amount and home prices by matching on  categories of LTV ratios. We did not control for debt-to-income ratios  or FICO scores, but FHA\u2019s data systems did not contain them for  unsold loans and FHA does not include them as criteria for DASP  eligibility. Further, these variables may not be substantially different  between the sold and unsold loans because the loans in both groups  are severely delinquent. We revised the report to clarify that we  estimated the LTV ratio at the time of the DASP sale. We calculated  the LTV ratio using the outstanding loan amount and estimating  current property values by adjusting the original sale values for  regional changes in home prices over time.", "In addition, FHA stated in technical comments that our comparison  group is invalid because 100 percent of loans in DASP sales would  end in foreclosure if they were not included in a sale. FHA stated that  the only loans eligible for sale are those for which the only alternative  remaining to the borrower is foreclosure. However, we disagree that  all sold loans would have ended in foreclosure had they not been  sold. As discussed in the report, unsold loans with characteristics  similar to sold loans experience a range of outcomes, including up to  34 percent experiencing outcomes other than foreclosure following  sales. In addition, the status of delinquent loans can be very fluid  throughout the sale process, even after purchasers place bids on  them, and borrowers who previously did not qualify for a loss  mitigation option could become eligible to be evaluated again (and  their loan could become ineligible for sale) if their circumstances  change. For example, our analysis of FHA data found that from 2010  through 2016 about 23 percent of loans were removed from sales  between the bid and claims dates due to, among other things, loans  entering into loss mitigation. Furthermore, we found that for five  individual loan pools, more than half of the loans were removed from  the sales between the bid and claims dates. These results argue  against the validity of FHA\u2019s presumption that all loans selected for  sales would have ended in foreclosure.", "Although our matching process does not capture all potential foreclosure  risk characteristics and our results should be interpreted accordingly, our  analysis supports our assumption that the pools of sold and unsold loans  are generally comparable and describes relationships between DASP  participation and loan outcomes. We maintain that our approach is  reasonable using the available data and forms a sound basis for the  findings and recommendations in the report.

Our models assumed a directed graphical structure for how loans  could transition among events between observed follow-up times, as  described in figure 23. We developed our model of possible transitions  based on FHA\u2019s typical process for managing unsold delinquent loans  and DASP program rules for managing sold delinquent loans. To simplify  the model, we did not allow paths for transitions that were infrequently  observed, illogical, or inconsistent with prior knowledge about loan  management. These unusual transitions in the data may reflect  misclassified outcomes or transitions through unobserved outcomes  between observation times. Table 7 gives the sample counts of the  transitions in the matched sample of loan-month observations.", "The graphical version of our model implied a matrix of modeled  transitions among outcomes, with transition probabilities set to 0 for paths  between outcomes not shown in the graph. Specifically, we defined the  loan outcomes at time t, Y, as a stochastic process, taking values  according to an underlying model of transition probabilities from time 0 to  t:  where r and s denoted two outcomes from the set of outcomes above in  table 7, such as unresolved and reperforming. Consistent with existing  literature, we assumed that the outcome process was a time- homogenous Markov chain. This assumption made the model  mathematically tractable, but required the transition probability at any  follow-up time to be independent of prior outcomes and constant over the  observation period. (We estimated versions of the model that relaxed this  assumption, as described below.) Under this assumption, we modeled the  transition hazard rate from outcome r to s as:  where x and \u03b2rs were vectors of covariates and transition-specific  parameters (excluding an intercept) and qrs was an unspecified  proportional baseline hazard. All covariates were time-invariant  characteristics of the loans measured at baseline, 2 months prior to the  loan\u2019s bid date, used to create the matched sample. We estimated \u03b2rs  using maximum likelihood estimation methods, as implemented by the  \u201cmsm\u201d package in R 3.5.1.", "The body of this report provides estimated transition probabilities for  various groups of loans, including loans that were sold or unsold. We  estimated the probability of a loan\u2019s transitioning from unresolved at t = 0  to some other outcome at t using the estimated parameters and the  matrix exponential P(t) = exp(tQ), where P and Q are the matrices of  transition probabilities and hazards, respectively, for all outcomes r and  s. We used Monte Carlo simulation from the fitted multivariate normal  distribution of the parameters to estimate 95 percent confidence intervals  for the transition probabilities, using 1,000 draws. In appendix VI, we  provide more detailed estimates of these transition probabilities and their  confidence intervals for key findings discussed in the body of this report.", "Our models estimated the difference in transition probabilities between  sold and unsold loans in the matched sample by including an indicator for sold status in x. We estimated transition probabilities for certain  subpopulations of loans, like specific purchasers or loan sales, by  estimating separate models for each subpopulation. This approach  allowed the models to be fully stratified and reduced computational  burdens associated with estimating many parameters using a sample of 1  million or more observed transitions, as a fully interactive specification  between sold status and the subpopulation variables would have  required. However, this approach prevented us from estimating the partial  interactions between sold loan status and the subpopulation variables.", "We conducted several validation and robustness checks of the analyses  reported in the body of this report. These included the following:", "Predictive fit. We did not design our models to predict future  outcomes but rather to make inferences about the difference in  transition probabilities between sold and matched unsold loans.  However, to identify substantial problems with model fit, we compared  the observed prevalence of each outcome to the estimated  prevalence expected under our models. Figure 24 shows the  predictive fit for models with a covariate in x for sold status and a  piecewise-constant indicator for the period after month 12. The  estimated and observed prevalence are generally close for most  outcomes before month 40. After that month, the model  underestimates the prevalence of foreclosure and overestimates the  prevalence of unresolved. This lack of fit late in the observation period  may reflect the substantial effect of sales cohort, which we modeled  through separate models stratified by sale rather than as a covariate.  In any case, the model fit was acceptable, given our nonpredictive use  of the model and the limitations of using observed outcome  prevalence rates to validate predictions of a process with interval  censoring.", "Time-inhomogenous models. We relaxed our assumption that the  transition intensities were constant throughout the observation period  by including indicators in x for whether the observation fell before or  after 12 months. FHA changed DASP rules before the 2015 sales to  extend the moratorium on foreclosures from 6 months to 12 months.  Outcome transition estimates from a model including these time  indicators plus a sold indicator appear in table 8, along with our base  estimates from a time-homogenous model with only the sold indicator.  Although Akaike Information Criterion values showed that the  piecewise model improved the fit, the estimated transition probabilities  generally supported the same substantive conclusions. The piecewise  model estimated that sold loans were somewhat more likely to  transition to a short sale or deed-in-lieu outcome, and somewhat less  likely to transition to reperforming, but the direction of the association  was the same as in the time-homogenous model. We used the time- homogenous model to provide results in the body of this report and in  appendix VI, due to the considerable computing time required to  estimate models with piecewise-constant covariates."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix VI: Data for Selected Outcome Figures and Additional Outcome Estimates", "paragraphs": ["In this appendix, we provide data for selected borrower outcome figures  presented in this report.
