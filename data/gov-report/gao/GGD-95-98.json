Such statistics are part of the process by which government policies and laws are developed, implemented, and evaluated; and substantial components of the federal budget are adjusted to reflect changes in various economic statistics, such as measures of price changes. Business and individual decisions on spending and investment are influenced by economic statistics. Economic statistics also feed into academic and other research, which in turn often influences public policy debate and private sector decisionmaking.", "Experts in both the public and private sector, including many government agency officials responsible for producing economic statistics, have long-standing concerns about the accuracy and adequacy of these statistics. Among the most common concerns are that the statistics inadequately reflect the increased importance of international transactions to the U.S. economy, that they do not provide sufficient data to explain the productivity of the economy, and that they poorly measure investment and saving.", "In response to these concerns, in April 1989, the Chairperson of CEA chaired a working group, including both producers and users of economic statistics within the federal government, that was charged with assessing these concerns and proposing recommendations to address them. In January 1990 and February 1991, CEA issued the working group\u2019s two sets of recommendations for improvement. In releasing the recommendations, CEA noted that, although the recommendations addressed well-known problems with those statistics that most affected budget and monetary policymaking, the recommendations were limited to those that were most cost-effective and could be executed in the short term."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To accomplish our first objective of identifying the ESI recommendations and describing their impetus, we reviewed the two sets of ESI recommendations, hearing records, and pertinent literature on economic statistics and interviewed users and producers of economic statistics and economic statistics experts.

In some cases, this required our judgment that recommendations in the two sets of recommendations were sufficiently similar to be considered the same. Our combination of the ESI recommendations and the resulting listing of 38 recommendations are provided in appendix II.", "We interviewed agency program and budget officials and reviewed agency planning and budget documents that they provided to accomplish our other objectives to describe the agencies\u2019 plans, funding, actions to implement other improvements the agencies made to economic statistics, and fiscal year 1995 budget requests for additional economic statistical improvements. We did not assess whether the agencies\u2019 plans fully addressed all the elements of the ESI recommendations, nor did we independently verify the budget data or data provided by the agencies on the specific aspects of their actions. Because several agencies shared responsibility for implementing a number of recommendations (see app.", "II), our reporting that an agency had completed its planned work in response to an ESI recommendation does not necessarily mean that the recommendation is fully implemented. Also, the recommendations are not necessarily equal in terms of complexity and importance. Thus, an exact count of how many recommendations are completed or pending would not be meaningful and is not presented.

The working group that developed these recommendations included major federal producers and users of federal economic statistics and sought to address well-known problems in statistics that affected public policy. The most serious problem noted by the working group was in measuring output and quality improvements to goods and services in a rapidly changing economy. At the same time, the working group sought to focus the recommendations on areas that it considered feasible for short-term implementation. Because of budget and time constraints, the recommendations were not intended to be comprehensive.

For example, Census officials said that Census planned to increase coverage of the service sector by beginning a new annual survey of communication services; Census requested about $7 million and received more than $1 million for its plan to address this recommendation. For a few recommendations, the agencies did not make plans because the agencies said they were already carrying out efforts they believed satisfied the intent of the recommendations. For example, BLS officials told us that BLS did not make a plan specifically intended to respond to an ESI recommendation\u2014to reconcile and reduce discrepancies in estimates of employment from two different surveys\u2014because this effort was integral to its overall efforts to improve the two surveys. BLS received $35 million (71 percent of the funds appropriated for ESI) for one systemwide, two-price measurement, and four labor market statistics recommendations. (Apps.

For example, BLS officials said that partial funding limited actions on BLS\u2019 plan to improve coverage of service industries in price indexes. Agency officials said that a few actions they planned for the ESI recommendations were completed by May 1994. For example, Census officials said that Census completed its plan to undertake an annual investment survey. Agencies also reported no progress on a few of the plans. Officials of these agencies generally cited budgetary and other resource constraints as the reason for not taking or completing action. For example, Census officials told us that since they did not receive the $5 million they requested, they were not able to begin Census\u2019 plan to expand corporate financial data by collecting quarterly financial data for the service sector and by expanding coverage of small corporations. There were also instances where an agency completed its plan without receiving all the funding it requested. For example, Census officials said that they were able to complete the substance of Census\u2019 plans to increase coverage of the service sector, although it received $1 million of the $7 million it requested.

OMB officials said that the administration is committed to improving economic statistics and that the improvements proposed by BEA, Census, and BLS will result in overall improvements to their statistics. According to a BEA official, although there are further methodological improvements BEA can make, adequate funding will be required to fill gaps in source data. BLS officials said that additional resources are the number one requirement to improve BLS\u2019 statistics. According to the Commissioner, BLS needs to improve service sector data, provide more information on work practices, as well as be more user friendly in data collection and dissemination in the future.

BEA said that our report was a useful overview of progress under ESI. BEA noted that the report reinforces the conclusion of BEA\u2019s recent mid-decade review of its economic accounts, which was that, despite recent progress, much work remains toward improving the economic accounts and economic statistics in general. In addition, BEA said that it made progress in virtually all the methodological issues addressed in ESI but was unable to make progress in areas where improvements were dependent on the development of new surveys or the modifications of existing surveys to fill gaps in coverage, if those improvements and modifications were not funded. BEA indicated several places in the report where it believed this point needed to be clarified. We have made several revisions to the report to explain that BEA reported it made progress in improving methodologies but was unable to develop or revise surveys due to lack of funding.", "BLS, in its written comments, said that policymakers, other data users, and the statistical agencies themselves have identified many areas where improvements are needed in statistical programs. BLS also said that ESI had made significant progress in addressing some of these problem areas, given the resources made available to it. BLS said, however, that our draft report appeared to imply that the BLS initiatives as originally envisioned were nearly fully funded. According to BLS, constraints caused them to curtail planned improvements and thus BLS\u2019 subsequent budget requests were significantly lower than they would have been to fund the planned improvements. We have revised the report to explain that BLS received substantially less funding than it believed necessary to implement the ESI recommendations fully. Senior BLS officials also suggested technical corrections to the report that we have incorporated where appropriate. (See app. XII for comments from BLS.)", "NASS\u2019 written comments stated that NASS had benefited from ESI, particularly from the recommendation that supported NASS\u2019 efforts to improve the coverage of its list of farm and farm business operators. NASS noted, however, that although the coverage of the list had improved, complete coverage of the farm operator universe would not be achieved until NASS and Census undertook a mutually cooperative list building effort. According to NASS, current laws prevented it from receiving the mailing list used by Census for its Agricultural Census or the list of farms identified in the Census. NASS said that the Department of Agriculture strongly supported a draft legislative proposal to permit list sharing among federal statistical agencies for statistical purposes only. As we noted in the report, the development of data-sharing legislation was one of the ESI recommendations. OMB drafted a data-sharing proposal that was circulated among federal departments for comments; this proposal had not been introduced in Congress as of May 19, 1995. (See app. XIII for comments from NASS.)", "The Chief Statistician and a senior economist in OMB\u2019s Office of Statstical Policy said they generally agreed with the information as presented. However, they said that, in discussing funding for ESI, the report should have noted those instances where agencies reprogrammed funds in order to implement an initiative. We did not discuss reprogramming in the report because our objective was to track new funds specifically appropriated for economic statistics improvements. We did add a footnote to the letter explaining that agencies did reprogram funds to implement some initiatives that did not receive new funding. The officials also offered suggestions for several technical changes, which we have incorporated where appropriate.", "CEA provided oral comments on the draft report. A senior economist at CEA said that the report should have noted BEA\u2019s strategic review of the National Income and Product Account (NIPA), known as the mid-decade review. This review is intended to evaluate and to develop a plan to maintain and improve the performance of BEA\u2019s economic accounts. The official said that this review was a good example of an agency working with its data users to develop a framework for continuous efforts aimed at improving economic statistics. We acknowledge that this BEA effort is a significant data improvement initiative. However, we did not include it in our discussion of agency initiatives because it was released after we had completed our review of the ESI recommendations in May 1994.", "Officials at the Federal Reserve and NSF said that they had no substantive comments on the information presented in the draft report.

Even though the efforts consisted of two sets of recommendations and spanned multiple years, these efforts are referred to collectively as the Economics Statistics Initiative (ESI)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Experts Noted Problems With Federal Economic Statistics", "paragraphs": ["Many public and private sector experts have noted problems with federal economic statistics. Problems have been attributed to underfunding, changes in program philosophy, or poor management that occurred during the 1980s.

The budget cuts in the 1980s had the effect of curtailing government efforts to improve economic statistics when their role and importance were greater than ever.", "In a frequently cited assessment of the federal statistical system, the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) concluded that in 1988 the decentralized federal statistical system lacked a coherent strategy and leadership from OMB. As a result of these and other problems, key questions about the U.S. economy, such as how fast it grew or how its growth affected incomes and their distribution, were very difficult to answer.", "In the private sector, organizations representing individuals, businesses, and other organizations that rely upon federal statistics also have noted problems with economic statistics. The American Economic Association (AEA), the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), and the National Association of Business Economists (NABE) have sponsored studies that concluded that the federal statistical system critically needed improvement. The Chairperson of AEA\u2019s Committee on the Quality of Economic Statistics wrote in 1988 that federal statistics were not adequate to inform decisionmakers for understanding and choosing among policies and, without improvement, would become increasingly inadequate to meet future policy needs. He cited examples of problems such as decisionmakers\u2019 inability to understand factors affecting national productivity, outdated U.S. international statistics that may fail to reflect global economics, and serious deficiencies in savings and investment data. Similarly, NBER\u2019s 1989 Conference on Research on Income and Wealth focused on problems with economic statistics, particularly problems with measuring international transactions. Noting a decline in federal budget support for data collection and maintenance and a growing concern among professional economists about economic statistics, NBER authors concluded that international economic statistics were in need of critical assessment and, in some cases, significant overhaul. Finally, NABE\u2019s special committee on statistics raised similar concerns. The committee reported in 1988 and testified in congressional hearings in 1990 that the government was investing insufficient resources to improve and maintain the quality of economic statistics to enable policymakers to develop appropriate public policy based on accurate and timely economic statistics and for businesses to plan adequately for the future."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Bush Administration Assessed Problems in Federal Economic Statistics", "paragraphs": ["Responding to these concerns, President Bush, as a supplement to his first State of the Union message in February 1989, proposed an increase of $16 million in federal spending to improve the quality and accuracy of business and economic statistics.

This group, chaired by the CEA Chairperson Michael J. Boskin, included representatives of the major federal government producers and users of federal economic statistics.", "To accomplish its mission, the working group surveyed statistical agencies\u2019 existing plans and priorities; gathered suggestions for further improvements from the agencies and community of users in the administration, Congress, and private sector; and developed recommendations for improvements. These recommendations concentrated in three agencies\u2014BEA, BLS, and Census. The working group acknowledged that due to budget and time constraints, the multiyear recommendations were interim and not comprehensive. In addition, it noted that, while the recommendations addressed well-known problems in areas that affected public policy, it kept its recommended improvements to those that were most cost-effective and could be executed in the short term. For example, the recommendations did not address organizational issues or the long-run needs of the system.", "On January 25, 1990, CEA publicly released the working group\u2019s first set of recommendations.

This figure represented the amount of additional funding the agencies believed they would need to implement the recommendations.
