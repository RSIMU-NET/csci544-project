Such mail can be disposed of using incineration, landfills or through other methods. USPS recently committed to minimizing the agency's impact on every aspect of the environment. Recycling undeliverable advertising mail can help USPS achieve this commitment, while generating revenue and reducing its costs and financial pressures. In response to the 2006 Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act, this report addresses (1) recent mail-related recycling accomplishments (initiatives) undertaken by USPS, the mailing industry, and others and (2) additional recycling opportunities that USPS could choose to engage in, or influence mailers to undertake. To conduct this study, GAO analyzed relevant data and documents, visited USPS and other facilities, and interviewed about 40 stakeholders."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["USPS and the mailing industry have undertaken numerous initiatives to increase (1) the recycling of mail-related materials and (2) the amount of mail with environmentally preferable attributes, such as mail that uses recycled paper. USPS has five key recycling-related initiatives underway. For example, USPS recently established annual goals to increase its revenue from mail-related recycling from $7.5 million to $40 million from fiscal years 2007 to 2010. However, by excluding savings that result from lower waste disposal costs--which accompany increased recycling--the goals do not reflect the full financial benefit attributable to mail-related recycling. USPS also has launched a pilot recycling program in New York City, but it is not known whether USPS will require its managers elsewhere to adopt applicable \"lessons learned\" from the pilot. Representatives of the mailing industry and other stakeholders also have undertaken a wide range of initiatives to, among other actions, increase the amount of mail that is recycled. For example, three mailing industry associations recently introduced separate awareness campaigns to encourage mail recipients to recycle their catalogs, envelopes, and magazines. In addition, the Direct Marketing Association--whose members collectively send about 80 percent of all Standard Mail--is undertaking several initiatives, including an effort to encourage mailers to use environmentally preferable mail attributes. USPS, mailing industry, and other stakeholders GAO interviewed identified five opportunities that USPS could choose to undertake to increase its recycling of mail-related materials and to encourage mailers to increase the amount of mail with environmentally preferable attributes. The five opportunities stakeholders cited most frequently were for USPS to: (1) implement a program for recognizing mail-related recycling achievements; (2) increase awareness among mail recipients that mail is recyclable and encourage them to recycle their mail; (3) collaborate with parties interested in increasing the supply of paper fiber available for recycling; (4) establish a special, discounted postal rate--or \"Green Rate\"--as a means of inducing mailers to adopt environmentally preferable attributes; and, (5) initiate a \"mail take-back\" program in locations that do not have access to municipal paper recycling. Each of these opportunities appears to be consistent with the agency's long-standing commitment to environmental leadership and the Postmaster General's recent commitments to minimize the agency's impact on every aspect of the environment and to act as a positive environmental influence in U.S. communities. Based on GAO's analysis, however, USPS would need to assess several factors including cost, feasibility (including logistical considerations), and mission compatibility in deciding whether to adopt these opportunities. For example, depending on the magnitude of variance between the expected costs and revenues, USPS may find implementing one or more of the opportunities unacceptable. This is, in part, because USPS faces multiple short- and long-term pressures in improving its operational efficiency, increasing its revenues, and controlling its costs--some of which are increasing faster than the overall inflation rate."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["During fiscal year 2007, United States Postal Service (USPS) customers  sent approximately 104 billion pieces of mail (mailpieces) as Standard  Mail, the primary class of mail used for advertising. Over time, most of  these mailpieces were presumably discarded as waste. Depending on how  the discarded mailpieces are disposed of, they could be recycled, placed  into landfills, or incinerated. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency  reports that during 2006, Standard Mail comprised about 2.3 percent (5.9  million tons) of all municipal solid waste. Of this amount, recycling efforts  captured about 39 percent, while landfills or incinerators received the  remaining quantity. USPS discarded about 6.1 billion undeliverable-as- addressed (UAA) Standard Mail mailpieces (about 317,000 tons) in 2006,  while mailers discarded the remainder. With the exception of UAA  Standard Mail, the responsibility for recycling discarded mail primarily lies  with mail recipients.", "USPS, which receives only a small portion of its funding from federal  appropriations, is expected to generate sufficient annual revenue to cover  its costs. In fiscal year 2007, however, USPS\u2019 operating costs exceeded its  revenues by over $5 billion, largely due to the agency\u2019s advance payments  for retiree health benefits. Furthermore, USPS expects to incur substantial  additional costs that will need to be offset by revenue increases and  improved operating efficiencies. USPS has reported that mixed paper (i.e.,  UAA mailpieces, including newsprint, and mail discarded by recipients in  postal facility lobbies) account for up to 70 percent of its waste stream.  Recycling these materials provides USPS with a means to generate  substantial revenues, significantly reduce its waste disposal costs, and  improve its financial position. In addition, because recycling discarded  mail-related materials results in a variety of environmental benefits,  including reductions in the amount of mail incinerated or placed in  landfills, recycling these materials provides USPS with a means to  enhance its long-standing commitment to environmental leadership.", "During fiscal year 2007, revenue generated from Standard Mail comprised  about 28 percent ($20.8 billion) of USPS\u2019 total revenue, and Standard Mail  constituted the largest class of mail by volume (about 49 percent of 212  billion mailpieces). The prevalence of Standard Mail is expected to  increase, in part, because businesses, non-profit organizations, and others  view it as an effective way to (1) provide consumers with information  about their products and services and (2) solicit contributions from mail  recipients. Some critics, however, view Standard Mail as an annoyance  that also poses identify theft concerns and negatively impacts the  environment. In response, numerous state legislatures introduced \u201cDo Not  Mail\u201d bills that, if enacted, would require mailers to remove registered  individuals from their mailing lists (similar to the national \u201cDo Not Call\u201d  registry).", "In response to the 2006 Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act and  agreements reached with relevant congressional offices, this report  addresses (1) recent mail-related recycling accomplishments (initiatives)  undertaken by USPS, the mailing industry, and others and (2) additional  recycling opportunities that USPS could choose to engage in, or influence  mailers to undertake. Pursuant to our legislative mandate, we issued a  report on our interim results on December 20, 2007. This report updates  our interim report and describes in more detail the key recycling initiatives  that recently have been undertaken by USPS, the mailing industry, and  other stakeholders. These initiatives include efforts to recycle mail-related  materials, including UAA Standard Mail, and to increase the amount of  mail with environmentally preferable attributes. Mail with environmentally  preferable attributes includes mail that (1) contains paper with recycled  paper fiber (recycled paper); (2) uses paper from responsibly-managed  forests (certified paper); (3) is designed to use materials efficiently, (such  as \u201ctwo-way\u201d envelopes); (4) is accurately addressed for delivery; and (5)  is targeted to mail recipients who may wish to receive it. This report also  describes additional stakeholder-identified opportunities for USPS to  engage in (or influence mailers to undertake) mail-related recycling  initiatives, and identifies factors such as cost; feasibility, including  logistical considerations; and mission compatibility that USPS would need  to assess prior to adopting the opportunities.", "To accomplish our objectives we, among other activities, (1) interviewed a  wide range of USPS officials and stakeholders from about 40 other  organizations, including representatives from mailing, paper recycling, and  environmental advocacy organizations; (2) toured various facilities,  including USPS facilities in Baltimore and Philadelphia, a paper recycling  facility, and a printing facility; (3) attended meetings of the \u201cGreening the  Mail Task Force\u201d\u2014a committee of USPS, mailing industry, and other  stakeholders that addresses environmental issues regarding the mail; and  (4) reviewed and analyzed relevant documentation. We discussed matters  related to recycling several classes of mail with stakeholders; however, we  primarily focused on Standard Mail because of (1) its increasing  prominence in the mail stream; (2) its contribution to the municipal solid  waste stream; (3) USPS\u2019 responsibility for discarding large volumes of  UAA Standard Mail; and (4) the issues critics cite related to Standard Mail,  which are reflected in numerous \u201cDo Not Mail\u201d state legislative initiatives.  While there are a variety of ways to consider the environmental impacts of  mail, this report focuses on the role recycling plays in eliminating mail and  mail-related materials from municipal solid waste, increasing USPS\u2019  revenue, decreasing USPS\u2019 waste disposal costs, and enhancing USPS\u2019  commitment to environmental leadership. Appendix I provides a more  detailed explanation of our scope and methodology.", "We conducted this performance audit from April 2007 to June 2008 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those  standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient,  appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives.

USPS\u2019  authority was revised on December 20, 2006, with the enactment of the  Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act. Through this act, Congress  provided USPS with tools and mechanisms to help ensure that USPS is  efficient, flexible, and financially sound. The act also introduced a rate cap  for many postal services. While Congress oversees USPS and provides  direction to the agency on its operations and other matters, USPS receives  only a small portion of its funding from federal appropriations.", "According to a 2001 Mailing Industry Task Force study, the mailing  industry includes businesses, organizations, and other parties (mailers)  that send and rely on mail to maintain contact with their customers. The  mailing industry also encompasses mail preparers, including printers and  businesses that send or receive mail on behalf of a third party. Vendors  and suppliers of the hardware, software, and labor related to mail  processing, such as companies who help mailers improve the accuracy of  their mailing lists, also are included in the mailing industry, according to  this study.", "USPS offers several classes of mail, including First-Class, Standard, and  Periodical Mail. The price for each class of mail varies, as does the level of  service that USPS provides. Mailers, including both household and  business customers, use First-Class Mail when sending personal mail and  personalized business correspondence, such as letters, greeting cards,  bills, and account statements. Mailers also may use First-Class Mail to  send advertisements and merchandise. Standard Mail is the primary mail  class for advertisements sent in bulk quantities and cannot be used for  sending personal correspondence, such as handwritten letters, bills, or  account statements. Periodical Mail primarily is comprised of newspapers  and magazines. Standard Mail rates are generally lower than First-Class  Mail rates, in part, because USPS typically does not provide services such  as return-to-sender and forwarding for UAA Standard Mail.", "USPS and the mailing industry view Standard Mail as an important  advertising medium for businesses, non-profit organizations, and other  parties who seek to inform mail recipients about their products and  services or to solicit contributions. While USPS currently receives about  half of its revenue from First-Class Mail, Standard Mail became the largest  class of mail (by volume) in fiscal year 2005. During 2005, mailers spent  about $56.6 billion on direct mail advertising\u2014comprising about 21  percent of all U.S. expenditures for advertising. USPS expects the volume  of Standard Mail to continue to grow.", "UAA mail is mail that USPS cannot deliver to a specified address due to an  incomplete, illegible, or incorrect address or insufficient postage, among  other reasons. USPS\u2019 treatment of UAA mail depends on the mail class.  USPS forwards UAA First-Class Mail to the addressee, returns it to the  sender, or, if the return address is missing, sends it to a USPS Mail  Recovery Center. In general, USPS retains UAA Standard Mail and treats  it as waste. Because of the large volume of UAA Standard Mail that USPS  discards annually (about 317,000 tons in 2006), USPS focuses most of its  mail-related recycling efforts on this material. USPS also treats the mail  discarded by recipients in postal facility lobbies (discarded lobby mail) as  waste. While USPS does not know how much mail post office box holders  and other recipients discard in its lobbies, a USPS official stated that the  amount is \u201ctrivial\u201d relative to its total volume of mail-related waste.", "USPS has reported that mixed paper (i.e., UAA mailpieces, including  newsprint, and discarded lobby mail) accounts for up to 70 percent of its  waste stream. According to USPS, these materials can be used to make  everything from low-grade paper products, such as hand towels and tablet  backings, to wallboard and stock for fuel pellets that can be burned with  coal to reduce harmful air emissions. Furthermore, according to the  agency, the large volume of its UAA mail is an attractive and reliable  source of clean mixed paper needed for manufacturing these and other  products.", "A USPS-sponsored study reported that in fiscal year 2004, UAA mail cost  the agency more than $1.8 billion, which represented about 2.6 percent of  USPS\u2019 total expenses (approximately $69 billion). About two-thirds of  UAA mail costs resulted from forwarding mail to the intended recipients  ($422 million\u201423 percent) or returning it to the sender ($822 million\u201444  percent). The remaining one-third of UAA mail costs are the result of  processing waste ($270 million\u201415 percent), correcting addresses ($197  million\u201410 percent), processing address change requests ($132 million\u20147  percent), and general administration and support ($24 million\u20141 percent).  Furthermore, according to USPS, creating and sending mail that cannot be  delivered costs businesses more than $2 billion annually.", "With the exception of UAA Standard Mail, the responsibility for recycling  discarded mail primarily lies with mail recipients. While the majority of  mail is recyclable, according to the Environmental Protection Agency,  mail recipients and others recycled only about 39 percent of the Standard  Mail they received and subsequently discarded in 2006. Studies find that  the volume of products recycled depend on, among other matters, whether  a recipient knows that a product is recyclable and whether the recipient  has access to a recycling program or facility. According to one study, over  40 percent of the public are unaware that it can recycle mail. Numerous  stakeholders we interviewed confirmed this lack of recycling awareness.  Even if individuals are aware that mail is recyclable, according to a 2005  survey conducted by the American Forest and Paper Association,  residents in about 31 percent of U.S. communities (14 percent of the  population) do not have access to paper recycling programs. In addition,  while a 2006 survey by the Federal Trade Commission found that only a  small number of victims (2 percent) reported that the theft of their identify  was connected to the mail, several stakeholders told us that identity theft  concerns prevent some recipients from recycling their mail. In December  2006, we reported on efforts to increase the volume of materials recycled  and found that, to increase recycling, U.S. municipalities need to conduct  public education campaigns and ensure that access to recycling is both  convenient and easy. Further, we identified federal policy options that  would help municipalities increase the volume of materials recycled,  including the establishment of (1) a nationwide education campaign to  inform the public about recycling and (2) programs that enable consumers  to recycle products by returning them to the manufacturer or some other  party for recycling. These programs are known as \u201ctake-back\u201d programs.", "USPS and the mailing industry formed a Greening the Mail Task Force in  1996 to identify cost-effective ways to integrate environmental  considerations into mailing practices and business processes. The task  force issued a final report of its activities in 1999, including its efforts to  identify \u201cgreen\u201d mail attributes (environmentally preferable attributes).

For example, Address  Management\u2019s goal is to decrease the amount of UAA mail. To accomplish  this, the organization provides mailers with tools to better manage the  quality of their mailing lists while, according to USPS, striving to maximize  its ability to efficiently deliver mail as addressed. The Product  Development organization within Marketing helps manufacturers develop  mail-related products that contain recycled materials.

According to USPS, reaching its fiscal year  2010 goal could also reduce its solid waste disposal costs by $10 million  annually. Thus, in fiscal year 2010, USPS could realize a full financial  benefit of $50 million. To help reach its initial fiscal year 2008 goal,  according to USPS officials, each of the agency\u2019s nine geographic areas  developed a plan to generate $2 million from recycling in fiscal year 2008.  Longer term, according to these officials, the $40 million goal for fiscal  year 2010 is based on the expectation that each of its 82 districts will  generate an average of about $500,000 in recycling revenues.", "Such goals are a step in the right direction and address the need for USPS  to generate additional revenue, which is one of the agency\u2019s four strategic  goals. However, by excluding savings that result from lower waste  disposal costs, the goals do not reflect the full financial benefit attributable  to mail-related recycling. This is because when USPS facility managers  implement mail-related recycling programs, their facilities generate less  waste, thereby reducing the facilities\u2019 waste disposal costs (in addition to  generating recycling revenue). Revising the agency\u2019s goals to include the  savings from lower waste disposal costs or adopting additional goals to  reflect the full financial benefit of recycling would help focus USPS  employees on the need to achieve greater cost reductions\u2014consistent  with a second USPS strategic goal. According to USPS officials, USPS is  developing the capacity to track solid waste disposal volumes and intends  to develop a plan for achieving its recycling goals. However, at the  conclusion of our review, it had not agreed to revise its goals or to adopt  additional goals for measuring its savings from lower waste disposal costs  to reflect the full financial benefit attributable to mail-related recycling.", "Regardless of whether USPS finds it beneficial to revise its goals to reflect  the full financial benefit attributable to mail-related recycling, in order to  measure its progress, USPS will need to (1) specify how it will measure its  progress toward its goals and (2) ensure that its organizations collect and  report accurate, reliable, and consistent data, which, according to agency  officials, does not presently occur. For example, according to both USPS  officials and our analysis of USPS documentation some district facilities  combine recycling revenues with waste disposal costs. Additionally, our  analysis of USPS documentation indicates that in fiscal year 2006 at least  one large district facility combined recycling revenues with waste savings  attributable to recycling\u2014which, together, comprise the full financial  benefit of recycling. Inconsistent reporting practices hamper efforts to  accurately measure the agency\u2019s progress in meeting its recycling revenue  goals. To partially address this problem, in March 2008, the agency\u2019s  accounting organization sent an e-mail to USPS area managers requesting  that they report recycling revenues separately from waste disposal costs.  While this request addresses the need to report recycling revenue  separately, it does not constitute a requirement for the managers at the  area-, district-, or facility-level to do so. Furthermore, the e-mail does not  address matters related to the reporting of USPS\u2019 savings from lower  waste disposal costs, or require these managers to report data on their  savings using a consistent method. Finally, at the conclusion of our  review, USPS had neither (1) specified how it will measure progress  toward its goals nor (2) required its organizations to collect and report  accurate, reliable, and consistent data.

In December 2007, however, USPS announced  its intention to refocus its attention on environmental matters, including  the recycling of UAA mail and mail-related materials. According to USPS,  recycling will help protect the value of Standard Mail as a form of  advertising, generate additional revenues, and reduce USPS\u2019 waste  disposal costs. Recycling UAA mail and other mail-related materials also  provides USPS with a means to enhance its long-standing commitment to  environmental leadership.

To help USPS accomplish  these objectives, the 1995 policy required facility managers to (1) keep  records of revenues generated by recycling, as well as the costs and  quantities of solid waste generated at their facilities; (2) conduct an annual  evaluation of their practices related to discarded mixed paper, disposal  methods, and recycling alternatives; and (3) supply information on their  annual evaluations, including the costs, volumes, disposal methods,  recycling alternatives, and barriers associated with implementing a mail- related recycling program at their facilities to his or her district manager.  The prior policy also established others responsibilities. For example, area  managers were responsible for ensuring that facilities that generate UAA  mail conducted the annual evaluations and for assisting district managers  in finding markets for the material. USPS\u2019 latest policy, issued in 2007,  does not address these and other matters.", "During the course of our work, we discussed differences between the two  policies with USPS officials, including the requirement for an annual  evaluation of facility practices related to discarded mixed paper.

To address this omission as well as others, the officials  indicated that USPS would develop a new policy that will, among other  things, (1) provide employees with specific information on how to  implement recycling programs at their facilities, (2) require USPS facility  managers to implement mail-related recycling initiatives unless doing so is  not cost-effective or logistically feasible, and (3) specify requirements for  reporting data on USPS\u2019 mail-related recycling activities.

In the  second phase, which recently began, the Memphis employees are working  with managers at facilities with existing waste disposal and recycling  contracts and are attempting to convince these managers to incorporate  their facilities within larger, regionally-based USPS waste disposal and  recycling contracts. Such contract consolidations are consistent with our  prior findings. Specifically, in 2004, we reported that consolidating  contracts allows private-sector companies to leverage their buying power  and identify more efficient ways to procure goods and services.", "The Memphis Center offers facility managers four types of contracts: (1)  waste disposal only; (2) removal of recyclables only; (3) removal of waste  and recyclables; and (4) Total Solid Waste Management contracts, which  cover both waste disposal and recycling. In fiscal year 2007, the four  types of contracts managed by the Memphis Center resulted in  approximately $6.6 million in recycling revenues (about $6 million) and  waste disposal cost savings (about $600,000).", "Total Solid Waste Management contracts attempt to both (1) maximize  recycling revenues and (2) minimize waste disposal costs by using two  methods to collect and transport mail-related recycling materials.

When consolidation at a  single USPS facility is not feasible, USPS uses a second method\u2014\u201cmilk  runs\u201d\u2014to collect its recyclable materials. Milk runs use contractors, such  as paper brokers and other vendors, to collect recyclable materials stored  at local USPS facilities and transport them to their destination.

USPS is implementing the pilot in stages. The first stage assessed postal  recycling activities underway in each of New York City\u2019s five boroughs,  using a variety of factors, such as costs to USPS, feasibility (including  logistical considerations), and mission compatibility. The report on the  assessment, issued in September 2007, concluded that recycling in New  York City (1) can generate recycling revenues, (2) will substantially reduce  USPS\u2019 waste disposal costs, (3) will not interfere with postal operations,  and (4) will require only a \u201cmodest incremental\u201d effort to accomplish.", "Based on the results of the first stage, the report suggested specific  recycling activities in each borough, including: (1) the initiation of  backhauling recycling programs for UAA Standard Mail and mail-related  materials in Manhattan, Brooklyn, and the Bronx, and the expansion of the  existing backhauling program in Queens; (2) the implementation of milk  runs for UAA Standard Mail and mail-related materials in Staten Island; (3)  the designation of sufficient loading dock space at USPS processing and  distribution centers in Manhattan to accommodate trailers for storing and  transporting mail-related recycling materials; and (4) the establishment of  recycling programs for discarded lobby mail in all five boroughs.  According to USPS, it is optimistic that, by carefully implementing and  enhancing mail-related recycling programs throughout New York City, it  could generate approximately $1.3 million per year in recycling revenues  and save an additional $800,000 in waste disposal costs.", "The pilot\u2019s second stage began in January 2008 and, in February 2008,  according to USPS officials, the agency issued a solicitation for a contract  to provide waste disposal and recycling services to USPS facilities in four  of New York City\u2019s five boroughs\u2014Brooklyn, the Bronx, Manhattan, and  Queens. USPS expects the contract will begin in October 2008.

In the  summer of 2007, USPS clarified this goal, specifying that it applied to the  cost\u2014not the volume\u2014of UAA mail. USPS is developing measures to  accurately assess its progress in meeting the UAA mail cost reduction goal.  According to USPS, its interim measures are not sufficient for this  purpose; however, USPS officials believe that data from its May 2009  deployment of Intelligent Mail, which we discuss later in this report, will  provide data needed to accurately measure its progress in meeting this  goal.", "USPS\u2019 Tools for Improving the Accuracy of Mailing Lists Reduce  UAA Mail  USPS has developed numerous tools that mailers can use to increase the  amount of mail that is accurately addressed for delivery. Mail that is  accurately addressed decreases UAA mail volume, which, in turn,  decreases USPS\u2019 operational and waste disposal costs. Since these address  accuracy tools decrease USPS\u2019 operational costs, USPS provides lower  postage rates (worksharing rates) to mailers who use them. A partial  description of some of USPS\u2019 address accuracy tools follows:    \u201cAddress Element Correction\u201d identifies mailpieces that are potentially  UAA and corrects small errors in the addresses (e.g., the omission of a  directional indicator such as \u201cNW,\u201d or errors that refer to an avenue as a  street).   \u201cDelivery Point Validation\u201d verifies that the address on a mailpiece  exists in USPS\u2019 database of addresses to which it delivers.    \u201cNational Change-of-Address LINK\u201d allows mailers to check their  mailing lists against USPS\u2019 National Change-of-Address database, which  contains updated address information for mail recipients who have filed  change-of-address notices with USPS.   \u201cAddress Change Service\u201d allows mailers to receive, for a fee,  electronic notices that inform them when USPS cannot deliver their  mailpieces. For First-Class Mail, these electronic notices reduce the  amount of mail USPS must return to the sender, thereby decreasing UAA  mail and USPS\u2019 operating costs. For Standard Mail\u2014which USPS generally  is not obligated to return to the sender\u2014the electronic notices (1) inform  mailers when their Standard mailpieces are UAA and (2) provide mailers  with the correct addressing information. This information enables  Standard mailers to update their mailing lists with corrected addresses  prior to their next mailing, thereby reducing future UAA mail-related costs.", "USPS Introduced Two New Requirements That Are Expected to  Reduce UAA Mail  USPS also introduced two recent changes that, according to USPS  officials, will reduce UAA mail and, consequently, help USPS meets its  UAA mail cost reduction goal (i.e., a 50 percent reduction by fiscal year  2010). First, USPS has revised its \u201cMove Update\u201d requirement, which  currently obligates First-Class mailers to use at least one approved address  accuracy tool (such as National Change-of-Address LINK or the Address  Change Service) to qualify for worksharing rates. In September 2007,  USPS expanded this requirement to include mailers who send Standard  Mail, effective November 23, 2008. Furthermore, USPS will begin requiring  First-Class and Standard mailers to update their mailing lists\u2014using an  approved address accuracy tool\u201495 days prior to each of their mailings.", "Second, beginning in May 2009, USPS intends to require mailers to use a  new barcode\u2014called the \u201cIntelligent Mail Barcode\u201d\u2014on their mailpieces  to qualify for worksharing rates. According to USPS officials, the new  barcode will allow USPS and mailers to track individual mailpieces as they  move through the mail stream. USPS officials believe that the capability to  track mailpieces will reduce UAA mail volumes\u2014and, potentially, USPS  operating costs\u2014because mailers will be able to use the barcode to  determine which of their mailpieces cannot be delivered and correct their  mailing lists accordingly. USPS has initiatives underway, including an  agreement with the Bank of America, to test the effectiveness of the  Intelligent Mail Barcode before it is fully implemented.", "USPS Has Implemented a Method to Identify and Redirect  Improperly Addressed Mail before Delivery Is Attempted  In September 2007, USPS also implemented a new, nationwide mail  processing method\u2014called the \u201cPostal Automated Redirection System\u201d\u2014 that identifies and redirects mailpieces to individuals who have moved.  According to USPS, if a mail recipient has moved and filed a change-of- address request with USPS, the automated redirection system identifies  mailpieces addressed to his or her prior address when these mailpieces  first enter the mail stream and initiates one of three possible actions. The  first possible action is for USPS to immediately redirect the mailpiece to  the new, correct destination. Second, if the mailpiece is not eligible for  forwarding or if the mailer has authorized its disposal, USPS would  remove the mailpiece from the mail stream and discard it. Finally, if  requested by the mailer, USPS would return the mailpiece to the mailer  (i.e., the sender). In the past, USPS redirected mailpieces only after  delivery had been attempted. In such cases, Standard Mail was returned to  the postal facility and discarded as waste (and disposed of through  recycling or some other means), while First-Class Mail was processed and  forwarded, returned to the sender, or sent to a mail recovery center.  Because USPS generally does not forward or return UAA Standard Mail\u2014 regardless of when it is first detected\u2014the automated redirection system  will not reduce the amount of UAA Standard Mail that USPS must  eventually discard. However, USPS officials believe the automated  redirection system will reduce the cost of processing UAA mail, thereby  contributing to the agency\u2019s UAA mail cost-reduction goal."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Mailing, Paper Recycling, and Environmental Advocacy Industries Have Undertaken Several Key Initiatives to Increase Mail- Related Recycling", "paragraphs": ["In addition to USPS\u2019 efforts, the mailing industry and other stakeholders  have undertaken several key initiatives to increase the volume of mail- related materials that are recycled. Some of these initiatives were  developed by mailing industry associations, while others are the result of  efforts by individual mailers and organizations in the paper and  environmental advocacy industries. For example, in 2007, the Direct  Marketing Association (DMA), the Envelope Manufacturers Association,  and the Magazine Publishers of America developed nationwide mail  recycling awareness campaigns. While similar in nature, the three  programs use different logos to increase recycling awareness and are  intended for different types of mailpieces (e.g., catalogs, envelopes, and  magazines). DMA members who participate in the association\u2019s \u201cRecycle  Please\u201d program are expected to include a logo in their catalogs and other  mailpieces to encourage mail recipients to recycle their mailpieces after  reading them. The envelope association\u2019s program\u2014called \u201cPlease  Recycle\u201d\u2014promotes mail recycling by encouraging manufacturers to place  a recycling logo on the front of envelopes and other packaging materials.  Finally, the magazine association\u2014which also calls its program \u201cPlease  Recycle\u201d\u2014developed recycling logos and a full-page recycling  advertisement that the association encourages its members to include in  their magazines in order to increase the volume of magazines recycled.  Participation in these recycling awareness campaigns varies. Specifically,  based on our calculations of data provided by officials from DMA and the  envelope and magazine associations, as of mid-March 2008, about 2  percent, 30 percent, and 10 percent of their members participated in these  programs, respectively.

According to coalition  officials, the logo has been repeatedly altered by product manufacturers  and others since it was first introduced and, as a result, multiple versions  of the logo currently exist, each of which signifies different meanings  depending on its use.

DMA  requires its members to honor such requests and, consequently, forbids its  members from selling or exchanging this list for any purpose other than  removing prospective customers from their mailing lists. According to  DMA officials, by eliminating prospecting mail, the Service (1) reduces the  amount of mail a consumer receives by approximately 80 percent and (2)  prevented 930 million pieces of unwanted mail from entering the mail  stream in 2007. While DMA officials stated that the association works  with consumer advocacy groups and other parties to inform consumers  about the Mail Preference Service, a recent study conducted by Pitney  Bowes indicates that two-thirds of Americans are not aware of the  Service\u2019s existence. In part to address this lack of awareness, several  parties within the environmental advocacy industry recently implemented  other opt-out programs.

The committee designed and executed a survey to benchmark the  environmental practices of its members and developed a Web-based tool  to help members evaluate their environmental practices in five areas: (1)  paper procurement and use, (2) address quality (accuracy) and data  management, (3) design, (4) packaging and printing, and (5) recycling and  pollution reduction. The tool also enables mailers to create an  environmental vision statement or policy statement for, among other  purposes, displaying on their Web sites.

DMA  officials stated that, thus far, members generally have reacted positively to  the list of 15 preferable practices, although some members have expressed  concerns about purchasing recycled and certified paper. Specifically,  members expressed concerns that (1) the supply of these products may  not be sufficient to meet demand if DMA were to require its members to  use them; and (2) due to the number of forest certification programs and  the controversy over the programs\u2019 various merits, it is not clear which  program they should use.

The new  requirement, effective in October 2009, will strengthen DMA members\u2019  current obligation to provide mail recipients with one opt-out notice per  year. The Commitment to Consumer Choice program also includes several  other requirements related to consumer choice. Some of these  requirements are new or modified, while others are long-standing. For  example, DMA members must (1) disclose, upon consumer request, the  source from which they obtained data about the consumer; (2) eliminate,  upon consumer request, the transfer or rental of the consumer\u2019s personal  information to other marketers; (3) increase the frequency with which  they update their mailing lists against information in DMA\u2019s Mail  Preference Service opt-out database (from a quarterly to a monthly basis);  and (4) act on all customer opt-out requests within 30 days and for a  period of at least 3 years.", "According to DMA officials, DMA has an internal process for ensuring that  members comply with its requirements.

First, several stakeholders stated  that USPS could increase its mail-related recycling activities by offering  recognition, financial awards, promotional opportunities, and other  incentives to reward exemplary USPS recycling achievements. Three  USPS officials stated that such incentives could target facility-level  managers and employees, who are likely to be critical to the successful  implementation of mail-related recycling programs. As discussed, USPS is  considering establishing a program to nominate facilities, teams, and  individuals for environmental excellence. As currently envisioned, the  program would honor excellence in seven environmental categories,  including \u201cpollution prevention.\u201d While USPS is contemplating recognition  for \u201cimprovements in recycling processes or programs\u201d as part of its  achievements related to pollution prevention, the program under  consideration does not specifically recognize mail-related recycling  achievements. An incentives program targeted specifically toward such  achievements could foster greater competition throughout USPS, resulting  in substantial increases in the agency\u2019s recycling revenue and significant  savings in its waste disposal costs. Such a program could be based solely  on recycling revenues, or include other metrics\u2014such as the amount  (tonnage) of materials recycled or its savings in waste disposal costs.", "Second, because mail recipients often are unaware that mail can be  recycled, stakeholders suggested that USPS conduct a campaign to  increase awareness among mail recipients that mail is recyclable and to  encourage them to recycle their mail. Such a campaign could be  collaborative in nature, unilateral, or undertaken through some  combination of outreach efforts. For example, several stakeholders stated  that USPS could collaborate with one or more of the ongoing mailing  industry and other stakeholder initiatives to increase recycling awareness  among mail recipients and to encourage them to recycle. Such an effort,  among other matters, could (1) address common misconceptions related  to the recyclability of various types of mail and (2) raise awareness about  the primary causes of identity theft\u2014two reasons why recipients may not  recycle their mail. In addition, USPS could collaborate with members of  the Greening the Mail Task Force to design and implement a plan to  increase the public\u2019s awareness in these and other areas. If USPS desired  to do so, stakeholders suggested that the agency also could take unilateral  action to promote mail recycling by, for example, delivering an  informational post card or some other form of communication to each  address in America. Such an approach would be similar to USPS\u2019 actions  to promote its various products and services nationwide, which, according  to USPS officials, typically increase consumer awareness by nearly 30  percent. Stakeholders also suggested that USPS develop postmarks and  stamps and install signage in postal lobbies to promote mail recycling.", "Third, numerous stakeholders suggested that USPS collaborate with  parties, such as the American Forest and Paper Association and U.S. paper  recycling companies, to increase the supply of fiber needed for  manufacturing recycled paper products. According to these stakeholders,  such fiber is typically in short supply domestically because it is usually  exported to countries, such as China and India, which pay premium prices  for the fiber. The stakeholders added that the constant supply of UAA mail  available through USPS could be used to increase the domestic supply of  recycled fiber. Such a supply increase could potentially decrease the cost  of using recycled paper products which, in turn, could encourage their  increased use. One way for USPS to undertake this opportunity is to  collaborate with the American Forest and Paper Association, which,  according to association representatives, is eager to increase mail-related  recycling. Such a collaboration, they said, would contribute to the  association\u2019s goal of recovering (i.e., preventing landfill disposal or  incineration) 55 percent of paper consumed in the United States by 2012.  In addition, USPS could collaborate with members of its Greening the Mail  Task Force to design and implement a plan to increase the supply of paper  fiber available for recycling. USPS also could choose to explore, or  expand, partnerships with local recyclers. One paper recycling company in  New Jersey, for example, purchases and transports UAA mail from USPS  facilities in Maryland, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and elsewhere to  manufacture recycled paper products, such as paper towels, toilet paper,  facial tissue, and napkins. According to a company representative,  because UAA mail is a critical feedstock for the company\u2019s production  methods, the company would like to increase its supply of UAA mail as  long as the cost of transporting UAA mail to the company does not  become prohibitive.", "Fourth, numerous stakeholders in the environmental advocacy industry,  suggested that USPS establish a special, discounted postal rate\u2014or Green  Rate\u2014as a means of inducing mailers to adopt one or more  environmentally preferable attributes in their mailpieces. According to  these parties, for example, USPS could establish a special discount for  mailers that use recycled and/or certified paper. Such a discount, they  said, would help mailers offset the increased costs associated with using  recycled paper and would provide an incentive for mailers to use certified  paper. A Green Rate also could reward mailers who, among other  practices, (1) use certain targeted marketing strategies, (2) can  demonstrate measurable reductions in the amount of UAA mail they send,  and (3) use mail materials efficiently. With respect to targeted marketing  strategies, for example, a Green Rate could reward mailers who  voluntarily participate in mail opt-out programs\u2014such as the program  offered by Catalog Choice\u2014and can demonstrate that they honor mail  recipients\u2019 requests to be removed from their mailing listings. A Green  Rate also could reward mailers who, over time, reduce the amount of UAA  mail they send. Beginning in May 2009, USPS intends to use its Intelligent  Mail Barcodes to establish large mailers\u2019 UAA mail rates (the baseline)  and, over time, measure changes in the frequency of the mailers\u2019 UAA  mail. While large mailers will be required to use the barcodes to receive  worksharing rates for their mailings, USPS also could choose to use these  data to reward mailers who meet a specified target for UAA mail  reductions. In addition, if USPS chose to do so, it could reward mailers  according to a \u201csliding scale,\u201d whereby mailers would receive larger  discounts for greater UAA mail reductions. A final example of practices  that could be considered for a Green Rate is the use of two-way reusable  envelopes and other mailpieces that use materials efficiently.", "Finally, numerous stakeholders suggested that USPS, using its existing  transportation network, initiate a mail take-back program to facilitate the  recycling of discarded and unwanted mail in rural, sparsely populated  areas that do not have access to municipal paper recycling. While the  details of such a program would need to be developed, stakeholders  suggested that USPS\u2014possibly, in collaboration with others\u2014could  supply mail recipients in these locations with pre-addressed packages to  send their discarded mail either directly to a plant for recycling or,  indirectly, to other facilities\u2014including, possibly, USPS facilities\u2014where  the packages could be held for subsequent pick up and recycling.  Conceptually, such a program resembles several existing take-back  programs for used products\u2014such as inkjet cartridges, digital cameras,  and cellular phones\u2014whereby the program sponsor (e.g., a manufacturer)  supplies the consumer with a pre-paid and pre-addressed envelope for  returning used products through the U.S. mail. Stakeholders noted that  USPS receives revenue for returning the products under the existing take- back programs and, depending on how such a program is funded, also  could receive revenue under a take-back program for mail."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "USPS Would Need to Assess Several Factors in Deciding Whether to Adopt the Opportunities", "paragraphs": ["Each of the five stakeholder-identified opportunities appears to be  consistent with (1) the agency\u2019s long-standing commitment to  environmental leadership and (2) the Postmaster General\u2019s recently  expressed commitment to minimize USPS\u2019 impact on every aspect of the  environment and to act as a positive environmental influence in U.S.  communities. However, based on our analysis, USPS would need to assess  factors such as cost; feasibility, including logistical considerations; and  mission compatibility in deciding whether to adopt the opportunities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Cost Considerations", "paragraphs": ["Each of the five opportunities has overall cost considerations given their  likely impact on staff and other resources that would be needed to, among  other actions, develop plans, procedures, and agreements for  implementing them. USPS also would need to identify the staff and offices  responsible for successfully initiating and carrying out the opportunities,  and provide training as appropriate. In addition, while the costs associated  with implementing a program for recognizing mail-related recycling  achievements are likely to be minimal (and more than offset by increases  in USPS\u2019 revenues), the remaining four opportunities necessitate  additional cost consideration. For example, two of the opportunities\u2014 increasing awareness about mail recycling and initiating a Green Rate\u2014 appear to have little likelihood of increasing the agency\u2019s revenue.  Furthermore, the remaining two opportunities\u2014collaborating with parties  interested in increasing the supply of paper fiber available for recycling  and initiating a mail take-back program\u2014may not generate sufficient  revenues to cover their costs. Depending on the magnitude of variance  between the expected costs and revenues, USPS may find implementing  one or more of the opportunities unacceptable. This is, in part, because as  we recently testified, USPS faces multiple short- and long-term pressures  in improving its operational efficiency, increasing its revenues, and  controlling its costs\u2014some of which are increasing faster than the overall  inflation rate. In addition, unlike in the past, USPS is now subject to an  inflation-based cap on the prices it can charge for its goods and services.  Specifically, the 2006 Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act includes  an annual limitation on the average percentage changes in rates for each  market-dominant mail class\u2014such as First-Class Mail and Standard Mail\u2014 which is linked to the change in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban  Customers.", "In addition to these overall cost considerations, three of the five  opportunities have additional cost-related factors that USPS would need to  assess prior to deciding whether to adopt them. First, while the cost of  collaborating with other entities to increase recycling awareness among  mail recipients and to encourage mail recipients to recycle their mail could  be minimal, according to a USPS official, each of its recent nationwide  promotional campaigns (which do not involve collaboration) cost USPS  approximately $2.1 million. Such costs, however, may be overstated with  respect to a recycling campaign because USPS could choose, in  collaboration with others, to target only mail recipients in zip codes that  do not have access to municipal paper recycling (about 14 percent of the  U.S. population). Furthermore, USPS could elect to \u201cpiggyback\u201d a  recycling awareness message on another of its promotional mailings,  which, by itself, would result in little additional cost. However, according  to USPS officials, such a promotional campaign would necessitate the use  of recycled paper to remain consistent with the agency\u2019s recycling  awareness message. As previously stated, using recycled paper is more  expensive than using virgin paper and, thus, would increase the cost of  such a campaign.", "Second, because establishing a special discount to induce mailers to adopt  more environmentally preferable business practices would\u2014absent other  actions\u2014reduce USPS revenues, USPS would have to assess the overall  affects of such a discount on its financial position. In addition, USPS  would need to assess the specific cost implications associated with each  environmentally preferable attribute it chooses to include in a Green Rate.  For example, if USPS were to consider allowing mailers who, among other  attributes, use certain mail targeting strategies to qualify for a Green Rate  (e.g., participation in voluntary opt-out programs), USPS would need to  assess whether, and to what extent, doing so would reduce its revenues.  USPS also would need to assess the costs associated with, among other of  its activities, defining a Green Rate (i.e., determining which  environmentally preferable attributes mailers must use to qualify for the  discount) and, to avoid potential abuse, ensuring that the mailpieces  presented by mailers as \u201cgreen\u201d actually qualify for the discount.", "Finally, initiating a mail take-back program in locations that do not have  access to municipal paper recycling could greatly increase USPS\u2019 costs  and workload. The extent of these increases would depend on a variety of  factors, including (1) the volume of additional mail generated by the  program; (2) the characteristics, including the dimensions and weight, of  the take-back packages that would require processing and delivery; (3)  whether the packages would need to be manually processed; (4) the  frequency with which each package needs to be handled; and (5) the  distance the packages need to be transported. First, depending on the  rate of program participation, the volume of mail requiring USPS  processing and delivery could increase substantially. In addition, because  the intent of such a program is for a mail recipient to combine all of the  mail they discard during a given time frame into a single package, the  package would greatly exceed the weight of typical mailpieces received by  the recipient. Furthermore, because communities that do not have access  to paper recycling are typically in rural, sparsely populated areas, the  increased volume of larger and heavier mailpieces probably would travel  long distances before reaching their final destination, thereby increasing  USPS\u2019 transportation costs throughout the journey. The volume, weight,  and size of these packages also could overwhelm USPS\u2019 service capacity in  certain rural locations. Rural postal delivery service is typically carried out  by USPS letter carriers using privately-owned vehicles that may not be  capable of accommodating the increased volume, weight, and size of the  take-back packages. Thus, USPS may incur costs for additional vehicles  or changes in its operational arrangements with its rural postal carriers.  Finally, the packages mailed by recipients would not be presorted and,  depending on how the program is implemented, may not be barcoded\u2014 two factors that would require more costly, manual processing before  delivery."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Feasibility Considerations", "paragraphs": ["Four of the five stakeholder-identified opportunities also have issues  related to their feasibility, which USPS would need to assess prior to their  adoption. For example, if USPS chose to implement a program for  recognizing mail-related recycling achievements, such as an incentive  program for facility-level managers and employees, it would first need to  collect the data needed to do so. The two existing sources for USPS  recycling data\u2014the agency\u2019s evaluation tool for its areas and the  budgetary line-item for its districts\u2014do not include facility-level data.  Furthermore, collecting this data may not be feasible due to staffing  constraints and the large number (about 37,000, according to USPS) of  postal facilities nationwide. In light of this feasibility limitation, however,  and given USPS\u2019 goal of earning $40 million in recycling revenue in fiscal  year 2010 from its districts\u2019 efforts (approximately $500,000 per district),  the agency could, instead, focus on recognizing the significant  achievements of its district managers and employees. A district-level  incentives program, however, has its own feasibility constraints. For  example, to help ensure equity in such an incentives program, USPS would  need to resolve several factors related to the program\u2019s successful  implementation. Specifically, USPS likely would need to make  adjustments for large, regional variations in the price paid for recyclable  mail-related materials. If USPS did not consider these variations, an  incentives program based solely on revenue generated from mail-related  recycling would seriously disadvantage certain districts. One possibility  for resolving this issue may be to structure an incentives program on other  metrics, such as the total tonnage of material recycled or a district\u2019s  savings in waste disposal costs, either in lieu of, or addition to, recycling  revenues. However, such an action would introduce other issues related to  the opportunity\u2019s feasibility because, according to USPS officials, USPS  does not currently require its organizations, including its districts, to (1)  report their recycling tonnage or savings from waste disposal costs or (2)  collect and report their recycling data using consistent methods. The  Manager of USPS\u2019 Environmental Policy and Programs organization told  us that the agency intends to require its area managers to report  information on their recycling tonnage, in addition to their recycling  revenue and waste disposal costs, but at the conclusion of our review,  USPS had not required these managers to do so.", "Second, if USPS chose to coordinate with parties, such as domestic  recyclers, to increase the supply of fiber available for paper recycling, it  would need to resolve a multitude of logistical considerations. For  example, (1) Where will USPS store its mail-related materials for  recycling? (2) Is sufficient storage available within USPS facilities? (3)  Who will load the materials for delivery to the recycler? (4) Who will be  responsible for transporting the materials and how will the deliveries be  accomplished? and (5) Given space constraints, how often will the  materials need to be transported, and to whom? Furthermore, to the  extent that USPS facilities, vehicles, and other materials (e.g., crates and  moveable carts) are used, the agency would need, among other actions, to  develop a method for sharing its costs with recyclers and others who  benefit directly from its efforts. If USPS were to undertake this  opportunity with a goal of recycling domestically\u2014as recommended by  some stakeholders\u2014USPS may also wish to explore arrangements to  recoup a portion of any reduction in its revenues attributable to using  domestic recyclers. If USPS did not use its staff or if sufficient and capable  staff is not available to undertake these and other efforts, USPS could hire  a third party to identify locations where this opportunity may be feasible  to implement and, in such cases, act as USPS\u2019 intermediary in addressing  these and other logistical considerations.", "Similarly, if USPS chose to establish a Green Rate, the agency would need  to resolve a wide range of issues related to the feasibility of doing so. For  example, USPS would need to assess whether a discount for mailpieces  with certain environmental attributes is the appropriate mechanism for  promoting environmentally preferable business practices. If USPS were to  proceed, it would need to define the parameters of the discount and, to  avoid abuse, determine how it would ensure that mail presented as \u201cgreen\u201d  actually qualifies for the discount. Several stakeholders expressed  particular concern about the feasibility of enforcing a Green Rate,  indicating that such a task would be administratively difficult and,  possibly, impossible to accomplish. Finally, to determine whether a Green  Rate is feasible, USPS would need to (1) assess the impact of such a  discount on its net revenues and existing postal rates; (2) determine  whether, and to what extent, a Green Rate would affect its market- dominate products, which are subject to an annual inflation-based price  cap; and (3) if the establishment of the discount resulted in the need to  raise postal rates, evaluate whether USPS would be able to raise rates in  accordance with the requirements in Postal Accountability and  Enhancement Act.", "Finally, to initiate a mail take-back program, USPS would need to consider  the logistics and overall feasibility of collecting and transporting the  increased volumes of larger and heavier mailpieces through the mail  stream. USPS, probably in collaboration with others, also would need to  determine how the program would work\u2014which likely would be a  complex arrangement. For example, what classes of mail would the  program cover? Who would supply the packages and postage needed to  return the discarded mail? How would the appropriate postage be  determined? Furthermore, where would the packages be sent, and to how  many locations? In addition, to estimate its costs, USPS would need to  develop, among other factors, a method for estimating (1) the number of  mail recipients who would participate in the program and (2) the volume,  size, and weight of their discarded mail take-back packages. While these  considerations are numerous, the most serious question with respect to  the program\u2019s feasibility is \u201cWho will pay the substantial costs associated  with implementing the program?\u201d", "USPS has three options to cover the costs of a mail take-back program.  First, USPS could explore increases in its postage rates for the applicable  classes of mail\u2014an action that mailing industry stakeholders would likely  strongly oppose. Furthermore, it may not be feasible to raise these rates  because of a limitation specified in the Postal Accountability and  Enhancement Act. Second, while USPS could require mail recipients to  pay the postage needed to cover the program\u2019s costs, such an action, in  our view, would greatly diminish or eliminate public participation. As we  reported in 2006, one key to increasing the volume of materials recycled is  to offer financial incentives to increase recycling. Thus, a mail take-back  program that departs from this premise is, in our view, unlikely to  succeed. Finally, USPS could solicit funding from other parties, such as  communities, federal and non-profit organizations, businesses,  environmental organizations, Congress, and other interested parties. While  USPS could explore this option, it is unclear whether other parties would  find it in their best interest to fund such a program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Mission Compatibility Considerations", "paragraphs": ["While each of these opportunities appears to be consistent with the  agency\u2019s environmental commitments, including the Postmaster General\u2019s  recent commitments to both minimize the agency\u2019s impact on every aspect  of the environment and to act as a positive environmental influence in U.S.  communities, it is unclear to what extent USPS views actions to fulfill  these commitments as being compatible with its mission and strategic  goals. Similarly, it is not clear whether, or to what extent, USPS would be  willing to sacrifice revenue and/or incur additional costs to further its  environmental commitments.", "In addition, two of the five stakeholder-identified opportunities\u2014the  establishment of a mail take-back program and a Green Rate for  mailpieces that incorporate a variety of environmentally preferable  attributes\u2014would necessitate additional cost considerations. First, several  mailing industry stakeholders told us that they strongly oppose a Green  Rate, in part, because of mission compatibility concerns. According to  these stakeholders, unlike worksharing rates that reward mailers for  reducing USPS\u2019 costs, a Green Rate discount does not align with USPS\u2019  primary mission of delivering the mail. In addition, they said that market  forces and mailer preferences\u2014not the establishment of a Green Rate\u2014 should determine whether mailers choose to include environmentally  preferable attributes in their mailpieces. Depending on how USPS chose to  define a Green Rate, some specific aspects of the definition could cause  additional mission compatibility concerns. For example, if the use of  certified paper was included in a Green Rate, USPS lacks the expertise  needed to evaluate the relative merits of the various\u2014and controversial\u2014 certification programs. Likewise, if a Green Rate incorporated certain  targeted marketing strategies, USPS could be drawn into a contentious  debate about the relative merits of various opt-out programs, including  voluntary programs administered by Catalog Choice and others.", "Finally, as discussed previously, establishing a mail take-back program  likely would result in significant increases in the volume, size, and weight  of packages moving through the mail stream. Such increases could  overburden USPS\u2019 delivery networks and create delivery delays. Related to  this, several stakeholders from USPS and the mailing industry told us that  USPS\u2019 mission is to deliver the mail in a timely fashion\u2014not to help mail  recipients recycle their discarded and unwanted mail."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["USPS, the mailing industry, and others have developed a wide range of  initiatives that, over time, could alleviate some concerns related to the  perceived negative impact of mail on the environment. Several of the  initiatives also have the potential to improve USPS\u2019 financial position\u2014 while also enhancing its environmental reputation in U.S. communities.  However, it is not clear what level of trade-offs, including decreased  revenue and/or increased costs, USPS would find acceptable to incur to  further its commitments and reputation on environmental matters.", "While much is being done, USPS has numerous opportunities to enhance  its mail-related recycling efforts. For example, while establishing goals  should assist USPS in generating substantial additional mail-related  recycling revenues, the agency has not established similar goals for  reducing its costs associated with waste disposal. Consequently, its  recycling goals do not reflect the full financial benefit attributable to mail- related recycling. In our view, revising USPS\u2019 recycling goals to include  savings from lower waste disposal costs or adopting additional goals that  reflect the full financial benefit attributable to mail-related recycling would  help focus USPS employees on the need to achieve greater cost  reductions\u2014consistent with one of USPS\u2019 strategic goals. Related to this,  while USPS intends to develop a plan to help it achieve its recycling goals,  it is not clear whether this plan will (1) specify how progress toward its  goals will be measured or (2) ensure that the data USPS will use to  measure its progress are accurate, reliable, and collected using a  consistent method. Furthermore, while USPS launched a pilot recycling  program in New York City to, among other objectives, apply lessons  learned to other postal facilities, it is unclear whether, and to what extent,  USPS will require its facility managers to adopt these lessons where  applicable, feasible, mission compatible, and appropriate in view of cost  and other considerations.

The first report, issued in 2006, contained a list of best practices  for accurately addressing mailpieces and recommended, among other  matters, that mailers\u2014prior to each mailing\u2014update their mailing lists by  using USPS\u2019 tools for improving address accuracy. We were unable to  ascertain the extent to which mailers have adopted the report\u2019s  recommendations. The second report, issued in 2007, (1) outlined a system  by which USPS could certify the accuracy of mailing lists purchased by  mailers and (2) described several scenarios in which such a system would  reduce UAA mail. According to USPS, it intends to develop a list  certification system by October 1, 2010. However, this time frame is  contingent on the deployment of software upgrades related to its postal  automated redirection system and the mailing industry\u2019s implementation  of Intelligent Mail barcodes, expected in May 2009.", "Third, several parties within the environmental advocacy industry have  undertaken initiatives to decrease the amount of unwanted mail received  by mail recipients. For example, \u201c41 Pounds\u201d and \u201cGreenDimes\u201d\u2014a non- profit and for-profit organization, respectively\u2014were established in 2006  to help mail recipients decline (i.e., opt-out of) many types of unwanted  mail, including credit card and sweepstakes offers, insurance promotions,  coupon booklets, and catalogs. These organizations accomplish this goal  by, among other activities, (1) helping mail recipients register for DMA\u2019s  Mail Preference Service and (2) directly contacting non-DMA mailers\u2014 who are not required to use this service\u2014to request them not to send mail  solicitations to these mail recipients. 41 Pounds charges $41 for its  services and, according to its Web site, donates one-third of this fee to  community and environmental organizations. GreenDimes charges $20 for  its services and, as of mid-March 2008, planted five trees for its services  and an additional tree for every catalog that a member (mail recipient)  declined (up to five additional trees). In addition, Catalog Choice\u2014a non- profit program sponsored by the Ecology Center and endorsed by the  National Wildlife Federation and the Natural Resources Defense Council\u2014 offers a free service that allows consumers to stop receiving unwanted  catalogs. Consumers can search for catalogs on the Catalog Choice Web  site and, after providing their address information, opt-out of those they do  not wish to receive.

For example, one major envelope manufacturer enables its  customers to customize their envelopes with an assortment of  environmentally preferable attributes, including recycled and certified  paper. A company official estimated that 80 percent of his company\u2019s  envelope sales include at least one environmentally preferable attribute.  Another company designed reusable \u201ctwo-way\u201d envelopes that are made  with at least 30 percent recycled paper.", "Fifth, some individual catalog mailers have undertaken their own efforts to  incorporate environmentally preferable attributes in their mailpieces.

A representative of Co-op  America estimated that the percentage of magazines using recycled paper  is extremely low. According to the representative, convincing magazine  officials to use recycled or certified paper is difficult, due, in part, to (1)  confusion regarding the environmental benefits of using these products,  (2) the higher cost of recycled paper, (3) the availability of recycled paper,  and (4) the perception among many magazine companies that using  recycled paper will adversely affect the appearance of their products."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: DMA\u2019s List of 15 Environmentally Preferable Business Practices", "paragraphs": ["As discussed in the body of this report, DMA developed a list of 15  environmentally preferable business practices\u2014the \u201cGreen 15.\u201d While  adoption of these 15 practices is mostly voluntary, in June 2008, DMA intends  to establish goals and timetables for measuring its members\u2019 success in  implementing these practices, which, according to DMA officials, could lead  to future DMA requirements.

Require paper suppliers to document that they do not produce or sell  paper from illegally harvested or stolen wood; and  5.  Evaluate the paper used for advertising, product packaging, and  internal consumption in order to identify opportunities to increase  their environmentally preferable attributes.", "Mailing list accuracy and data management \u2013 Mailers should:  6.
