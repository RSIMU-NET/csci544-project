Technology installation has progressed smoothly, however State and DHS have not provided comprehensive guidance to consular posts on when and how information from the DHS Automated Biometric Identification System (IDENT) on visa applicants should be considered by adjudicating consular officers. In the absence of such guidance, we found that these officers are unclear on how best to use the biometric program and IDENT information. Since September 11, State and DHS have made many improvements to visa issuance and border security policies. Nevertheless, in prior reports, we have found additional vulnerabilities that need to be addressed through joint, coordinated actions. For example, DHS has not adequately defined the operational context for US-VISIT, which affects the biometric program.

IDENT response time could affect visa issuance times  because a visa cannot be issued until the post has received and reviewed  the IDENT response. Our observations at posts in San Salvador and Santo  Domingo demonstrated the importance of the length of time required to  receive an IDENT response. We observed that most interviews average  only a few minutes, but the IDENT response time currently is 30 minutes.  Thus, if interviewing officers collect prints during the interview, the  interview would be completed before the IDENT response would be  available to consular officers. Since the visa cannot be issued until the  IDENT information is considered by the consulate, potential delays in the  IDENT response times could have a major effect on the visa issuance  process and inconvenience visa applicants.

Santo Domingo has fewer interviewing windows than San  Salvador and cannot easily spare one to designate for fulltime fingerprint  scanning due to high interview volume. Some interviewing officers scan  applicants\u2019 fingerprints at the time of the interview, so the interview ends  before the IDENT response has been returned from DHS.

We reported that the visa revocation process was  not used aggressively to share information among agencies on individuals  with visas revoked on terrorism grounds. It also broke down when these  individuals had already entered the United States prior to revocation.  Immigration officials and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) were  not then routinely taking actions to investigate, locate, or resolve the cases  of individuals who remained in the United States after their visas were  revoked.

However, our review showed that some  weaknesses remained. For instance, in some cases State took a week or  longer to notify DHS that individuals with revoked visas might be in the  country. Without these notifications, DHS may not know to investigate  those individuals. Given outstanding legal and policy issues regarding the  removal of individuals based solely on their visa revocation, we  recommended that the Secretaries of Homeland Security and State jointly  (1) develop a written governmentwide policy that clearly defines roles and  responsibilities and sets performance standards and (2) address  outstanding legal and policy issues in this area or provide Congress with  specific actions it could take to resolve them.
