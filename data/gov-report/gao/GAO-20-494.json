For example, an estimated 41 percent of districts need to update or replace heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems in at least half of their schools, representing about 36,000 schools nationwide that need HVAC updates (see figure). In about half of the 55 schools GAO visited in six states, officials described HVAC-related problems, such as older systems that leaked and damaged flooring or ceiling tiles. If not addressed, such problems can lead to indoor air quality problems and mold, and in some cases caused schools to adjust schedules temporarily. To determine the condition of their school facilities, an estimated two-thirds of districts conducted a facilities condition assessment at least once in the last 10 years. According to GAO's survey of the 50 states and District of Columbia, most states do not conduct statewide assessments to determine school facilities' needs and instead leave this task to school districts.", "School districts' highest priorities for their school facilities were improving security (an estimated 92 percent), expanding student access to technology (87 percent), and monitoring health hazards (78 percent), according to GAO's school district survey. In school districts GAO visited, officials said they first address health hazards and safety issues. In nearly all districts GAO visited, security also had become a top priority, with some districts prioritizing security updates over replacing building systems, such as HVAC. In about half of districts nationwide, funding for school facilities primarily came from local sources such as property taxes, based on GAO's survey. High-poverty districts more commonly relied on state funding and used property taxes less commonly than low-poverty districts. According to GAO's state survey, 36 states provided capital funding to school districts for school construction or renovations, including five of the six states GAO visited, though the funding amounts and mechanisms differed considerably within and across states."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Public school facilities play an integral role in the educational and civic life  of local communities.

We conducted the survey from  September to December 2019. We also conducted a nationally  representative survey of K-12 public school districts from August to  October 2019. The unweighted response rate was 57 percent. Estimates  generated from the survey, adjusting for nonresponse, are generalizable  to the population of public school districts. We also visited 55 schools in  16 school districts across six states (California, Florida, Maryland,  Michigan, New Mexico, and Rhode Island) to observe a predetermined  set of key building systems and features in each school. We interviewed  district and school staff about their roles in funding, assessing, or  providing other resources for facilities to school districts and schools. We  selected states to vary geographically, as well as in the amount and type  of funding they provide for school facilities, and data they collect on the  condition of school facilities.", "To determine relevant systems and features for school facilities, we  reviewed the Standard Guide for Property Condition Assessments:  Baseline Property Condition Assessment Process, an international  standard for assessing the condition of a building. Additionally, we  interviewed multiple subject matter experts and stakeholders in the field  of school facilities and building assessments. We used this information to  create two lists of building systems and features, which we asked about in  our surveys and observed in the schools we visited.

School districts can typically use this funding for a wide range of  purposes, including school maintenance and operations. Maintenance  may include routine replacement of lighting, filters, or building system  parts, as well as emergency repairs to building systems. According to  Education, maintenance and operations may also cover care and upkeep  of grounds and equipment, vehicles (other than student transportation),  and security.", "When school districts need to construct, renovate, replace, or make major  repairs to building systems or features, such as roofing or plumbing, they typically use capital funding, which is separate from funding used for  maintenance and operations.", "School districts use various mechanisms to fund capital projects. The  specific funding mechanisms available to a given school district may differ  based on state laws or regulations, and may require approval from state  or local voters. A common funding mechanism for capital projects is to  issue bonds. Bonds are debt securities issued by states, school districts,  and other governmental entities and are repaid with interest, often  through local property taxes or other types of local revenue. In some  states, school districts might also use funding mechanisms called capital  reserves and sinking funds to raise funds for school facilities projects.  Capital reserves allow districts to hold end-of-year surpluses of general  education funding in a capital reserve fund, which typically grows over  time and can be used for large-scale projects. Sinking funds are usually  generated from local property taxes and allow districts to set aside a  percentage of property taxes each year to be used for capital projects.  Districts do not pay interest because the funds are not borrowed;  however, the funds generated may not be sufficient for large-scale  projects.", "In specific circumstances, some federal funding is available for school  facilities. For example, Education administers the Impact Aid program,  which compensates local school districts that, among other things, have  lost property tax revenue due to federal activities. This may include the  presence of tax-exempt federal property, such as a military installation,  children in public schools whose parents work and live on federal  property, or children living on Indian lands. In fiscal year 2019, Education  provided $17.4 million in Impact Aid grants to school districts, specifically  for construction, renovation, or repair of school facilities. Additionally,  the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) provides funding  for school districts affected by some natural disasters, partly to repair and  replace damaged buildings. For example, in 2019, following Hurricane  Harvey, FEMA awarded grants to two school districts in Texas to set up a  temporary middle school and replace books, equipment, and furniture,  among other things."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Facilities Condition Assessments", "paragraphs": ["A facilities condition assessment is a systematic inspection of building  systems and features using a standardized method for recording  observations about condition.

In terms of specific  building systems and features, we estimate that 41 percent of school  districts need to update or replace HVAC systems in at least half their  schools (about 36,000 schools nationwide). We also estimate about a  quarter of districts need to update or replace other building systems,  including interior lighting, roofing, safety and security systems, or  plumbing in at least half their schools (see fig. 2).", "We saw similar results among the 55 schools we visited. Of those, 28 had  HVAC issues, such as older systems that frequently malfunction or leak  and damage flooring or ceiling tiles, according to our observations and  discussions with district and school officials. For example, one school we  visited in Rhode Island had parts or components of their operating HVAC  systems that were nearly 100 years old, according to district officials (see  fig. 3). In Michigan, we visited one school that district officials said used  an original boiler from the 1920s to heat the building. According to district  officials, older boilers are labor-intensive to maintain because city code  requires an engineer to be on site when each boiler is operating; without  constant monitoring when in operation, the boilers could build up too  much pressure and explode. Officials in a New Mexico district said their  mechanical systems experience issues because hard water (i.e., water  with a high concentration of minerals) damages the systems and causes  them to malfunction. Because of the hard water, the district spent  $150,000 to replace an 8-year-old boiler that, according to district  officials, should have lasted 20 years. District officials said they would like  to purchase filtration and water softening systems to address the issue,  but that the district cannot afford to do so.", "If not addressed, HVAC issues can result in health and safety problems.  Officials in several school districts we visited said there are serious  consequences to not maintaining or updating HVAC systems, including  lost educational time due to school closings and the potential for mold  and air quality issues (see fig. 4). For example, officials in a Michigan  district said about 60 percent of their schools do not have air conditioning,  and in 2019, some temporarily adjusted schedules due to extreme heat.  Without air conditioning, schools relied on open windows and fans, which  were not always effective at cooling buildings to safe temperatures for  students and staff, according to district officials. Officials in a Maryland  district said the district retrofitted some schools with air conditioning, but  did not update pipes and insulation serving the HVAC systems, which has  caused moisture and condensation problems in these buildings. Officials  were concerned the moisture and condensation could lead to air quality  and mold problems, but said that to remedy these issues could cost over  $1 million for each building.", "School districts also reported needing to update or replace other key  building systems and features. Based on our school district survey, we  estimate that about 30,000 schools need to update or replace interior  lighting and about 28,000 schools need to update or replace roofing. Of  the 55 schools we visited, some had recently updated or replaced these  systems, while others continued to face challenges. For example, 15  schools had installed light emitting diode (LED) systems or incorporated  other energy efficient features, such as motion sensors to turn off lights in  unused rooms or automatic dimmers that adjust based on the amount of  daylight in a given space (see fig. 5). Six schools had not recently  updated their interior lighting, but officials expressed a desire to do so in  the near future, such as by switching to LED systems. Some district  officials said LED systems can reduce energy consumption and utility  costs.", "Of the 55 schools we visited, 18 had problems with their roofing,  according to district and school officials. Roofing problems ranged from  small leaks to larger issues requiring a costly replacement (see fig. 6). For  example, officials in a Rhode Island district said that replacing the roofing  at one school would likely cost about $3 million. These officials said,  because the district did not have the funds to replace it, they instead  planned to spend $20,000 on temporary fixes, with the hope that these  fixes would last until funding was available for a full replacement."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Majority of School Districts Evaluated Facilities to Determine Conditions", "paragraphs": ["Based on our survey of school districts, we estimate that 65 percent of  districts had conducted a facilities condition assessment of their schools  at least once in the last 10 years and about 35 percent had not or did not  know if their district had (see fig. 7).

Specifically, of the 16 school districts we visited in  six states, officials in 12 districts said they had recently conducted a  facilities condition assessment for a variety of reasons, such as to  develop facilities master plans or raise support for a bond. For example,  officials in one urban California district said they conducted an extensive  facilities condition assessment for planning purposes and developed a  master plan of issues identified in schools 20 years or older. During the  assessment, the district assigned barcodes to certain systems, such as  HVAC and water fountains, to track conditions across schools (see fig. 9).", "District officials said they update facilities data as they complete projects.  Officials in a rural Michigan district said they conducted an assessment  before asking voters to approve a sinking fund. District staff identified the  value, age, cost for repairs, and expected lifecycle of all major systems,  which helped them estimate funding needs for the next 10 years.

Officials in  Michigan said their state provides no funding for school facilities nor  requires districts to conduct facilities condition assessments because  districts are responsible for planning and prioritizing school facilities\u2019  needs. Michigan officials said districts often assess facility conditions  before seeking bonds or other local funding to show local voters the level  of need. Officials in California similarly said that school districts are  primarily responsible for evaluating school conditions and noted that it  would be cost-prohibitive for the state to conduct a statewide assessment,  given the number of schools in the state. Maryland officials said the state  has not had funding to conduct a statewide assessment since 2003, but  they are currently planning a future statewide assessment.

At  schools we visited around the country, officials reported initiatives to  address health concerns that ranged from total renovations to temporary  mitigation programs (see fig. 11). For example, officials in a district in  California told us that in two schools we visited they removed all materials  containing lead, as well as replaced all roofs that contained asbestos, in  accordance with health and safety regulations. These officials also said  staff tests the water quality in all schools per recommended guidelines. In  a different district, officials said they had concerns about water quality, but  that they did not have the funding to remediate the issue in all schools.  Therefore, the district provides bottled water to students in nearly all of its  schools, and installs water filtration systems when it constructs or  renovates schools. In several schools in five states we visited, officials  said there is asbestos in floor or ceiling tiles or other materials that would  require abatement during any renovation. Because abatement increases  costs, schools may prioritize other projects or find workarounds. For  example, at one high school in Florida, the district installed interactive  white boards on top of old chalkboards rather than risk disturbing  asbestos in the walls by removing the chalkboards. Officials in two  districts also told us about addressing potential health hazards related to  climate. For example, at a school in Florida, officials said they have to  address mold and mildew issues due to frequent flooding and high  humidity.

In the high school,  officials applied a specialized film to exterior windows to make them bullet  resistant. The school has a new security vestibule where visitors wait  before entering the school, and staff placed comment boxes throughout  the school encouraging students to submit safety tips. In Michigan, we  visited a middle school that installed additional barricades on classroom  doors, and trained students on how to use them during lockdown drills. In  California, we visited an elementary school that added exterior windows  to the front office so staff could see visitors approaching, and installed a  lockdown alarm button.", "Officials from some districts we visited said they prioritized security over  failing building systems. For example, one district in Rhode Island where  we observed problems with key building systems, including ceiling  damage from a leaking roof, broken windows, and holes in the walls and  foundation of a school building, installed new security features throughout  their schools. These included equipping classroom doors with electronic  lockdown mechanisms that staff can activate remotely. The district  updated the main entrance with heavy, reinforced doors and bulletproof  glass. In a district in Florida, we visited an elementary school that updated  security systems, including installing new cameras. This was despite the  school having major challenges with its HVAC system that require  maintenance staff to go up to the roof every day to adjust the air  conditioning. In addition, we observed multiple buckets throughout the  school to collect water leaking through the roof, and the principal  described how it frequently \u201crained\u201d in her office. District officials said they  are seeking state funding to renovate the entire school, but decided to  first address security updates because all classrooms have exterior  doors, making it difficult to control access to the school.

In a district in California, officials said they built nine  schools in the past decade because of the increasing student population.  At a high school in Maryland, the principal said his priority was ensuring  sufficient space because the school was at capacity and he was  struggling to find additional classrooms and furniture. Due to population  fluctuations at a nearby military installation, he said he often turns offices  and workspaces into classrooms and vice versa.

Based on our survey analysis, we found  significant differences in the primary funding sources for school facilities  for high-poverty and low-poverty districts. Specifically, high-poverty  districts more commonly relied on state funding to address facility needs  than low-poverty districts, whereas low-poverty districts more commonly  relied on local funding (see fig. 15).", "School districts reported using several funding mechanisms to access  local funding for school facilities projects. The most common was property  taxes, which an estimated 77 percent of all school districts used for  school facilities.

About 1.5 million more students attended school in high-poverty  districts than low-poverty districts in 2015-16. Low-poverty districts spent about $1  billion more on capital construction than high-poverty districts that year.  Size: Capital construction expenditures per student were similar in the largest (by  number of students enrolled) 100 districts compared to smaller districts. Both  groups of districts, on average, spent $837 per student on capital construction in  school year 2015-16.  Locale: Capital construction expenditures per student were similar, on average, for  urban ($838 per student) and rural districts ($834).", "Officials in school districts we visited described various challenges they  faced in securing funding for school facilities and how they have managed  with limited funding. For example, officials in a Michigan district said the  district had $1.5 billion in outstanding bond repayments and state  borrowing related to bond repayments. As a result, the district is unable to  issue an additional secured bond to fund new school facilities projects.  According to officials, Michigan does not provide state-level funding for  school facilities, so the district funded some recent school facilities  projects using general education surpluses resulting from staff vacancies.  However, as the district hired teachers and other staff, funding for  facilities will decline, further limiting the district\u2019s ability to address issues  with school facilities. That district has also deferred maintenance in order  to handle emergency repairs, according to officials. Officials in a high- poverty district in one state we visited said their tax base generates  minimal local revenue for school facilities. According to officials, the  district is mostly dependent on state funding. In the past decade, the state  established a partnership between various public entities, which provided  $1 billion to the district to address school facility needs, according to  district officials. Officials said the funding through this partnership was  enough to renovate about 25 schools. However, officials estimated the  district has about $5 billion in unmet needs, and its 2012 facilities  condition assessment recommended it consider replacing 50 schools.", "We also visited districts that have consistently had access to funding for  school facilities. For example, officials in one low-poverty California  district said their district is generally able to obtain funds needed for  school facilities projects, primarily through local taxes and passing  general obligation bonds. Officials said there are currently few challenges  with the condition of the district\u2019s school facilities because of routine and  preventive maintenance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "State Support for School Facilities Varied Within and Across States", "paragraphs": ["Though school districts most commonly used local funding to address  school facility needs, 36 states provided some level of capital funding to  school districts for school construction or renovations, based on our state  survey (see fig. 17). In addition, states reported using various criteria to  determine funding for capital projects, including the condition of a district\u2019s  schools (23 states), type of project, such as HVAC or fire safety (22), and  size of the student population (18). Fewer states (17) reported providing  districts with funding for maintenance and operations\u2014used for routine  upkeep and replacement of building system parts\u2014separate from general  education funding.", "State support for school facilities similarly varied within and among the six  states that we visited. Five of the six states we visited reported providing  state-level capital funding for school facilities, although the amount and  mechanisms differed. For example, according to state officials, New  Mexico has a capital fund for schools supported through taxes on the oil  and gas industry and bases its state funding on a school\u2019s condition.  These officials described how New Mexico assesses and ranks all  schools based on the condition of their facilities, and funds projects  starting with the highest priority school on the list, until each year\u2019s funds  are depleted. The state uses capital funds to match local dollars. The  percentage of a project\u2019s cost covered by the state depends on the  district\u2019s ability to raise local funds. In one district we visited, the state  pays 100 percent.", "Florida targets funding for school facilities to rural districts and charter  schools, both of which have limited access to local funding sources such  as property taxes, according to officials. These officials said the state has  a specific program to support capital projects in rural districts, and other  funding\u2014generated from taxes on landlines and utilities\u2014has in recent  years gone to charter schools. In California, districts receive state  funding based on the order the state receives eligible applications, until  funds are depleted, according to state officials. Michigan officials said the  state does not fund school facilities projects at the state level, although  the state has a program to review school districts\u2019 local bond measures.  The state does not require school districts to submit their bonds for state  approval, but doing so allows the district to access the state\u2019s credit  rating, which usually lowers the district\u2019s interest rate, among other  benefits, according to these officials.", "In three states we visited, state officials we interviewed told us that  financial support for capital projects may fluctuate each year depending  on availability of state funding. For example, Rhode Island officials said  that after the 2007-2009 recession, the state legislature stopped funding  school facilities until 2015. This resulted in deferred maintenance in  Rhode Island\u2019s schools that the state and school districts now need to  address in addition to any new capital projects, according to officials.", "Based on our state survey, five states require districts to use a portion of  their general education funding for maintenance and operations. Three of  these states reported requiring districts to use 3 percent or less of their  general education funding for this purpose, one state reported requiring  districts to use 6 percent, and one state did not know what percent was  required. Officials in Rhode Island said they have a new policy to require  districts to set aside a portion of the state funds they receive for  maintenance and operations to protect the state\u2019s increasing investment  in school facilities, and that the state is phasing in the requirement over 5  years. Officials in New Mexico said that while they do not require this type  of set aside, they evaluate how well districts maintain their facilities, and  districts that inadequately maintain them may be ineligible for some types  of state facilities funding.", "Many states also reported that they considered state-level priorities for  school facilities when providing funding and guidance to school districts.  Based on our survey, more than half of states provided financial support,  as well as standards and guidance, for specific building systems and  features of school facilities (see fig. 18).", "State funding and guidance related to state-level priorities can affect  school district decisions on facilities. For example, Rhode Island  approved a $250 million state bond for school facilities in 2018, and will  provide higher reimbursements for district expenditures on projects  reflecting state priorities, such as health and safety and decreasing  overcrowding, according to state officials. In two rural districts within two  states, district officials told us they cannot afford to undertake capital  projects without state funding, and therefore have to balance state  requirements with local needs and preferences for their facilities. For  example, one district in New Mexico opted to renovate an existing gym  using state matching funds, rather than fully replace it, because this  allowed the district to maintain existing square footage. According to  officials in that district, the state developed standards for how large a gym  can be and still receive state funding for a full replacement, and the  district prioritized renovating and maintaining the larger existing space  instead."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Third Party Views", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Department of Education  (Education) for review and comment.

For example, officials said the state  does not provide funding for designated classrooms for bilingual  education. Because the district does not have the local property tax base  to fund these spaces, officials said they must be creative with classes and  teacher schedules to provide bilingual education. The location of these  classes moves to different parts of the school at different times, meaning  that teachers cannot set up a stable classroom that is properly equipped  to teach bilingual education to students in the district, according to district  officials.", "None of the officials we interviewed in the eight districts that received  Impact Aid said their district used Basic Support payments to address  issues with the conditions of school facilities.

They described this as particularly risky because Impact  Aid appropriations levels are not guaranteed to remain consistent each  year. The representatives said if funding levels for Impact Aid are reduced  in the future, the districts would still have to pay back the borrowed funds  before allocating funding for other purposes such as general operations,  teacher salaries, educational materials, and other essentials for educating  students in the school district.", "On our state survey, eight states reported providing additional school  facilities funding or other assistance to districts in the state that receive  Impact Aid.

We previously reported that, in contrast to most traditional public schools,  many charter schools are responsible for financing their own buildings  and other facilities, i.e., charter school districts may not have access to  the same local funding mechanisms as traditional school districts. As a  result, charter schools vary in terms of whether they own their own  building or pay rent, and whether they operate in buildings originally  designed as a school or in buildings that have been redesigned for  educational purposes. Sometimes charter schools may also share space  in their building with others, such as non-profit organizations. In addition  to differences in facility access and finance, charter school governance  also varies. We previously reported that in some states, charter schools  function as their own school district, while in other states, charter schools  have the option to choose between being their own school district or part  of a larger school district.", "The data presented in this appendix are limited to the nongeneralizable  responses of the 52 charter school districts that responded to our survey  of school districts, unless otherwise noted. In addition, we visited five  charter schools across four states (California, Florida, Maryland, and  Rhode Island) as part of our school district site visits. This appendix  summarizes key information on the condition of and funding for school  facilities in these charter school districts and schools. Responses from  the nongeneralizable group of charter school districts were similar to the  generalizable results for all districts in the nation for key building updates,  as well as priorities for modernizing school facilities, but different for how  these districts access funding for school facilities."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Conditions of School Facilities", "paragraphs": ["The highest number of charter school districts (20 of 51) indicated  needing to update or replace heating, ventilation, and air conditioning  systems in the majority of their schools, followed by windows (16), roofing  (15), and interior light fixtures (15).", "School officials at a charter school we visited told us they were having  ongoing issues with several key building features, such as doors and  windows. The charter school rents their facility from the traditional school  district and has a lease that specifies who is responsible for certain  maintenance and repair projects. School officials told us the school has a  \u201cutilities-only\u201d lease, meaning they should not be responsible for any  repairs, but officials told us they had to take on several projects to make  the facility usable. Although the traditional school district\u2014of which this  charter school is a part\u2014is responsible for many of these projects, district  officials said they have not had the funding to address this. For example,  before the school opened, school officials said they had to install door  handles on interior doors and re-key the building so that they were able to  lock and unlock doors. In addition, school officials told us that teachers  have complained that windows are nailed shut and cannot be opened.", "Based on our school district survey, 24 of 52 charter school districts had  conducted a facilities condition assessment of their schools at least once  in the last 10 years. Of those 24 school districts, 19 reported assessing  schools at least every 5 years. Twenty-three charter school districts  reported conducting the assessment to assess safety and hazards.  Officials at four of the five charter schools we visited told us they were  responsible for maintaining their own facilities. The other charter school  we visited was part of a larger network of charter schools, and had  regional offices that assisted with facilities and operations.", "When updating or renovating school facilities, charter school districts  responding to our survey ranked security and technology as their highest  priorities, similar to the generalizable results for all districts in the nation.  The top reported priorities were student access to technology (44 of 52),  safety and security (43 of 51 districts), and telecommunication systems  such as WiFi (36 of 51). An official at a charter school we visited in  Florida said safety and security was one of their main focuses when  constructing the school. The school and parking lot are gated, and there  is a camera to monitor all cars and people entering the campus. School  officials told us that all classrooms and common areas are equipped with  phones that can broadcast announcements throughout the campus, and  that they have a lightening alert system so that they can move students  indoors if a storm is approaching."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Funding for School Facilities", "paragraphs": ["As previously noted, charter schools may or may not be part of a larger  school district, and may not be able to access local funding sources such  as property tax revenue. As noted in this report, property tax revenue was  the most common source of funding that all school districts reported using  for school facilities\u2014an estimated 77 percent of all districts nationwide  used property taxes for this purpose. Most charter school districts that  responded to our survey indicated that state funding was their primary  method of funding school facilities (32 of 49) and fewer (8 of 49) reported  local funding as their primary method. The most common local funding  mechanism that charter school districts reported using for facilities was  grant funding (20 of 46 districts), followed by public-private partnerships  (12 of 47 districts).", "A charter school we visited told us about several areas in their school that  they had improved with grants from non-profit organizations. For  example, a teacher at the school applied for a grant from a foundation to  replace the basketball hoops and paint in the gym, and a separate  organization had installed a new playground at the school.", "Based on our state survey, 26 states provide funding to charter schools  for facilities\u201422 states provide direct funding to charter schools and four  states provide funding to non-charter school districts, which would  indirectly fund certain charter schools. Of the 26 states, 20 states  reported doing so either through a funding formula, or a combination of  funding formula, charter school requests, and other methods. The most  common factor that states considered when determining levels of facilities  funding for charter schools was the size of the student population (12 of  25 states).
