According to the 2010 QDDR report, the elevation of this office to a bureau would enhance State's ability to, among other things, counter violent extremism, build foreign partner capacity, and engage in counterterrorism diplomacy. In addition, the report stated that the bureau's new status would enable more effective coordination with other U.S. government agencies.", "On the basis of preliminary results of ongoing work that GAO is conducting for this subcommittee and other congressional requesters, this testimony provides observations on (1) how the bureau's staffing resources have changed since 2011, (2) the extent to which the bureau has assessed its performance since 2011, and (3) the extent to which the bureau's coordination with U.S. government entities on select programs is in line with key collaboration practices. To conduct this work, GAO reviewed and analyzed State and other U.S. government agency information and interviewed U.S. government officials in Washington, D.C. GAO expects to issue a final report on this work in July 2015, along with any related recommendations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO's preliminary analysis shows that the Department of State's (State) Bureau of Counterterrorism has had an annual increase in authorized full-time equivalent (FTE) positions since fiscal year 2011 and has recently undertaken efforts to reduce a persistent staffing gap. The number of FTEs for the bureau increased from 66 in fiscal year 2011 to 96 in fiscal year 2015, and over the same period the percentage of FTE vacancies ranged from 17 to 23 percent. The vacancies have included both staff-level and management positions. During GAO's ongoing work, the bureau indicated that the gaps between authorized and filled positions were due to several factors. These included an increase in FTEs that the bureau was authorized when it was established and postponement of some staffing decisions until the Coordinator for Counterterrorism, who assumed her position in 2014, had sufficient time to assess the bureau's needs and priorities. The bureau has recently made progress in filling vacant positions and reported having 10 FTE vacancies as of the end of May 2015.", "GAO's preliminary analysis has found that the bureau assessed its progress toward achieving its foreign assistance-related goals but has not established time frames for addressing recommendations from program evaluations. Specifically, the bureau established indicators and targets for its foreign assistance-related goals identified in the bureau's first multiyear strategic plan, and it reported results achieved toward each indicator. Since its elevation to a bureau in fiscal year 2012, the bureau has also completed four evaluations of counterterrorism-related programs it oversees, resulting in 60 recommendations. GAO's preliminary results show that the bureau had addressed about half of the recommendations (28 of 60) as of April 2015 but had not established time frames for addressing the remaining recommendations.", "GAO's preliminary analysis has also found that the bureau's coordination within State and with other federal agencies on the Countering Violent Extremism and Counterterrorism Finance programs generally reflects key practices for collaboration. For example, with regard to identifying resources, in cases where the bureau funded other U.S. agencies partnering on these programs, the funding mechanism was clear and laid out in interagency agreements."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for the opportunity today to discuss our preliminary  observations from our ongoing work looking at the Department of State\u2019s  (State) Bureau of Counterterrorism (CT Bureau).", "Terrorism and violent extremism continue to pose a global threat, and  countering terrorism both at home and abroad remains a top priority for  the U.S. government. In 2010, the first Quadrennial Diplomacy and  Development Review (QDDR) conducted by State and the United States  Agency for International Development (USAID) focused on these global  threats by recommending that State\u2019s Office of the Coordinator for  Counterterrorism (CT Office) be elevated to a bureau. According to the  2010 QDDR report, the elevation of the CT Office to a bureau would  enhance State\u2019s ability to, among other things, counter violent extremism,  build foreign partner capacity, and engage in counterterrorism diplomacy.

We  also interviewed State officials from the CT Bureau, Office of Inspector  General, Office of U.S. Foreign Assistance Resources, and the Bureaus  of Human Resources, Comptroller and Global Financial Services,  Budgeting and Planning, and Administration. To assess the reliability of  the staffing data, we compared information provided by State with staffing  information in State\u2019s Congressional Budget Justifications and spoke to  State officials regarding the processes they use to collect and verify the  staffing data. Based on the checks we performed, we determined that  these data are sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this engagement.  To examine the extent to which the CT Bureau has assessed its  performance since 2011, we reviewed bureau strategic plans,  performance reports, program evaluation reports, and action plans for  evaluation recommendations, as well as State policy and guidance  documents outlining performance reporting and evaluation requirements  for bureaus. We also interviewed CT Bureau officials responsible for  strategic planning and program monitoring and evaluation and  interviewed or obtained written responses from State officials responsible  for overseeing implementation of State\u2019s performance reporting and  evaluation policies. To examine the extent to which the CT Bureau\u2019s  coordination with U.S. government entities on select programs is in line  with key collaboration practices, we reviewed agency documents and  interviewed officials from various State regional and functional bureaus;  from the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security, Justice, and the  Treasury; and from USAID, the National Counterterrorism Center, and the  United States Institute of Peace in Washington, D.C. We focused on the  CT Bureau\u2019s Countering Violent Extremism (CVE) and Counterterrorism  Finance (CTF) programs because these programs involve coordination  with large numbers of agencies and also represent strategic priorities for  the CT Bureau. We used GAO\u2019s key features of collaboration  mechanisms that agencies should consider when collaborating within and  across the U.S. government to evaluate the extent and nature of  collaboration between the CT Bureau and other bureaus within State and  other U.S. government agencies.", "Our preliminary analysis is based on our ongoing work, which is being  conducted in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

State elevated the CT Office to the  CT Bureau in January 2012. According to State, one reason for elevating  the CT Office to a bureau was that the office\u2019s responsibilities for  counterterrorism strategy, policy, operations, and programs had grown far  beyond the original coordinating mission. In the transition from CT Office  to CT Bureau in 2012, some initial organizational changes occurred, such  as a reduction from five to four Deputy Coordinators who oversee  counterterrorism issue areas within the bureau as well as the creation of  an executive office to provide management support to the bureau. The  initial organizational changes also elevated the role of strategic planning  and metrics and established a new policy and guidance unit.", "Our preliminary information shows that additional changes to the CT  Bureau\u2019s organizational structure occurred starting in 2014, after the  current Ambassador was confirmed as the Coordinator for  Counterterrorism in February 2014. According to bureau officials, the  Ambassador initiated a strategic review of the bureau\u2019s programs and  what they were accomplishing to help form a clear picture of priorities,  threats, and where the bureau\u2019s efforts and funding should be directed.  The strategic review, which was completed in November 2014, led to a  reorganization of the bureau and a shift in overall focus to a regional or  geographic approach. As a result of the strategic review, the portfolio of  the CT Bureau\u2019s Office of Programs has changed to reflect a more  regional approach rather than an approach based on funding streams.  According to CT Bureau officials, the shift is intended to encourage and  facilitate cross-bureau discussions across the entire CT Bureau.  Specifically, the portfolios of program officials have been broadened by  requiring a cross-cutting look at programs across their assigned region.  Figure 1 shows how the CT Office has evolved over the last two decades.", "Our preliminary information shows other changes to the bureau\u2019s  organizational structure stemming from the strategic review, such as the  changes in names of directorates and offices, their portfolios, or both to  better reflect the new strategic approach and priorities of the bureau. For  example, the portfolio for the multilateral affairs office was shifted and  combined with the portfolio for the regional affairs office. In addition, a  new office and two new units were created: (1) the Office of Strategy,  Plans, and Initiatives; (2) the Foreign Terrorist Fighters Unit; and (3) the  Countering Violent Extremism Unit.
