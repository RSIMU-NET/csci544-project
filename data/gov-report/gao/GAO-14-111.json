These contractors are to identify potential fraud, investigate it thoroughly and in a timely manner, and take swift action, such as working to revoke suspect providers' Medicare billing privileges and referring potentially fraudulent providers to law enforcement.", "GAO examined (1) ZPIC contract costs and how ZPICs use those funds, (2) the results of ZPICs' work, and (3) the results of CMS's evaluations of ZPICs' performance and aspects of CMS's evaluation practices. To do this, GAO examined ZPIC funding, contracts, and related documents; data on ZPICs' workloads, investigations, and results; and CMS evaluations of ZPICs as well as federal standards for performance measurement. GAO also interviewed CMS and ZPIC officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) paid its Zone Program Integrity Contractors (ZPIC) about $108 million in 2012.

ZPICs also reported taking other actions to protect Medicare funds, including having more than 130 of their investigations accepted by law enforcement for potential prosecution, and working to stop more than 160 providers from receiving additional Medicare payments in 2012. However, CMS lacks information on the timeliness of ZPICs' actions--such as the time it takes between identifying a suspect provider and taking actions to stop that provider from receiving potentially fraudulent Medicare payments--and would benefit from knowing if ZPICs could save more money by acting more quickly.", "ZPICs generally received good ratings in annual reviews, with five of six eligible for incentive awards. CMS follows some best practices for ZPICs' oversight, but the agency does not clearly link ZPIC performance to agency program integrity goals. The majority of the measures CMS uses to evaluate ZPICs relate to the quality of their work because, according to CMS officials, quality is the most important element. However, evaluation of such measures, while a best practice, does not connect ZPIC work to agency performance measures. For example, CMS aims to increase the percentage of actions taken against certain high risk Medicare providers--work central to ZPICs--but does not explicitly link ZPICs' work to the agency's progress toward that goal, another best practice that would allow the agency to better assess the ZPICs' support of CMS's fraud prevention efforts."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that CMS collect and evaluate information on the timeliness of ZPICs' investigative and administrative actions, and develop ZPIC performance measures that explicitly link ZPICs' work to Medicare program integrity performance measures and goals.

This  report examines (1) ZPIC contract costs and how ZPICs use those funds,  (2) the results of ZPICs\u2019 work, and (3) the results of CMS\u2019s evaluations of  ZPICs\u2019 performance and aspects of CMS\u2019s evaluation practices.", "To determine ZPIC contract costs and how ZPICs use those funds, we  analyzed ZPICs\u2019 financial data from CMS\u2019s Analysis, Reporting, and  Tracking System (ARTS), an online system ZPICs use to submit invoices  and report workload statistics and that CMS uses to track and analyze  ZPIC workload, performance, and production; and interviewed ZPIC  officials on how they use their funds. To examine the six ZPICs\u2019 results,  we analyzed calendar year 2012 data from CMS ARTS and the Fraud  Investigation Database (FID). These included data on the source of  investigations and the actions taken against suspect providers. We  interviewed officials from the operational ZPICs and CMS, as well as HHS  OIG.

In particular, HIPAA required the  Secretary of HHS to enter into contracts to promote the integrity of the  Medicare program. In exercising its authority to identify and combat  improper payments, CMS created 18 Program Safeguard Contractors  (PSC) to identify and investigate potential fraud in specific parts of  Medicare, such as Part A, in particular states or regions.", "In 2008, as part of the implementation of broader agency contracting  reform, CMS began replacing PSCs with ZPICs, reducing the total  number of contractors and giving additional responsibilities to ZPICs to  investigate potential fraud across the Medicare fee-for-service program.  In September 2008, CMS awarded the first two ZPIC contracts for   Zones 4 and 7. As of September 2013, all but one of the ZPICs\u2014  Zone 6\u2014was in operation. PSCs continue to operate in Zone 6 because  of protest-related delays with respect to the Zone 6 ZPIC contract. The  term of each ZPIC contract is generally for a 1-year base period followed  by 4 option years, enabling CMS to extend each contract through 5 years  of performance. (See table 1 for contract performance timelines and   fig. 1 for a map of the seven ZPIC zones.)", "In 2010, CMS established the Center for Program Integrity (CPI), which  oversees the agency\u2019s program integrity efforts, including ZPICs. CPI\u2019s  stated mission is to ensure that correct payments are made to legitimate  providers for covered, appropriate, and reasonable services for eligible  beneficiaries. CPI has undertaken an effort to try to move beyond the  \u201cpay and chase\u201d approach\u2014which focused on the recovery of funds lost  due to payments of fraudulent claims\u2014to focusing on fraud prevention.  To enhance these efforts, the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010  appropriated funds for and required CMS to implement predictive  analytics technologies, which are automated systems and tools that can  help identify patterns of potentially fraudulent claims before they are  paid. In turn, CMS developed the Fraud Prevention System (FPS), an  electronic system in which Medicare claims data are compared against  models of potentially fraudulent behavior to identify and prioritize for  investigation providers with aberrant billing patterns. As part of  implementing FPS, CPI modified ZPICs\u2019 work. They are to continue to  investigate and quickly initiate actions to protect Medicare, but are also  charged with investigating certain referrals from FPS."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Investigating and Acting on Potential Fraud", "paragraphs": ["To detect and investigate potential fraud within each zone, ZPICs develop  leads, investigate them, and initiate appropriate actions against suspect  providers, suppliers, and others. ZPICs do this with teams of  investigators, data analysts, and medical reviewers. Investigators perform  a range of actions to examine potential fraud, including conducting  provider audits, making site visits to suspect providers\u2019 offices, and  interviewing Medicare beneficiaries. Data analysts, including statisticians,  examine Medicare claims and other data to support investigations and  search for potential fraud and new schemes. Medical reviewers, primarily  nurses, provide clinical knowledge to support the work of investigators  and data analysts.", "ZPICs identify potential targets for fraud investigations using three  categories of sources:  1.  Reactive sources. Reactive sources are notifications of potential fraud  submitted to ZPICs, which may result in a ZPIC conducting an  investigation. A number of entities refer potential fraud to ZPICs for  investigation. These entities include Medicare Administrative  Contractors (MAC), which examine their contacts with beneficiaries  for indications of potential fraud and may forward the contacts to  ZPICs for additional scrutiny. In addition, HHS OIG operates a fraud  hotline and may refer calls from it to the MACs for initial screening and  then to the ZPICs for further investigation. Other sources include  investigations ZPICs receive directly from CMS.  2.  Proactive sources. ZPICs are required to maintain at least 3 years of  Medicare claims data for analysts to examine for potential fraud using  a variety of analytic tools and methods. For example, analysts  examining these data may identify providers that, compared with their  peers, have aberrant billing patterns, which can indicate potentially  fraudulent behavior. If analysts identify such patterns, those findings  may result in a ZPIC investigation.  3.  FPS. FPS identifies providers for ZPICs to investigate, with the goal of  identifying aberrant billing patterns early so that ZPICs can investigate  suspect providers before they generate large amounts of potentially  fraudulent claims.", "ZPICs prioritize their investigations according to CMS guidance, which  states that ZPICs should give priority to investigations with the greatest  program impact and/or urgency. CMS\u2019s Program Integrity Manual defines  such investigations as those involving patient abuse or harm, multistate  fraud, high dollar amounts of potential overpayments, likely increase in  the amount of fraud or enlarged pattern of fraud, and complaints made by  Medicare supplemental insurers. In addition, with the implementation of  FPS in July 2011, CMS directed the ZPICs to investigate certain high-risk  leads from that system.", "As part of their investigations, ZPICs initiate administrative actions  against Medicare providers or suppliers, coordinating with CMS and  MACs to carry out those actions, which may result in Medicare savings.  (See table 2 for the administrative actions ZPICs may initiate as part of  their investigations.) For example, ZPICs may initiate payment  suspensions that allow CMS to stop payment on suspect claims and  prevent the payment of future claims until an investigation is resolved. In  addition, a ZPIC may recommend to CMS that the agency revoke a  provider\u2019s Medicare billing privileges and will coordinate with a MAC to  implement that action following CMS approval. In addition to  administrative actions, ZPICs may forward vulnerabilities identified  during an investigation to CMS for consideration as possible local or  national prepayment edits.", "In addition to administrative actions, if a ZPIC investigation uncovers  suspected instances of fraud, the ZPIC must refer the investigation to  HHS OIG for further examination and, if HHS OIG declines to investigate,  the ZPIC may refer the issue to the FBI or any other interested law  enforcement entity, such as a U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office. A ZPIC investigation  that is referred to and accepted by law enforcement for further exploration  and potential prosecution is then called a case. As long as law  enforcement entities have not closed a case, it is considered open by  both law enforcement and ZPICs.", "CMS also requires ZPICs to support HHS OIG, the Department of Justice  (DOJ), and other law enforcement entities with their Medicare fraud  investigations. This support can be for these entities\u2019 own, independently  initiated cases, or for those that ZPICs initiated and then referred to law  enforcement. ZPICs provide support on ZPIC-initiated and non-ZPIC- initiated cases by responding to law enforcement requests for information.

Fee-for-service program integrity work. ZPICs are to identify and  investigate potential fraud in Medicare fee-for-service. The contracts  for this work outline four categories of investigations: Part A, Part B,  durable medical equipment (DME), and home health and hospice.  Although DME providers and home health and hospice suppliers  provide services covered under Medicare Parts A and B, the ZPIC  contracts identify them separately and ZPICs track their fee-for- service program integrity work based on these four categories.  2.  Medicare-Medicaid Data Match Program (Medi-Medi). Medi-Medi is a  joint effort between CMS and states to identify providers with aberrant  Medicare and Medicaid billing patterns through analyses of claims  for individuals with both Medicare and Medicaid coverage. States  participate voluntarily and ZPIC Medi-Medi work and funding is  dependent on the number of states, if any, actively participating in  each zone.  3.  Special projects. CMS may also fund ZPICs for special zone- or fraud- specific projects. Special projects can vary in duration and can be as  short as several months or run for multiple years.", "The total award amount for the six operating ZPIC contracts through all  option years is more than $600 million. Of that amount, $411 million is for  fee-for-service program integrity work, $169 million is for Medi-Medi, and  $62 million is for special zone- and fraud-specific projects over the life of  the contracts. (See fig. 2.) The contract award amounts for the   six operating ZPIC contracts (inclusive of option years) range from   $67 million to $182 million, which reflects variations between the zones in  terms of their size, exposure to fraud risk, and receipt of special projects.  For example, Zone 7 covers a geographically small area comprising one  state and one territory, but is an area CMS considers to be at high risk for  fraud. In comparison, Zone 2 is a geographically large but predominantly  rural area comprising 14 states and including areas that may be at a  lower risk of fraud. In addition, although not all ZPICs currently receive  funding for a special project, all six operating ZPICs have at some time  received such funding. For example, one ZPIC was awarded almost $50  million for an ongoing state-specific fraud hotline and another received  almost $3 million for a completed project specifically examining potential  fraud among home health providers.", "CMS primarily oversees ZPICs through the coordinated efforts of CPI and  the Office of Acquisition and Grants Management (OAGM). The ZPIC  Contracting Officer in OAGM is responsible for ensuring effective  contracting, and the Contracting Officer\u2019s Representatives (COR) are in  CPI. Each ZPIC is assigned a different COR, who helps oversee ZPIC  contractor compliance through ongoing reviews. Among other things, the  CORs use CMS ARTS to review their ZPICs\u2019 monthly invoices and  aggregate workload, such as the total number of new investigations,  administrative actions, and dollar amounts recouped in a month.", "Each ZPIC contract includes award fee provisions, which give contractors  the opportunity to earn all or some of the award fee allowed under their  contracts, depending on their level of performance. CMS evaluates each  ZPIC\u2019s performance annually and determines how much of its award fees  it will receive. CMS first evaluates whether a ZPIC is eligible for an award  fee. For these reviews, CMS instructs its CORs on how to assess  specific areas of their ZPICs\u2019 performance by interviewing ZPIC and other  staff; reviewing a sample of open and closed investigations and cases, as  well as other documents; reviewing data in CMS ARTS, FID, and other  systems; and making observations during ZPIC site visits. If in this review  CMS finds that a ZPIC meets certain performance thresholds, the CORs  move to the second step: using their annual review findings to  recommend the amount of award fees a ZPIC should receive. The ZPICs\u2019  contracts specify through Award Fee Plans the criteria against which  CMS will measure ZPICs\u2019 performance to earn their fees. These criteria  fall into two overarching areas: (1) quality of service measures that apply  to all ZPICs, worth 60 percent of the award fee, and (2) ZPIC-specific  plans drafted in the prior year by each ZPIC and approved by CMS on  how the ZPIC will improve its administrative actions\u2014Award Fee  Administrative Action Plans\u2014worth 40 percent.

In addition, ZPICs reported  completing almost 1,800 requests for information for cases initiated by  law enforcement and almost 700 for cases that had been initiated by  ZPICs, primarily for data analysis. ZPICs also reported that, as a result of  their cases being accepted and prosecuted by law enforcement,  convicted providers were ordered to pay almost $80 million in court- determined fines, settlements, and/or restitutions. Cases can also result  in prison sentences and other actions, though CMS does not  consistently track those outcomes. ZPICs are to track information on the  results of their cases in FID, but the system contains few outcomes. CMS  officials said that they are aware of this issue and have taken steps to  both improve ZPICs\u2019 use of FID and integrate the system with CMS ARTS  and other systems to improve the data in FID. As of August 2013, CMS  officials reported that the agency was testing the integration of the  systems and expected the integration to be completed by late 2013.", "According to CMS, ZPICs are to take immediate action to protect  Medicare funds, but CMS may be missing opportunities for additional  savings to Medicare because the agency lacks information on the  timeliness of certain ZPIC actions. ZPIC officials reported taking actions  and preventing potentially fraudulent payments before they were made, in  line with CMS fraud strategies, and CMS ARTS data show ZPICs  implementing some aspects of these strategies. For example, ZPIC  officials reported focusing on prepayment reviews of claims\u2014preventing  potentially fraudulent payments\u2014and 2012 CMS ARTS data showed that,  of the providers whom ZPICs reviewed in 2012, almost five times as  many had their claims reviewed on a prepayment basis rather than a  postpayment basis.

CMS officials said that this portion of the award fee is  intended to encourage ZPICs to develop more innovative ways to take  administrative actions.", "CMS follows some best practices for its oversight of ZPICs, but does not  clearly link ZPIC performance to agency performance measures and  goals. The award fee evaluations allow CMS to assess key elements of  ZPICs\u2019 work, which follows federal best practices. Federal standards state  that performance measures may address the type or level of program  activities conducted (process), the direct products and services delivered  by a program (outputs), or the results of those products and services  (outcomes). CMS\u2019s measures evaluate ZPICs\u2019 processes and outputs,  but not their outcomes. Moreover, these performance measures do not  connect ZPIC work to agency performance measures that are linked to its  goals, which is another best practice. One way that agencies examine the  effectiveness of their programs is by measuring performance as required  by the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA), as  amended by the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010. One of CMS\u2019s  GPRA goals is to fight fraud and work to eliminate improper payments.  Within that goal are two Medicare fee-for-service performance measures  for determining progress toward that goal, and CMS officials reported that  ZPICs are the primary actors for one of the measures: increasing the  percentage of providers who are identified as high risk against whom  CMS takes administrative actions. CMS\u2019s fiscal year 2014 target for this  performance measure is to increase the percentage of administrative  actions taken for these high-risk providers from 27 percent to 36 percent.  Federal standards state that entities should link performance  measurements to goals and objectives, and previous GAO work found  that leading organizations try to link the goals and performance measures  for each organizational level to successive levels and ultimately to the  organization\u2019s strategic goals.none of the ZPICs\u2019 performance measures link to the agency\u2019s measures  of increasing the percentage of administrative actions taken against high- risk providers, or to the other Medicare fee-for-service program integrity  performance measure of reducing improper payments. Some ZPICs had  goals in their Award Fee Administrative Action Plans related to the  agency\u2019s performance measures\u2014for example, one ZPIC set a goal of  increasing the value of its referrals of overpayments, which could reduce  improper payments\u2014but these were zone-specific and do not allow CMS  to evaluate the overall impact of ZPICs on agency measures and,  ultimately, goals. CMS officials told us in April 2013 that they are revising  the ZPIC Award Fee Plans, but based on a draft of the revisions and  discussions with CMS officials, the revised plans will continue to lack  measures related to outcomes and will not tie performance to agency  program integrity measures or goals. difficult and setting targets can be problematic, CMS could explicitly link  ZPICs\u2019 work to the agency\u2019s progress toward meeting its performance  measures and goals. Specifically, CMS officials reported that they are  using FPS to identify and track high-risk providers for the performance  measure of increasing the number of administrative actions taken against  those providers. Although ZPICs are the primary users of FPS and have  primary responsibility for initiating administrative actions, CMS does not  link ZPICs\u2019 use of FPS to that measure, hindering the agency\u2019s ability to  effectively oversee its progress toward meeting its goal of fighting fraud  and working to eliminate improper payments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Given the vulnerability of the Medicare program to fraud and the lack of  reliable estimates of the extent of fraud in the program, determining how  well CMS is carrying out its fraud prevention strategy is a vital, if  challenging, task. ZPICs, which are central to that strategy, reported that  their efforts have yielded positive results, such as savings greater than  their contract costs and multiple other actions that helped protect  Medicare from potentially fraudulent providers, such as referring suspect  providers to law enforcement. Yet little is known about how expeditiously  ZPICs take action to save Medicare funds\u2014an important consideration  given that the longer a fraud scheme operates, the greater the potential  financial losses. As a result, CMS would benefit from enhancing its  collection and evaluation of information on the timeliness of ZPICs\u2019  actions, including information on whether new tools or strategies have  increased the speed with which ZPICs investigate potentially fraudulent  providers or initiate administrative actions. In addition, as CMS attempts  to achieve its agencywide program integrity goal of fighting fraud and  eliminating improper payments in the Medicare program, it would benefit  from knowing how ZPICs are contributing to efforts to achieve this goal.  By linking the evaluation of ZPICs\u2019 work to the agency\u2019s program integrity  performance measures\u2014in particular the performance measure focused  on administrative actions, which are a significant portion of ZPICs\u2019 work\u2014 CMS would have greater assurance that its ZPIC activities are  appropriately supporting CMS fraud prevention efforts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["To help ensure that CMS\u2019s fraud prevention activities are effective and  that CMS is comprehensively assessing ZPIC performance, the  Administrator of CMS should take the following two actions:", "Collect and evaluate information on the timeliness of ZPICs\u2019  investigative and administrative actions, such as how soon  investigations are initiated after ZPICs identify potential fraud and how  swiftly ZPICs initiate administrative actions after identifying potentially  fraudulent providers.", "Develop ZPIC performance measures that explicitly link their work to  the agency\u2019s Medicare fee-for-service program integrity performance  measures and targets for its GPRA goal of fighting fraud and working  to eliminate improper payments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We requested comments from HHS, but none were provided.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.

Specifically, we examined aggregated ZPIC invoices and workload  statistics that specified how ZPICs allocate their funds, and interviewed  ZPIC officials to confirm these data.

We reviewed CMS guidance on how ZPICs should prioritize their  work and how to conduct investigations. We interviewed officials from the  CMS Center for Program Integrity about how they review and track ZPIC  administrative actions and their process of approval for actions, such as  revocations.
