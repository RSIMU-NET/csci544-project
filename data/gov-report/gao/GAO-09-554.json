Many scientists and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)--a United Nations organization that assesses scientific, technical, and economic information on climate change--believe these gases may negatively affect the earth's climate. Given forecasts of growth in aviation emissions, some governments are taking steps to reduce emissions. In response to a congressional request, GAO reviewed (1) estimates of aviation's current and future contribution to greenhouse gas and other emissions that may affect climate change; (2) existing and potential technological and operational improvements that can reduce aircraft emissions; and (3) policy options for governments to help address commercial aircraft emissions. GAO conducted a literature review; interviewed representatives of government agencies, industry and environmental organizations, airlines, and manufacturers, and interviewed and surveyed 18 experts in economics and aviation on improvements for reducing emissions from aircraft. GAO is not making recommendations. Relevant agencies provided technical comments which we incorporated as appropriate and EPA said emissions standards can have a positive benefit to cost ratio and be an important part of policy options to control emissions."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["According to IPCC, aviation currently accounts for about 2 percent of human-generated global carbon dioxide emissions, the most significant greenhouse gas--and about 3 percent of the potential warming effect of global emissions that can affect the earth's climate, including carbon dioxide. IPCC's medium-range estimate forecasts that by 2050 the global aviation industry, including aircraft emissions, will emit about 3 percent of global carbon dioxide emissions and about 5 percent of the potential warming effect of all global human-generated emissions. Gross domestic product growth is the primary driver in IPCC's forecasts. IPCC also made other assumptions about future aircraft fuel efficiency, improvements in air traffic management, and airport and runway capacity. IPCC's 2050 forecasts for aviation's contribution to global emissions assumed that emissions from other sectors will continue to grow. If other sectors make progress in reducing emissions and aviation emissions continue to grow, aviation's relative contribution may be greater than IPCC estimated; on the other hand, if other sectors do not make progress, aviation's relative contribution may be smaller than estimated. While airlines currently rely on a range of improvements, such as fuel-efficient engines, to reduce emissions, some of which may have limited potential to generate future reductions, experts we surveyed expect a number of additional technological, operational, and alternative fuel improvements to help reduce aircraft emissions in the future. However, according to experts we interviewed, some technologies, such as advanced airframes, have potential, but may be years away from being available, and developing and adopting them is likely to be costly. In addition, according to some experts we interviewed, incentives for industry to research and adopt low-emissions technologies will be dependent to some extent on the level and stability of fuel prices. Finally, given expected growth of commercial aviation as forecasted by IPCC, even if many of these improvements are adopted, it appears unlikely they would greatly reduce emissions by 2050. A number of policy options to address aircraft emissions are available to governments and can be part of broader policies to address emissions from many sources including aircraft. Market-based measures can establish a price for emissions and provide incentives to airlines and consumers to reduce emissions. These measures can be preferable to other options because they would generally be more economically efficient. Such measures include a cap-and-trade program, in which government places a limit on emissions from regulated sources, provides them with allowances for emissions, and establishes a market for them to trade emissions allowances with one another, and a tax on emissions. Governments can establish emissions standards for aircraft or engines. In addition, government could increase government research and development to encourage development of low-emissions improvements."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Many sources, including manufacturing, residential, and transportation  sources, emit greenhouse gases that contribute to the accumulation of  these gases in the earth\u2019s atmosphere. Greenhouse gases disperse and trap  heat in the earth\u2019s atmosphere. This heat-trapping effect, known as the  greenhouse effect, moderates atmospheric and surface temperatures,  keeping the earth warm enough to support life. However, according to the  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)\u2014a United Nations  organization that assesses scientific, technical, and economic information  on the effects of climate change\u2014global atmospheric concentrations of  these greenhouse gases have increased markedly as a result of human  activities over the past 200 years, contributing to a warming of the earth\u2019s  climate.

Airlines have a  financial incentive to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, as those emissions  are a direct result of fuel burn, which represents a large portion of their  operating costs\u2014about 30 percent for U.S. airlines in 2008. Some experts  expect aviation to grow at a fast rate until 2021, when the Federal Aviation  Administration (FAA) forecasts that U.S. domestic commercial aviation  will serve over 1 billion passengers a year. While the current economic  downturn could delay this growth somewhat, experts believe that growth  in the aviation sector means greater productivity and mobility, but is also  likely to increase emissions. To counteract expected increases in  emissions, many governments and international organizations have set  goals for future emissions reductions. For example, a number of  developed countries have set a goal to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by  50 percent by 2050. In addition, the Kyoto Protocol, an international  agreement to minimize the adverse effects of climate change, set binding  targets for the reduction of greenhouse gases for 37 industrialized  countries and the European Economic Community (EEC) to achieve  during the 2008 through 2012 commitment period. Although the United  States is a signatory to the Kyoto Protocol, it is not bound by its terms or  emissions target because it has not ratified the Protocol. The Protocol also  requires industrialized nations and the EEC to pursue \u201climitations or  reduction of emissions of greenhouses gases\u2026 from aviation\u2026 working  through the International Civil Aviation Organization.\u201d Finally, some  governments have taken actions designed to control aviation emissions.  For example, in 2003, the European Union (EU) established a cap-and- trade program known as the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) to  control carbon dioxide emissions from various energy and industrial  sectors. The EU ETS was first implemented in 2005 and was amended in  2008 to include aviation. Beginning in 2012, the ETS will include all  covered flights into or out of an EU airport.", "You asked us to provide information on aviation emissions of greenhouse  gases and other emissions that may affect climate change. To do so, we  identified (1) aviation\u2019s current and estimated future contribution to the  emissions of greenhouse gases and other emissions that may affect climate  change, (2) existing and potential future technological and operational  improvements that the commercial aviation industry can use to reduce  commercial aircraft emissions, and (3) policy options for the U.S.  government and other governments to help reduce commercial aviation  emissions and the potential costs and benefits of each option. You also  asked that we describe the EU\u2019s plans to add the aviation industry to its  existing ETS and the potential legal implications of doing so. (See app. I  for this description.) To address these objectives, we reviewed studies on  the impact of aviation on climate change. We also collaborated with the  National Academy of Sciences to identify and recruit experts with  experience in climate change and the aviation industry. We interviewed 18  such experts (see app. II for a list of the experts). After these interviews,  we asked the experts to complete a survey in which they assessed a list of  options to reduce emissions on a variety of predetermined factors, such as  potential for emissions reductions and costs (see app. III for complete  results). In addition, we spoke with government, airline, and interest group  officials in the United States, the EU, and the United Kingdom, focusing on  commercial aviation.

During flight operations, aircraft emit a number of greenhouse gas  and other emissions, including carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides (NOx),  soot, and water vapor. Figure 1 shows the primary emissions from  commercial aircraft. Carbon dioxide emissions from aircraft are a direct  result of fuel burn. For every gallon of jet fuel burned, about 21 pounds of  carbon dioxide are emitted. Reducing the amount of fuel burned,  therefore, also reduces the amount of carbon dioxide emitted. Water vapor  emissions and certain atmospheric temperature and humidity conditions  can lead to the formation of contrails, a cloudlike trail of condensed water  vapor, and can induce the creation of cirrus clouds. Both contrails and  cirrus clouds are believed to have a warming effect on the earth\u2019s  atmosphere. Aircraft also emit other pollutants that affect local air quality.  Finally, airport operations are sources of greenhouse gas and other  emissions, which we are not examining in this report.", "Historically, the commercial aviation industry has grown substantially in  the United States and worldwide and is a contributor to economic growth.  Between 1981 and 2008, passenger traffic increased 226 percent in the  United States on a revenue passenger mile basis and 257 percent globally  on a revenue passenger kilometer basis. According to the FAA, in 2006  the civil aviation industry in the United States directly and indirectly  contributed 11 million jobs and 5.6 percent of total gross domestic product  (GDP) to the U.S. economy. Globally, the International Air Transport  Association estimated that in 2007 the aviation industry had a global  economic impact of over $3.5 trillion, equivalent to about 7.5 percent of  worldwide GDP. Recently, however, the airline industry has experienced  declining traffic and financial losses as the result of the current recession.", "The fuel efficiency of commercial jet aircraft has improved over time.  According to IPCC, aircraft today are about 70 percent more fuel efficient  on a per passenger kilometer basis than they were 40 years ago because of  improvements in engines and airframe design. The cost of jet fuel is a  large cost for airlines. In the 2008, when global fuel prices were high, jet  fuel accounted for about 30 percent of U.S. airlines\u2019 total operating  expenses, compared with 23 percent during 2007. Fuel efficiency  (measured by available seat-miles per gallon consumed) for U.S. carriers  increased about 17 percent between 1990 and 2008, as shown in figure 2.  Internationally, according to the International Air Transport Association,  fuel efficiency (measured by revenue passenger kilometers) improved 16.5  percent between 2001 and 2007. According to FAA, between 2000 and  early 2008 U.S. airlines reduced fuel burn and emissions while transporting  more passengers and cargo.", "In addition, commercial aviation has become less energy intensive over  time\u2014that is, to transport a single passenger a single mile uses less energy  than it previously did, measured in British thermal units.

IPCC releases and periodically updates estimates of future  greenhouse gas emissions from human activities under different economic  development scenarios. In 1999, IPCC released its report, Aviation and the  Global Atmosphere, conducted at the request of the International Civil  Aviation Organization (ICAO)\u2014a United Nations organization that aims  to promote the establishment of international civilian aviation standards  and recommended practices and procedures. In 2007, IPCC released an  update on emissions from transportation and other sectors called the  Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate  Change. These reports were developed with input from over 300 experts  worldwide and are internationally accepted and used for policy-making.", "A variety of federal agencies have roles in addressing aviation emissions.  In 2004, FAA and other organizations including the National Aeronautics  and Space Administration (NASA) released a report, Aviation and the  Environment: A National Vision Statement, Framework for Goals and  Recommended Actions, through the collaborative PARTNER program,  stating a general goal to reduce overall levels of emissions from  commercial aviation and proposing actions to deal with aviation  emissions. FAA also is involved in a number of emissions-reduction  initiatives\u2014including work on low-emissions technologies and low-carbon  alternative fuels; the implementation of a new air traffic management  system, the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen); and  climate research to better understand the impact of emissions from  aviation. NASA has been involved in research that has led to the  development of technologies that reduce aircraft emissions. Currently,  NASA\u2019s Subsonic Fixed-Wing project, part of its Fundamental Aeronautics  program, aims to help develop technologies to reduce fuel burn, noise, and  emissions in the future. Both FAA and NASA are involved in the Aviation  Climate Change Research Initiative, whose goals include improving the  scientific understanding of aviation\u2019s impact on climate change. Also, as  mandated under Title II of the Clean Air Act, the Environmental Protection  Agency (EPA) promulgates certain emissions standards for aircraft and  aircraft engines and has adopted emission standards matching those for  aircraft set by ICAO. While neither ICAO nor EPA has established  standards for aircraft engine emissions of carbon dioxide, ICAO is  currently discussing proposals for carbon dioxide emissions standards and  considering a global goal for fuel efficiency. In addition, in 2007 a  coalition of environmental interest groups filed a petition with EPA asking  the agency, pursuant to the Clean Air Act, to make a finding that  \u201cgreenhouse gas emissions from aircraft engines may be reasonably  anticipated to endanger the public health and welfare\u201d and, after making  this endangerment finding, promulgate regulations for greenhouse gas  emissions from aircraft engines.", "International concerns about the contribution of human activities to global  climate change have led to several efforts to reduce their impact. In 1992,  the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  (UNFCCC)\u2014a multilateral treaty whose objective is to stabilize  greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would  prevent dangerous human interference with the climate system\u2014was  signed. By 1995, the parties to the UNFCCC, including the United States,  realized that progress toward this goal was not sufficient. In December  1997, the parties reconvened in Kyoto, Japan, to adopt binding measures  to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Under the resulting Kyoto Protocol,  which the United States has not ratified, industrialized nations committed  to reduce or limit their emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse  gases during the 2008 through 2012 commitment period. The Protocol  directed the industrialized nations to work through ICAO to reduce or  limit emissions from aviation, but international aviation emissions are not  explicitly included in Kyoto\u2019s targets. In 2004, ICAO endorsed the further  development of an open emissions trading system for international  aviation, and in 2007 called for mutual agreement between contracting  states before implementation of an emissions trading scheme. In part to  meet its Kyoto Protocol requirements, the EU implemented its ETS in  2005, which sets a cap on carbon dioxide emissions and allows regulated  entities to buy and sell emissions allowances with one another. In 2008,  the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union passed a  directive, or law, to include aviation in the ETS. Under the directive,  beginning in 2012 a cap will be placed on total carbon dioxide emissions  from all covered flights by aircraft operators into or out of an EU airport.  Many stakeholders and countries have stated objections to the EU\u2019s plans  and legal challenges are possible. (See app. I for a discussion of the ETS\u2019s  inclusion of aviation.)

While the production and use of  biofuels result in greenhouse gas emissions, the extent to which they  provide a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions depends on whether their  emissions on an energy-content basis are less than those resulting from  the production and use of fossil fuels. To date, some assessments of  biofuels have shown a potential reduction in greenhouse gas emissions  when compared with fossil fuels, such as jet fuel. However, researchers  have not agreed on the best approach for determining the greenhouse gas  effects of biofuels and the magnitude of any greenhouse gas reductions  attributable to their production and use. FAA, EPA, and U.S. Air Force  officials we met with said that quantifying the life-cycle emission of  biofuels is difficult, but work in this area is currently under way. For  example, according to EPA, the agency has developed a comprehensive  methodology to determine the life-cycle emissions, including both direct  and indirect emissions, of a range of biofuels. This methodology, which  involved extensive coordination with experts outside of and across the  federal government, was included in the recent notice of proposed  rulemaking on the renewable fuel standard.

However, many experts claim that some of these crops are unsuitable for  use as biofuels because they may have negative environmental and  economic consequences, such as potentially reducing the supply and  quality of water, reducing air quality and biodiversity, and limiting global  food supplies. For example, cultivating palm for biofuel production might  lead to deforestation, thereby increasing both greenhouse gas emissions  and habitat loss. In addition, jatropha has been identified as an invasive  species in some regions and, because of its aggressive growth, may have  the potential to reduce available habitat for native species. According to  experts we met with, algae, on the other hand, are seen as a potentially  viable source: they can be grown using saltwater and in a variety of other  environments.

The cost of current algae conversion technology has, for  example raised obstacles to the commercial-scale production needed to  obtain significant supplies in the future. Given that future alternative fuels  will have many uses, airlines will compete with other sources, including  road transportation, for those limited supplies. Compared with the market  for ground transport, the market for fuels for commercial aviation is small,  leading some experts to believe that fuel companies are more likely to  focus their biofuel efforts on the ground transport market than on the  commercial aviation market. Some experts we met with said that given the  relatively small size of the market, limited biofuel supplies should be  devoted to road transportation since road transportation is the largest  contributor of emissions from the transportation sector.", "A large number of industry and government participants, including  airlines, fuel producers, and manufacturers, are currently conducting  research and development on alternative fuels for aircraft.

The price of fuel as a factor in providing an incentive  for the development and adoption of low-emission technologies is seen in  some historical examples in NASA research. While winglets were first  developed through a NASA research program in the 1970s, they were not  used commercially until a few years ago when higher fuel prices justified  their price. Additionally, although NASA currently is sponsoring research  into open rotor engines, the agency also did so in the 1980s in response to  high fuel prices.

For example, the U.S. airline industry lost  about $3.7 billion in 2008, and while analysts are uncertain about its  profitability 2009, some analysts predict industry profits of around $4  billion to $10 billion. In addition, Boeing has reported a number of recent  cancellations of orders for the fuel-efficient 787 Dreamliner. According to  one expert we met with, when airlines are low on cash, they are unlikely  to undertake improvements that will reduce their fuel consumption and  emissions, even if the savings from fuel reductions will ultimately be  greater than the cost of the improvement because they have so little cash.

One expert we met with did a rough estimate of  future emissions from aircraft assuming the adoption of many low-carbon  technologies such as blended wing-body, operational improvements, and  biofuels. He used IPCC\u2019s midrange forecast of emissions to 2050 as a  baseline for future traffic and found that even assuming the introduction  of these technologies, global emissions in 2050 would continue to exceed  2000 emissions levels.

In this way, the market would establish an allowance  price, which would represent the price of carbon dioxide (or other  greenhouse gas) emissions. Generally, according to economists, by  allowing sources to trade allowances, policy makers can achieve  emissions reductions at the lowest cost.", "A cap-and-trade program can be designed to cap emissions at different  points in the economy. For example, a cap-and-trade program could be  designed to cap \u201cupstream\u201d sources like fuel processors, extractors, and  importers. Under this approach, a cap would be set on the emissions  potential that is inherent in the fossil fuel. The upstream cap would  restrain the supply and increase the prices of fossil fuels and thus the price  of jet fuel relative to less carbon-intensive alternatives. Alternatively,  under a \u201cdownstream\u201d program, direct emitters, such as commercial  airlines, would be required to hold allowances equal to their total carbon  emissions each year. (See fig. 9.) However, economic research indicates  that both types of programs would provide commercial airlines with an  incentive to reduce their fuel consumption in the most cost-effective way  for each airline, such as by reducing weight, consolidating flights, or using  more fuel-efficient aircraft, if they were included in such a program. To the  extent that airlines would pass along any program costs to customers  through higher passenger fares and shipping rates, travelers and shippers  could respond in various ways, including by traveling less frequently or  using a different, cheaper transportation mode.", "The effectiveness of a cap-and-trade program in balancing the benefits and  costs of the emission reductions could depend on factors included in its  design. Generally, by establishing an upper limit on total emissions from  regulated sources, a cap-and-trade program can provide greater certainty  than other policies (for example, an emissions tax) that emissions will be  reduced to the desired level. Regulated sources would be required to hold  allowances equal to their total emissions, regardless of the cost. However,  allowance prices could be volatile, depending on factors such as changes  in energy prices, available technologies, and weather, making it more  expensive for sources to meet the cap. To limit price volatility, a cost- containment mechanism called a \u201csafety valve\u201d could be incorporated into  the cap-and-trade program to establish a ceiling on the price of  allowances. For example, if allowance prices rose to the safety-valve price,  the government could sell regulated sources as many allowances as they  would like to buy at the safety-valve price. Although the safety valve  could limit price spikes, the emissions cap would be exceeded if the safety  valve were triggered.", "In addition, the baseline that is used to project future emissions and set  the emissions cap can affect the extent to which a cap-and-trade program  will contain or reduce emissions. The point in time on which a baseline is  set also can influence the environmental benefits of a cap-and-trade  program. For example, some environmental interest groups in Europe  have claimed that the environmental benefits of including aviation in the  EU ETS will be minimal, since the emissions cap will be based on the  mean average of aviation emissions from 2004 through 2006, leading to  minimal future emissions reductions.", "In addition, industry groups and other experts have raised concerns that a  cap-and-trade program could be administratively burdensome to the  government, which would need to determine how to allocate the  allowances to sources, oversee allowance trading, and monitor and  enforce compliance with the program. Generally speaking, an upstream  program may have lower administrative costs than a downstream program  because it would likely involve fewer emissions sources.", "Some members of the aviation industry have said they view open and  global cap-and-trade programs positively, although they report that not all  types of cap-and-trade programs will work for them. For instance, ICAO  and other industry organizations have said they would prefer an open cap- and-trade program (in which airlines are allowed to trade allowances with  other sectors and sources) to a closed one (in which airlines are allowed  to trade emissions allowances only with one another) because an open  program would give airlines more flexibility in meeting their emissions  cap. Staff we met with at the Association of European Airlines expressed  willingness for aviation to participate in a cap-and-trade program as long  as it is global in scope, is an open system, is not in addition to similar  taxes, and does not double-count emissions. In addition, some industry  groups and government agencies we met with said that a global program  would best ensure that all airlines would take part in reducing emissions.", "Some countries are planning to address aviation emissions through cap- and-trade programs.

Nonetheless, estimates  of the social costs associated with greenhouse gas emissions vary. For  example, IPCC reported that the social costs of damages associated with  greenhouse gas emissions average about $12 per metric ton of carbon  dioxide (in 2005 dollars) with a range of $3 to $95 per ton (in 2005 dollars).", "Economic research indicates that an emissions tax is generally a more  economically efficient policy tool to address greenhouse gas emissions  than other policies, including a cap-and-trade program, because it would  better balance the social benefits and costs associated with the emissions  reductions. In addition, compared to a cap-and-trade program, an  emissions tax would provide greater certainty as to the price of emissions.

In addition, some  experts told us that NextGen-related technologies are candidates for  subsidies because of the high costs of the technologies and the benefits  that they will provide to the national airspace system. According to IPCC,  subsidies can encourage the diffusion of new low-emissions technologies  and can effectively reduce emissions. For example, as newer, more fuel- efficient engines are developed and become commercially available,  subsidies or tax credits could lower their relative costs and encourage  airlines to purchase them.", "Although subsidies are similar to taxes, economic research indicates that  some subsidy programs can be economically inefficient, and need to be  financed (for example, using current tax revenue or by raising taxes).

The extent to  which the costs associated with an emissions control program are  incurred by commercial airlines and passed on will depend on a number of  economic factors, such as the level of market competition and the  responsiveness of passengers to changes in price. Officials of some  industry organizations we met with said that because airlines are in a  competitive industry with a high elasticity of demand, they are  constrained in passing on their costs, and the costs to industry likely will  be large. The Association of European Airlines reported that airlines will  have very limited ability to pass on the costs of the EU ETS. Furthermore,  the International Air Transport Association has estimated that the costs to  the industry of complying with the EU ETS will be \u20ac3.5 billion in 2012,  with annual costs subsequently increasing. Others we interviewed,  however, stated that airlines will be able to pass on costs, and the  increases in ticket prices will not be large. For example, the EU estimates  that airlines will be able to pass on most of the costs of their compliance  with the EU ETS, which will result in an average ticket price increase of \u20ac9  on a medium-haul flight. However, the revenue generated by the tax or by  auctioning allowances could be used to lessen the overall impact on the  economy, or the impact on certain groups (for example, low income) or  sectors of the economy by, for example, reducing other taxes.", "Finally, according to some airline industry representatives, a program to  control greenhouse gas emissions would add to the financial burden the  aviation industry and its consumers already face with respect to other  taxes and fees. For example, passenger tickets in the United States are  subject to a federal passenger ticket tax of 7.5 percent, a segment charge  of $3.40 per flight segment, and fees for security and airport facilities (up  to $4.50 per airport). In addition, international flights are subject to  departure taxes and customs-related fees. However, none of these taxes  and fees attempt to account for the cost of greenhouse gas emissions, as a  tax or cap-and-trade program would do.

The flexibility  in the performance standards reduces the cost of compliance compared  with technology-based standards and, according to DOT, avoids potential  aviation safety implications that may occur from forcing a specific  technology across a wide range of operations and conditions.", "For example, by placing a strict limit on aircraft emissions, a standard  would limit the emissions levels from an engine or aircraft. Regulations on  specific emissions have been used to achieve specific environmental goals.  ICAO\u2019s nitrogen oxide standards place limits on nitrogen oxide emissions  from newly certified aircraft engines. These standards were first adopted  in 1981 and became effective in 1986. Although no government has yet  promulgated standards on aircraft carbon dioxide emissions or fuel  economy, emissions standards are being discussed within ICAO\u2019s  Committee on Aviation Environmental Protection and, in December 2007,  a number of environmental interest groups filed petitions with EPA asking  the agency to promulgate regulations for greenhouse gas emissions from  aircraft and aircraft engines.

For example, unlike market-based instruments, technology  standards would give engine manufacturers little choice about how to  reduce emissions and may not encourage them to find cost effective ways  of controlling emissions. In addition, according to IPCC, because  technology standards may require emissions to be reduced in specified  ways, they may not provide the flexibility to encourage industry to search  for other options for reducing emissions. However, according to EPA,  performance standards to address certain emissions from airlines, such as  those adopted by ICAO and EPA, gave manufacturers flexibility in  deciding which technologies to use to reduce emissions. Nonetheless,  although performance standards can provide greater flexibility and  therefore be more cost-effective than technology standards, economic  research indicates that standards generally provide sources with fewer  incentives to reduce emissions beyond what is required for compliance,  compared to market-based approaches. Moreover, standards typically  apply to new, rather than existing, engines or aircraft, making new engines  or aircraft more expensive, and as a result, the higher costs may delay  purchases of more fuel-efficient aircraft and engines.", "Current international aviation standards also may require international  cooperation.

We  agree that allowing regulated sources more flexibility in how they meet  emissions standards can reduce the costs associated with achieving the  emissions reductions. However, economic research indicates that for  addressing greenhouse gas emissions, market-based measures such as  emissions taxes or cap-and-trade programs would be economically  efficient (that is, would maximize net benefits) compared to other  approaches, in part because market-based measures can give firms and  consumers more flexibility to decide when and how to reduce their  emissions.

While  the executive branch has not articulated a position on this issue since mid- 2008, it has expressed the importance of climate change and developing a  solution on a global level.", "The Air Transport Association (ATA), a trade association representing  principle U.S. airlines, also has concluded that the EU ETS\u2019s inclusion of  aviation violates international law, specifically the Chicago Convention.  ATA argues that imposition of the ETS on U.S.-based carriers is contrary  to Articles 1, 12, 11, 15 and potentially, in the alternative, Article 24. In  summary, ATA argues that the ETS, as amended, violates Article 1 and  Article 12 provisions of sovereignty and authority. Article 1, which  provides contracting states exclusive sovereignty over their airspace, is  violated by the EU\u2019s extraterritorial reach which covers emissions of non- EU airlines in another states\u2019 airspace. Further, Article 12, which requires  contracting states to ensure that aircraft under its jurisdiction are in  compliance with rules and regulations relating to the flight and maneuver  of aircraft, also is violated. ATA argues that Article 12 gives ICAO  primary authority, under the Convention, to set rules for the \u201cflight and  maneuver of aircraft\u201d over the \u201chigh seas,\u201d which precludes the applicatio of rules by one state over the airlines of another state to the extent  inconsistent with ICAO rules.

States may only establish  admission and departure rules consistent with the remainder of the  Chicago Convention, which prevents the EU from arguing that Article 11  authorizes EU action. In any event, ATA contends that any rules may only  apply \u201cupon entering or departing from or while within the territory of that  State,\u201d whereas the European scheme reaches outside European territory.  Further, ATA finds that the ETS is contrary to Article 15 of the Chicago  Convention because it imposes a de facto charge for the right to enter or  exit an EU member state. In the alternative, ATA argues that there could  be a violation of Article 24 of the Convention, which exempts fuel on  board an aircraft from duties, fees, and charges. Because the law  calculates emissions based on fuel consumption, the purchase of  greenhouse gas permits may constitute a \u201csimilar \u2026 charge\u201d of fuel on  board, according to ATA. Additionally, Article 24 mirrors Article 11 of the  U.S.-EU Air Transport Agreement but extends the freedom from  taxation/charges on fuel to that purchased in the EU.

Reagan argues that international  aviation emission reductions should be pursued through ICAO given the  \u201cpolitical, technical, and legal implications raised by the regulation.\u201d This  article sets forth that politically, ICAO is the appropriate body because it  can work towards uniformity in a complex regulatory arena, incidentally  resulting in increased participation from a variety of stakeholders,  reduction of resentment, and a reduced likelihood of non-compliance and  legal challenges. Further, ICAO has the expertise necessary to technica design aviation\u2019s emission reduction regime and is in a position to  consider the \u201ceconomic, political, and technical circumstances of its  member states \u2026 .\u201d Finally, Reagan argues that pursuing an emissions  reduction regime through ICAO could avoid likely legal challenges which  present themselves under the current ETS, as ICAO could facilitate a  common understanding of contentious provisions. In conclusion, he  proposes that the EU should channel the energy for implementation of the  current regime into holding ICAO accountable for fulfilling environmental  duties.", "In contrast, a law review article published in the European Environmen Law Review in 2007 by Gisbert Schwarze argues that bringing aviation in the EU ETS falls clearly within existing law and is, in fact, mandated. article presents the case that neither existing traffic rights in member  states, bilateral air transport agreements, nor the Chicago Convention  pose any legal obstacles. He argues, in fact, that the EU has a mandate  under the UNFCCC and the Kyoto Protocol to implement climate change  policies which include aviation. First, the article sets forth that the  inclusion of aviation does not restrict existing traffic rights or allow or  disallow certain aircraft operations in different member states, but ra merely brings the amount of emissions into the decision-making process.", "Further, Schwarze explains that imposing the ETS on carriers flying in and out of the EU is well within the Chicago Convention. Article 1 of the  Convention provides contracting states exclusive sovereignty over their  airspace which provides the EU with the authority to impose obligations  relating to arrival and departures, so long as there is no discrimination on  the basis of nationality, as required by Article 11. Additionally, the article  sets forth that Article 12, regarding the flight and maneuver of aircraft, is  not applicable because, as argued above, the ETS does not regulate certain  aircraft operations. Article 15, which covers charges, is similarly  inapplicable because emissions allowances on the free market or through  the auctioning process do not constitute a charge. Finally, Article 24 is  inapposite as well because the emissions trading system does not  constitute a customs duty.", "Additionally, Schwarze argues that the bilateral air transport agreements  with various nations, such as the Open Skies Agreement with the Unite d  States, do not pose any legal barriers to inclusion of aviation in ETS.", "Id. at 12-13.", "These agreements contain a prohibition of discrimination similar to Art 11 of the Chicago Convention and a fair competition clause which require fair competition among signatories in international aviation as well as  prohibits a party from unilaterally limiting traffic. The article argues so long as the ETS operates without discrimination, it is in conformity  with the principle of a sound and economic operation of air services and  therefore satisfies the fairness clause. Finally, since the ETS gives only  incentive to reduce emissions, it does not regulate the amount of air  traffic.", "Finally, Schwarze argues that not only is the inclusion of aviation into the EU ETS legally sound, the UNFCCC and Kyoto Protocol mandate its  inclusion. The UNFCCC requires all parties to the treaty to adopt national policies and take corresponding measures on the mitigation of climate  change consistent with the objective of the convention, recognizing that  this can be done \u201cjointly with other parties.\u201d Additionally, the Kyoto  Protocol, which sought to strengthen UNFCCC, required Annex 1 parties  to pursue \u201climitations or reduction of emissions of greenhouse gases \u2026  from aviation \u2026 working through the International Civil Aviation  Organization.\u201d And finally, although not legally binding, ICAO Resolution  A35-5 endorses the development of an open emissions trading system for  international aviation."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Potential Legal Challenges and Dispute Resolution", "paragraphs": ["A  re  actions under international law if the ETS is imposed.

We interviewed  federal officials from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), FAA,  the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the  Departments of Defense and State. We also met with representatives of  ICAO\u2014a United Nations agency. We interviewed representatives of  industry groups, environmental groups, airlines, aircraft manufacturers,  aircraft engine manufacturers, alternative fuels manufacturers,  economists, and academics. We interviewed officials based in the United  States and abroad. We interviewed representatives of the EU and  associations about the EU ETS. We completed a literature search and  reviewed relevant documentation, studies, and articles related to our  objectives. To specifically address commercial aviation\u2019s contribution to  emissions, we asked our interviewees to identify the primary studies that  estimate current and future emissions. As a result, we reviewed and  summarized the findings of the 1999 International Panel of Climate Change  Aviation and the Environment report and its 2007 Fourth Assessment  Report, which were most frequently named as the most authoritative  sources on global aviation emissions.", "To specifically address technological and operational options to reduce  commercial aviation\u2019s contribution to greenhouse gases and other  emissions that can have an impact on the climate, we contracted with the  National Academy of Sciences to identify and recruit experts in aviation  and environmental issues. We interviewed 18 experts identified by the  Academy, including those with expertise in aeronautics, air traffic  management, atmospheric science, chemistry, climate change modeling,  economics, environmental science, and transportation policy. In  conducting these interviews, we used a standardized interview guide to  obtain consistent answers from our experts and had the interviews  recorded and transcribed. Based on these interviews, we assembled a list  of options for reducing aviation emissions, and we asked our experts to  assess these options on several dimensions. We provided each of our  experts with a standardized assessment tool that instructed the experts to  assess the potential of each technological and operational option on the  following dimensions: potential fuel savings and emissions reductions,  potential research and development costs, potential cost to the airline  industry, potential for public acceptance, and time frames for adoption.  For each dimension, we asked the experts to assess each option on a  three-point scale. For example, we asked the experts to rate each option  as having \u201clow potential\u201d, \u201cmedium potential\u201d, or \u201chigh potential\u201d  for fuel savings and carbon dioxide emissions reductions. We directed the e not to answer questions about areas in which they did not have specific  knowledge or expertise. As a result, throughout our report, the number o expert responses discussed for each emissions reduction option is sma than 18, the number of experts we interviewed. Besides asking the expert rcraft and  to assess the potential of technological options, such as new ai ls  engine designs, we asked them to assess the potential of alternative fue to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Furthermore, for operational opti ons  we asked the experts to assess included options that the federal  government must implement, such as air traffic management  improvements, as well as options that the airlines can exercise to reduc fuel burn. We analyzed and summarized the experts\u2019 responses in order to  identify those technological and operational options that the experts  collectively identified as holding the most promise for reducing emissions.  To analyze the results, for each option and dimension, we counted the  numbers of experts that selected the \u201clow,\u201d \u201c responses. We then determined an overall, or group, answer for each  q uestion based on the response the experts most commonly selected for  each option and dimension. However, if approximately the same number  o the group answer. For example, rather than reporting that the experts  rated a particular option as having \u201chigh\u201d potential, we instead reported  that they rated it as having \u201cmedium-high\u201d potential if approximately the  same number of experts selected the \u201chigh\u201d response as selected the  \u201cmedium\u201d response. Finally, if approximately the same number of experts  medium,\u201d and \u201chigh\u201d  f experts selected a second response, then we chose both responses as  selected all responses, then we determined that there was no consensus  on that question and reported the result as such.", "In order to determine government options for reducing aviation emissions,  we interviewed relevant experts, including those 18 recruited by the  National Academy of Sciences, about the potential use and the costs and  benefits of these options. We asked our interviewees to provide opinions  and information on a variety of governmental options, including carbon  taxes, cap-and-trade programs, aircraft and engine standards, government- sponsored research, and governmental subsidies. We looked at  governmental actions that have been taken in the past and at those that  have been proposed. We reviewed economic research on the economic  impact of policy options for addressing greenhouse gas emissions. Our  review focused on whether policy options could achieve emissions  reductions from global sources in an economically efficient manner (for  example, maximize net benefits). We interviewed EU officials to understand  how the EU ETS will work and to determine issues related to this scheme,  which is slated to include certain flights into and out of EU airports starting  in 2012.
