The percent of millennials within the federal workforce varies by agency and agencies that have high rates of retirement eligibility also tend to have low percentages of millennials in the workforce.", "In 2015, millennial employees in the federal government had an estimated Employee Engagement Index (EEI) score of 63.8 \u2013 as derived from the Office of Personnel Management's Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey \u2013 which is less than one percentage point lower than non-millennials. Engagement is usually defined as the sense of purpose and commitment employees feel towards their employer and its mission. As shown in the figure below, millennial subgroups had both the highest and lowest EEI scores among all age groups in 2015\u2014employees 25 and younger had the highest EEI score (70.8), while employees 30 to 39 years old had the lowest EEI score (63.3).", "Key drivers of engagement can help agencies develop a culture of engagement. GAO's regression analysis identified six practices as key drivers of the EEI, which were similar for both millennials and non-millennials: (1) constructive performance conversations, (2) career development and training, (3) work-life balance, (4) inclusive work environment, (5) employee involvement, and (6) communication from management.

As you know, federal  agencies are facing critical human capital management challenges. In our  prior work we noted how skills gaps in such government-wide fields as  cybersecurity, acquisition management, and telecommunications, as well  as in such agency-specific positions as nurses and physicians, are  jeopardizing the ability of agencies to cost-effectively carry out their  missions. At the same time, trends in retirement eligibility threaten to  aggravate the problem of skills gaps. Across government, almost a third  of permanent career employees on-board as of September 30, 2014, will  be eligible to retire by 2019.", "The importance of a top-notch federal workforce cannot be overstated.  The nation continues to face new and more complex social, economic,  and security challenges, and all of these issues will need to be addressed  in an environment of a large and long-term fiscal imbalance that will put  resource constraints on most agencies. Moreover, as we have pointed  out in our High-Risk Series and other reports for Congress, some federal  agencies continue to face ongoing performance and accountability  problems at a time when taxpayers have come to expect\u2014and need\u2014 higher levels responsiveness by public programs and officials.", "To help ensure agencies have the capacity to address these challenges,  it will be important for them to recruit and retain employees able to thrive  in organizations that are flatter, results-oriented, and externally focused,  and that collaborate with other governmental entities as well as with the  private sector to achieve desired outcomes. In short, agencies need to be  competitive in the labor market for top talent, including millennials. Based  on our work and that of other organizations, this means going beyond  merely attracting and hiring quality candidates; rather, it calls for a robust  talent management strategy that covers the full life-cycle of federal  employment and includes such key components as: data-driven workforce and succession planning; effective on-boarding programs;  results-oriented training and development; meaningful performance management; comparable pay and benefits; and a culture of employee engagement.", "In my remarks today, I will focus on this last component: employee  engagement. A growing body of research on both private- and public- sector organizations has found that increased levels of engagement\u2014 generally defined as the sense of purpose and commitment employees  feel toward their employer and its mission\u2014can lead to better  organizational performance. Specifically, I will discuss (1) recent  employment trends of millennials in the federal workforce and how they  compare to other employee cohorts; (2) trends in engagement levels of  millennials versus other employee groups; and (3) the drivers of federal  employee engagement based on our 2015 report and key lessons  learned for building a culture of engagement to help strengthen agencies\u2019  recruitment and retention efforts.", "My statement is based on our review of the trends and drivers of  government-wide employee engagement conducted between 2014 and  2015 and our larger body of work on federal human capital management  issued primarily between January 2014 and September 2016 and is  updated with more recent information as appropriate. For example, to  update the trends and drivers of employee engagement we analyzed  2015 results from the Federal Employees Viewpoint Survey (FEVS). To  update the federal civilian employment trend information, we analyzed  fiscal year 2014 data from the Office of Personnel Management\u2019s (OPM)  Enterprise Human Resources Integration (EHRI) Statistical Data Mart.", "To provide consistent breakouts by age for both engagement and  employment trend data, we used age groups established by OPM in the  FEVS.

In defining the millennial generation for purposes of this  statement we chose to group results from employees in 3 age groups: 25  years old and younger, 26 to 29 years old, and 30 to 39 years old.  Therefore, our definition of millennial is much broader than the typical  definition but we believe the value of consistency across our analysis  outweighs the disadvantages of including 30 to 39 year olds as  millennials.", "For our 2015 report on employee engagement we reviewed documents  and interviewed officials from three case study agencies.

We selected the National Credit Union  Administration (NCUA), the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), and the  Department of Education (Education) to ensure that we included agencies  that had high scores in one or more of the three metrics we identified and  that we included at least one Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990 (CFO  Act) agency.", "Detailed descriptions of the scope and methodology can be found in the  original reports cited throughout this statement.

Officials at Education\u2019s OCIO said it is important to ensure  that policies are applied consistently, which is the goal of that office\u2019s  Speaking with One Voice initiative. The biweekly management meetings  to discuss and clarify the implementation of department policies (e.g.,  telework, resources, and employee bonuses) were instituted after  conversations with employees revealed that policies were inconsistently  applied. As a result of the initiative, Education\u2019s OCIO officials said  employees know that senior leaders are paying attention to how policies  affect employees and are accountable for ensuring appropriate  implementation.", "Line of sight. FTC officials emphasized the importance of creating a line  of sight between the agency\u2019s mission and the work of each employee.  As we have previously reported, successful organizations create a \u201cline of  sight\u201d showing how team, unit, and individual performance can contribute  to overall organizational results. FTC officials said that the agency lists  every employee that contributed to a case in the pleadings, from the  attorneys and paralegals to the information technology specialists who  provided computer support. Importantly, FTC officials said they recognize  how mission support functions, such as excellent human resources  customer service contribute to the agency mission.", "Employee outreach. According to officials at all three case study  agencies, they all reach out to employees and their labor union  representatives, if applicable, to obtain insight into their FEVS scores or  to inform other improvement efforts. Our 2003 report found that employee  involvement strengthens the improvement process by including frontline  perspectives and experiences. By participating in improvement task  teams, employees have additional opportunities to share their  experiences and shape policies and procedures as they are being  developed and implemented. For example, in 2012, while NCUA\u2019s EEI  score was above the government-wide level, FEVS questions about  awards, performance appraisals, and merit-based promotions were its  lowest scoring categories. NCUA officials said they contracted with an  external facilitator to conduct workshops and webinar-based feedback  sessions with employees to gain insight into their FEVS results and  identify root causes influencing the survey scores. These officials said  that using external facilitators offered employees confidentiality and  created an environment that encouraged open conversations. Based on  these feedback sessions, NCUA created an internal employee-driven  committee to inform revisions to the awards, performance appraisals, and  merit-based promotion process, and developed recommendations for  NCUA\u2019s management to implement these changes. Most of the  committee\u2019s recommendations were implemented."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Supplemental Data Sources Enable Agencies to Pinpoint Efforts", "paragraphs": ["According to officials at our case study agencies in our 2015 report on  employee engagement, while the EEI provides a useful barometer for  engagement, other indicators can provide officials with further insight into  reasons for engagement levels and areas for improvement. Other data  such as turnover rates and equal employment opportunity (EEO)  complaints\u2014which are likely already collected by federal agencies\u2014can  provide additional insight and strategies for improving employee  engagement. Notably, MSPB found that there is a statistically significant  correlation between higher levels of employee engagement and fewer  EEO complaints. Officials in the three case study agencies said that  they pay attention to their FEVS scores, but other sources of data can  provide explanatory or agency-specific information valuable to developing  improvement strategies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Effects of Engagement Efforts Occur Over Multiple Years", "paragraphs": ["Officials at case study agencies for our 2015 report on employee  engagement told us that they take a multi-year, multi-prong approach to  improving engagement and do not base engagement efforts solely on the  survey cycle or focus their attention on year to year changes in the EEI.  Some case study agency officials said a single survey cycle does not  provide enough time to implement changes and see results because real  change usually takes more than 1 year. The FEVS cycle begins around  May and agencies receive results in September or October. It may be  late-winter or early-spring before an agency will have designed an action  plan. By the time the next survey cycle begins, agencies may still be  interpreting results and developing and implementing their action plans.", "Moreover, according to case study agency and other officials we  interviewed for the 2015 report, the annual survey cycle does not allow  enough time for employees\u2019 perceptions to change before the next cycle  begins. For example, an Education official said that it took a few years  to see the effects of engagement-related actions. Members of the Chief  Human Capital Officers Council and National Council on Federal Labor- Management Relations joint working group on employee engagement  said that the effects of initiatives implemented to improve engagement,  will not be reflected in the EEI scores for at least a couple of years, which  makes evaluating their effectiveness challenging.", "Instead of focusing exclusively on FEVS and EEI scores, the case study  agencies we examined took a longer term approach to their engagement  efforts. For example, according to officials, Education established  engagED, a long-term cultural change initiative aimed at building a more  innovative, collaborative and results-oriented agency, and creating a  more engaged workforce. Key components included quarterly all-staff  meetings with the Secretary to discuss various topics; a \u201clunches with  leaders\u201d program that allowed agency employees to discuss key topics  with senior agency leaders; and periodic leadership summits where  agency leaders participate in developmental activities identified by staff  and focused on teams, individual leadership, and problem resolution.", "In conclusion, more than simply a goal in its own right, higher levels of  engagement can enhance an agency\u2019s \u201cbrand\u201d to job seekers, reduce  turnover, and most importantly, improve organizational performance.  Moreover, while our analysis and the experience of our case study  agencies suggests that developing a culture of engagement does not  necessarily require expensive programs or technology, it does  necessitate effective management strategies such as leadership  involvement, strong interpersonal skills on the part of supervisors, and  thoughtful use of data. The starting point is valuing employees, focusing  on their performance and career development, and ensuring their  inclusion in decisions affecting their work. These engagement efforts,  combined with other components of a robust talent management strategy  covering the full life-cycle of federal employment, provide an ample tool  kit that should position agencies to be competitive in the labor market for  top talent.", "This completes my prepared remarks.
