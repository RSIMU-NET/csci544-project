The sensitive report included an objective related to the extent  to which security forces at various DOD domestic installations used  fielded PACS. DOD deemed a significant portion of the information  related to this objective to be sensitive, necessitating protection from  public disclosure. This public report omits information related to our  observations of PACS use at these installations and the risks associated  with not using PACS. As a result of this omission, we updated the  wording of the second objective to focus on DOD components\u2019 efforts to  monitor the use of fielded PACS at installations. Although the second  objective and the information associated with it in this public report is  more limited, we relied on the same methodology to support our findings  and the excluded information does not impact our recommendations. The  first and third objectives in this report are the same as in the sensitive  report and use the same methodology as in the sensitive report. DOD  deemed some of the detailed information presented in conjunction with  the third objective to be sensitive, necessitating protection from public  disclosure. As a result, this public report omits specific details regarding  the technical issues of PACs.", "This report focuses on physical access controls at authorized access  control points at DOD\u2019s domestic installations that are owned and  operated by the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, the Marine Corps, and the  Defense Logistics Agency (DLA). We did not consider actions DOD has  taken to prevent unauthorized access to its domestic installations by  means such as tunneling under or climbing over perimeter barriers.", "For objective one, we analyzed key Office of the Under Secretary of  Defense for Intelligence (OUSD(I)) and DOD component policies outlining  physical access control requirements. The key guidance documents we  analyzed are listed in table 2.", "Additionally, we interviewed officials from OUSD(I), the Joint Staff, each  of the DOD components, and the U.S. Northern Command to discuss the  guidance documents and any efforts to update, revise, or draft new  guidance on the use of installation PACS. We also reviewed DOD  component documentation and interviewed OUSD(I) and DOD  component officials to determine the extent to which PACS was fielded at  domestic installations and to identify ongoing efforts to field PACS at  additional domestic installations. Finally, we interviewed DOD officials to  identify any planned future enhancements to PACS and the Identify  Matching Engine for Security and Analysis (IMESA).", "For our second objective, we focused on individuals seeking unescorted  access to DOD domestic installations. We reviewed and analyzed  OUSD(I), DOD component, and installation-specific guidance on the use  and monitoring of PACS. We conducted site visits to six domestic  installations to meet with installation command and security force officials  to discuss their experiences using PACS and to observe their use of  PACS. We then compared the guidance and our observations with  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government for monitoring  activities, which states that management should obtain data on a timely  basis so that they can be used for effective monitoring. Although findings  from these six installations are not generalizable to all DOD domestic  installations, they are illustrative of how PACS are used, and more  generally, how installation access is controlled.", "In selecting the six installations to visit we considered installation  ownership to ensure that we included an installation from each DOD  component, geographic proximity among installations, and the type of  PACS used by the installation. We also visited an installation where no  PACS was installed. We limited our site selection to active-duty  installations in the continental United States. Based on this methodology  we visited Fort Stewart, Georgia; Moody Air Force Base, Georgia; Naval  Station Mayport, Florida; Marine Corps Support Facility Blount Island,  Florida; Tobyhanna Army Depot, Pennsylvania; and DLA Distribution  Center Susquehanna, Pennsylvania.", "For our third objective, we reviewed DOD user agreements to determine  the support agreement terms, requirements, and responsibilities for  addressing PACS technical issues. We analyzed DOD component data  on the number and type of Defense Biometric Identification System  (DBIDS) helpdesk technical issues reported from January 2016 through  July 2018, and compared the data with provisions in the user agreements  that discuss the PACS helpdesk. We also compared the steps the Army  and DMDC have taken or planned to address helpdesk technical issues  with Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government for  developing performance measures, which states that management  should establish performance measures and indicators. We interviewed  officials from DOD components and the installations we visited to discuss  their experiences with PACS helpdesks, and their views on the  performance and reliability of PACS. We assessed the reliability of the  helpdesk technical issue data by interviewing knowledgeable officials  about the data and by testing the raw data to determine the accuracy of  the summary data provided by DOD. Additionally, we collected and  analyzed the raw data to determine whether calculations were made  correctly. We determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for our  understanding the number and types of PACS technical issues.", "To address our three reporting objectives, we met with officials from the  DOD organizations listed in table 3.", "We conducted this performance audit from February 2018 to August 2019  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives.
