When examinations are completed, the resulting median assessment from an offshore examination is almost three times larger than from other types of examinations. However, due to the 3-year statute, the additional time needed to complete an offshore examination means that IRS sometimes has to prematurely end offshore examinations and sometimes chooses not to open one at all, despite evidence of likely noncompliance. Although data were not available to measure the effect of the statute on assessments, IRS agents and managers told GAO that overall assessments for offshore cases are lower than they would be if IRS had more time to work these cases. Some offshore examinations exhibit enforcement problems similar to those where Congress has granted a statute change or exception in the past. For example, Congress changed the statute for certain abusive tax shelters that involved technical complexity and dilatory tactics on the part of taxpayers. Through discussions with IRS officials and others in the tax practitioner and policy communities, GAO identified advantages and disadvantages to such an exception. Advantages included increased flexibility for IRS to direct enforcement resources to egregious cases of noncompliance and a possible deterrent to future noncompliance. Disadvantages included increased uncertainty and lack of closure for taxpayers. Our commenters also discussed design options to mitigate some of the disadvantages of a statute extension, such as making an exception apply to all taxpayers having offshore accounts/entities, and thereby, mitigating taxpayer uncertainty and lack of closure."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In recent years, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has observed a  significant increase in offshore activity among U.S. taxpayers. More and  more taxpayers have been observed attempting to \u201cexpatriate\u201d their  income and assets. Making investments or doing business internationally  is legal, but numerous schemes have been devised in which the true  ownership of income streams and assets has been hidden or disguised  using offshore activity, which is not legal. Some schemes can be as simple  as taking unreported income and personally traveling to a tax haven  country and depositing the cash into a bank account. Other schemes are  more elaborate, involving numerous domestic and foreign trusts,  partnerships, nominees, foreign financial accounts, offshore credit/debit  cards, and multilayered transactions. Like all forms of noncompliance,  offshore schemes add to the tax gap\u2014the difference between taxes owed  and taxes paid on time\u2014and shifts more of the tax burden onto compliant  taxpayers. Such schemes also can fuel a perception that the tax system is  not equitable and can erode honest taxpayers\u2019 faith in the voluntary  compliance system. When IRS discovers an offshore scheme, it has 3 years  from when the tax return was filed in which to work on uncovering the  scheme and assessing any additional tax. This is known as the 3-year  statute of limitations on assessments.", "In recognizing the serious problem posed by offshore tax evasion, you  asked us to identify any impediments that may exist to better combating  these schemes. An IRS study shows lengthy examination times for some  offshore examinations, which suggests that time or the lack thereof could  be an impediment to effectively addressing offshore schemes. This report  focuses on this possible impediment. Our objectives were to (1) compare  the length of and recommended assessments yielded by offshore and  nonoffshore examinations and determine whether the 3-year statute of  limitations reduces recommended offshore assessments, (2) determine  whether or not enforcement problems posed by offshore examinations are  similar to enforcement problems that led Congress to grant exceptions to  the statute in other situations, and (3) identify possible advantages and  disadvantages of an exception to the statute for offshore examinations.", "To do our work, we (1) analyzed IRS data, reports, publications, and other  documentation providing insight into the characteristics, complexity, and  size of the offshore tax evasion problem; (2) compared IRS data on the  amount of time required to complete examinations involving an offshore  component with those lacking such a component and the recommended  assessments from those examinations; (3) reviewed selected IRS files to  illustrate examinations of returns involving offshore components;   (4) researched the history of the federal statute of limitations for  assessments to include legislation proposed between 2003 and 2006 that  included references to either offshore tax evasion or the statute of  limitations; (5) interviewed representatives of California\u2019s taxing authority,  the California Franchise Tax Board (FTB), and reviewed documents  related to a recent change in California\u2019s statute related to certain abusive  tax shelters; (6) interviewed revenue agents and managers with expertise  in offshore cases to develop an understanding of IRS enforcement  activities; and (7) interviewed IRS officials and others in the tax  practitioner and policy communities about their views on extending the  examination period for returns involving offshore schemes. We assessed  the reliability of the IRS data that we used and found that it was  sufficiently reliable for our purposes. The universe of IRS examinations  with an offshore component included individual taxpayers, smaller and  larger corporations, and other taxable entities. The database of all  nonoffshore examinations we used for comparison similarly included a  full range of taxpayers. Details on our methodology can be found in  appendix I. We did our work from June 2005 through February 2007 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["It is perfectly legal for U.S. taxpayers to hold money offshore. It is illegal,  however, for a taxpayer to not disclose substantial offshore holdings, to  not report income earned in the United States and \u201chidden\u201d through  offshore arrangements, and to not report income earned offshore to IRS  on the taxpayer\u2019s tax return. If U.S. taxpayers own an offshore business  such as a foreign corporation, they are required to disclose that holding to  IRS on their tax return. When applied to abusive transactions, IRS  generally uses the term \u201coffshore\u201d to mean a country or jurisdiction that  offers financial secrecy laws in an effort to attract investment from outside  its borders. When referring to a financial institution, \u201coffshore\u201d refers to a  financial institution that primarily offers its services to persons domiciled  outside the jurisdiction of the country in which the financial institution is  organized.", "Abusive offshore schemes are often accomplished through the use of  limited liability corporations (LLC), limited liability partnerships (LLP),  international business corporations (IBC), and trusts, foreign financial  accounts, debit or credit cards, and other similar instruments. According  to IRS, the schemes can be complex, often involving multiple layers and  multiple transactions used to hide the true nature and ownership of the  assets or income that the taxpayer is attempting to hide from IRS.", "IRS has multiple programs and techniques used to select potentially  noncompliant tax returns for examination. One source is a computer  model designed to predict returns that, if audited, would be most likely to  result in additional taxes owed. Other sources that prompt an examination  include referrals from inside or outside IRS, information from third  parties, and indications of fraud or noncompliance from other audits.", "Once IRS has identified a return for an examination, the classification  process begins. Classification is the process of determining whether a  return should be selected for examination, what issues should be  examined, and how the examination should be conducted. IRS guidance  on classification states that classification should be conducted by an  experienced examiner.", "Examination is the accumulation of evidence for evaluating the accuracy  of the taxpayer\u2019s tax return. Examiners gather facts to correctly determine  a taxpayer\u2019s tax liability. Evidence can include the taxpayer\u2019s testimony  and books and records as well as the examiner\u2019s own observations and  documents from third parties. Methods for accumulation of evidence  include analytical tests, documentation, inquiry, inspection, observation,  and testing. IRS procedures call for examiners to pursue an examination  to the point where a reasonable determination of correct tax liability can  be made. In turn, examiners prepare audit reports, which should contain  all information necessary to ensure a clear understanding of the  adjustment, if any, and document how the tax liability was computed.  These reports serve as the basis for assessment actions. An assessment  records the taxpayer\u2019s liability due.", "IRS examinations are generally of one of three types\u2014correspondence,  office, or field. The simplest examinations usually cover one to two tax  issues handled by a lower-graded examiner through correspondence. More  complex examinations are done by meeting with taxpayers or their  representatives in IRS offices. The most complex examinations are done  through revenue agent field visits to taxpayer locations. Only about 16  percent of all IRS examinations from 2002 through 2005 were conducted  through field examinations, but 98 percent of offshore examinations were  of this type. About three-fourths of nonoffshore examinations are handled  through correspondence.", "IRS does not classify every return that is filed, nor does it examine every  case file that is classified, even if IRS determines that examining the tax  return would likely yield an assessment of additional taxes owed. Figure 1  provides a notional representation of the process of taking the over 130  million individual income tax returns that were filed in fiscal year 2004  through the steps that lead to audits of a much smaller number of those  returns.", "In most cases, the law gives IRS 3 years from the date a taxpayer files a tax  return to complete an examination and make an assessment of any  additional tax. For example, if a taxpayer filed a tax return on April 15,  2000, IRS had until April 15, 2003, to finish any examination of that return  and make an assessment of additional taxes owed by the taxpayer. This  statute of limitations for assessments is in effect for all examinations with  exceptions allowing longer periods for certain taxpayer actions or  omissions such as fraud or substantial understatement of gross income (in  excess of 25 percent of the amount of gross income stated on the return).  Taxpayers may also waive the 3-year assessment limitation through  written consent."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Offshore Examinations Take Longer Than Other Examinations, so the 3-Year Statute Can Lead to Lower Assessments Than Would Otherwise Be Possible", "paragraphs": ["In general, it takes longer for IRS to identify and examine tax returns  involving abusive offshore transactions than IRS needs in nonoffshore  cases because of the added complexity of examining offshore  transactions. Where IRS is able to complete examinations involving  abusive offshore transactions, they generally result in larger assessments  than other types of examinations. IRS has policies in place to avoid  violating the statute of limitations, and IRS enforcement personnel told us  that these policies, in conjunction with the longer time needed to complete  offshore examinations, mean some cases are never opened in the first  place while others are not fully worked because the time allowed under  the current statute is running out.

Tax  evasion, both domestic and offshore, often involves schemes with many  layers of deception. IRS officials told us that for domestic tax evasion,  revenue agents are able to issue summonses to domestic financial  institutions to uncover the layers of deception the taxpayer created to hide  the source and existence of the funds. In offshore cases, IRS generally  does not have summons power over offshore financial institutions, and is  often unable to determine the owner of an offshore account or business,  or determine the source of the funds. Even in cases where IRS is able to  determine information about offshore funds, an IRS manager told us that  this process of discovery is much more time consuming than for  nonoffshore cases.", "Unlike much nonoffshore tax evasion, most possible offshore tax evasion  cases are not discovered through IRS\u2019s computerized analysis of tax  returns, but rather through investigations of promoters of offshore  schemes. Officials told us that several divisions of IRS forward leads on  the promoters of offshore schemes they discover to revenue agents, who  develop the cases in order to discover the extent of the promoter\u2019s use of  offshore schemes. This process takes far longer than computer analysis- based methods of identifying potential noncompliance.", "After developing information that a promoter of offshore schemes illegally  sold schemes to help taxpayers avoid their tax liability, IRS can refer that  information to the Department of Justice, which can then file a complaint  in the United States District Court requesting the court to issue an  injunction against the promoter. In some cases, the injunction will compel  the promoter to disclose the clients who purchased the scheme. IRS  officials told us that it can take years to get a client list from a promoter  and, even with a client list, there is still much work that IRS needs to do  before the clients of the offshore schemes can be audited. For example,  IRS officials told us that they may only get limited information about the  clients of offshore promoters, and often that information is limited to a  name and perhaps the city and state where the client lives, so considerable  time may be spent finding the individuals listed by the promoter.", "Time spent developing information on a return before putting it into the  queue for examination shortens the time available to close the  examination before the 3-year civil statute of limitations expires. Table 1  compares the median number of days spent in development for offshore  and nonoffshore examinations from 2002 to 2005. As shown in the table,  the median offshore case took 184 more calendar days than the median  nonoffshore case to move from filing to examination. Comparing just field  examinations, which constituted over 98 percent of offshore examinations  in fiscal years 2002 through 2005, the difference in median development  time was 96 days. Some examinations lead to additional examinations of  the same taxpayer\u2019s returns, such as when a revenue agent identifies  noncompliance on one return and then reviews prior year returns looking  for the same problem, or when a taxpayer files a new return while an  examination is underway. To avoid overstating development time, this  comparison includes only the number of days between the start of the  examination and the filing date of the last return filed before the  examination began.", "Once offshore cases are developed and moved into examination, the  examinations take longer than nonoffshore cases. Considering all types of  examinations together, the median offshore examination took 90 more  days than the median nonoffshore examination. Considering field  examinations alone, the median offshore field examination was 70 days  longer than the median nonoffshore field examination, as shown in table 2.  IRS officials told us that this is due to examination complexity and the  difficulty of identifying and obtaining information from foreign sources.", "The total time that elapses between a return being filed and IRS\u2019s closing  of the examination of that return is referred to as total cycle time and  provides another type of comparison between offshore and nonoffshore  cases. As shown in table 3, the median offshore examination took almost  500 more calendar days overall to close than the median nonoffshore  examination, a 126 percent difference. The median offshore case took 82  percent of the statute time versus 36 percent for nonoffshore cases.  Considering just field examinations, the median cycle times for offshore  and nonoffshore examinations were closer in length, but the median  offshore examination was still 194 days longer, a difference of 28 percent."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Completed Offshore Examinations Yield Larger Recommended Assessments Than Other Examinations", "paragraphs": ["About half of all offshore examinations resulted in a recommended  assessment of additional taxes due compared to approximately 70 percent  of nonoffshore examinations.

Considering all types of examinations  together, including both those that resulted in an assessment and those  that did not, offshore examinations yielded less per hour of direct  examination time than nonoffshore examinations because the number of  hours spent on those examinations is nearly 4 times longer, on average.

Such  instances mean the loss of revenue to IRS and inefficient use of IRS  examination resources. IRS policies specify that statute expiration dates  for all tax returns be properly determined, that all records be annotated  with these dates, and that the cases be closely monitored to prevent  accidentally running out of time. Revenue agents and managers told us  that IRS strongly emphasizes the importance of keeping track of these  dates and avoiding allowing an examination to go past the statute date.", "While the 3-year statute of limitations applies in most cases, some  exceptions exist under current law. For example, an assessment may be  made after the 3-year point if the tax return is false or fraudulent or if  there is a sufficiently large omission of gross income. Taxpayers may also  agree to waive their statute rights.", "In the rare cases where IRS personnel allow an examination to go past the  statute without meeting one of the current exceptions to the statute (a  \u201cbarred statute\u201d), the responsible agent and his or her manager must  prepare a Barred Statute Report and face possible disciplinary action  because of the examination time spent with no possibility of making an  assessment. IRS data for fiscal years 2005 and 2006 showed 39 barred  statutes associated with examinations where a manager made an initial  determination to recommend a disciplinary action. As shown in table 6,  most of these barred statutes ultimately resulted in some type of  disciplinary action.", "IRS has created guidance for continuing offshore examinations past the 3- year point. This guidance permits agents to request permission to carry on  the examination past the 3-year point based on their judgment that, given  additional time, they will be able to ultimately prove that the examination  meets one of the following three conditions:1.  The return is false or fraudulent. IRS defines false or fraudulent as the  preparation and filing of false income tax returns by claiming inflated  personal or business expenses, false deductions, unallowable credits,  or excessive exemptions.  2.  There is a sufficiently large omission of gross income (in excess of 25  percent of the amount of gross income stated on the return) under IRC  6501(e), in which case the tax may be assessed at any time within 6  years after the return is filed.  3.  The taxpayer failed to notify the Secretary of the Treasury of certain  foreign transfers under IRC 6501(c)(8), in which case the statute of  limitations is 3 years from the date IRS receives the required  information.", "A conclusion to continue an examination beyond the statute must be  approved in writing by IRS managers, based on the revenue agent\u2019s  documentation of the rationale and calculations to support this  conclusion. In addition, IRS must have made a timely and proper request  to the taxpayer to obtain a consent agreement to extend the statute. The  taxpayer\u2019s refusal to extend the statute or lack of response must be  documented. If this guidance is followed, no disciplinary action will be  taken against the IRS managers and agents if the examination ultimately  does not prove to meet one of the three conditions for making an  assessment after 3 years.", "The IRS guidance allowing some examinations to go past the normal  statute period based on the revenue agent\u2019s judgment that an assessment  will be possible after the 3-year point recognizes the limited time available  to agents to finalize case-specific facts when the 3-year statute is about to  expire. The IRS guidance also notes that the Credit Card Summons project  examinations are generally likely to involve unreported income or fraud as  well as failure to file information returns reporting foreign transfers. The  guidance also states that other offshore examinations share many of the  same challenges as Credit Card Summons project examinations including  complex examinations and securing documents located outside the United  States.", "IRS managers told us that this procedure for continuing examinations  beyond the statute is cumbersome, time-consuming, and some agents are  reluctant to use the procedure because of concerns about barred statutes.  Revenue agents told us that this reluctance stems from the culture of IRS  examiners where agents are instructed from the time they are hired to  never let an examination go past the statute of limitations for any reason.  Despite subsequent assurances from IRS guidance, however, revenue  agents told us that ingrained reluctance to letting the statute of limitations  pass is still paramount.", "All of the examinations allowed to extend past the statute date under this  guidance represent a gamble on the part of IRS that the examination will  ultimately meet one of the exceptions to the statute and an assessment  will be allowed under the law. IRS records show that 1,942 offshore  examinations were taken past the 3-year statute period from fiscal years  2002 through 2005. IRS ultimately made assessments on 63 percent of  these examinations and these assessments were significantly higher than  assessments from all other types of examinations, with a median  assessment of about $17,500 versus about $5,800 from offshore  examinations that were closed within the 3-year statute of limitations and  $2,900 from all nonoffshore examinations closed within 3 years. IRS  databases do not allow systematic analysis of the approximately 700  examinations that did not result in an assessment, so we do not know if  these were accurate returns or if the discovered tax evasion just did not  rise to the level of fraud or substantial understatement of income.", "For those examinations that closed with an assessment, longer   examinations did not change the median assessment amount significantly  for nonoffshore examinations. On the other hand, offshore examinations   produced much larger median assessments than both shorter offshore  examinations and all nonoffshore examinations when the examinations  themselves took 3 years or more, as shown in figure 2. A similar  relationship is found for field examinations alone, as shown in figure 3.", "Similarly, our analysis of assessment dollars generated per hour of  examination time (including examinations both with and without  assessments) showed that the yield increased markedly for offshore  examinations that take more than 3 years. While average assessment  dollars per hour of direct offshore examination time are about half of the  average for nonoffshore examinations, the reverse is the case for  examinations that go over three years\u2014$6,458 per hour for offshore  examinations compared to $3,432 per hour for nonoffshore examinations.  The comparison is nearly the same for field examinations alone\u2014$6,465  per hour for offshore field examinations and $3,454 per hour for  nonoffshore field examinations.", "Revenue agents and managers told us that some developed case files are  not opened for examination because insufficient time remains under the  statute to make the examination worthwhile. They said that managers and  agents have leeway in deciding which examinations to work because there  are usually more developed case files waiting for agents than there are  agents to work them. IRS wants agents to work examinations with a good  likelihood of leading to meaningful assessments; managers told us they  look for examinations that have both apparent noncompliance and  sufficient time remaining within the statute to fully develop the apparent  issues. Revenue agents and IRS managers told us that, in order to avoid  violating the statute, they will often choose case files to examine with  more time remaining under the 3-year statute of limitations over case files  with less time remaining but with more likely or more substantial possible  assessments. As a result, they explained that not all case files in the  unassigned inventory of case files developed for examination are selected  for examination and many case files are \u201csurveyed,\u201d or closed without  examination.", "Two IRS policies could contribute to closing a developed offshore case  without an examination. One of these policies requires sorting the  unassigned inventory to identify the areas most in need of examination.  This policy includes statute year and statute date among the attributes  used in sorting unassigned inventory. A second policy requires that an  examiner not begin an examination or requisition any return for audit  without management approval if fewer than 12 months remain on the  statutory period for assessment. As described earlier, offshore  examinations typically require more time to develop than nonoffshore  examinations, and as a result, offshore examinations in the queue for  examination would typically be nearer the end of the assessment period  than nonoffshore examinations. IRS managers explained that this attribute  of offshore examinations can lead to leaving offshore cases in the queue  until the statute period ends and then closing the case without an  examination.", "Agents and managers also said that they often choose to end an ongoing  examination nearing the end of the 3-year assessment period without  making a complete assessment rather than risk taking the examination  past the statute period, losing revenue, and facing disciplinary action. IRS  agents and managers told us that they face difficult choices as an  examination nears the end of the 3-year assessment period and the  examination is incomplete. On the one hand, the examination can be  discontinued. This choice is the safest for individual IRS agents and  managers because it avoids the possibility of a Barred Statute Report and  disciplinary actions. However, this choice also results in an assessment  that does not accurately reflect the extent of a taxpayer\u2019s compliance or  noncompliance with tax laws because the examination is incomplete.  Continuing the examination can result in an accurate assessment, but only  if the examination demonstrates one or more of the exceptions to the  statute described earlier. If the examination does not ultimately  demonstrate fraud or another basis for an exception, IRS managers and  agents wasted IRS resources because they are barred from making an  assessment. Revenue agents told us that they believed that in some cases  there is \u201cmoney being left on the table\u201d in the form of unexamined issues  that could have led to assessments if there had been sufficient time to  examine them.", "Even where there is sufficient time to work an examination, only a few  years where a taxpayer was using a particular scheme may be open to  examination and the early years of a scheme may be past their statute date  before the examination even begins. For example, if IRS is examining a  taxpayer\u2019s 2005 tax return and discovers a significant understatement in  the income that the taxpayer reported, the agent can examine some of the  taxpayer\u2019s previous returns, but unless the revenue agent and manager  suspect fraud, in which case there is not a statute of limitations, IRS must  abide by the 3-year statute of limitations on assessments and not examine  some prior years that taxpayers held money offshore illegally. A senior IRS  official told us that this is a particularly significant problem because it is  often in the first years of an offshore scheme where the taxpayer moves  the most money offshore and the most egregious tax evasion takes place,  so IRS is missing out on significant assessments by not being able to look  back at previous tax returns.", "IRS revenue agents are not able to accurately estimate likely possible  assessments for case files or tax years that are unexamined. Similarly, in  cases where an examination is started and subsequently closed without  some issues being examined due to the statute of limitations, it is not  possible to estimate the likely assessment from unexamined issues.", "As mentioned earlier, however, we found that 1,942 offshore examinations  were allowed, either by IRS decision or by a voluntary statute extension  signed by the taxpayer under examination, to exceed the 3-year statute of  limitations. Of those, more than 700 were closed without an additional tax  assessment. IRS officials told us that many of the offshore examinations  that go past the 3-year statute of limitations are very difficult to work due  to complex financial arrangements and that even with significantly more  time, some particularly complex and well-hidden offshore schemes would  remain very difficult to uncover.

In order to obtain illustrative examples  of offshore examinations, we reviewed examinations that took a shorter  than average number of days to complete, about an average number of  days, and a longer than average number of days. We reviewed case files in  two locations and our reviews included both completed examinations and  examinations still in progress. These examinations included some that had  no changes to the taxpayer.

The taxpayer  maintained that he did not have an offshore credit card. IRS used a  summons to obtain records of a domestic rental car transaction that would  identify the holder of the offshore credit card. While the name shown on  the rental car records was similar to the taxpayer\u2019s name, it was not the  taxpayer\u2019s name. After reviewing the rental car records, the revenue agent  concluded that the taxpayer was not the holder of the offshore credit card.  The examination had no other issues and resulted in no change in the  amount of tax owed by the taxpayer. In conducting this examination, the  revenue agent    sent 4 pieces of correspondence to the taxpayer,    conducted 1 interview with taxpayer,    notified the taxpayer of third-party contact, and    used 1 summons to obtain domestic rental car records; the summons was  returned 33 days after it was issued.", "In the second examination, the taxpayer had a number of businesses in the  United States and in other countries, including at least one business in a  tax haven country. It appeared that some of the taxpayer\u2019s businesses paid  consulting fees to other businesses the taxpayer owned, and consulting  fees were paid into an offshore account in a tax haven country through  which the taxpayer received funds via a credit card.", "IRS found it difficult to determine how much money was in the taxpayer\u2019s  offshore tax haven business and how the money got there. The money in  that business, IRS told us, is the lynchpin of the entire examination, which  was still underway at the time of our review. During the 4 years that the  examination had been underway, IRS opened examinations on the  taxpayer\u2019s spouse and on other businesses in other tax years. IRS has not  been able to find where some of the money is going, although officials are  confident that more is being hidden as the taxpayer had other businesses  that made payments to the business in the offshore tax haven country.  Over the 4 years of this examination, there have been at least    5 powers of attorney,    20 summonses,    39 contacts with the taxpayer\u2019s power of attorney,    23 document requests,    5 missed appointments by taxpayer or taxpayer\u2019s representative,    1 statute extension,    2 interview requests denied,    5 meetings with taxpayer\u2019s representative,    4 postponed appointments,    4 third-party contacts, and    2 occasions on which the taxpayer refused to supply information.", "The scheme began, as far as IRS can tell, in the late-1990s, but  examinations of some early years of the taxpayer\u2019s scheme were  statutorily barred.

The following  details on legislative actions illustrate instances where changes and  exceptions to the statute were granted at both the federal and state levels  because of enforcement problems similar to those exhibited by offshore  examinations such as (1) time constraints on IRS; (2) taxpayers delaying  examinations through dilatory, uncooperative tactics on the part of  taxpayers; and (3) failure of taxpayers to provide required information."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Historical Changes and Exceptions", "paragraphs": ["The Revenue Act of 1934 provided the current 3-year statute.

Because the transactions are often  composed of many pieces located in several parts of a complex tax return,  they are essentially hidden from plain sight, which contributes to the  difficulty of determining the scope of the abusive shelter problem. Often  lacking economic substance or a business purpose other than generating  tax benefits, abusive shelters are promoted by some tax professionals,  often in confidence, for significant fees, sometimes with the participation  of tax-indifferent parties, such as foreign or tax-exempt entities. They may  involve unnecessary steps and flow-through entities, such as partnerships,  which make detection of these transactions more difficult. The  transactions are marketed to wealthy individuals, large corporations, and  small business taxpayers. Section 6111 of the Internal Revenue Code  requires the promoter or other tax shelter organizer to report such  transactions with IRS.

According to TIGTA, this  transaction used flow-through entities, such as partnerships, and various  financial products to add steps and complexity to transactions that had  little or no relationship to the investor\u2019s business or the asset sale creating  the sheltered gain. TIGTA further explained that the losses generated from  the transactions were often reported among \u201clegitimate\u201d items in several  parts of the tax return. TIGTA concluded that taken together, these  characteristics, especially the use of flow-through entities, made it very  difficult for IRS to detect the Son of Boss abusive tax shelter through its  traditional process of screening returns individually for questionable  items. TIGTA noted that examinations of abusive tax shelters can take  significant amounts of time even for the most experienced examiners  because such shelters often involve complex, technical transactions that  take on different variations and require examining multiple flow-through  entities to make a proper tax determination.", "At the time of our review, IRS representatives stated that sufficient time  had not elapsed to determine to what extent, if any, the 1-year extension  for unreported listed transactions improved examination effectiveness.

The FTB manager also  cited two sources of examinations in which the normal 4-year statute had  expired but taxpayers were willing to work to resolve their tax shelter  issues. These sources were the Self Compliance Letters and the  California Tax Shelter Resolution Initiative. The California FTB used a  self compliance letter to solicit amended returns from taxpayers for at  least 1 year in which the 4-year statute had expired. This letter cited the 8- year statute.

Offshore tax evasion is special, though, in that the  examinations that IRS pursues typically take much longer to develop and  examine because of the inherent difficulty in identifying and obtaining  information from foreign sources, the often dilatory and uncooperative  tactics on the part of taxpayers and their representatives, and the technical  complexity of the examinations.", "Nevertheless, the statute of limitations that applies to offshore  examinations is the same as applies to all returns. This leads to some  suspected tax evasion that IRS identifies going unexamined when revenue  agents and managers choose not to start work on offshore examinations  because there is too little time remaining under the statute or choose to  cut work off early in order to avoid a barred statute. There are exceptions  that permit IRS to continue examinations past the 3-year point and still  make assessments, but in many offshore examinations IRS has only 3  years to complete its work. Furthermore, taking an examination past the 3- year point in anticipation of finding fraud or one of the other exceptions  permitted under the statute represents a gamble by IRS that the  investment of additional examination resources will ultimately result in an  assessment being allowed under the law.", "Past Congresses have recognized the need for statute exceptions in the  face of similar compliance and enforcement obstacles.
