Generally the credit provides a subsidy for research spending in excess of a base amount but concerns have been raised about its design and administrability. Government Accountability Office (GAO) was asked to describe the credit's use, determine whether it could be redesigned to improve the incentive to do new research, and assess whether recordkeeping and other compliance costs could be reduced. GAO analyzed alternative credit designs using a panel of corporate tax returns and assessed administrability by interviewing Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and taxpayer representatives."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Large corporations have dominated the use of the research credit, with 549 corporations with receipts of $1 billion or more claiming over half of the $6 billion of net credit in 2005 (the latest year available). In 2005, the credit reduced the after-tax price of additional qualified research by an estimated 6.4 to 7.3 percent. This percentage measures the incentive intended to stimulate additional research. The incentive to do new research (the marginal incentive) provided by the credit could be improved. Based on analysis of historical data and simulations using the corporate panel, GAO identified significant disparities in the incentives provided to different taxpayers with some taxpayers receiving no credit and others eligible for credits up to 13 percent of their incremental spending. Further, a substantial portion of credit dollars is a windfall for taxpayers, earned for spending they would have done anyway, instead of being used to support potentially beneficial new research. An important cause of this problem is that the base for the regular version of the credit is determined by research spending dating back to the 1980s. Taxpayers now have an \"alternative simplified credit\" option, but it provides larger windfalls to some taxpayers and lower incentives for new research. Problems with the credit's design could be reduced by eliminating the regular credit and modifying the base of the alternative simplified credit to reduce windfalls. Credit claims have been contentious, with disputes between IRS and taxpayers over what qualifies as research expenses and how to document expenses. Insufficient guidance has led to disputes over the definitions of internal use software, depreciable property, indirect supervision, and the start of commercial production. Also disputed is the documentation needed to support a claim, especially in cases affected by changes in the law years after expenses were recorded. Such disputes leave taxpayers uncertain about the amount of credit to be received, reducing the incentive."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Since 1981, the tax credit for qualified research expenses has provided  significant subsidies (an estimated $5.6 billion for fiscal year 2009) to  encourage business investment in research and development.  This type of  investment can have a profound effect on long-term growth if it fosters  innovation.  Economists widely agree that some government subsidy for  research is justified because the social returns from research exceed the  private returns that investors receive.  In the absence of a subsidy, the  amount invested in research would be less than optimal from society\u2019s  standpoint.", "Despite the widespread support for the concept of a credit for increasing  research activities, concerns have been raised about the cost-effectiveness  of the design of the current credit and its administrative and compliance  costs.  Very generally, the research credit provides a subsidy for spending  in excess of a base amount.  One design issue is how the base is  determined and how well it achieves its objective of targeting benefits only  to research spending that would not have been done without the credit.", "To help inform congressional deliberations on the credit, you asked us to  (1) describe how taxpayers are currently using the credit; (2) identify  what, if any, changes to the credit\u2019s design may be able to increase the  incentive to do additional research with social benefits; and (3) identify  specific and significant problems, if any, that exist in the administration of  the credit and options to address them.", "To provide information on the use of the research credit we analyzed  Internal Revenue Service (IRS) taxpayer data from the Statistics of Income  (SOI) Division\u2019s annual samples of corporate tax returns for the most  recent years available (2003 through 2006) supplemented by data collected  by IRS examiners.  We determined that the data were sufficiently reliable  for our purpose of describing the general characteristics of R&E Credit  claimants; the amount and type of R&E Credit claimed by taxpayers; the  average rate of credit for claimants; and the types of research spending for  which taxpayers are claiming the credit (i.e., basic vs. applied research, as  defined by tax rules).  However, we do discuss certain limitations of the  data and how those may affect selected statistics.", "To identify what, if any, problems exist with the design of the credit, we  examined its performance, relative to alternative designs, in terms of three  criteria.  Our first criterion was the amount of revenue the government  must forgo under each of the alternative credit designs in order to provide  a given level of incentive.  Our second criterion was the extent to which  each design minimizes unintended variations in the rates of incentives  across taxpayers.  Our final criterion was the extent to which each design  of the credit helps to minimize the administrative and compliance burdens  on IRS and taxpayers.  We compared alternative designs of the credit by  using a panel of SOI taxpayer data to simulate the sizes of the incentives  and revenue costs of different credit designs under different scenarios, as  well as by interviewing research credit experts.  We performed a  sensitivity analysis that allowed certain data and parameters of our  simulation model to vary.  For example, one aspect of our sensitivity  analysis involved running the simulations using data collected at different  stages of the tax filing process, including data from the original returns as  well as from amended or audited returns, where applicable.  Our panel  database included most of the largest credit claimants in 2003 and 2004,  which accounted for about half of the total credits claimed and 54 percent  to 55 percent of total qualified research expenses in each of those years.

The purpose of this design is to reduce  the cost of providing a given amount of incentive.  Figure 1 illustrates the  difference between an incremental credit and two common alternative  designs for a subsidy\u2014a flat credit and a capped flat credit.  In the case of  the flat credit a taxpayer would earn a fixed rate of credit, 20 percent in  this example, for every dollar of qualified spending.  The taxpayer\u2019s total  qualified spending consists of the amount that it would have spent even if  there were no subsidy, plus the additional or \u201cmarginal\u201d amount that it  spends only because the credit subsidy is available.  The subsidy  encourages additional spending by reducing the after-tax cost of a  qualified research project and, thereby, increasing the project\u2019s expected  profitability sufficiently to change the taxpayer\u2019s investment decision from  no to yes.  The subsidy provided for the marginal spending is the only  portion of the credit that affects the taxpayer\u2019s research spending  behavior.  The remainder of the credit is a windfall to the taxpayer for  doing something that it was going to do anyway.  In the case of a capped  credit, the taxpayer earns a fixed rate of credit on each dollar of qualified  spending up to a specified limit.  If, as in the example shown in figure 1,  the credit\u2019s limit is less than the amount that the taxpayer would have  spent anyway, all of the credit paid is a windfall and no additional  spending is stimulated because no incentive is provided at the margin.  In  contrast, the objective of an incremental credit is to focus as much of the  credit on marginal spending while keeping the amount provided as a  windfall to a minimum.  The last example in figure 1 shows the case of an  ideal incremental credit\u2014one for which the base of the credit (the amount  of spending that a taxpayer must exceed before it can begin earning any  credit) perfectly measures the amount of spending that the taxpayer would  have done anyway.  This credit maintains an incentive for marginal  spending but eliminates windfall credits, substantially reducing the credit\u2019s  revenue cost.  Alternatively, the savings from the elimination of windfalls  could be used to increase the rate of credit on marginal spending.", "The primary differences across the research credit computation options  are in (1) how the base spending is defined and (2) the rate of credit that is  then applied to the difference between current-year QREs and the base  amounts.

A group could, thereby, increase the amount of credit it  earned without actually increasing its research spending in the aggregate.

The aggregation rules also apply to trades or businesses under common control.  A trade or  business is defined as a sole proprietorship, a partnership, a trust or estate or a corporation  that is carrying on a trade or business. however, one factor that reduces the MER for all credit earners, regardless  of the design, is the offset of the credit against the section 174 deduction  for research spending (or the alternative election of the reduced credit  amount) mentioned earlier.  For corporations subject to the top corporate  income tax rate of 35 percent, this offset effectively reduces the regular  credit\u2019s MER from 20 percent to 13 percent and the ASC\u2019s MER from 14  percent to 9.1 percent.  Another factor that reduces the MER of many  taxpayers is the fact that they do not have sufficient tax liabilities to use all  of the credits they earn in the current year.  When a taxpayer cannot use  the credit until sometime in the future, the present value of the credit  decreases according to the taxpayer\u2019s discount rate.  For example, if the  taxpayer has a discount rate of 5 percent and must delay the use of $1  million of credit for three years, the present value of that credit is reduced  to approximately $864,000.  Such a delay, therefore, would reduce the  regular credit\u2019s MER from 13 percent to about 11.2 percent.  This delay in  the use of the credit also reduces the present value of the revenue cost to  the government.  In the remainder of this report we make a distinction  between the amount of net credit (after the section 174 offset) that  taxpayers earn for a given tax year and the credit\u2019s discounted revenue  cost, which reflects delays in the use of credits.  Unless otherwise  specified, we use the term revenue cost to refer to the discounted revenue  cost."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Estimating the Credit\u2019s Stimulative Effect", "paragraphs": [". research spending and is defined as the percentage change in total QREs  divided by the percentage change in the price of a unit of research.  If the  average MER were 5 percent and the price elasticity were -1, then the  credit would increase total QREs by 5 percent.  The next step in the  computation is to apply the percentage increase to the amount of  aggregate qualified spending that would have been done without the credit  in order to determine the total amount of spending stimulated by the  credit.  Finally, the bang-per-buck can be estimated by dividing the total  amount stimulated by the credit\u2019s revenue cost.", "In this study, we provide some estimates of the credit\u2019s weighted average  MER and revenue cost, as well as estimates of the aggregate amount of  qualified research spending.  We have not estimated the price elasticity of  research spending and the available estimates from past empirical  research leave considerable uncertainty regarding the size of that  elasticity.  Nevertheless, as can be seen in figure 2, for any value of the  price elasticity, a credit design that provides the same weighted average  MER as another design, but at a lower revenue cost, should provide a  higher bang-per-buck than that other credit.  Therefore, comparing  different designs on the basis of their MER and revenue cost should be  equivalent to comparing them on the basis of their bang-per-buck.", "To fully assess the research credit\u2019s value to society, more than just the  amount of spending stimulated per dollar of revenue cost would have to  be examined.  A comparison would have to be made between (1) the total  benefits gained by society from the research stimulated by the credit and  (2) the estimated costs to society resulting from the collection of taxes  required to fund the credit.  The social benefits of the research conducted  by individual businesses include any new products, productivity increases,  or cost reductions that benefit other businesses and consumers  throughout the economy.  Although most economists agree that research  spending can generate social benefits, the effects of the research on other  businesses and consumers are difficult to measure.

In 2005, 549 such  corporations accounted for about 65 percent of the $6 billion of net credit  claimed that year (see figure 4 and table 3 in appendix II).  Even within  the population of large corporations credit use is concentrated among the  largest users.  The 101 corporations in our panel database in 2004  accounted for about 50 percent of the net credit claimed that year.   Corporations with business receipts of $1 billion or more accounted for an  even larger share\u2014about 70 percent\u2014of the $131 billion of total QREs  reported by credit claimants for 2005.  In 2005 approximately 69 percent  of QREs were for wages paid to employees engaged in qualified research  activities.  Almost all of the remaining QREs were for supplies used in  research processes (about 16 percent) and for contract research (about 15  percent).", "Prior to the introduction of the ASC in 2006, taxpayers that used the  regular credit accounted for the majority of QREs and an even larger  majority of the research credit claimed.  In 2005, regular credit users  reported about 75 percent of all QREs and claimed about 90 percent of  total research credits.  (See figure 5 in appendix II.)  Their share of total  credits was larger than their share of total QREs because the regular credit  rules were more generous than those of the AIRC for taxpayers who could  qualify for the former.  Most of the regular credit users were subject to the  50-percent minimum base, which, as we will explain in a later section, had  a significant effect on the MER they received from the credit.  The lack of  current tax liabilities was another factor that affected the MERs of many  credit claimants.  In 2005, 44 percent of total net credits earned could not  be used immediately.  (See figure 6 in appendix II.)", "By taking into account factors, such as which credit a taxpayer selected,  whether it was subject to a minimum base, and whether it could use its  credit immediately, we were able to estimate MERs for all of the credit  claimants represented in SOI\u2019s corporate database (see appendix I for  details).  These individual estimates allowed us to compute a weighted  average MER for all taxpayers.  We also estimated the discounted cost to  the government of the credits that all taxpayers earned.  These estimates,  along with data on total QREs, permitted us to estimate the bang-per-buck  of the credit for 2003 through 2005 for alternative assumptions about the  price elasticity of research spending.  (See table 4 in appendix II.)  Our  estimate of the overall MER in 2005 ranged between 6.4 percent and 7.3  percent, depending on assumptions about discount rates and the length of  time before taxpayers could use their credits.  Our estimates of the  discounted revenue cost were also sensitive to these assumptions and  ranged between $4.8 billion and $5.8 billion.  The bang-per-buck estimates  were not sensitive to these particular assumptions; however, they were  quite sensitive to the price elasticity assumptions.  If the elasticity was -0.5,  the bang-per-buck for 2005 would have been about $0.80.  If the elasticity  was -2, the bang-per-buck would have been about $3.00.", "Data on amended claims filed by our panel of large corporations indicate  that, in the aggregate, these amendments increased the amount of credit  claimed by between 1.5 percent and 5.4 percent (relative to the amounts  claimed on initial returns) for each tax year from 2000 through 2003.  (See  tables 5 through 8 in appendix II.)  The credit increase through  amendments for tax year 2004 was only 0.5 percent.  Data from IRS  examinations of these large corporations indicate that examiners  recommended changes that, in the aggregate, would have decreased  credits claimed by between 16.5 and 27.1 percent each tax year from 2000  through 2003.  (See tables 9 through 12 in appendix II.)  The lower  percentage change of 9 percent for 2004 reflects, in part, the fact that  audits for that tax year had not progressed as far as those for the earlier  years.", "Changes of these magnitudes raise the question of how much credit  taxpayers actually expected to receive when they filed their claims and,  more important, when they were making their research spending decisions  for the years in question.  These expectations are critical because they  are what affect the taxpayer\u2019s decisions, not the amounts of credit actually  received well after the decisions have been made.  For those taxpayers  that do not expect to file amendments and do not expect IRS to change  their credits, the amounts claimed on their original returns should be the  best estimate of their expectations.  For taxpayers that know they may be  stretching the rules with some of the expenses they are trying to claim as  QREs, their post-exam credit amounts may be better estimates of their  expectations.  In other cases, given the lack of clarity in certain aspects of  the definitions of both QREs and gross receipts, taxpayers may be  uncertain whether they will receive any credit for particular research  projects.

In reality, it is impossible for policymakers to know how much  research spending taxpayers would have done without the credit.  Any  practical base that can be designed for the credit will only approximate  the ideal base with some degree of inaccuracy.  The primary base for the  regular credit (except for start-up companies) is determined by a  taxpayer\u2019s spending behavior that occurred up to 25 years ago (see the  computation rules on page 7).  There is little reason to believe that, in  most cases, the ratio of research spending to gross receipts from that long  ago, when multiplied by the taxpayer\u2019s most recent 4-year average of gross  receipts, would accurately approximate the ideal base for that taxpayer.", "Most credit claimants received substantial windfalls.  Regular credit  claimants subject to the 50 percent minimum base represented about 71  percent of all claimants in 2005 (see figure 5 in appendix II).  More than  half of the credit such claimants earned was a windfall.  Even the highest  elasticity estimates and the largest possible MER (which together should  produce the largest increase in research spending) indicate that spending  increases due to the credit represent less than 15 percent of the total  research spending of these claimants.  Since regular credit users subject to  the 50 percent minimum base receive a credit for half of their research  spending, the credit for marginal spending is less than half of the credit  they receive.", "Inaccuracies in the base also cause disparities across taxpayers in both the  marginal incentives and windfall benefits that they receive from the credit.   Table 1 shows the extent of the disparities across taxpayers that use  different credit options and are subject to different constraints.  Taxpayers  for which bases exceeded their actual spending received no incentive from  the credit.  Regular credit users whose primary bases were not so  inaccurately low that the minimum base took effect received had MERs of  13 percent (if they could use their credits immediately), while those with  primary bases so inaccurate that they were subject to the minimum base  had their MERs cut to 6.5 percent (again, if they could use their credits  immediately).  Using the IRS tax data, we estimated that the regular  credit users subject to the minimum base received an average effective  rate of credit (total credit divided by total spending) more than one and  one-half times as large as those who were not subject to the minimum  base.  The average effective rate includes windfall credits, which the MER  does not.  This result indicates that, even though the minimum base  reduced the credits that taxpayers earned on both their marginal spending  and on the spending they would have done anyway, taxpayers subject to  the minimum base still received larger windfall credits than those who  were not.", "Meanwhile, AIRC users received significantly lower MERs and average  effective credit rates than did either group of regular credit users.", "Although data are not yet available on credit use after the ASC was  introduced, we applied current credit rules to the historical data from our  panel of large credit claimants to estimate how many of them would have  chosen ASC if it had been available in 2003 and 2004.  We found that, if  taxpayers had selected the option that provided them with the largest  credit amount, most of the panel members would have switched to the  ASC, but a significant number would still have claimed the regular credit.

Figure 3 illustrates this problem  in the case that a taxpayer earns a credit each year but is not subject to the  minimum base.  For every $1 million of spending increase this year, the  taxpayer\u2019s base in each of the next 3 years would increase by $166,667.   These base increases reduce the amount of credit that the taxpayer can  earn in each of the next 3 years by $15,167, for a combined total of  $45,500.  As a result, the actual benefit that the taxpayer receives for  increasing this year\u2019s spending is cut in half, and the MER is reduced to 4.6  percent.  If the taxpayer anticipated that its future spending would  decline so much that it would not be able to earn any credit in the next 3  years, then there would be no negative future consequences from  increasing this year\u2019s spending and the MER would be 9.1 percent.   However, if a taxpayer does not expect to exceed its base in the current  year, even after increasing its spending by a marginal amount, but plans to  increase its future spending enough to earn credits in the future years,  then it would receive no current benefit for that marginal spending.

However, the low base is likely to be below most  taxpayer\u2019s ideal base and some are likely to earn credit on substantial  amounts of research spending that they would have done anyway.

If we assumed a relatively low discount rate and short length of  carryforward (for those who could not use their credits immediately), then  the estimated weighted average MER for our panel prior to the  introduction of the ASC ranged between 7.4 percent and 8.3 percent,  depending on which years of data we used and whether the data related to  before or after amendments and IRS exams.  If the ASC option had been  available to these corporations and they chose the credit option that  provided them the largest amount of credit, we estimate that their  weighted average MER would have been between 5.6 percent and 6.3  percent.

Under the first change, the ASC would be the only option  available; under the second change, all of the taxpayers would receive  larger amounts of credits under the ASC than under the regular credit  (except for those that could not earn either credit), so they would  voluntarily choose the ASC.  In both cases, if the rate of the ASC is kept  at 14 percent, both the average MER and the revenue cost would decrease,  but the percentage decrease in the average MER in most cases would be at  least twice as large, meaning that the credit\u2019s bang-per-buck would  decrease.

Moreover, once taxpayers  began to expect regular updates of the base, the expected negative effects  on future credits would lower the MER of the regular credit in the same  way that they do for the ASC.  One potential compromise between a  frequently updated base that significantly reduces the credit\u2019s bang-per- buck and a fixed base that causes distorting disparities is to have a base  that is updated only in those cases where it has become evidently far out  of line for individual taxpayers.

The IRS officials we interviewed disagreed with  these assertions and referred to language from their Research Credit Audit  Technique Guide that instructs examiners on the relevant language from  current regulations.  Both practitioners and IRS officials acknowledged  that some controversies arise because language in the IRC and regulations  does not always provide a bright line for identifying qualified activities.   For example, one qualification requirement is that the research must be  intended to eliminate uncertainty concerning the development or  improvement of a business component.  The regulations say that  uncertainty exists \u201cif the information available to the taxpayer does not  establish the capability or method for developing or improving the  business component, or the appropriate design of the business  component.\u201d  An IRS official said that examiners could use clarification  of the meaning of \u201cinformation available to the taxpayer,\u201d while a  practitioner noted that the regulations do not say what degree of  improvement in a product is required for the underlying research to be  considered qualified.  The practitioner said that research for  improvements is more difficult to get qualified than research for new  products.", "Several particularly contentious issues relate to specific types of research  activities or expenses, including the following:  The definition and qualification standards for internal-use  software (IUS).  Research relating to the development of software for  the taxpayer\u2019s own internal use is generally excluded from qualified  research, unless it meets an additional set of standards that are not applied  to other research activities.  The IRC provides Treasury the authority to  specify exceptions to this exclusion but Treasury did not address this  issue when it published final research credit regulations in 2004.  Treasury  pointed to the significant changes in computer software and its role in  business activity since the mid-1980s (when the IUS exclusion was added  to the IRC) as making it difficult to determine how Congress intended the  new technology to be treated.  Meanwhile, tax practitioners complain that  IRS continues to consider most software development expenditures in the  services industry to be IUS.  Some commentators have questioned  whether there is still an economic rationale for distinguishing between IUS  and software used for other purposes, given that innovations in software  can produce spillover benefits regardless of whether the software is sold  to third parties.  IRS officials say that eliminating the distinction would  significantly increase the revenue cost of the credit but they doubt that it  would simplify administration.  They believe that a bright-line definition of  IUS, such as that contained in 2001 proposed regulations, is the only  practical approach for dealing with this issue.  The development of IUS  regulations has been included in all of Treasury\u2019s priority guidance plans  since the issue was left out of the final research credit regulations;  however, Treasury officials have not indicated when they are likely to be  issued or what stand they are likely to take.", "Late-stage testing of products and production processes.

One of them said that IRS rejected testing activities  simply on the basis of whether the testing techniques, themselves, were  routine.  IRS officials said that they typically reject testing that is done  after the taxpayer has proven the acceptability of its production process  internally.

The  official also said that they have disagreements with taxpayers over when  commercial production begins and suggested that this is one area where  some further clarification in regulations might help.

They say that IRS often rejects wage claims simply  on the basis of job titles.  IRS officials told us that wages of higher level  managers could be eligible for the credit; however, the burden of proof is  on the taxpayer to substantiate the amount of time that those managers  actually spent directly supervising a qualified activity.

Data are not available that would  allow us to say whether one of the methods would result in higher overall  research spending than the other.  For those groups in which the aggregate  research spending of all members is determined by group-level  management, the only way that the allocation rules can affect the credit\u2019s  incentive is if they allow the shifting of credits from members without  current tax liabilities to those with tax liabilities.  If the group credit is  computed according to the method that yields the largest credit, then an  additional dollar of spending by any group member will increase the group  credit by the same amount, regardless of how the group credit total is  allocated among members.", "The gross QRE allocation method is much less burdensome for controlled  groups and for IRS than the stand-alone method because it does not  require anyone to maintain base-period records for the regular credit,  unless they choose to use that credit themselves.

First, the misallocation of  resources that can result from the uneven distribution of both marginal  incentives and windfall benefits across taxpayers could lead to missed  opportunities for the country to benefit from research projects with higher  social rates of return.  Second, the requirement to maintain detailed  records from the 1980s, updated for subsequent changes in law and  regulations, represents a considerable compliance burden for regular  credit users (including some that are required to use that option).  Regular  updates of the base would substantially reduce these problems; however,  no clear purpose would be served by retaining both the ASC and a regular  credit, the base of which would be updated almost as frequently as that of  the ASC.  Unfortunately, neither of the problems can be avoided without a  reduction in the credit\u2019s bang-per-buck.  The addition of a minimum base  to the ASC would likely improve the bang-per-buck of that credit (the  extent would depend on certain estimating assumptions) and also reduce  inequities in the distribution of windfall credits.", "The research credit presents many challenges to both taxpayers and IRS.   In a number of areas, current guidance for identifying QREs does not  enable claimants or IRS to make bright-line determinations.  In some of  these areas further clarification is possible; in others ambiguity may be  difficult to reduce.  In some cases, drawing lines that make the definition  of QREs more liberal would likely result in the credit being less well- targeted to research with large spillover benefits to society.  Instead, the  credit would be shifted toward a broader subsidy for high-tech jobs or  manufacturing in general.  Documenting and verifying that particular  expenses are qualified for the credit involve considerable resource costs  on the part of taxpayers and IRS.  Moreover, widespread disagreements  between IRS and taxpayers over the adequacy of documentation leave  many taxpayers uncertain about the amounts of credit they will ultimately  receive.  Recordkeeping burdens may discourage some taxpayers from  using the credit and the uncertainty reduces the credit\u2019s effective  incentive.  Relaxing recordkeeping requirements would alleviate these  problems; however, there remains a risk that such a relaxation could  significantly increase the amount of credit provided for spending of  questionable merit.

This discontinuity usually occurred in cases  of a corporate reorganization, such as a merger or spin-off.  In cases where  we did not find a complete 5-year set of tax returns for one of the EINs  selected into our panel, we searched to see if we could find the missing  returns under a different EIN.  We focused our search on cases where  taxpayers had reported substantial amounts of research credits or QREs  for tax years early in our period and then they stopped appearing in SOI\u2019s  corporate sample (because they stopped filing a return under their initial  EIN).  For example, we examined the cases of taxpayers that filed returns  in 2000 and 2001 and then stopped filing returns to see if they were related  to cases in our panel for which we were missing tax returns for those 2  years.  If the companies that stopped filing returns were not related to any  companies for which we were missing returns, we then checked to see if  they were related to any other members of our panel (because they might  have been merged into an ongoing corporation that kept the same EIN  before and after the merger).  Conversely, if the panel member for which  we were missing early-year tax returns did not match up with any cases  that had stopped filing after those years, we checked to see if that panel  member had been spun off of any other panel member (meaning that it  was once included in the consolidated tax return of the other panel  member and than was either sold off or became deconsolidated and filed  its own return).  We did a similar examination for companies that showed  dramatic changes in the level of their QREs from one year to the next.  We  extended our search for potential merger and spin-off candidates to any  companies in the annual SOI samples that accounted for at least 0.1  percent of either QREs or grossed up credit in any year from 2000 through  2004.  In this manner we identified a number of pairs of taxpayers that  combined with or split off from one another during our panel period.  We  could usually confirm these corporate changes from publicly available  information on the Internet, but we also had the IRS examiners review our  linkages.

In cases in which one of our panel members in 2003 or 2004 had sold a  subsidiary or spun off some other entity that had been included in its  consolidated tax return in an earlier year of our panel period.  We  subtracted the estimated QREs of that spun-off entity from the panel  member\u2019s QREs for that earlier year.  (We assumed that the spun-off  entity\u2019s share of total QREs in the earlier year was the same proportion  as the following ratio:  The spun-off entity\u2019s QREs in the first year that  it filed its own return, divided by the sum of the spun-off companies  QREs plus the QREs of the corporation from which it had been spun  off.)", "By making these adjustments, we were able to create reasonably  consistent spending histories for those cases where we had identified (on  our own or with the assistance of IRS examiners) significant corporate  reorganizations in our panel population.

First, for claimants  of the regular credit we computed the ratio of the amount of credit they  claimed, divided by the difference between their current QREs and their  base QREs.  If this ratio was a value other than 0.13 or 0.2, we flagged the  case as a potential group member.  Second, for claimants of the alternative  incremental research credit (AIRC), we computed the ratio of the credit  they actually claimed over the amount of credit that they could have  claimed if all of the QREs and gross receipts reported on their 6765 were  their own.  If this ratio was other than 1 or 0.65, we flagged the case as a  potential group claimant.  Third, we also searched the SOI databases for  groups of cases that reported the same exact amounts of QREs in a given  year.", "For the purpose of calculating the ASC for group members we gave each  member of a group the group\u2019s aggregate spending history and gross  receipts history; however, each member had its own amount of research  credit claimed and its own values for the variables taken from the general  business credit form.  In order to avoid double-counting (or more) the  QREs of the groups or giving them too much weight when computing our  weighted average effective rates of credit, we created a variable named  CREDSHR, which we then used to assign each group member only a  fraction of the group\u2019s total QREs or weighting in the effective rate  calculation.", "The value of CREDSHR for each group member is equal to the ratio of the  amount of research credit that the member claimed over the aggregated  amount of credit that the group would be able to claim, based on the  group\u2019s aggregated QREs and base QREs or gross receipts.  In other  words, we gave each member a share of the group\u2019s QREs that was  proportionate to its share of the group\u2019s total credit.  Although this  allocation method is not precisely derived from the group credit allocation  regulations, it should yield a close approximation of the true distribution  of QREs across group members.  We do not have the detailed attachments  to Form 6765 that show exactly what each group member\u2019s QREs and  gross receipts were.  In most cases the sum of CREDSHR for all members  of a group in our panel population was approximately equal to 100  percent.  When the sum did not reach 100 percent we assumed that there  are other members who were not represented in the SOI sample for a  given year.  The absence of these missing members does not affect the  validity of the computations for the group members we had; it simply  means that the missing members were treated as any other company that  did not meet the criteria for inclusion in our panel.", "Because some taxpayers in the panel belonged to controlled groups that  together determined the amount of qualified spending in 2003 or 2004, we  adjusted for the composition of these groups when we assembled the  panel.  In particular, spending and other variables were adjusted to hold  constant the group\u2019s composition in 2003 or 2004, the 2 years for which  credit was computed.  This was accomplished in several ways.  First, the  SOI data allowed us to identify certain controlled groups from  duplications in the amount of reported spending.  Second, we researched  mergers, acquisitions and dispositions for these firms from 2000 through  2004, or the years for which we constructed the panel.  Third, we  requested confirmation of our knowledge about these controlled groups  from LMSB, in addition to any other information about the groups\u2019  composition that LMSB might have had.

Our baseline prediction was that the probability of a taxpayer  moving from one particular ratio range into another specific ratio range  was equal the probability of such a move that we observed in our  historical data.  We used Markov chains of probabilities to predict changes  in status two and three years into the future.  In our sensitivity analysis, we  examined 12 alternative sets of probabilities.

Additionally, at higher discount rates, the effect of spending  in 2003 or 2004 on the amount of credit earned in subsequent years is  mitigated, since credit earned in subsequent years is worth less in present  value terms in 2003 and 2004 at higher rates of discount.

Lacking data on  carryforward patterns, we based our assumption about the length of the  carryforward period on behavior that was \u201cobserved\u201d as part of the  simulation.  For example, in some cases we could simulate the taxpayer\u2019s  carryforward status in both 2003 and 2004.

The taxpayer would receive an  additional $130,000 worth of credit if it increased its spending by $1  million, which represents a marginal effective rate (MER) of 13 percent\u2014- the maximum MER available under the regular credit.  The taxpayer\u2019s  total credit ($260,000) divided by its total spending ($11 million) equals its  average effective rate of credit (about 2.4 percent).  In the second example  the taxpayer\u2019s primary base exceeds the ideal base by $600,000, which  prevents the taxpayer from receiving any windfall credit; however, it also  reduces the incentive that the taxpayer has to spend another $1 million on  research by cutting the credit on that marginal spending from $130,000 to  $52,000, for an MER of 5.2 percent.  In the third example the taxpayer\u2019s  primary base is well above all of the spending that the taxpayer was  contemplating for the year, so the credit provides no incentive for the  taxpayer to increase its spending beyond what it would have done anyway.   The MER is zero.  The fourth example shows what could happen when a  taxpayer\u2019s primary base was much too low and if there were no minimum  base for the credit.  The credit would provide the taxpayer with the same  marginal incentive as in the first example; however, the taxpayer\u2019s windfall  credit would be nine times larger than in that first case.  Finally, the last  example shows how the minimum base can reduce the cost of the credit  by significantly reducing windfalls in some cases.  Unfortunately, this  windfall cannot be reduced without also cutting the marginal incentive.   Given that the minimum base is 50-percent of current spending, every $1  million of marginal spending increases the base by $500,000, so the  taxpayer can earn only $650,000 of credit on that spending, representing  an MER of 6.5 percent.", "ASC users currently are not subject to a minimum base.  If they were to be,  then the final example in figure 7 shows how that minimum base could  affect their current year credits.  The minimum base could also affect the  negative future-year effects arising from current-year marginal spending  (which were illustrated in figure 3).  If a taxpayer\u2019s primary base for the  ASC would be less than the minimum base in future years, even after  accounting for the increase due to current-year marginal spending, then  current spending would not cause any reduction in future credits.  If the  primary base exceeded the minimum base in future years, then the  negative future effects would occur, just as they did in the case without a  minimum base."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Issues Relating to the Definition of Qualified Research Expenses", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background and Significance", "paragraphs": ["In 1986, Congress narrowed the definition of qualified research out of a  concern that many taxpayers claiming the credit did not engage in high  technology activities and some claimed the credit for virtually any  expenditures relating to product development.

The act provided Treasury the authority to specify exceptions  to this exclusion; however, the legislative history to the Act states that  Congress intended that regulations would make the costs of new or  improved internal-use software (IUS) eligible for the credit only if the  research satisfies, in addition to the general requirements for credit  eligibility, the following three-part test that  1.  the software was innovative;  2.  the software development involved significant economic risk; and   3.  the software was not commercially available for use by the  taxpayer.", "The statutory exclusion for internal-use software and the regulatory  exceptions to this exclusion have been the subject of a series of proposed  and final regulations (and also considerable controversy).

In response to further taxpayer concerns Treasury  reconsidered the positions it took in TD 8930 and issued proposed  regulations on December 26, 2001, which stated, among other things, that,  unless computer software is developed to be commercially sold, leased,  licensed or otherwise marketed, for separately stated consideration to  unrelated third parties, it is presumed to be IUS.", "In publishing both TD 8930 and the proposed regulations Treasury  declined to adopt the recommendation of commentators that the  definition of IUS should not include software used to deliver a service to  customers or software that includes an interface with customers or the  public.  Financial services and telecommunications companies are among  those particularly concerned with this issue.  They note that their software  systems are integrally related to the provision of services to their  customers, yet expenditures to develop those systems would not qualify  for the credit (unless they met the additional set of standards) under the  \u201cseparately stated consideration\u201d standard because they do not charge  customers specifically for the use of the software.", "Several commentators noted that the original treatment of IUS introduced  by the 1986 act predated the occurrence of a dramatic shift in computer  usage that transformed the US economy from one based on production of  tangible goods to one based on services and information.

Some commentators supported their  recommendations for a narrower definition of IUS by referring to the  legislative history included in the Conference Report accompanying the  Tax Relief Extension Act of 1999, which included the following language:  The conferees further note the rapid pace of technological  advance, especially in service-related industries, and urge the  Secretary to consider carefully the comments he has and may  receive in promulgating regulations in connection with what  constitutes \u201cinternal use\u201d with respect to software expenditures.

IRS officials told  us that some exceptions were added to both TD 8930 and the proposed  regulations in response to the conference report.

Treasury said it was concerned about the  difficulty of effecting congressional intent behind the exclusion for  internal-use software with respect to software being developed today.  As  an example, it was concerned that the tendency toward the integration of  software across many functions of a taxpayer\u2019s business activities may  make it difficult for both taxpayers and the IRS to separate internal-use  software from non-internal-use software under any particular definition of  internal-use software.

This disparate treatment would give regular credit users some  incentive to pass their sales through foreign members rather than to sell  directly to foreign third parties.  It also would provide some advantage for  regular credit users to manufacture and sell products overseas, rather than  to manufacture them in the United States and sell them directly to third  parties overseas; however, it would not give those users any advantage to  manufacture overseas, rather than to manufacture in the United States and  pass their sales through foreign members.  It is not clear that any of these  incentive effects that would result from this option would be significant  relative to the many other tax and nontax factors that businesses consider  when deciding where to locate their activities and how to route products  and transfers through their affiliates.  Perhaps most importantly, this  option could exclude a substantial amount of export sales of U.S.  multinational corporations from gross receipts.  This result would favor  regular credit users whose export sales have increased as a share of their  total sales and disfavor users whose export shares have declined.

In the case  of the research credit, a taxpayer must provide evidence that all of the  expenses for which the credit is claimed were devoted to qualified  research activities, as defined under IRC section 41.  Under that section  the qualification of research activities are determined separately with  respect to each business component (e.g., a product, process, or formula),  which means that the taxpayer must be able to allocate all of its qualified  expenses to specific business components.

Standard business accounting  typically focuses on the financial status of organizational units, such as  geographical or functional departments.  Large businesses often have cost  centers, which are separately identified units (such as research,  engineering, manufacturing and marketing departments) in which costs  can be segregated and the manager of the center is responsible for all of its  expenses.  Project accounting is the practice of creating reports that track  the financial status of specific projects, the cost of which are often  incurred across multiple organizational units.", "Practitioners that work with both large multinational corporations and  small family-owned businesses told us that most of their clients claiming  the research credit do not use project accounting. Project accounting is  typically used by government contractors, which are usually required to  account for their costs on a contract-by-contract basis, and in certain  industries, such as pharmaceuticals and software development.  However,  even those firms that use project accounting need to collect additional  details that are required only for purposes of claiming the credit.   Consequently, many firms rely on third-party consultants (with expertise  in the complexities of research credit rules) to conduct studies that bridge  their cost-center accounting of research expenditures to project-based  accounting that is acceptable to IRS.  IRS and practitioners often refer to  this attempt to bridge the two accounting approaches as the \u201chybrid\u201d  approach.", "A key component of the documentation needed to support a credit claim,  regardless of which accounting approach a taxpayer uses, is the allocation  of wage expenses between qualifying and nonqualifying activities.  In the  case of a taxpayer using project accounting, those accounts make it easier  to demonstrate that an employee worked on a project to develop a new or  improved business component; however, even then, additional support is  needed to show how much of the employee\u2019s time was spent on activities  that qualify as a process of experimentation intended to eliminate  uncertainty (or on a qualifying support activity).  In the case of a taxpayer  using cost-center accounting, documentation also needs to be generated to  show the amount of wages devoted to each qualifying project.  Wage  allocations made by consultants are typically based on after-the-fact  surveys or interviews of managers who are asked to estimate the percent  time that their employees spent on different projects and activities.  In  addition, subject matter experts (SME), such as a firm\u2019s managers,  scientists and engineers, are often interviewed to gain explanations of how  particular activities meet the standards of qualifying research.  Some of the  consultants also told us they also try to gather whatever relevant technical  documentation may exist to support this testimonial evidence.  In the case  of large corporations with numerous research projects detailed allocation  estimates may be made for only a representative sample of projects and  then extrapolated across the population of all projects.", "There were wide difference in opinions between the IRS examiners and  the tax practitioners we interviewed regarding what methods are  acceptable for allocating wages between qualifying and nonqualifying  activities.  Practitioners noted that IRS used to accept cost center or  hybrid accounting in the absence of project accounting; however, in recent  years IRS has been much less willing to accept claims based on the first  two approaches.  They also said that IRS examiners now regularly require  contemporaneous documentation of qualified research expenses (QRE),  even though this requirement was dropped from the credit regulations in  2001.  Some practitioners suggested that the changes in IRS\u2019s practices  came about because examiners were having difficulty determining how  much QREs to disallow in audits when they found that a particular activity  did not qualify.  Others said that IRS does not want to devote the  considerable amounts of labor required to review the hybrid  documentation.  The IRS officials we interviewed said that many more  taxpayers have or had project accounting than was suggested by the tax  practitioners.  The officials said that the consultants ignored these  accounts because they boxed them in (in terms of identifying qualified  research expenses).  They noted that, before the surge in new claims by  firms that had never claimed the credit previously, taxpayers used to  supply more documentary evidence, such as budgets and e-mails.  In their  view the use of high level surveys and uncorroborated testimony of SMEs  are not a sufficient basis for identifying QREs.  The officials noted that  sometimes consultants conduct interviews for one tax year and then  extrapolate their results to support credit claims for multiple earlier tax  years  In their view, these are the types of claims that the new penalty on  erroneous claims will combat.  These officials would also like to see a  new line item added to tax returns on which taxpayers would be required  to show the amount of the research deduction they were claiming under  IRC section 174.  They would like to make taxpayers go on record as  having considered the expenses to be research when they first incurred  them, rather than after the fact on an amended return.", "A common complaint among the practitioners we interviewed is that IRS  examiners routinely reject their credit studies but will not also say what  would be acceptable, short of contemporaneous project-based accounts.   They also say that IRS mixes up a taxpayer\u2019s requirement to keep records  and what is required to substantiate credit claims.  The taxpayers do have  records of all their expenses, but not of which ones are tied to qualified  activities.  Supplemental records and narratives are needed to explain how  the expenses qualify.  The practitioners said that it is unreasonable to  expect that many businesses will maintain contemporaneous records of  how much time each of their employees spends on qualified activities  simply for purposes of claiming the credit; therefore, after-the-fact  estimated allocations should be allowed.  Some observed that when  Congress renewed the credit in 1999 it expressed concern about  unnecessary and costly taxpayer recordkeeping burdens and reaffirmed  that \u201celigibility for the credit is not intended to be contingent on meeting  unreasonable recordkeeping requirements.\u201d  They also note that recent  court decisions have allowed the research tax credit in the absence of  contemporaneous allocations when the evidence provided by the taxpayer  has been convincing, which courts have cited in two recently decided  research tax credit cases.  IRS officials told us that their current practices  are consistent with these recent decisions, which, they emphasize, require  estimates to have a credible evidentiary basis.  The key issue is not the  contemporaneity of the evidence, but its quality (e.g., time survey  estimates made by employees who actually performed or supervised the  research, rather than estimates made by someone in the firm\u2019s tax  department who had no first-hand knowledge of the research).  Some  practitioners doubted the usefulness of specific recordkeeping guidelines,  given the wide range of practice across industries.  Others would greatly  welcome additional guidance and thought that the separate audit  technique guides that IRS developed for the pharmaceuticals and  aerospace industries, which several practitioners commended, could serve  as models.", "IRS officials say that they do not require project-based accounting records  and they disagree with taxpayer assertions that they routinely deny credit  claims for lack of such accounting or lack of contemporaneous records.   Examiners consider these types of records to be the most reliable and  relevant form of substantiation; however, in the absence of project-based  accounts, the examiners are instructed to consider and verify all credible  evidence.", "The officials note that two audit technique guides (ATG) they have  published\u2014one (issued in June 2005) covering research credit issues in  general and the other (issued in May 2008) covering issues relating to  amended claims\u2014provide general descriptions of necessary  documentation and lists specific types of  documentation that would be  acceptable for addressing particular issues.  The latter states that IRS  does not have to accept either estimates or extrapolations because IRC  section 6001 requires taxpayers to keep records to support their claims.  It  instructs examiners to consider the extent to which taxpayers rely on oral  testimony and/or estimations, rather than documentation, when deciding  whether to reject a claim and that information to support the claim should  be contemporaneous.  Examiners are also directed to consider whether  oral testimony was from employees who actually performed the qualified  research and how much time elapsed between the research and the  testimony.  To enable examiners to make such determinations without  having to go through often voluminous amounts of documentation, IRS is  now requiring examiners to issue a standardized information document  request (IDR) questionnaire to all taxpayers with amended claims for the  research tax credit that are in the early stages of examination.  This IDR  asks taxpayers for complete answers (not just references to other  documentation) to questions concerning key aspects of the support for  their credit claims.  For example, the IDR asks what percentage of QREs  are base on oral testimony or employee surveys, who was interviewed or  surveyed, and how much time elapsed between the claim year and the  time of the interview or survey.  If some of the support for the answers is  contained in other records, the taxpayer must supply specific location  references.  The ATG advises examiners that, in some cases they can use  the responses to the IDR alone to determine that the amount claimed is  not adequately supported and should be disallowed without further  examination.", "The IRS officials we interviewed pointed to the research credit  recordkeeping agreements (RCRA) as examples of the recordkeeping that  they would accept and some practitioners said that IRS could use the  knowledge it gained through RCRAs about industry-specific record  keeping practices to develop more industry-specific recordkeeping  guidance.

In other cases, taxpayers make claims based on  studies that consultants have sold to them on a contingency-fee basis.    Treasury Circular No. 230 now prohibits those who practice before IRS  from collecting contingency fees for these types of studies; however, some  studies may be prepared by consultants who do not practice before IRS.", "IRS officials said one reason that led the agency to designate the credit as  a Tier 1 issue was to push taxpayers to make better initial credit claims  before IRS spends substantial time on audits.  As a result of the Tier I  designation, the research credit has been assigned an issue management  team to ensure that the issue is fully developed with appropriate direction  and a compliance resolution strategy.  Three requirements that currently  form part of this strategy are that:    all claims for the credit that are not made on or before the due date of  the taxpayer\u2019s Form 1120 for a given tax year must be filed at IRS\u2019s  Ogden Service Center;    examiners must issue a standardized information document request  (IDR) to taxpayers at the outset of all new examinations of the credit;  and  in all cases where any amount of a research credit claim is disallowed  by IRS, the examiners must determine whether the recently enacted  penalty for filing erroneous claims for refund or credit should be  applied.   The examiners must obtain and document the concurrence of  a technical advisor in all such cases where they decide not to impose  the penalty.", "Although most of the tax practitioners we interviewed acknowledged that  there was a proliferation of aggressive and sometimes sloppy research  credit claims, they pointed to many legitimate reasons for companies to  file claims on amended returns, including the following:      Substantiating and documenting research expenses in a manner that is  acceptable to IRS is time consuming and labor intensive, making it  difficult to file for the credit on a timely basis on an original return.   The firms\u2019 tax preparers need the assistance of the firms\u2019 scientists,  engineers, and technicians, who cannot be made available in time for a  current-year filing.  Pulling these technical experts away from their  research represents a significant financial burden for taxpayers.   Consequently, when taxpayers go through this effort it makes sense for  them to cover multiple tax years at a time on amended returns.    The prevalence of amended returns in recent years also can be  attributed to long-standing uncertainties in credit regulations.  The  definition of qualified research expenses was only resolved in final  regulations in 2003, and the \u201cdiscovery test\u201d was also abandoned in  the final regulations by Treasury and IRS.  This clarification of the  rules prompted taxpayers to file claims for the credit for past tax years  on amended returns.  Similarly, changes in regulations relating to the  definition of gross receipts also prompted many taxpayers to file  amended claims.", "Start-up companies often don\u2019t consider it worthwhile to file credit  claims until they turn profitable.

Taxpayers are required  to use the same definitions of qualified research and gross receipts for  both their base period and their current-year spending and receipts.   However, given the fact that few firms have good (if any) expenditure  records dating back to the early 1980s base period, most firms are unable  to precisely adjust their base period records for the changes in definitions  promulgated in subsequent regulations and rulings.

The practitioners\u2019 biggest concern is that, unless taxpayers can achieve a  10 percent relative precision in their estimates, IRS makes them use the  lower limit of the confidence interval for their estimates of QREs, which is  the least advantageous to the taxpayer.  Practitioners say this standard is  too difficult to meet, even in cases where taxpayers use large samples, and  that IRS should have a less demanding threshold for allowing taxpayers to  use point estimates.  Moreover, they objected to IRS\u2019s requirement that  they exclude the \u201ccertainty stratum\u201d when calculating relative precision,  which they considered to be just bad statistics.  IRS officials responded  that having a precision threshold encourages taxpayers to do a quality  sample and that 10 percent precision is a good indicator of a high quality  sample.  They said that without some control standards taxpayers could  try to make do with very small samples.  The officials also noted that there  are methods other than increasing sample sizes, such as improving sample  design, population definition and stratification techniques, by which  taxpayers can reduce their sampling errors.  With respect to the exclusion  of the certainty stratum, IRS acknowledged that this requirement was not  justified on statistical grounds; however, they believe it is needed to  prevent potential abuses.

IRS  acknowledged that the practitioners\u2019 point was correct from a statistical  point of view; however, they noted that, given the incremental nature of  the credit, that it is important for estimates of QREs to be accurate for  each specific year, not just over the multi-year period as a whole.

A group could, thereby, increase the amount of credit it  earned without actually increasing its research spending in the aggregate.   Department of the Treasury and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) officials  told us that the rules also guard against manipulation within a group that  would shift credits from members with tax losses to those with tax  liabilities.  Under the Internal Revenue Code (IRC), for purposes of  determining the amount of the research credit, the qualified expenses of  the same controlled groups of corporations are aggregated together.  The  language of the relevant subsection specifically states that:  A.  all members of the same controlled group of corporations shall be  treated as a single taxpayer, and  B.  the credit (if any) allowable under this section to each such  member shall be its proportionate share of the qualified research  expenses and basic research payments giving rise to the credit.", "Congress directed that Treasury regulations drafted to implement these  aggregation rules be consistent with these stated principles.", "Under current Treasury regulations the controlled group of corporations  must, first, compute a \u201cgroup credit\u201d by applying all of the credit  computational rules on an aggregate basis.

The stand-alone entity credit means the  research credit (if any) that would be allowed to each group member if the  group credit rules did not apply.  Each member must compute its stand- alone credit according to whichever method provides it the largest credit  for that year without regard to the method used to compute the group  credit.

The consultants with whom we discussed this  issue agreed that the rules were very burdensome for those groups that are  affected.  Some very large corporate groups must do these computations  for all of their subsidiaries, which could number in the hundreds, and they  have no affect on the total credit that a group earns.  None of these  affected groups can benefit from the simplified recordkeeping that the  ASC offers to other taxpayers because they must be able to show which  stand-alone credit method provides the highest credit for each member,  which can only be done by computing the credit under both the ASC and  regular credit rules (and AIRC rules in the years for which it was available)  for each member.

If a group, as a  whole, is above its base spending amount, then an additional dollar of  spending by any group member will increase the group credit by the same  amount, regardless of how the group credit total is allocated among  members.  Some would say, in this sense, all QREs give rise to the credit to  the same extent.  Several public commentators and consultants we  interviewed recommend that groups be allowed to allocate their group  credits by any reasonable means, as long as the sum of the credits that  each member receives does not exceed the group credit amount.", "Treasury maintains that a single, prescribed method is necessary to ensure  the group\u2019s members collectively do not claim more than 100 percent of  the group credit.  An official explained that if two members of a group  each used a different method that maximized their share of the group  credit, this would result in the members claiming in aggregate more than  the group credit amount.  If taxpayers could use any reasonable method of  allocation and group members used different methods, then IRS would  have no basis for saying whose individual credit had to be reduced in  order that the aggregate claims by members did not exceed the group  credit amount.  While acknowledging that disagreements within groups  are likely to be rare, the official noted a case where representatives of two  members of the same group separately argued in favor of differing  allocation rules.", "Treasury also maintains that the stand-alone credit approach is more  consistent with Congress\u2019s intent to have an incremental credit than is the  gross QRE approach.  According to Treasury, the former approach  appears to be the only one that would provide each member some  incentive to exceed their base spending amount, given that each member  may not know the tax positions of other group members (i.e., current-year  and base QREs) until the end of the tax year.  The individual member may  not know the extent to which one more dollar of its own spending will  increase the group credit amount, but it does know that by maximizing its  stand-alone credit amount, it will maximize its share of whatever amount  the group earns as a credit in the aggregate.  An IRS official added that  requiring everyone to use the stand-alone method would ensure a fairer  distribution of the credit within groups.  Otherwise, a parent corporation  may discriminate in favor of 100-percent owned members and against 50- percent members in the allocation of credits because some of the benefit  given to the latter would go to unrelated parties."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Consequences of Alternative Decisions", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Effects on Compliance and Enforcement Burden", "paragraphs": ["Allowing controlled groups to use an alternative allocation method could  significantly reduce both the compliance burden on the affected groups  and IRS\u2019s cost of verifying their compliance.

If  the group credit is computed according to the method that yields the  largest credit, then an additional dollar of spending by any group member  will increase the group credit by the same amount, regardless of how the  group credit total is allocated among members.

The effect of this type of shifting on the efficiency of the credit  should be relatively minor because, when a credit is carried forward, the  benefit to the taxpayer and the cost to the government are both  discounted to the same degree.
