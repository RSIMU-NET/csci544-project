Huddle\u2019s updated study made this assumption in estimating costs for Head Start and adult education. For other programs, the studies adjusted the national recipiency rate or average cost upward or downward to reflect a presumed difference in the use of the program by illegal aliens.

With regard to the first issue, the national studies focused on local services provided to the general public; the only such state or federal service that any of them included was highway services.

Using marginal cost\u2014the cost of providing a service to one additional user\u2014would better reflect the additional costs due to the presence of illegal aliens.

However, on the cost side, the researchers draw sharply different conclusions: Huddle estimates that illegal aliens generated $3.3 billion in Social Security costs; the Urban Institute estimates that no Social Security costs were generated by illegal aliens.", "This difference reflects a disagreement about the conceptual approach to measuring Social Security costs. The Urban Institute study views the Social Security costs for illegal aliens in a given year as the amount of benefits paid to this population in that year. The rationale for this view is that the federal government treats Social Security costs and revenues on a current accounts basis: in calculating the annual federal budget deficit (or surplus), Social Security taxes are treated as revenues and Social Security benefits as expenses. However, the Social Security Administration does not have data on the amount of Social Security benefits paid to illegal aliens; as a result, it is unclear whether the Urban Institute\u2019s assumption that this amount was zero is reasonable.", "In contrast, Huddle\u2019s updated study views Social Security costs in terms of the \u201cpresent value of future benefits\u201d that illegal aliens will collect.

Moreover, the national studies varied considerably in the range of items they included and their treatment of certain items, making their estimates difficult to compare. As a result, a great deal of uncertainty remains about the national fiscal impact of illegal aliens.", "Obtaining better data on the illegal alien population would help improve the national net cost estimates. Recognizing the difficulties inherent in collecting better data on a population with an incentive to keep its status hidden from government officials, any effort to collect better data should focus on those characteristics of the illegal alien population that are useful in estimating the largest net cost items, or many of them. These characteristics include the population\u2019s size, geographic distribution, age distribution, income distribution, labor force participation rate, tax compliance rate, and extent of school participation.", "Clearer explanations of which costs and revenues are appropriate to include would also help improve the usefulness of the estimates. The appropriateness of including any particular item may depend on the policy questions addressed by a study. If studies were more explicit about the questions they address, their estimates of net costs would be easier to compare.", "The expert panel convened by the U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform could serve as a forum for discussing some of these data and conceptual issues. By exploring ways to provide lawmakers with better information on the public fiscal impact of illegal aliens, researchers could help provide a basis for the development of appropriate policy responses to address the problems of illegal immigration."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We obtained comments on a draft of this report from the Urban Institute and Donald Huddle (see apps. V and VI). In their comments, the researchers restated their disagreements with each other on a number of topics, including the size of the illegal alien population, the appropriate treatment of costs for citizen children of illegal aliens and Social Security costs, and the magnitude of indirect costs such as those attributable to job displacement. The researchers also cited areas in which they maintained that our report did not sufficiently identify the problems with each other\u2019s estimates. In addition, they provided technical comments that we incorporated where appropriate to better characterize the methodologies they used in their net cost estimates.", "The Urban Institute researchers agreed with much of the report\u2019s analysis and its conclusions about the need for better data on the illegal alien population and sharper definitions of the accounting framework used. However, they took exception with two points in our report. They maintained that it is possible to test the reasonableness of the underlying assumptions used in the net cost estimates by developing estimates for reference groups and that their estimate of Social Security costs attributable to illegal aliens was reasonable. Huddle disagreed with several of the report\u2019s findings. He maintained that the report was too negative in claiming that the reasonableness of many of the assumptions in the net cost estimates is unknown. In elaborating this point, Huddle argued that the results of various surveys of illegal aliens\u2019 use of public benefits are consistent with the utilization rates in his cost estimates. Huddle also asserted that our report\u2019s criticism of his Social Security and displacement cost estimates were unjustified.", "We believe that our report accurately describes the problems researchers face in developing estimates of the national fiscal impact of the illegal alien population. With regard to the reasonableness of the assumptions in the net cost estimates, we agree with Urban Institute researchers that developing cost and revenue estimates for reference groups can provide a \u201creality check\u201d on estimates for illegal aliens, as well as a useful context for assessing the net cost estimates. However, the use of reference groups provides only a limited test and does not ensure that the estimates for a particular immigrant group are reasonable. We find Huddle\u2019s claim that the assumptions in his estimates are consistent with the results of survey studies problematic for several reasons. The utilization rates reported by these studies vary considerably, the reliability of some of the studies has been questioned, and the extent to which the findings of these studies can be generalized to the illegal alien population nationwide is unclear.", "On the issue of Social Security costs for illegal aliens, we continue to believe that data limitations preclude the development of a reasonable estimate. To support their estimate that these costs are zero, the Urban Institute researchers cited some reasons why illegal aliens are not likely to be receiving Social Security benefits. Huddle, on the other hand, criticized the Urban Institute\u2019s estimate by citing several reasons for believing that illegal aliens are receiving benefits. Given the researchers\u2019 disagreement and the lack of national data on the number of illegal aliens receiving benefits, we have no basis for supporting either of these positions. Data limitations also lead us to question Huddle\u2019s estimate of Social Security costs. For example, Huddle claimed that at least 75 percent of illegal aliens in the work force have valid Social Security numbers, but he did not provide sufficient evidence to support this claim. Moreover, data are not available to assess his claim.", "Finally, with regard to the magnitude of displacement costs, we continue to believe that Huddle\u2019s estimate overstates these costs because it is based on a displacement rate that is inconsistent with research findings on job displacement. (See pp. 32-33 for a more detailed discussion of Huddle\u2019s comments and our responses on this issue).", "The comments from the Urban Institute and Huddle reinforce our assessment of how difficult it is to develop estimates of the national fiscal impact of illegal aliens, given the limited data available. As noted in this report, obtaining better data on some of the key characteristics of the illegal alien population could help narrow the gap between the researchers\u2019 widely varying estimates of the national net cost. Moreover, clearer explanations of the approaches used would make the net cost estimates more useful.", "Our work was conducted in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

The figures that Huddle cited in his 1982-83, 1985, and 1989-90 \u201cmicrostudies of job displacement\u201d are based on the percentages of unemployed native workers he surveyed who were still unemployed after some period of time. However, these figures cannot be construed as measures of displacement by illegal aliens because the studies did not show that the unemployed natives lost their jobs to illegal aliens or were unable to find work because of the presence of illegal aliens in the Houston labor market.", "In effect, Huddle\u2019s microstudies of job displacement assumed a correlation between the employment of illegal aliens and the unemployment of native workers that was unsupported by any evidence.

Furthermore, Huddle\u2019s interpretation of Altonji and Card\u2019s econometric results is based on an incorrect use of statistics. Huddle sums the coefficients from three separate regression equations, each with a different dependent variable.", "The work of other researchers does not support the claim of a 25-percent displacement rate. Our 1986 review of the literature on job displacement concluded that illegal aliens may displace native workers. However, it found that the available research was inconclusive because it was limited and suffered from important methodological weaknesses. In addition, the experts that we consulted during our review agreed that while there is no consensus on what the average displacement rate might be, the literature on displacement does not support the claim of a rate as high as 25 percent. Recent studies using nationwide data have concluded that job displacement by aliens is either small in magnitude or nonexistent. The literature on job displacement that focuses specifically on illegal aliens has reached the same conclusion."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Huddle\u2019s Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In his comments on a draft of our report, Huddle maintained that our criticism of his displacement cost estimate was unjustified (see app. VI). Huddle made four main points about our discussion of displacement. First, he contended that we had misunderstood his definition of displacement and were not including other types of displaced workers, such as teenagers who could not find first-time jobs and workers who had to physically move in order to look for work. Second, Huddle maintained that the coefficients from the four different equations in the Altonji and Card study are additive. Third, Huddle claimed that we did not consider the effect of illegal immigrants on wage depression as well as job displacement. Finally, Huddle maintained that his interpretation of the literature on job displacement was valid and that other experts would agree with him.", "With respect to Huddle\u2019s definition of displacement, we do not agree that it is valid to apply this broader definition in calculating the costs of the array of social service benefits he cites. Workers who have never entered the labor force cannot collect unemployment benefits, for example, and teenagers in particular are not likely to be individually eligible for the full range of welfare benefits. Workers who migrate elsewhere, that is, those who are physically displaced due to the presence of illegal aliens in the work force, may not necessarily be jobless or earning such a low wage in their new place of residence that they would be eligible for welfare benefits. Most importantly, there is no evidence of how many displaced workers remain permanently unemployed and, therefore, continue to collect welfare over a long period of time. In our view, ascribing full costs to this broader set of workers overstates the true cost of displacement.", "With respect to Huddle\u2019s claim that the coefficients in table 7.7 of the Altonji and Card study are additive, we disagree. Adding the coefficients on the first equation, which measures the ratio of people in the labor force to the population as a whole, and the second equation, which measures the ratio of employed persons to the population as a whole, effectively double-counts all employed persons, because the second ratio is a subset of the first. In addition, no other researcher we consulted, including one of the authors, interpreted the Altonji and Card study in the way that Huddle did, nor did they agree with Huddle\u2019s methodology of adding coefficients from separate regression equations to get a measure of total labor displacement.", "With respect to Huddle\u2019s claim that we overlooked the phenomenon of wage depression, we did not make an evaluation of the impact of illegal aliens on wage depression because that was outside the scope of the net cost studies we reviewed. These studies specified job displacement only, and it is our judgment that the evidence on job displacement is much weaker than the evidence on wage depression. Huddle\u2019s claim that job displacement and wage depression are close substitutes in terms of their impact on the low-skill native work force and on the net cost of public services is not supported by any empirical evidence or reference to any relevant literature.", "Finally, with respect to our overall conclusion and our interpretation of the literature, we thoroughly reviewed the literature and consulted with recognized experts on immigration (see app. IV for a list of these persons).
