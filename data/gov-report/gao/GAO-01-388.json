Specifically, you expressed  concern about the extent to which such competitions might adversely  affect the pay and benefits of former federal employees and could result  simply in shifting government jobs to the private sector at lower pay and  benefits. This report draws on our previous work examining the results of  A-76 competitions within the Department of Defense and additional data to  describe (1) how A-76 competitions reduce estimated costs of Defense  activities and (2) what impact the competitions have on affected federal  employees\u2019 employment, pay, and benefits."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Since 1955, the executive branch has encouraged federal agencies to obtain  commercially available goods and services from the private sector when  the agencies determined that such action was cost-effective. The Office of  Management and Budget formalized the policy in Circular A-76, issued in  1966. Later, it issued a supplemental handbook that provided the  procedures for competitively determining whether commercial activities  should be performed in house, by another federal agency through  interservice support agreements, or by the private sector. In general, the  competition process involves the government describing work to be  performed, such as aircraft maintenance or base operating support, in a  performance work statement and soliciting private sector offers. The  government also prepares an in-house cost estimate to perform the same  work based on its most efficient organization. The government estimate is  then compared to the selected offer from the private sector to determine  who will perform the function.", "We have previously reported that A-76 studies can produce cost reductions  whether the competitions are won by the public or the private sector. Cost  reductions result from efforts to achieve more efficient organizations. At  the same time, we have also noted some limitations in (1) the preciseness  of the Department of Defense\u2019s savings estimates from A-76 studies due to  such factors as the need to offset up-front investment costs associated with  conducting the studies and implementing the results and (2) baseline  operating costs against which savings are calculated.", "When contractor performance is chosen, wages and benefits are often  governed by the Service Contract Act for services or the Davis Bacon Act  for construction, which prescribes minimum pay and benefits for  contractor employees under government contracts. The Service Contract  Act of 1965 provides that pay and benefit levels be established by the  Department of Labor for certain contractor employees, including, for  example, office clerks and aircraft maintenance workers. The Davis Bacon  Act of 1931 provides for the establishment of minimum pay and benefit  levels, again to be set by the Department of Labor, for most construction  skill classifications. Some employees, however, may be covered by existing  collective bargaining agreements.", "The Department of Labor is responsible for administering the provisions of  these acts. It periodically establishes and reassesses pay and benefit levels  based on a survey of the wages offered by the private sector in local  geographic areas by skill classification. It also establishes flat hourly rates  for skill classifications in different geographical areas based on the median  level of pay for those job classifications in those areas. The Department of  Labor periodically reassesses the rates and publishes updates when the  median levels change.", "In terms of other benefits, the Service Contract Act and the Davis Bacon  Act require contractors to provide a minimum level of benefits.  Contractors, however, have flexibility in the types of benefits they provide.  For example, they could provide a combination of benefits, such as  retirement, and health and life insurance, as long as benefits meet or  exceed the minimum level. They also could allow employees to place some  or all the benefit amount in a 401(k) plan or receive the benefit in cash."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Costs Reduced Primarily From Using Fewer Persons to Perform Required Work", "paragraphs": ["Our analysis and discussions with government and private sector officials  that are involved in A-76 competitions continue to affirm, as we previously  reported, that most estimated cost reductions from competitions are  related to reduced personnel cost estimates\u2014mostly a reduction in  personnel requirements. Government and contractor officials told us they  use a variety of techniques to minimize the number of personnel needed to  perform a required function. These techniques include limiting proposed  activities to the streamlined requirements detailed in the performance  work statement, substituting civilian for military workers, designing a new  work process, multiskilling (employees performing more than one skill),  and proposing modern methods and equipment to complete the tasks.", "Contractor and defense officials stated that personnel reductions are key to  achieving reduced costs from A-76 competitions. For example, we  previously reported on an A-76 competition involving aircraft maintenance  at the Altus Air Force Base, Oklahoma, where the Air Force estimated cost  reductions of $20 million annually. In initiating the study, the Air Force  planned to convert its largely military workforce to civilian personnel,  either government employees or employees of a contractor, depending on  the results of the A-76 study. Either way, civilian workers were expected to  be less costly. The organization in place before the study had 1,444  authorized positions: 1,401 were military positions. After the study, the  selected government organization had 735 positions\u2014all civilians, almost a  50-percent reduction.", "A performance work statement serves as the basis for determining  personnel requirements for both government estimates and private sector  offers. Because labor represents the predominant costs in an A-76 study,  both the in-house government organization and the contractors develop  work strategies that enable them to perform the work requirements with  the minimum number of people. They also develop their personnel  requirements by determining the skill classifications needed and the  number of staff hours per classification to complete tasks over a time  period. For example, if they had an average need for 240 hours of plumbing  tasks each 40-hour week, then they would need six people with plumbing  skills. Contractors told us they use the least costly skill classification and  multiskill and multirole employees to complete the required tasks. For  simple plumbing, electrical, and carpentry tasks, a less costly maintenance  worker classification could be used, not a fully qualified electrician, for  example. Contractors also have the flexibility to use temporary or seasonal  workers to meet periodic workload needs, pay overtime, or pay higher  wages to workers in a lower pay classification to temporarily perform tasks  performed by employees in a higher classification. The government can use  many of these techniques, but it may need to obtain the cooperation of  employee groups and obtain waivers to personnel procedures."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Impact of A-76 Competitions on Affected Employees\u2019 Employment, Pay, and Benefits Varies", "paragraphs": ["The impact on employment, pay, and benefits of individual employees  affected by A-76 studies varies depending on factors such as the results of  the competitions, the availability of other government jobs, and other more  individual factors such as retirement eligibility. Pay may also be affected by  the location and technical nature of the work. These factors make it  difficult to draw universal conclusions about the effects of A-76 decisions  on affected federal employees\u2019 employment options, pay, and benefits. Our  analysis of the results of three A-76 case studies, one that remained a  government activity and two won by the private sector, illustrates how  federal employees may be affected. The three studies show that about half  of the civilian government employees remained in federal service, either in  the new or another government organization, with similar pay and benefits,  and most of the remaining employees received a cash incentive of up to  $25,000 to retire or separate. A small number of employees were  involuntarily separated. Further, we found that all employees that applied  for positions with winning contractors were hired. Types of benefits  provided by the contractors, such as health insurance, vacation time, and  savings plans, appeared to be similar to those offered by the government.  Results of these three cases are highlighted below and further summarized  in appendix I.

Employees may be faced with positions being downgraded or even  eliminated. However, the ultimate impact on pay and benefits of affected  employees varies, depending on factors such as availability of other federal  positions, retirement eligibility, or use of \u201csave pay\u201d provisions associated  with exercising employment rights under federal personnel reduction- in-force rules.", "In establishing the new in-house organization, a reduction-in-force usually  occurs. To minimize disruptions that can occur as the result of a reduction-  in-force, the Department of Defense offers eligible employees a cash  incentive, up to $25,000, to retire or voluntarily separate. According to  reduction-in-force procedures, a government employee that accepts a  lower graded position is eligible to retain his/her former grade and pay for 2 years. At the end of the 2-year period, if the employee remains in the same  position, his/her grade may be lowered, but his/her current pay is not  lowered, although future pay raises may be limited. Employees who do not  obtain positions in the new organization have priority for placement in  other jobs within the Department of Defense for which they are qualified.", "One case study at Wright Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, involved studying  623 positions\u2014428 civilian and 195 military. The in-house organization won  the competition and the number of positions was reduced to 345 civilian  positions and the military personnel were reassigned to other duties. In this  case, 83 full-time civilian positions were eliminated. Of the employees in  the positions eliminated, 28 obtained other government positions, 53 chose  voluntary retirement, and 2 were involuntarily separated.", "Of the 345 employees authorized for the new organization, 310 came from  the previous organization. Available information indicated that among  those employees,  52 percent experienced a reduction in grade,  31 percent remained at the same grade level,  1 percent obtained a higher grade level, and  15 percent changed wage systems, making it difficult for us to determine  the impact on their grade level.", "As mentioned previously, those employees who had reductions in grade  may not experience a decrease in actual pay or benefits."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Impacts on Employees\u2019 Pay and Benefits Where Competitions Are Won by the Private Sector", "paragraphs": ["When a contractor wins a competition, generally positions associated with  the in-house organization are eliminated through a reduction-in-force and  all government civilian workers in the former activity must evaluate their  options. In general, this means they must obtain other government  employment, retire, or separate, as discussed previously. Employees who  retire or separate may also have the option of working for the contractor.  Separated employees have right-of-first refusal for employment with  winning contractors for positions for which they are qualified.", "In the two studies we examined where contractors won, approximately  two-thirds of the affected civilian employees accepted a cash incentive to  voluntarily retire or separate. About 25 percent obtained other government  jobs and generally retained their same pay and benefit levels. The  remaining employees, less than 10 percent, were involuntarily separated.  Some of the retired and separated workers applied for a job with the  contractors and, according to the contractors\u2019 officials, all were hired.", "Contractors we spoke with indicated that they actively recruit displaced  and retired workers because they do not usually have a readily available  workforce in place to staff the new organization. Further, they stated that  they want to hire as many former government employees as possible  because it gives them an experienced workforce and also lowers their  recruiting, hiring, and training costs compared to hiring an external  workforce. We were told that all former separated or retired employees  who applied with these two contractors were hired. However, not all  separated or retired government employees sought employment with the  contractors. One contractor told us approximately 60 percent of the staff it  hired were former civilian or military employees. Another contractor  reported hiring about 20 percent.", "Employees that go to work for a contractor may have a different salary  than what they had with the government, which could be higher or lower.", "Salaries and benefits for most employees that provide services on  government contracts are based on the pay and benefit wage scales  established pursuant to the Service Contract Act. Contractors we spoke  with said they must minimize labor costs to win the competition\u2014first  against other competing contractors and then against the in-house  government estimate. Therefore, they do not typically submit offers with  higher pay and benefit levels than the minimum established by the  Department of Labor under the Service Contract Act. Thus, while the  contract labor rates can differ either positively or negatively for a former  government employee, for covered positions, the contractor must pay  wages that prevail in a given geographic area.", "In the two contractor case studies, information was not readily available to  identify precise changes in pay for the former government employees who  had accepted employment with the winning contractors. In general, for the  one contractor where we analyzed pay changes, we identified instances  where pay rates were less and in other instances where pay rates were  more than before. However, the precise difference was not always clear  because of limited information on employees\u2019 previous salaries. In many  instances, these former government employees received a cash incentive to  leave government service and were also receiving federal retirement  benefits.", "In terms of benefits, table 1 shows that the government and contractor  employees in our case studies were provided many of the same types of  benefits. However, comparing actual benefits was not possible because  data were not readily available on benefit amounts for individual  employees. In addition, some government employee benefits were  calculated based on length of service (such as vacation time) and pay (such  as contributions to the federal retirement savings plan), and participation  in many of the benefits is voluntary (such as health insurance, life  insurance, and the Thrift Savings Plan).", "Some of the contractors we spoke with also offered sick or personal leave  and some contractors added additional paid vacation time for length of  service."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In oral comments on a draft of this report, on February 23, 2001, the Deputy  Under Secretary of Defense for Installations concurred with the report\u2019s  findings.

We also interviewed 79  of the 82 former civilian or military government employees that went to  work for the contractor that won the Tyndall civil engineering segment of  the competition. However, our analyses were constrained due to limited  available data concerning individual former employees. For example, base  personnel offices did not track what happened to personnel affected by a  specific A-76 study and could not provide us with exact government salary  information for employees that went to work for contractors.
