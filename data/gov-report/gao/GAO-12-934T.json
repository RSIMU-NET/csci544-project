The Coast Guard is refurbishing its medium endurance cutters  through the Mission Effectiveness Project to increase these cutters\u2019  reliability and reduce longer-term maintenance costs, and third-party  assessments show that the performance of those medium endurance  cutters that have completed the project has improved.

Although senior Coast Guard headquarters officials reported considering  various factors when setting overall mission performance targets  annually, these officials reported doing so based on the assumption that  vessel class assets will achieve 100 percent of their operational hour  targets. Our analysis of Coast Guard data, though, makes it clear that the  Coast Guard\u2019s legacy vessel fleet has increasingly fallen below  operational hour targets in recent years, and this trend is expected to  continue. In addition, Coast Guard officials reported that the decline in  legacy vessel operational capacity has challenged the Coast Guard\u2019s  ability to meet its mission performance targets. Further, Coast Guard  operational commanders reported taking actions to mitigate the effect of  declining legacy vessel capacity, such as diverting vessels tasked to  other missions to help complete operations. Nevertheless, the Coast  Guard has not revised legacy vessel operational hour targets because,  according to Coast Guard officials, doing so would lower its mission  performance targets. However, these targets have gone unmet because  of the declining operational capacity of the legacy vessel fleet. Because it  sets mission performance targets and allocates resources on the  assumption that legacy vessels will achieve 100 percent of operational  hour targets, the Coast Guard\u2019s allocation of resources is not realistic.  Further, because the Coast Guard uses vessels\u2019 operational hour targets  to set agency-wide performance targets and to allocate resources,  consistent achievement of its performance targets is at increased risk.", "In our July 2012 report, we recommended that the Secretary of Homeland  Security direct the Commandant of the Coast Guard to adjust legacy  vessel fleet operational hour targets to reflect actual capacity, as  appropriate by class. DHS did not concur with this recommendation and  noted, among other things, that reducing the operational hour targets  would fail to fully utilize those assets not impacted by maintenance  issues. We disagree with DHS\u2019s position because, as noted in the July  2012 report, while senior Coast Guard officials reported that the Coast  Guard adjusts its mission performance targets annually, it does not also  adjust legacy vessel operational hour targets annually. These officials  also stated that the Coast Guard\u2019s mission performance targets are  based on each vessel class\u2019s capacity, with the assumption that each  vessel will operate at 100 percent of its planned operating time.
