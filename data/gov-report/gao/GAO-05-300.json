Given the magnitude of this effort, strategic planning is critical for DHS to ensure that it meets the nation's homeland security challenges. GAO was asked to assess the extent to which DHS's planning process and documents (1) address required elements of the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA) and other good strategic planning practices and (2) reflect its homeland and non-homeland security mission responsibilities."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["DHS has made considerable progress in its planning efforts, releasing its first strategic plan in 2004 that details its mission and strategic goals. Nevertheless, opportunities for improvement exist. The creation of DHS brought together 22 agencies to coordinate the nation's homeland security efforts and to work with Congress and numerous other organizations, including federal agencies, state and local governments, and the private sector, to further this mission. Although DHS planning documents describe programs requiring stakeholder coordination to implement, stakeholder involvement in the planning process itself was limited. Involving stakeholders in strategic planning efforts can help create an understanding of the competing demands and limited resources, and how those demands and resources require careful and continuous balancing. As DHS updates its strategic plan, earlier and more comprehensive stakeholder consultation will help ensure that DHS's efforts and resources are targeted at the highest priorities and that the planning documents are as useful as possible to DHS and its stakeholders. While DHS's strategic plan addresses five of the six GPRA-required elements, it does not describe the relationship between annual and long-term goals. This linkage is crucial for determining whether an agency has a clear sense of how it will assess progress toward achieving the intended results for its long-term goals. While DHS's strategic planning documents address most of the required elements of GPRA, not including them in the strategic plan makes it difficult for DHS and its stakeholders to identify how their roles and responsibilities contribute to DHS's mission and potentially hinders Congress's and other key stakeholders' ability to assess the feasibility of DHS's long-term goals. Additionally, several of the GPRA-required elements addressed in the strategic plan could be further developed through the adoption of additional good strategic planning practices. For example, identifying the specific budgetary, human capital, and other resources needed to achieve its goals could demonstrate the viability of the strategies and approaches presented for achieving its long-term goals. Finally, although DHS's priority is its homeland security mission--which emphasizes deterring terrorism in the United States--DHS's planning documents clearly address its responsibility for non-homeland security mission programs as well, such as its response to natural disasters. In addition, DHS planning officials said that non-homeland security responsibilities were represented in the planning process and documents due, in part, to the commitment of top leadership."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["To address the federal government\u2019s challenge of responding to threats  against the homeland, President Bush signed the Homeland Security Act of  2002, creating the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

The strategy sets forth a plan to improve homeland security through the cooperation of federal, state, local, and private sector organizations in  an array of functions, with DHS having a prominent role in coordinating  these functions. In addition, the strategy states that the United States \u201cmust  carefully weigh the benefit of each homeland security endeavor and only  allocate resources where the benefit of reducing risk is worth the amount  of additional cost.\u201d We have advocated a risk management approach to  guide the allocation of resources and investments for improving homeland  security. Specifically, a risk management approach would provide a  decision support tool to help DHS establish and prioritize security program  requirements, planning, and resource allocations.", "DHS\u2019s own strategic planning process began in July 2003, with the creation  of the Strategic Plan Development Group. The group consisted of officials  from 15 separate DHS components and offices, including general counsel  and directors of strategic planning from across DHS. By the fall of 2003, the  group had created a draft strategic plan with goals and objectives for each  component. However, according to officials involved, the group members  were authorized to represent their component agencies but not to negotiate  priorities in order to create departmentwide goals. Such a discussion was  needed to develop a departmentwide document. Consequently, following  the work of the Strategic Plan Development Group, DHS\u2019s Deputy  Secretary brought DHS senior leaders together in December 2003 to  develop DHS\u2019s vision, mission, and strategic goals and achieve senior  leadership ownership of the strategic plan.", "DHS issued its first departmentwide strategic plan in February 2004.

GPRA requires that agency officials solicit the input of  stakeholders as they develop their strategic plans. Further, stakeholder  involvement during the planning process is important to ensure DHS\u2019s  efforts and resources are aligned with other federal and nonfederal  partners with shared responsibility for homeland security and that they are targeted at the highest priorities. Such involvement is also important to  ensure stakeholders help identify and agree on how their daily operations  and activities contribute to DHS\u2019s mission. Additionally, DHS\u2019s planning  documents describe areas where DHS needs to coordinate with  stakeholders to implement its programs, achieve its goals and objectives,  and meet its homeland security and non-homeland security  responsibilities. The importance of consultation to DHS was recently  underscored in GAO\u2019s High-Risk Series: An Update, in which we  designated as high risk the establishment of appropriate and effective  information-sharing mechanisms to improve homeland security. While this  area has received increased attention, the federal government still faces  formidable challenges sharing information among stakeholders in an  appropriate and timely manner to minimize risk.", "Though DHS officials briefed congressional stakeholders on the strategic  planning progress, they did not consult directly with Congress while  developing the department\u2019s mission statement or strategic goals. DHS  officials said that when briefed, congressional stakeholders requested that  the strategic plan include more detail, including specific performance goals  and measures. However, according to DHS officials, these goals and  measures were not included in order to meet OMB\u2019s time frame for issuing  the plan. To meet this time frame, DHS decided to keep the plan\u2019s content  at a high level and focus on achieving broad consensus among agency  components on DHS\u2019s mission and long-term strategic goals and objectives.  Nevertheless, DHS officials acknowledged that Congress should be more  involved in future planning efforts. As we previously reported, Congress  needs to be considered a partner in shaping agency goals at the outset,  since it is a key user of performance information and to ensure that  congressional priorities are addressed in the planning documents. We have  suggested that agencies consult with congressional stakeholders at least  once every new Congress in order to clarify performance expectations.", "Further, DHS officials said they did not consult with other federal agencies  responsible for shared homeland security initiatives in developing the  strategic plan. We have reported that a focus on results implies that federal  programs contributing to the same or similar results should be closely  coordinated to ensure that goals are consistent. Stakeholder consultation  in strategic planning efforts can help create a basic understanding of the  competing demands that confront most agencies, the limited resources  available to them, and how those demands and resources require careful  and continuous balancing. The National Strategy for Homeland Security  identifies six federal agencies responsible for 43 homeland security  initiatives. While DHS was identified as the agency with lead responsibility  for a majority of these initiatives, there were multiple lead agencies for  12 of these initiatives. For example, DHS and the State Department share  lead responsibility for the initiative \u201ccreate \u2018smart borders.\u2019\u201d As part of this  initiative, the strategy states that DHS would improve information provided  to consular offices so that individual applicants can be checked in  databases and would require visa-issuance procedures to reflect threat  assessments. These shared initiatives require that DHS look beyond its  organizational boundaries and coordinate with other agencies to ensure  that their efforts are aligned in order to meet consistent goals. However, to  ensure that the shared initiatives have common goals, and that the goals  are appropriate, consultation during the planning stage is vital.", "Finally, DHS had limited consultation with nonfederal stakeholders, such  as state and local governments and the private sector, in its strategic  planning process. Nonfederal stakeholder involvement in DHS\u2019s strategic  planning process is vital considering that state and local governments have  primary responsibility as first responders for homeland security and  approximately 85 percent of the nation\u2019s critical infrastructure is privately  owned. DHS officials explained that expanded involvement of nonfederal  stakeholders was not practical within OMB\u2019s time frame for completing the  strategic plan. Instead, DHS provided a draft of the strategic plan to a  departmental advisory group, the Homeland Security Advisory Council, for  its review and comment. Further, DHS component agency planning  officials said that instead of consulting directly with nonfederal  stakeholders, officials from DHS components were expected to represent  stakeholder views when providing their input to the strategic plan. For  example, officials in DHS\u2019s Private Sector Office were expected to  represent the opinions of private sector officials based on the office\u2019s work  with private sector representatives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Relationship between Annual and Long-term Goals Not Addressed in DHS\u2019s Strategic Plan", "paragraphs": ["DHS\u2019s strategic plan addressed five of the six GPRA-required elements, but  did not include a description of the relationship between annual and long- term goals.

For example, the first strategic goal in DHS\u2019s  strategic plan is \u201cAwareness: Identify and understand threats, assess  vulnerabilities, determine potential impacts, and disseminate timely  information to our homeland security partners and the American public.\u201d  There are four objectives related to this goal, but there is no description of  when to expect results or when a goal assessment would be completed.  However, the Milestones Report includes a timeline for expected results of  programs that address the long-term goals, with performance measures  and targets for each long-term goal through fiscal year 2009. Adding this  information to the strategic plan would therefore require little additional  effort and would make the plan itself a more useful document.", "In addition, the strategic plan generally describes strategies and  approaches to achieve the long-term strategic goals but does not include  the specific budgetary, human capital, or other resources needed. For  example, the first objective under the second strategic goal, \u201cPrevention,\u201d  states that DHS plans to \u201csecure our borders against terrorists, means of  terrorism, illegal drugs, and other illegal activity.\u201d The approach to achieve  this objective requires \u201cthe appropriate balance of personnel, equipment  and technology.\u201d However, the description does not include details on the  specific personnel, equipment, and technology that would be needed.  Although the sensitive nature of some homeland security information may  limit the level of detail, including such resource-related information in the  strategic plan is critical for understanding the viability of the strategies  presented to achieve the long-term goals.", "Further, the impact of program evaluations on the development of strategic  goals could be discussed in greater detail in the strategic plan. Inclusion of  these components is necessary to ensure the validity and reasonableness of  DHS\u2019s goals and strategies as well as for identifying factors likely to affect  performance. Evaluation can be a critical source of information for  Congress and others in assessing (1) the appropriateness and  reasonableness of goals; (2) the effectiveness of strategies by  supplementing performance management data with impact evaluation  studies; and (3) the implementation of programs, such as identifying the  need for corrective action. Rather than identifying specific program  evaluations and providing a schedule of evaluations, the strategic plan  states only that DHS planned to (1) integrate strategy and execution;  (2) assess performance, evaluate results, and report progress;  (3) collaborate; and (4) refine. The plan did not include a description of the  evaluations used to develop DHS\u2019s strategic goals, nor did DHS address  how future evaluations would be used to revise the goals and objectives.", "Finally, DHS identified some key factors that may affect its ability to  achieve its strategic goals and objectives, an element required by GPRA.  However, based on our prior review of agency strategic plans, this element  could be further developed with an explanation of the actions DHS intends to take to mitigate these factors. For example, DHS identified the need for  \u201cinternational cooperation\u201d as a key factor that can significantly affect the  achievement of its goals. To make its plan more useful, DHS could include  in its next update a discussion of how the department might work together  with other federal agencies to help obtain international cooperation in  achieving shared goals."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DHS\u2019s Homeland Security Mission Is a Priority, but Plans Also Address Other Responsibilities", "paragraphs": ["DHS planning documents specify that DHS\u2019s homeland security mission\u2014 which emphasizes counterterrorism efforts\u2014is the key driver of planning  and budgeting decisions.
