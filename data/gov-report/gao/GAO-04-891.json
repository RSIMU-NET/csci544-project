In July 2001, INTELSAT transferred its satellite and financial assets to a private company. FCC determined that this and other actions satisfied the ORBIT Act requirements for INTELSAT's privatization but noted that the company must hold an initial public offering (IPO) of securities by a required date. The current deadline for the IPO is June 30, 2005. Because Intelsat has not completed the IPO, some satellite companies assert that privatization is not fully complete. Some parties have pointed out that there was a possibility that implementation of the ORBIT Act could have given rise to action arguably inconsistent with commitments that the United States made in international trade agreements. However, we were told that actual implementation avoided such outcomes and no disputes arose. Most stakeholders and experts that GAO spoke with believe that access to non-U.S. satellite markets has improved, but few attribute this improvement to the ORBIT Act. These stakeholders and experts said that global trade agreements, such as the WTO's basic telecommunications commitments, and the global trend towards privatization of telecommunications companies have improved access in non-U.S. markets. Several stakeholders and experts told GAO that improvements in market access were already underway when the Congress passed the ORBIT Act and that the act has complemented ongoing trends towards more open satellite markets. Some satellite companies report continuing market access problems, but there are disagreements regarding whether FCC should investigate and resolve these problems. Some satellite companies that GAO spoke with report problems with access to non-U.S. satellite markets, which they attribute to countries with policies that favor domestic and regional satellite companies, countries exercising control over content, bureaucratic processes in various countries, and long-term business relationships between INTELSAT and various telecommunications companies. Most companies GAO spoke with report that Intelsat does not take active steps to acquire preferential or exclusive market access, and Intelsat itself stated that it does not seek nor, if offered, would accept preferential market access. Finally, some companies suggest that FCC should take a more proactive role in investigating market access problems, rather than assuming an adjudicative role. FCC said that evidence provided to the agency has not been sufficient to warrant action and also suggested that trade disputes are more appropriately addressed by the United States Trade Representative."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["INTELSAT was created as an intergovernmental organization designed to  bring satellite services\u2014such as international telephone calls and relay of  television signals internationally\u2014to countries around the world. As an  operator of an international network of communications satellites,  INTELSAT was capitalized and controlled primarily by the designated  signatories of the governments that entered into the agreement to form  INTELSAT. Due to its intergovernmental nature, INTELSAT benefited from  many privileges that privately owned companies do not enjoy. During the  1990s, there was considerable criticism from new commercial satellite  companies focused on the difficulty of competing against a company with  the advantages that flowed from INTELSAT\u2019s intergovernmental status. At  about the same time, decision-makers within INTELSAT began to believe  that its intergovernmental structure led to a slow decision-making process  that did not enable INTELSAT to be sufficiently nimble in the increasingly  dynamic global communications marketplace.", "In 2000, the Congress passed the Open-market Reorganization for the  Betterment of International Telecommunications Act (ORBIT Act) to help  promote a more competitive global satellite communication services  market. The ORBIT Act called for the full privatization of INTELSAT and  imposed certain criteria on the nature of INTELSAT\u2019s privatization. You  asked us to provide information related to the implementation of the  ORBIT Act and the status of market access for global satellite companies in  countries around the world. Specifically, this report provides federal  officials\u2019 and stakeholders\u2019 views on (1) whether the privatization steps  required by the ORBIT Act have been implemented and whether there were  potential inconsistencies between ORBIT Act requirements and U.S.  obligations made in international trade agreements; (2) whether access by  global satellite companies to non-U.S. markets has improved since the  enactment of the ORBIT Act and, if so, to what is this generally attributed;  and (3) if any market access problems remain, what role does the Federal  Communications Commission (FCC) have in addressing those problems  under the ORBIT Act. In addition, you asked us to provide information  related to the tax status of INTELSAT prior to privatization as well as the  current tax treatment of multinational corporations. As we agreed, we are  issuing a separate report to you on these tax issues.", "To respond to the three objectives of this report, we conducted semi- structured interviews with a variety of industry participants. We  interviewed five satellite service providers and six scholars and attorneys  who specialize in the regulatory and market access issues related to  satellite communications. We selected scholars and attorneys based on  their recently published articles or speeches on competition in the satellite  services market. We also interviewed officials from FCC; the United States  Trade Representative (USTR); the Department of State; the National  Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA); and the  International Telecommunications Satellite Organization, an  intergovernmental entity formed when INTELSAT privatized that works to  ensure that satellite service is available to countries that might not  otherwise have access to such services. We also reviewed key documents,  including relevant provisions of the Communications Satellite and ORBIT  acts, and other relevant documents obtained from FCC, USTR, and NTIA  about the ORBIT Act and related concerns about market access in non-U.S.  markets. Using FCC\u2019s Electronic Comment Filing System, we searched for  filings on market access concerns and checked for any other such  complaints filed with the agency. We also searched for any complaints on  market access issues that might be filed with USTR and NTIA. We did not  verify the reliability of these complaint data because these issues were not  material to the primary focus of this report.", "We conducted our review from February through June 2004 in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Congress passed the Communications Satellite Act of 1962 to promote  the creation of a global satellite communications system. As a result of this  legislation, the United States joined with 84 other nations in establishing  the International Telecommunications Satellite Organization\u2014more  commonly known as INTELSAT\u2014roughly 10 years later. Each member  nation designated a single telecommunications company to represent its  country in the management and financing of INTELSAT. These companies  were called signatories to INTELSAT, and were typically government- owned telecommunications companies, such as France Telecom, that  provided satellite communications services as well as other domestic  communications services. Unlike any of the other nations that originally  formed INTELSAT, the United States designated a private company,  Comsat Corporation, to serve as its signatory to INTELSAT.", "During the 1970s and early 1980s, INTELSAT was the only wholesale  provider of certain types of global satellite communications services such  as international telephone calls and relay of television signals  internationally. By the mid-1980s, however, the United States began  encouraging the development of commercial satellite communications  systems that would compete with INTELSAT. In 1988, PanAmSat was the  first commercial company to begin launching satellites in an effort to  develop a global satellite system. Within a decade after PanAmSat first  entered the market, INTELSAT faced global satellite competitors.  Moreover, intermodal competition emerged during the 1980s and 1990s as  fiber optic networks were widely deployed on the ground and underwater  to provide international communications services.", "As competition to INTELSAT grew, there was considerable criticism from  commercial satellite companies because they believed that INTELSAT  enjoyed advantages stemming from its intergovernmental status that made  it difficult for other companies to compete in the market. In particular,  these companies noted that INTELSAT enjoyed immunity from legal  liability and was often not taxed in the various countries that it served. By  the mid-1990s, competitors began to argue that for the satellite  marketplace to become fully competitive, INTELSAT would need to be  privatized so that it would operate like any other company and no longer  enjoy such advantages. At about the same time, INTELSAT recognized that  privatization would be best for the company. Decision-makers within  INTELSAT noted that the cumbersome nature of the intergovernmental  decision-making process left the company unable to rapidly respond to  changing market conditions. In 1999, INTELSAT announced its decision to  privatize and thus become a private corporation.", "By the late 1990s, the United States government also decided that it would  be in the interests of consumers and businesses in the United States for  INTELSAT to privatize. The ORBIT Act, enacted in March 2000, was  designed to promote a competitive global satellite communication services  market. It did so primarily by calling for INTELSAT to be fully privatized.  The ORBIT Act required, for example, that INTELSAT be transformed into  a privately held, for-profit corporation with a board of directors that would  be largely independent of former INTELSAT signatories. Moreover, the act  required that the newly privatized Intelsat retain no privileges or other  benefits from governments that had previously owned or controlled it. To  ensure that this transformation occurred, the Congress imposed certain  restrictions on the granting of licenses that allow Intelsat to provide  services within the United States. The Congress coupled the issuance of  licenses granted by FCC to INTELSAT\u2019s successful privatization under the  ORBIT Act. That is, FCC was told to consider compliance with provisions  of the ORBIT Act as it made decisions about licensing Intelsat\u2019s domestic  operations in the United States. Moreover, FCC was empowered to restrict  any satellite operator\u2019s provision of certain new services from the United  States to any country that limited market access exclusively to that  satellite operator.", "Market access for satellite firms to non-U.S. markets was also affected by  trade agreements that were negotiated during the 1990s. Specifically, the  establishment of the World Trade Organization (WTO) on January 1, 1995,  with its numerous binding international trade agreements formalized global  efforts to open markets to the trade of services. Since that time, WTO has  become the principal international forum for discussion, negotiation, and  resolution of trade issues. For example, the first global trade agreement  that promotes countries\u2019 open and nondiscriminatory market access to  services was the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), which  provides a legal framework for addressing barriers to international trade  and investment in services, and includes specific commitments by member  countries to restrict their use of these barriers. Since adoption of a basic  telecommunications services protocol by the GATS in 1998,  telecommunications trade commitments have also been incorporated into  the WTO rules. Such commitments resulted in member countries agreeing  to open markets to telecommunications services, such as global satellite  communications services."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Most INTELSAT Privatization Steps Have Taken Place and Stakeholders Stated That Implementation of the ORBIT Act Was Not Inconsistent with U.S. Obligations in International Trade Agreements", "paragraphs": ["FCC determined that INTELSAT\u2019s July 2001 privatization was in  accordance with the ORBIT Act\u2019s requirements and licensed the new  private company to provide services within the United States.

Intelsat, Ltd. has several subsidiaries, including a  U.S.-incorporated indirect subsidiary called Intelsat, LLC. Upon their  execution of privatization, INTELSAT signatories received shares of  Intelsat, Ltd. in proportion to their investment in the intergovernmental  INTELSAT. Two months before the privatization, FCC determined that  INTELSAT\u2019s privatization plan was consistent with the requirements of the  ORBIT Act for a variety of reasons, including the following.", "Intelsat, Ltd.\u2019s Shareholders\u2019 Agreement provided sufficient evidence  that the company would conduct an IPO, which would in part satisfy the  act\u2019s requirement that Intelsat be an independent commercial entity.", "Intelsat, Ltd. no longer enjoyed the legal privileges or immunities of the  intergovernmental INTELSAT, since it was organized under Bermuda  law and subject to that country\u2019s tax and legal liability requirements.", "Both Intelsat, Ltd. and Intelsat, LLC are incorporated in countries that  are signatories to the WTO and have laws that secure competition in  telecommunications services.", "Intelsat, Ltd. converted into a stock corporation with a fiduciary board  of directors. In particular, FCC said that the boards of directors of both  Intelsat, Ltd. and Intelsat, LLC were subject to the laws of Bermuda and  the United States, respectively, and that the laws of these countries  require boards of directors to have fiduciary obligations to the company.", "Measures taken to ensure that a majority of the members of Intelsat,  Ltd.\u2019s board of directors were not directors, employees, officers,  managers, or representatives of any signatory or former signatory of the  intergovernmental INTELSAT were consistent with the requirements of  the ORBIT Act.", "Intelsat, Ltd. and its subsidiaries had only arms-length business  relationships with certain other entities that obtained INTELSAT\u2019s  assets.", "In light of these findings, FCC conditionally authorized Intelsat, LLC to use  its U.S. satellite licenses to provide services within the United States.  However, FCC conditioned this authorization on Intelsat, Ltd.\u2019s conducting  an IPO of securities as mandated by the ORBIT Act. In December 2003,  FCC noted that if Intelsat, Ltd. did not conduct an IPO by the statutory  deadline, the agency would limit or deny Intelsat, LLC\u2019s applications or  requests and revoke the previous authorizations granting Intelsat, LLC the  authority to provide satellite services in the United States. In March 2004,  Intelsat, Ltd. filed a registration statement with the Securities and  Exchange Commission (SEC) indicating its intention to conduct an IPO.  Since that time, however, the Congress further extended the required date  by which the IPO must occur. In May 2004, the Congress extended the IPO  deadline to June 30, 2005, and authorized FCC to further extend that  deadline to December 31, 2005, under certain conditions. In late May 2004,  Intelsat withdrew its filing with SEC regarding its registration to conduct  an IPO. On August 16, 2004, Intelsat, Ltd. announced that its Board of  Directors approved the sale of the company to a consortium of four private  investors; the sale requires the approval of shareholders holding 60 percent  of Intelsat's outstanding shares and also regulatory approval. According to  an Intelsat official, this transaction, if approved, would eliminate former  signatories\u2019 ownership in Intelsat.", "Most companies and experts that we interviewed believe that, to date,  Intelsat\u2019s privatization has been in accordance with the ORBIT Act\u2019s  requirements, and some of these companies and experts that we  interviewed believe that FCC is fulfilling its duties to ensure that the  privatization is consistent with the act. These parties noted that the ORBIT  Act set forth many requirements for Intelsat and that most of these  requirements have been fulfilled. However, some companies and experts  believe that the IPO is a key element to complete Intelsat\u2019s privatization.  According to some parties, the IPO would further dilute signatory  ownership in Intelsat, Ltd. as envisioned by the ORBIT Act, which would  reduce any incentive that former signatories might have to favor Intelsat  when selecting a company to provide satellite services. Table 1 compares  Intelsat, Ltd.\u2019s ownership on the day of privatization in 2001 with the  ownership as of May 6, 2004. As indicated in the table, in May 2004, more  than 50 percent of Intelsat, Ltd. was owned by the former signatories to the  intergovernmental INTELSAT; although, as mentioned above, the recently  announced purchase of Intelsat by four private investors, if approved,  would eliminate former signatory ownership in Intelsat, according to an  Intelsat official."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Stakeholders Note Potential for Inconsistencies between ORBIT Act and International Trade Agreements, but Stated That Implementation of the Act Was Not Inconsistent with Those Agreements", "paragraphs": ["We were told that there were potential inconsistencies between the ORBIT  Act and obligations the United States made in international trade  agreements.

Some stakeholders told us that, had this occurred, FCC\u2019s  actions could have been viewed as inconsistent with U.S. obligations in  international trade agreements. In fact, on August 1, 2000, following the  enactment of the ORBIT Act, the European Commission (EC) stated that  the ORBIT Act raised a general concern regarding its compatibility with the  U.S. obligations in the WTO. The EC further emphasized that if the act was  going to be used against European Union (EU) interests, the EU would  consider exercising its rights to file a trade dispute under the WTO.", "While we were told that potential inconsistencies could have arisen,  INTELSAT privatized according to the ORBIT Act removing any need for  FCC to act in a manner that might be inconsistent with U.S. international  trade obligations, and no trade disputes arose.

Officials from FCC, USTR, the Department of State, as well as satellite  company representatives and experts on telecommunications issues, told  us that INTELSAT privatized according to the act\u2019s requirements. Several  stakeholders emphasized that trade disputes had not arisen because  INTELSAT privatized in accordance with the ORBIT Act. As of June 2004,  WTO and USTR documentation showed that no trade complaints had been  filed at the WTO about the ORBIT Act and INTELSAT\u2019s privatization.

Five satellite companies and four of the  experts that we spoke with said that agreements negotiated through the  WTO, such as the basic telecommunications commitments, helped improve  access in non-U.S. satellite markets. Additionally, two of the satellite  companies and one expert told us that the trend towards privatization in  the telecommunications industry\u2014such as governments privatizing state- controlled telephone companies\u2014has helped improve market access. At  the same time, many stakeholders noted that the ORBIT Act had little to no  impact on improving market access. According to several stakeholders,  market access was already improving when the ORBIT Act was passed.  While some of those we spoke with noted that the ORBIT Act might have  complemented the ongoing trends in improved market access, only one  satellite company we interviewed stated that the act itself improved market  access.

For approximately 30 years, INTELSAT was the dominant  provider of global satellite services.

Several stakeholders noted that Intelsat may benefit  from the long-term business relationships that were forged over the  decades, since telecommunications companies in many countries will feel  comfortable continuing to do business with Intelsat as they have for years.  Additionally, two of the satellite companies noted that because some of  these companies have been investors in the privatized Intelsat, there may  be an incentive to favor Intelsat over other satellite competitors. One global  satellite company told us that Intelsat\u2019s market access advantages continue  because of inertia\u2014inertia that will only dissipate with time. Two  stakeholders also noted that because companies\u2014including domestic  telecommunications providers as well as direct customers of satellite  services\u2014have plant and equipment as well as proprietary satellite  technology in place to receive satellite services from Intelsat, it might cost  a significant amount of money for companies to replace equipment in order  to use satellite services from a different satellite provider. These legacy  advantages can make it more difficult for satellite companies to convince  telecommunications companies to switch from Intelsat\u2019s service to their  service.", "However, some other companies have a different view on whether Intelsat  has any preferential or exclusive market access advantages.  Representatives of Intelsat, Ltd. told us that Intelsat seeks market access  on a transparent and nondiscriminatory basis and that Intelsat has  participated with other satellite operators, through various trade  organizations, to lobby governments to open their markets.  Representatives of Intelsat, Ltd. also told us that former signatories of  Intelsat own such small percentages of Intelsat, Ltd. that such ownership  interests would not likely influence market access decisions in countries in  which the government still controls the former signatory. Some companies  and many of the experts that we interviewed told us that, in their view,  Intelsat does not have preferential access to non-U.S. satellite markets.  Further, all five satellite companies as well as several experts that we  spoke with said that they have no knowledge that Intelsat in any way seeks  or accepts exclusive market access arrangements or attempts to block  competitors\u2019 access to non-U.S. satellite markets. While Intelsat is the sole  provider of satellite service into certain countries, we were generally told  that traffic into some countries is \u201cthin\u201d\u2014that is, there is not much traffic,  and therefore there is little revenue potential. In such cases, global satellite  companies other than Intelsat may not be interested in providing service to  these countries.

One satellite company said that  section 648 of the ORBIT Act, which prohibits any satellite operator from  acquiring or enjoying an exclusive arrangement for service to or from the  United States, provides a vehicle for FCC to investigate the status of access  for satellite companies to other countries\u2019 markets. If FCC were to find a  violation of section 648, it would have the authority to withdraw or modify  the relevant company\u2019s licenses to provide services within the U.S.  market.

While SES notes that GAO  correctly attributes possible preferences to long term business  relationships companies/countries may have with Intelsat, SES  Americom believes that GAO should mention that possible preferences  also arise because Intelsat\u2019s customers have equipment suitable solely  for use with Intelsat satellites.", "GAO response: Regarding customer equipment, we mention that  companies have plant and equipment in place to receive service from  Intelsat that might cost a significant amount of money to replace, which  we believe adequately addresses this point.", "SES Americom states that GAO should preface our discussion of the  required IPO with the word \u201cequity\u201d.", "GAO response: The ORBIT Act\u2019s requirement for an IPO does not  specifically state \u201cequity IPO,\u201d but states that Intelsat must hold an \u201cIPO  of securities.\u201d Nevertheless, in the context of Inmarsat\u2019s required IPO,  which is also required under the ORBIT Act, FCC is currently reviewing  this very issue\u2014that is, whether the IPO must be an offering of equity  securities.
