Under Treasury\u0092s Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP), initiated in early 2009, servicers have modified almost 1 million loans between 2009 and 2011. During the same period, servicers modified nearly 1 million additional loans under programs administered by the Departments of Agriculture (USDA) and Veterans Affairs (VA), Federal Housing Administration (FHA), and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (the enterprises). Servicers have also modified about 2.1 million loans under nonfederal loan modification programs resulting in a total of about 4 million modifications between 2009 and 2011. However, a large number of borrowers have sought assistance, but were unable to receive a modification. For example, approximately 2.8 million borrowers had their HAMP loan modification application denied or their trial loan modification canceled. Further, the volume of federal modifications has declined since 2010. Recent efforts have expanded refinancing programs. However, low participation rates in FHA\u0092s program raise questions about the need for Treasury\u0092s financial support, which could reach a maximum of $117 million.", "In spite of these efforts, the number of loans in foreclosure remains elevated, and key indicators suggest that the U.S. housing market remains weak. GAO\u0092s analysis of mortgage data showed that in June 2011 (most current data available for GAO\u0092s use and analysis) between 1.9 and 3 million loans still had characteristics associated with an increased likelihood of foreclosure, such as serious delinquency and significant negative equity (a loan-to-value ratio of 125 percent or greater). These loans were concentrated in certain states, such as Nevada and Florida. Further, more recent indicators such as home prices and home equity remain near their postbubble lows. As of December 2011, total household mortgage debt was $3.7 trillion greater than households\u0092 equity in their homes\u0097representing a significant decline in household wealth nationwide.", "Despite the scope of the problem, most stakeholders GAO interviewed said that enhancing current foreclosure mitigation efforts would be preferable to new ones. GAO found that agencies could take steps to make their programs more effective. Collectively, FHA and the enterprises had 1.8 million loans in their portfolios that were 90 days or more past due as of December 2011. GAO found that most of the agencies and enterprises, with the exception of USDA, had stepped up their efforts to monitor servicers\u0092 outreach to struggling borrowers. However, not all the agencies were conducting analyses to determine the effectiveness of their foreclosure mitigation actions. Experiences of Treasury and the enterprises and GAO\u0092s econometric analysis strongly suggest that such analyses can improve outcomes and cut program costs. For example, GAO\u0092s analysis showed that the size of payment change, delinquency status, and current loan to value ratio, can significantly influence the success of the foreclosure mitigation action taken. In contrast, not all federal agencies consider redefault rates and long-term costs when deciding which loan modification action to take. Nor have they assessed the impact of loan and borrower characteristics. In some cases, agencies do not have the data needed to conduct these analyses. GAO found some evidence to suggest that principal forgiveness could help some homeowners\u0097those with significant negative equity\u0097stay in their homes, but federal agencies and the enterprises were not using it consistently and some were not convinced of its merits. In addition, there are other policy issues to consider in how widely this option should be used, such as moral hazard. The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), for instance, has not allowed the enterprises to offer principal forgiveness. Treasury recently offered to pay incentives to the enterprises to forgive principal, and FHFA is reevaluating its position. Until agencies and the enterprises analyze data that will help them choose the most effective tools and fully utilize those that have proved effective, foreclosure mitigation programs cannot provide the optimal assistance to struggling homeowners or help curtail the costs of the foreclosure crisis to taxpayers."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that: Treasury reevaluate the need for its financial support of FHA\u0092s refinance program; USDA increase its efforts to monitor servicers\u0092 outreach tostruggling borrowers; FHA, VA, and USDA collect and analyze", "information needed to fully assess the effectiveness and costs of their foreclosure mitigation efforts; andFHFA expeditiously finalize analysis on whether to allow the enterprises to offer HAMP principal forgiveness modifications.

The Emergency Economic Stabilization  Act of 2008 (EESA) provided the Department of the Treasury (Treasury)  with $700 billion to use under the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP)  to, among other things, preserve homeownership, prevent avoidable  foreclosures, and protect home values. Since EESA\u2019s passage, a series  of congressional acts and initiatives introduced by the administration have  expanded federal efforts to mitigate foreclosures. The centerpiece of  these efforts has been the 2009 Home Affordable Modification Program  (HAMP), which is being implemented by Treasury\u2019s Office of  Homeownership Preservation. Foreclosure mitigation programs  administered by other federal agencies, such as the U.S. Department of  Housing and Urban Development (HUD) as well as Fannie Mae and  Freddie Mac (the enterprises), have continued and in many cases have  been expanded. In addition, state and local governments, nonprofits, and  mortgage lenders and servicers have initiated programs to mitigate  foreclosures. Loan modification programs have been a key component of  both federal and nonfederal mitigation efforts to moderate the foreclosure  crisis. Limited research is available on the effectiveness of these efforts,  however, and the probability of loans remaining current after a  modification is not well understood. Information on the outcome of these  efforts is central to helping ensure that federal foreclosure mitigation  programs efficiently and effectively preserve homeownership, prevent  avoidable foreclosures, and protect home values.", "This report is based upon our continuing analysis and monitoring of  Treasury\u2019s activities in implementing EESA, which provided us with broad  oversight authorities for actions taken under TARP and required that we  report at least every 60 days on TARP activities and performance.

In addition, to assist policymakers and  housing market participants in evaluating the impact and effectiveness of  current federal foreclosure mitigation efforts, we examined (1) the federal  and nonfederal response to the foreclosure crisis, (2) the number of loans  potentially at risk of foreclosure and the current condition of the U.S.  housing market, and (3) opportunities to enhance the effectiveness of  current foreclosure mitigation efforts.", "To examine the response to the foreclosure crisis, we looked at programs  administered by Treasury; HUD; the U.S. Departments of Agriculture  (USDA) and Veterans Affairs (VA); and two housing government- sponsored enterprises (the enterprises)\u2014the Federal National Mortgage  Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage  Corporation (Freddie Mac).

However, we have used CoreLogic data in prior reports in which we  concluded that the data we used were sufficiently reliable for our  purposes. Nevertheless, because of limitations in the coverage and  completeness of the data, our analysis may not be representative of the  mortgage market as a whole. For this engagement, we reviewed  documentation on the process CoreLogic used to collect its data. We  discussed this process and the interpretation of different data fields with  CoreLogic representatives. In addition, we conducted reasonableness  checks on data elements to identify any missing, erroneous, or outlying  data.

Although this data set did not contain direct information about the presence of modifications, we developed a set of  algorithms to infer if a loan had been modified. We confirmed the  accuracy of our algorithms by using our methodology to analyze data  provided by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) that  included known modifications (see app. III for a more detailed discussion  of our approach). We conducted analyses on a 15 percent random  sample of the CoreLogic data set to examine the volume, characteristics,  and performance of loan modifications executed by both federal and  nonfederal programs.", "To examine the extent to which loans were associated with an increased  likelihood of foreclosure, we identified key characteristics associated with  an increased likelihood of foreclosure by reviewing our prior work and  other studies, and interviewing housing market participants and  observers.

Homeowners involved in a foreclosure are often forced to move out and  may see their credit ratings plummet, making it difficult to purchase  another home.

Large numbers of  foreclosures can significantly worsen cities\u2019 fiscal circumstances, both by  reducing property tax revenues and by raising costs to local government  associated with maintaining vacant and abandoned properties.

These procedures expand its  modification efforts by allowing for term extensions of up to 40 years  from the date of modification (compared to the remaining term under  the traditional modification program), further interest rate reductions,  and if necessary, a mortgage recovery advance to cover past due  amounts and other costs, such as canceled foreclosure fees. In  addition, forborne principal may be included in this advance. USDA  reimburses the servicer for advancing the funds for the mortgage  recovery advance, which is payable when the borrower sells the  property or pays off the loan (similar to FHA-HAMP). USDA approved  servicing plans for nearly 13,000 traditional modifications and 143  SLS modifications between January 2009 and December 2011. USDA  does not offer servicers incentives for modifying loans. According to  USDA\u2019s guidance, servicers are required to use the following waterfall  in considering a loss mitigation action: repayment agreement, special  forbearance, loan modification, SLS loan modification, preforeclosure  sale (short sale) or deed-in-lieu of foreclosure.", "Although Treasury does not share the cost of modifying loans with  investors under FHA-HAMP and USDA\u2019s SLS, it has put in place  performance incentives that reward participating servicers and borrowers  for certain modifications that remain current under these programs.  Servicers must have entered into agreements with Treasury to participate  in these incentive programs. According to Treasury, it offered VA the  opportunity for its servicers and borrowers to receive incentive payments  under MHA. However, VA officials told us that implementing this feature  increased the complexity of its loan modification program and VA was  concerned that veterans may be denied modifications. As a result, VA  decided to issue its guidelines for VA-HAMP without the additional  incentives. As of December 2011, Treasury had paid $5 million in servicer  and borrower incentives using TARP funds for FHA-HAMP modifications  that remained current, but had not made any incentive payments for  USDA SLS modifications.", "Treasury\u2019s Housing Finance Agency Innovation Fund for the Hardest Hit  Housing Markets (known as the Hardest Hit Fund or HHF program) has  committed $7.6 billion of TARP funding to 18 states and the District of  Columbia for programs such as loan modification programs, among other  things, to meet the distinct challenges struggling homeowners in their  state are facing. For example, California devoted more than $770 million  for reducing principal balances for low-to-moderate income borrowers  with current LTV ratios greater than 115 percent.

A  number of federal and nonfederal programs are in place to help  homeowners who are current on their mortgages but cannot refinance  because of declining home values. Generally, these programs offer  refinancing options that include accepting higher LTV ratios than have  typically been allowed and lowering refinancing costs.", "The primary federal refinance effort has been the Home Affordable  Refinance Program (HARP). It was announced alongside HAMP in  February 2009 as a way to provide for borrowers who were current on  their mortgage payments but unable to refinance because the declines in  home values had left them with little or no equity in their homes. HARP  was intended to allow these borrowers to benefit from reduced interest  rates in order to make their mortgage payments more affordable. Only  mortgages owned or guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are  eligible. Initially, HARP targeted borrowers with current LTV ratios  between 80 percent and 105 percent, but FHFA revised those  requirements to include borrowers with current LTV ratios up to 125  percent in July 2009. The standard mortgage insurance requirements for  these refinance loans were relaxed so that borrowers who did not have  mortgage insurance on their existing loan did not have to purchase it for  their refinanced loan, something that would typically be required for a loan  with an LTV ratio of more than 80 percent. HARP has resulted in  approximately 1 million refinances as of December 31, 2011.Approximately 91 percent of HARP refinances have gone to borrowers  with current LTV ratios between 80 percent and 105 percent. According to  Fannie Mae, borrowers who refinanced in 2011 under its HARP effort  saved an average of $151 on their monthly mortgage payments.Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac expected that the program would have  minimal net costs to them.", "To respond to continued weakness in the housing market, including the  large number of borrowers with negative equity, FHFA announced  changes to HARP in October 2011. These changes included removing  the LTV cap to reach more underwater borrowers\u2014those with current  LTVs of more than 125 percent. Delivery fees the enterprises charged to  lenders and that may be passed on to the borrower were also reduced. In  addition, the enterprises eliminated representations and warranties tied to  the original loan. FHFA also extended the program\u2019s expiration date to  December 31, 2013.", "While HARP is available only to borrowers with loans owned or  guaranteed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, several other refinance  efforts were put in place to reach other borrowers.

In order to qualify, investors must write down at least  10 percent of the outstanding principal and achieve an LTV ratio of no  more than 97.75 percent.", "Through December 2011, FHA Short  Refinance has had limited success, reaching 646 borrowers. During the  subsequent 5 months, however, program volume doubled to 1,303 loans.  Although no borrowers who have refinanced under the program had  defaulted as of December 31, 2011, Treasury had paid approximately  $5.5 million in administrative fees to maintain an $8 billion letter of credit  facility that will be used to pay Treasury\u2019s portion of claims on losses  associated with loans refinanced under the program. The letter of credit is  expected to be in force through September 2020\u2014approximately 8 more  years\u2014and the administrative fees associated with this letter of credit  could reach a maximum of $117 million. However, participation in the  program was initially estimated at 1 million borrowers, and even with  FHA\u2019s recently announced changes to the program, whether participation  will reach the levels initially projected is not clear. With participation to  date much lower than expected and future participation unknown, the  costs to Treasury of maintaining the letter of credit facility may not be  justified.

For example, an FHA  streamlined refinance without an appraisal may help existing borrowers  with negative equity that are current on their mortgage but struggling to  make their mortgage payments because it allows lenders to refinance the  entire outstanding principal balance. VA\u2019s Interest Rate Reduction Refinancing Loan requires no appraisal or credit underwriting, and  borrowers may qualify with VA approval even if they are delinquent.", "Under the HHF program, several states are using funding for refinance  programs that help borrowers with negative equity or second mortgages.  For example, Ohio set aside $50 million to help borrowers refinance into  mortgages with a reduced principal balance and lower monthly payments.

A borrower who is unemployed and requests assistance  under HAMP (nonenterprise program only) must be evaluated for and, if  qualified, must receive an UP forbearance plan before being considered  for HAMP unless the servicer determines that a HAMP modification is the  better alternative for the borrower. No TARP funds are used to support  the UP program. Under UP, servicers must provide qualified borrowers  with a forbearance period during which their mortgage payments are  temporarily reduced or suspended for a minimum of 12 months. Upon  completion of the forbearance period, borrowers must be evaluated for  other loan workout programs. UP has resulted in nearly 18,000  forbearance agreements.", "Other federal agencies and the enterprises also have existing programs  to provide temporary relief to borrowers. These programs may be formal  or informal and typically take the form of forbearance agreements and  repayment plans. FHA and USDA encourage servicers to use these  options informally early in the delinquency to prevent borrowers from ever  becoming 90 days delinquent. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac reported that  about 257,000 repayment plans and forbearance agreements had been  completed under their existing programs since January 2009. FHA  servicers provided repayment plans to about 440,000 borrowers and  special forbearance agreements to about 67,000 borrowers.

Under HHF, several states have established programs to provide ongoing  mortgage payment assistance to qualified borrowers who are  unemployed or underemployed. Other programs provide one-time loans  to qualified borrowers to resolve their delinquencies, which may be  forgiven after a period of time (e.g., 3 years for California\u2019s program).

The program was designed to  provide mortgage payment relief (up to $50,000 total) to eligible  homeowners experiencing a drop in income of at least 15 percent to  cover past-due mortgage payments as well as a portion of the  homeowner\u2019s mortgage payment for up to 24 months. HUD permitted five  states with similar programs already in place\u2014Connecticut, Delaware,  Idaho, Maryland, and Pennsylvania\u2014to direct their EHLP allocations to  these programs.

Our analysis of available data indicated that a large number  of struggling homeowners could be eligible for federal foreclosure  mitigation programs and a large number with FHA insured or enterprise- backed loans are at an increased risk for foreclosure because of their  delinquency status. As the following examples illustrate.", "Treasury estimated that as of December 31, 2011, about 900,000  borrowers could be eligible for its HAMP modification program. This  number included loans that were 60 days or more delinquent and  were serviced by participating HAMP servicers that appeared to meet  the program\u2019s eligibility requirements.", "Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac collectively had about 1.1 million loans  that were seriously delinquent as of the quarter ending on December  31, 2011.", "FHA reported that about 711,000 of its loans were seriously  delinquent for the month of December 2011. Furthermore, between  March 2010 and June 2011 FHA\u2019s serious delinquency rate ranged  between 8.2 and 8.8 percent but between June and December 2011,  it climbed about 1.4 percentage points to 9.5 percent.", "Although federal agencies and the enterprises have taken steps to help  ensure that servicers reached struggling borrowers, not all agencies were  conducting the necessary analyses to determine which of their  foreclosure mitigation actions were most effective. Specifically, we found  that not all federal agencies consider current data on redefault rates and  evaluate the total costs of various loan modification actions to weigh the  tradeoffs between assisting borrowers to retain their homes and  protecting taxpayers\u2019 financial interests. As a result, agencies may not be  making the best use of foreclosure mitigation funds. Additionally, not all  federal agencies analyze loan and borrower characteristics that could  influence the success of these actions. Doing so would help in  determining which actions would be most successful both in aiding  homeowners and in containing costs. We also found some evidence to  suggest that principal forgiveness as a mitigation tool could help some  borrowers\u2014those with significant negative equity\u2014but that federal  agencies and the enterprises were not using it consistently and some  were not convinced of its overall merits. Moreover, there are other policy  issues to be considered when determining how widely this option should  be used, including moral hazard (borrowers strategically defaulting to  become eligible for assistance).", "Stakeholders provided us with a variety of reasons for not introducing  new federal programs at this time. Specifically, most stakeholders said  that introducing entirely new initiatives at this stage could be  counterproductive. Such initiatives, they said, would create additional  uncertainty in the market and could further delay a recovery because of  the time and costs that would be involved in implementing them. Further,  some stakeholders noted that support for new initiatives that required  additional federal funding would be difficult to implement in the current  budgetary environment. Stakeholders also said that not all borrowers who  were at risk of foreclosure would be able to avoid foreclosure through any  action and that some borrowers might not be interested in doing so. For  example, Treasury officials said that some underwater borrowers could  have already decided that foreclosure was in their best economic interest  and may not want or seek assistance.

For instance,  the redefault rate for loans that were delinquent less than 60 days at the  time of modification was 9 percent, but the redefault rates for loans that  were delinquent 90 days or more was 17 percent. The rate was even  higher for those already in foreclosure\u201419 percent. In general, the  agencies and the enterprises require servicers to make contact with  delinquent borrowers, identify the reason for the delinquency, and provide  borrowers information on available options to help them resolve the  delinquency. However, Treasury and FHA officials said that servicers  were unable to reach many borrowers, which may hinder efforts to  provide foreclosure mitigation actions. For example, servicers have  reported to FHA that about 13 percent of the delinquent borrowers they  attempt to contact do not respond.

In 2011, FHA piloted a scorecard designed to  comprehensively evaluate servicers\u2019 loss mitigation activity, including  their compliance with servicing guidelines and regulations. Further,  FHA has been identifying best practices for reaching borrowers. For  example, one servicer reported having increased success contacting  borrowers earlier in a delinquency using text messages and email  instead of telephone calls and letters, and FHA has shared this  practice with other servicers.", "In 2011, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac revised the procedures  servicers must follow when contacting borrowers to help ensure that  all those eligible know about the options that may be available to  them. The enterprises have also developed a performance metric to  track servicers\u2019 compliance with these requirements. Further, they  recently implemented changes to HARP program requirements by  eliminating the maximum LTV ratio and allowing servicers to solicit  borrowers who may be eligible for the program. In addition, the  enterprises have required servicers to report monthly on delinquent  borrowers, including on the extent of the delinquency and the most  recent action the servicer has taken.", "VA assigns a staff member to each case after a borrower becomes 60  days delinquent to monitor the servicer\u2019s efforts and provide  assistance to the borrower.

If  servicing is found to be adequate at that point, VA will continue to  perform these reviews every 90 days until the delinquency is resolved.  If the VA staff member determines that the servicer has not taken  adequate steps to reach and assist the borrower, the VA staff member  will try to contact the borrower directly and then may work with the  servicer to identify the best foreclosure mitigation action.", "In contrast, USDA does not require servicers to report information about  their efforts to reach borrowers, and its systems are not set up to  determine whether servicers are complying with USDA\u2019s requirements.  For example, servicers report monthly on loans that are at least 30 days  delinquent, but USDA does not require servicers to report on efforts to  contact the borrower early in the delinquency or on the extent to which  they have offered informal foreclosure mitigation options. Once a loan is  90 days delinquent, servicers must submit servicing plans to USDA that  outline recommended foreclosure mitigation actions, which USDA has to  approve. But if a servicer determines that no foreclosure mitigation  actions are appropriate, it does not need to submit a servicing plan.  According to USDA officials, they would not have information on the  servicer\u2019s efforts to reach the borrower or offers of informal actions and  may not become aware of the servicer\u2019s decision not to offer a formal  foreclosure mitigation action until after the loan goes into foreclosure and  the servicer files a claim. USDA officials said that they review each loss  claim to determine whether the servicer followed requirements for  evaluating the borrower for foreclosure mitigation options.

Larger reductions  in the monthly payment\u2014that is, 50 percent or more\u2014did not result in  further improvement in the 6-month redefault rate.", "According to our analysis, payment reductions for the majority of FHA and  VA loan modifications were smaller than payment reductions for other  types of modified loans. As figure 10 illustrates, 45 percent of FHA- modified loans and about 40 percent of VA-modified loans had payment  reductions of less than 10 percent of the original mortgage payment. In  contrast, the majority of modifications for enterprise-prime loans,  nonenterprise-prime loans, and subprime loans had resulted in payment  reductions greater than 20 percent, and in some cases were much larger.  For example, more than half of enterprise-prime modified loans and 39  percent of subprime loans had payment reductions of 30 percent or more  of the original monthly mortgage payment. Furthermore, our analysis  found that the predicted 6-month redefault rate for FHA-modified loans  was several percentage points higher than for the other loan types\u2014for  example, FHA\u2019s rate was 22 percent, while the rate for subprime loans  was 17 percent. However, the predicted 6-month redefault rate for VA- modified loans was 15 percent, which was similar to other loan types.", "According to our analysis of CoreLogic data, modifications resulting in  payment reductions can involve one action or a combination of actions,  such as lowering the interest rate, reducing the loan balance (through  forgiving or forbearing principal), capitalizing past due amounts, and  extending the term of the loan. Some of these actions were much more  commonly used than others\u2014for example, interest rate reductions and  capitalization were used far more frequently than reducing the loan  balance (see fig. 11). Further, our analysis indicated that the predicted 6- month redefault rates could differ depending on the action used.  Modifications that included balance reductions had a redefault rate of 11  percent, while modifications that included a rate reduction, capitalization,  or term extension had redefault rates of 15, 16, and 18 percent,  respectively. Our analysis of HAMP data indicated that the baseline 12- month redefault rate for all modified loans was 15 percent. Among HAMP  loans that received principal forbearance, the rate was slightly lower\u201412  percent.

For example, the lowest redefault  rates for both borrowers with significant negative equity and borrowers  with LTV less than 95 percent are achieved with payment reductions of  40 to 49 percent (see fig 12).", "We also found that certain borrower and loan characteristics affected  redefault rates. For instance, borrowers who were the most delinquent at  the time of modification had higher redefault rates than less delinquent or  current borrowers. Borrowers who were delinquent 90 days or more had a  redefault rate of 17 percent, and those already in foreclosure had a  redefault rate of 19 percent. But the rate for borrowers who had been  delinquent for less than 60 days was 9 percent. Furthermore, modified  loans with certain characteristics were more likely to redefault: loans in  areas where the unemployment rate had increased since modification,  loans receiving higher interest rates at modification, or loans that were  originated with adjustable rather than fixed rates.", "Generally, federal agencies are responsible for helping ensure that loss  mitigation programs reduce taxpayers\u2019 costs. For example, FHA requires  and USDA encourages servicers to use foreclosure mitigation actions to  minimize losses from loans going to foreclosure. Similarly, one of the core  values of VA is to be a good steward of financial resources that taxpayers  provide to the agency. In addition, in estimating costs of loan guarantee  programs, agencies are required to consider the long-term costs of the  loan guarantee on a net present value basis. Long-term costs include  payments by the government to cover defaults and delinquencies, among  other things. Further, according to the Office of Management and Budget  loss mitigation actions should be used only if they are likely to be less  expensive than the cost of default or foreclosure. And, as noted earlier,  both the Treasury and the enterprises analyze the performance of  modified loans and consider loan and borrower characteristics to better  understand the long-term costs of various loan modification actions.  Finally, as we previously reported, agencies could use performance  information to identify problems, take corrective action, and improve  programs. Evaluating the costs of various loan modification actions  enables agencies to more effectively weigh the tradeoffs between helping  borrowers keep their homes and protecting taxpayers\u2019 interests.", "FHA officials stated that they considered loan performance and long-term  costs in the initial design of the program in 1996. However, FHA has not  updated its analysis of loan performance and long-term costs since this  time to reflect changes to its loss and foreclosure mitigation activities\u2014 including the introduction of FHA-HAMP\u2014or the housing market. In  addition, FHA officials told us that they had not assessed the extent to  which individual servicers considered long-term costs in making decisions  about offering loss and foreclosure mitigation options to borrowers.Recently, FHA began to require trial modification payment periods for  certain foreclosure mitigation actions. FHA expects this will reduce  redefault rates.", "FHA has recently begun to calculate redefault rates for specific home  retention actions and plans to examine these data in the future. FHA  officials stated that they regularly monitor redefault rates of delinquent  loans as part of their oversight of servicer activities. For example, FHA set  an annual performance goal beginning in fiscal year 2010 for its  combined home retention actions and has used the results of this  monitoring to provide oversight and training to servicers to reduce  redefault rates. However, this goal is for the actions in the aggregate and  does not take into account individual actions, such as FHA\u2019s standard  loan modification and the FHA-HAMP modification. Further, FHA has not  used this information to analyze the effectiveness of its programs.  Recently, FHA began to calculate redefault rates for specific home  retention actions and plans to continue to calculate and examine these  data in the future.", "FHA currently collects limited data on loan and borrower characteristics at  the time of a foreclosure mitigation action. FHA collects information such  as delinquency status and the amount of the new principal and interest  payment for some modified loans. However, it does not currently collect  other key information on borrowers\u2014such as borrower income and  expenses at the time of foreclosure mitigation action. Analyses of the  characteristics of modified loans and their borrowers could help in  adjusting loss mitigation policies. Further, this information could be used  to help identify which foreclosure mitigation action would be most  appropriate for a borrower. According to FHA officials, servicers are  required to provide only minimal data on loan and borrower  characteristics at the time of a foreclosure mitigation action, as the  responsibility for determining eligibility for loss mitigation activities rests  with the servicer and not FHA. In October 2011, a contractor began  work to assess FHA\u2019s oversight of servicers\u2019 loss mitigation activities. The  assessment identified loan and borrower characteristics commonly  collected within the industry, which include current LTV as well as  information needed to calculate the change in monthly payment, among  other things. The assessment concluded that FHA should collect  additional loan-level data from servicers to enable FHA to analyze the  performance of modified loans.", "FHA is considering changes to its current approach that may facilitate the  analysis of long-term costs. In December 2010, a team of consultants  assisting the agency to establish the Office of Risk Management advised  FHA to use an NPV model to help identify appropriate loss mitigation  options and maximize the economics of modifications. In March 2012,  FHA indicated that it planned to develop a loss model to inform its loss  mitigation approach.

FHA officials raised concerns about using  an NPV approach.  Specifically, they noted that FHA policy requires  servicers to work with all delinquent borrowers to find long-term solutions  that, if possible, permit the borrower to retain homeownership. Further,  FHA does not use results from analyses to provide the basis for not  offering assistance to struggling homeowners.  Incorporating an NPV  model into FHA\u2019s foreclosure mitigation toolkit would not preclude  servicers from working with all delinquent borrowers or offering  assistance.  Instead, it would likely provide greater clarity about the  predicted economic outcome of specific foreclosure mitigation actions and  would help servicers better prevent avoidable foreclosures.  Further,  incorporating an NPV model would help balance the tradeoffs between  assisting borrowers to keep their homes and helping ensure the lowest  cost to the taxpayer.", "VA also has not incorporated analyses of long-term costs into its loss  mitigation programs.

According to VA  officials, VA monitors the effectiveness of its loss mitigation activities on a  case-by-case basis by assigning a VA loan technician to oversee  situations that cannot be resolved and work directly with the borrower, if  required.", "Finally, USDA has not incorporated analyses of long-term costs into its  foreclosure mitigation program, which is designed to have the least  upfront cost to the government. As a result, USDA does not require  servicers to consider long-term costs in determining which mitigation  options to offer borrowers. It collects loan-level data from servicers on  loan performance and type of action taken. Further, when servicers  submit a request to provide a loss mitigation action to a borrower, they  provide data on certain loan and borrower characteristics, including the  monthly payment amount after the action, verified income and expenses,  and the property value (which could be used to calculate LTV). However,  USDA has not analyzed these data, in part because the data are provided  through two different reporting systems and would have to be matched in  order to be useful. Although the agency had not previously tried to  match data, USDA officials said that it would be possible to match data on  individual borrowers. Further, USDA officials stated that their loss  mitigation data collection systems were outdated and noted that the  agency had plans to update them to allow the agency to more  systematically capture data on their loss mitigation activities. However,  USDA officials were uncertain of the timetable or availability of funding to  implement these changes.", "Because FHA does not analyze the performance of loss mitigation  activities by loan and borrower characteristics and VA and USDA do not  analyze the performance of these activities by type of home retention  action or loan and borrower characteristics, these agencies have a limited  understanding of the ultimate costs of their loss mitigation programs. As a  result, their loss mitigation activities may not be effectively balancing the  tradeoffs between assisting borrowers to keep their homes and helping  ensure the lowest cost to the taxpayer. If these agencies better  understood the performance and ultimate costs of each home retention  action, they could, for example, decide that it was in their best financial  interest, as well as the borrowers, to change the order in which their loss  mitigation options were offered or to adjust their eligibility requirements.  And by collecting additional data and conducting more comprehensive  analyses, they could better inform decision makers, helping them to  ensure that federal foreclosure mitigation programs are as effective as  possible and, at the same time, limiting long-term costs.

Principal forgiveness  involves reducing the amount the borrower owes on a mortgage without  requiring that the amount of the reduction be repaid. As a result, this  action not only lowers the borrower\u2019s monthly mortgage payment but  allows underwater borrowers the opportunity to rebuild equity in their  homes more quickly. Our analysis found that, although the redefault rate  for the loans that received principal forgiveness was lower than the  overall pools of modified loans, the effects of changing the amount of  principal forgiven on loan performance were inconclusive. However,  private investors and lenders that hold loans in their portfolio have used  principal forgiveness, suggesting that this foreclosure mitigation tool may  be effective in certain circumstances.", "Between 2009 and 2011, the prevalence of principal forgiveness among  modified loans ranged from about 3 to 13 percent, and averaged about 6  percent (see fig 13). During the fourth quarter of 2011, about 9 percent  (9,867) of modifications included principal forgiveness\u2014up from about 3   In contrast,  percent during the first quarter of 2011, according to OCC.more than three-quarters of all modifications during the fourth quarter of  2011 included capitalization or rate reduction, more than half received a  term extension, and almost a quarter of modifications included principal  forbearance. Principal forgiveness was more prevalent among HAMP  modifications (about 16 percent) than among all modifications (about 9  percent). At the same time, OCC data indicated that the prevalence of  principal forgiveness varied by market segment and investor. Specifically,  principal forgiveness was more prevalent among subprime loans (about  13 percent) than prime loans (7 percent). Further, principal forgiveness  was used primarily for loans held in portfolio or serviced for private  investors. FHFA does not permit the enterprises to use principal  forgiveness as a loan modification action. HUD, USDA, and VA are not  authorized to support principal forgiveness.", "Our analysis of Treasury data for the HAMP program (including Fannie  Mae and Freddie Mac loans) found that the 12-month redefault rate for  loans that received principal forgiveness was 8 percent, while the rate for  loans receiving principal forbearance was 12 percent. Both of these  figures are lower than the overall redefault rate for all HAMP loans, which  was 15 percent. Our analysis of HAMP data, when controlling for  observable borrower and loan characteristics, found that the effect of  principal forgiveness on the redefault rate was inconclusive. However,  larger balance reductions through principal forbearance were found to  lower the redefault rate. The inconclusive results are likely attributable to  the fact that principal forgiveness has been used sparingly. While  principal forgiveness has always been allowed under HAMP, Treasury did  not start offering incentives to investors to forgive principal until October  2010. Since few HAMP modifications have incorporated principal  forgiveness, our ability to fully examine the impact of this action on  redefault rates was limited. For the CoreLogic data, we analyzed the  performance of loans that received a balance reduction, either through  principal forgiveness or principal forbearance, and found that loans that  received a balance reduction were less likely to redefault. Specifically,  the overall 12-month redefault rate of modified loans (loans comparable  to HAMP loans) was 26 percent. In contrast, the redefault rate of loans  that received a balance reduction was 15 percent.", "Treasury has taken recent action to further encourage servicers to use  principal forgiveness. As discussed earlier, since October 2010 Treasury  has required servicers to evaluate severely underwater HAMP applicants  for its Principal Reduction Alternative, which provides investors in  nonenterprise loans with incentive payments when forgiving principal as  part of a HAMP modification. In January 2012, Treasury announced that  HAMP would be modified to further encourage investors to offer principal  reductions by increasing the incentives payments. In the past, investors  received between 10 and 21 cents on the dollar to write down principal on  loans. As of March 2012, Treasury began paying 30 to 63 cents on the  dollar.", "FHFA, the conservator and regulator of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac,  has not allowed them to use their own funds to offer principal forgiveness.  FHFA has argued that it has a statutory responsibility to preserve and  conserve the assets and property of the regulated entities. At the same  time, FHFA noted that it has a statutory responsibility to maximize  assistance for homeowners to minimize foreclosures while taking into  consideration the cost to taxpayers of any action undertaken. FHFA  performed an initial analysis comparing the effectiveness of principal  forbearance to principal forgiveness as a loan modification tool in  December 2010 and updated it in June and December 2011 using  Treasury\u2019s HAMP Net Present Value (NPV) model. The agency  concluded that although both forgiveness and forbearance reduce the  borrower\u2019s payment to the same affordable level, forbearance achieves  marginally lower losses for the taxpayer than forgiveness. These  analyses have provided the basis for FHFA\u2019s current policy decision to  not permit the enterprises\u2019 use of principal forgiveness. However, some  housing market observers have been critical of FHFA\u2019s approach to  evaluating the utility of principal forgiveness. For example, one industry  observer noted that FHFA\u2019s analysis assessed the costs of writing down  all loans in the enterprises\u2019 portfolios with negative equity instead of the  possibility of using principal forgiveness for some borrowers and a  forbearance strategy for others based on the borrowers\u2019 and loans\u2019  characteristics. For example, one Treasury official has been quoted as  stating that principal forgiveness may have the best result for borrowers  above 120 LTV ratios that can prove some type of hardship. Other  concerns raised by industry observers included FHFA\u2019s use of information  obtained at loan origination rather than current data (i.e., Fair Isaac  Corporation (FICO) credit scores, income, etc.) and not following HAMP  modification rules for the extent of the monthly payment reduction, which  require a 31 percent debt-to-income target rather than a prescribed LTV  reduction.", "In January 2012, Treasury announced that it would pay incentives to the  enterprises if FHFA allowed servicers to forgive principal as part of  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac HAMP modifications, a change that could  significantly alter FHFA\u2019s position. Shortly after Treasury\u2019s  announcement, FHFA began to conduct analyses to reevaluate the use of  principal forgiveness as a foreclosure mitigation tool. FHFA updated its  earlier analyses by incorporating the impact of receiving incentive  payments from Treasury and altered its analyses to address some of the  critiques made of its previous approach. Specifically, FHFA indicated that  it made adjustments to the loan origination data to better reflect likely  changes in borrowers\u2019 FICO scores and housing payment debt-to-income  ratios, and used zip code as opposed to state-level indices to more  accurately identify high LTV borrowers. In addition, FHFA officials told us  that they used a 31 percent debt-to-income target in their updated  analyses. According to FHFA officials, they also modified their current  analysis to fully consider HAMP and HAMP PRA modification rules. FHFA  officials told us that they believed that this change addressed the critique  about using a mutually exclusive approach of using principal forgiveness  versus forbearance for all loans with negative equity.", "As of June 2012, FHFA had not made a final decision on allowing the  enterprises to engage in HAMP principal forgiveness modifications.   According to FHFA, its preliminary analysis, as of April 2012, showed a  positive benefit of $1.7 billion to the enterprises of accepting $3.8 billion in  Treasury incentive payments for performing loan modifications involving  principal forgiveness. Further, FHFA noted any savings, from the  perspective of the federal government, would be negligible due to the  draw on the Treasury. However, all TARP-funded housing programs are  expenditures, including incentives paid to the nonenterprise investors,  servicers, and borrowers. Further, the payment of incentives to the  enterprises for principal forgiveness modifications would be paid out of  the $45.6 billion that Treasury has already obligated to be used for  preventing avoidable foreclosures and preserving homeownership.  FHFA\u2019s estimate was based on the nearly 700,000 loans in Fannie Mae\u2019s  and Freddie Mac\u2019s portfolios considered to be eligible for a HAMP loan  modification that were severely underwater (current LTV greater than  115) as of June 30, 2011, and were either already in delinquency status  or loans that could become delinquent within 6 months. According to  FHFA, the actual number of borrowers who would receive principal  forgiveness would likely be lower due to other eligibility requirements and  because eligible borrowers may choose not to participate. Additionally,  FHFA noted that HAMP principal forgiveness modifications would not  expand the number of borrowers who are eligible to obtain modifications  under HAMP because the eligibility requirements are the same.", "Separately, the enterprises assessed the feasibility of principal  forgiveness, but their analyses focused on different issues and produced  different results. Before Treasury announced that it would pay incentives  to the enterprises, Fannie Mae assessed the affect of principal  forgiveness on loan modifications through two small pilot programs, but  found that the pilots did not provide any indication that performance  varied between modifications with and without principal forgiveness.  However, Fannie Mae analysis did not address the financial impact to the  enterprise of receiving Treasury HAMP PRA incentive payments. Freddie  Mac prepared estimates of the savings that principal forgiveness might  provide using the HAMP NPV model by assuming principal forgiveness to  a 105 percent LTV. Given the underlying assumptions, it found that for  100,000 borrowers, the inclusion of the recently proposed Treasury  incentive payments could offset losses to the enterprises by  approximately $480 million as opposed to performing a loan modification  without subsidies from Treasury.", "Aside from the direct financial impact to the enterprises of receiving  incentive payments for participating in HAMP\u2019s PRA , FHFA and the  enterprises have raised concerns about borrowers strategically defaulting  to become eligible for principal forgiveness\u2014moral hazard\u2014as well as  the additional costs and time this approach would require. Nonetheless,  there remain techniques for mitigating its impact on borrower behavior,  most notably requiring that the borrower already be in default and prove a  financial hardship. All three entities also pointed to the costs for  developing information systems and the time it would take the enterprises  and its servicers to implement principal forgiveness. For example,  according to Fannie Mae officials, these costs could be as high as tens of  millions of dollars and could require up to 22 to 24 months. FHFA noted  that it was still evaluating the direct operational costs associated with  adopting principal forgiveness under HAMP and that those costs were not  trivial. However, FHFA has not indicated whether those direct costs are  likely to be greater than the $1.7 billion in financial benefits that it  determined would likely accrue to the enterprises from receiving Treasury  HAMP PRA incentive payments. Moreover, as noted by FHFA, the  anticipated benefit of principal forgiveness is that, by reducing  foreclosures relative to other modification types, losses to the enterprises  would be lowered and house prices would stabilize faster, thereby  producing broader benefits to all market participants."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Despite the unprecedented scale of federal and nonfederal efforts to help  borrowers facing potential foreclosure, key indicators suggest that the  U.S. housing market remains weak and that high foreclosure levels will  likely persist in the foreseeable future. While these efforts resulted in  more than 4 million loan modifications between January 2009 and  December 2011, the volume of modifications has declined since 2010  and millions of borrowers have sought but have been unable to receive a  permanent modification. Specifically, our analysis of mortgage data  showed that 1.9-3 million loans still had characteristics associated with an  increased likelihood of foreclosure, such as serious delinquency and  significant negative equity (LTV ratio of 125 or higher), as of June 2011.  Further, Treasury estimated that there were 900,000 borrowers who were  seriously delinquent and potentially eligible for its HAMP modification  program as of December 31, 2011. Another almost 2 million FHA, Fannie  Mae, and Freddie Mac loans also were seriously delinquent. In addition,  indicators such as home prices and home equity remain near their  postbubble lows. And finally, as of December 2011, total U.S. household  mortgage debt was $3.7 trillion greater than households\u2019 equity in their  homes.", "Despite their efforts, neither federal agencies nor nonfederal entities have  been able to come up with a clear path for resolving the foreclosure crisis.  A number of factors have hindered foreclosure mitigation efforts, including  competing priorities (e.g., balancing short-term versus long-term costs,  mitigating moral hazard) and ongoing developments, such as declining  house values, and a high unemployment rate. Ultimately, what will likely  be required will be a variety of approaches aimed at removing various  obstacles to existing foreclosure mitigation strategies. Comprehensive  data-gathering and analysis will also be needed to help ensure that  federal foreclosure mitigation programs are effective and also limit fiscal  costs and the potential for negative long-term consequences from  government intervention.", "Our analysis found that several agencies and the enterprises could do  more to better manage the costs associated with foreclose mitigation  efforts and step up their efforts to reach and help borrowers, specifically  the following,", "Treasury has not reassessed its need for the letter of credit on FHA\u2019s  Short Refinance program, which will not likely reach the number of  borrowers that it initially estimated it would help. For this reason,  Treasury may not need to maintain an $8 billion letter of credit for the  program and thus may be able to cut costs by reducing or eliminating  the fees associated with the letter.", "One of the key findings of our econometric analysis of the CoreLogic  and HAMP loan-level data was that loan modifications should be  made before borrowers become seriously delinquent on their  mortgage payments in order to obtain the best results. Although  USDA requires servicers to attempt to work with borrowers before  they become seriously delinquent, USDA does not collect information  from servicers about these efforts. Moreover, its monitoring and data  collection to ensure that servicers are complying with its requirements  to reach distressed borrowers before they become seriously  delinquent are limited. Collecting and analyzing data would provide  USDA with a more complete picture of how well servicers are  reaching distressed borrowers and preventing avoidable foreclosures.", "FHA, VA, and USDA have not fully analyzed the costs and benefits of  their foreclosure mitigation actions to help ensure that both borrowers  and taxpayers benefit from efforts to keep homeowners in their  homes. Although FHA has begun to calculate redefault rates for  specific home retention actions, it has not used this information to  assess the effectiveness of its foreclosure mitigation efforts. Doing so  is particularly important since FHA loan modifications typically do not  reduce borrower\u2019s monthly payments to the levels that our analysis  indicated result in more sustainable modifications. Further, VA and  USDA do not routinely calculate redefault rates for specific types of  home retention actions\u2014such as their various loan modification  programs\u2014although additional efforts to calculate this performance  data would provide these agencies with better information to manage  their foreclosure mitigation efforts. In addition, our analysis of the  performance of loans identified key loan and borrower characteristics  that reduced the likelihood of redefault. Specifically, we found that the  size of payment change as well as the current LTV and delinquency  status at the time of modification greatly influenced the success of a  loan modification. However, FHA, VA, and USDA have not assessed  the impact of loan and borrower characteristics on the performance of  their foreclosure mitigation efforts. In some cases, these agencies do  not have the data needed to conduct these analyses. In contrast,  Treasury and the enterprises routinely calculate and evaluate this  performance information. For example, the enterprises based recent  changes to their non-HAMP loan modification programs on their  analysis of the size of monthly payment reductions on redefault rates.  Without these types of analysis and data, FHA, VA and USDA cannot,  on a regular basis, evaluate the merits of the different home retention  actions and use the information to identify opportunities to improve  program performance.", "Finally, several federal agencies and the enterprises continue to make  changes and enhancements to their foreclosure mitigation efforts to assist  borrowers struggling to avoid foreclosure. For example, Treasury recently  announced a number of changes to HAMP to increase the number of  borrowers helped by the program, including targeting efforts to help  underwater borrowers by tripling the incentives paid to investors for  principal forgiveness and offering incentive payments to the enterprises  for loan modifications that include principal forgiveness. In response,  FHFA is currently reevaluating its prohibition against the use of Fannie  Mae and Freddie Mac funds for principal forgiveness. Although permitting  the enterprises to offer principal forgiveness would not expand the  numbers of borrowers eligible for a HAMP modification, FHFA\u2019s  preliminary analysis indicated that the Treasury incentive payments would  result in a positive benefit to the enterprises of $1.7 billion as opposed to  performing traditional HAMP modifications for severely underwater  borrowers. FHFA and the enterprises have noted that there would be  various costs associated with adopting a principal forgiveness program  that have not yet been fully determined, thus, delaying a decision on  whether the enterprises will engage in principal forgiveness. Given the  December 31, 2013, deadline for entry into a HAMP permanent loan  modification and the lead time required for the enterprises to implement a  principal forgiveness program, it is critical that FHFA take the steps  needed to expeditiously make a decision about allowing the enterprises to  engage in HAMP principal forgiveness modifications. As estimated by  FHFA, nearly 700,000 severely underwater borrowers could potentially be  eligible if the enterprises were to offer HAMP modifications with principal  forgiveness.", "As the enhanced efforts pick up speed, it may be possible to identify  further enhancements that would help both struggling homeowners and  the overall economy. However, the ability of federal agencies and the  enterprises to make such determinations is unclear, unless they collect  and analyze the data needed to demonstrate the success and cost- effectiveness of individual actions. This information can help program  managers and policymakers decide what further steps, if any, to take in  their efforts to mitigate the foreclosure crisis."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["To help ensure Treasury is making effective and efficient use of its  resources, Treasury and FHA should update their estimates of  participation in the FHA Short Refinance program given current  participation rates and recent changes to the program.

For example, servicers could  report on their efforts to reach borrowers and whether borrowers have  responded to outreach from the servicer regarding early delinquency  interventions and are receiving informal foreclosure mitigation actions.  Further, the Secretary of USDA should determine the extent to which  distressed borrowers have not been reached and assess whether  changes are needed to help ensure servicers are complying with USDA\u2019s  loss mitigation requirements.", "To more fully understand the strengths and risks posed by foreclosure  mitigation actions and protect taxpayers from absorbing avoidable losses  to the maximum extent possible, we recommend that FHA, VA, and  USDA conduct periodic analyses of the effectiveness and the long-term  costs and benefits of their loss mitigation strategies and actions.

The HAMP Tier 1 evaluation includes  identifying actions to be taken that will result in a monthly mortgage payment-to- income ratio of 31 percent. These actions must follow a standard sequence until  this ratio is reached: capitalizing past due amounts, reducing the interest rate  down to a minimum of 2 percent, extending the mortgage term by up to 40 years  from the date of modification, and forbearing principal. Servicers have the option  of using an alternative sequence of modification actions under the Principal  Reduction Alternative that includes principal forgiveness as a second step  before reducing the interest rate. Servicers then use a standardized net present  value (NPV) test to compare the financial benefits to the investor of modifying  relative to not modifying the loan.  Borrowers who are approved for HAMP Tier 1  begin with a trial period that lasts at least 3 months. Borrowers who successfully  complete a trial period receive a permanent modification. After 5 years, the  interest rate begins to step up each year until the market rate is reached if the  starting interest rate was below the market rate at the time of the modification.  Treasury pays incentives to investors and servicers for completed modifications  and to borrowers, investors, and servicers for the continued successful  performance of certain modifications.

Borrowers will be offered HAMP Tier 2 modifications only if  these changes reduce monthly payments by at least 10 percent and result in  payments ranging from 25 percent to 42 percent of monthly gross income.", "Second-Lien Modification Program (2MP): The Second Lien Modification  Program (2MP) is designed to work in tandem with HAMP modifications to  provide a comprehensive solution to help borrowers afford their mortgage  payments. A participating servicer of a second lien for which the first lien  receives a HAMP Tier 1 or Tier 2 modification must offer to modify the  borrower\u2019s second lien, accept a lump sum payment from Treasury to fully  extinguish the second lien, or accept a lump sum payment from Treasury to  partially extinguish the second lien and modify the remaining portion. Under  2MP, servicers are required to take modification actions in the following order:  capitalize accrued interest and other past due amounts; reduce the interest rate   to as low as 1 percent for 5 years (when the interest rate will reset at the rate on  the HAMP-modified first lien); extend the term to at least match the HAMP- modified first lien; and forbear or forgive principal in at least the same proportion  as the forbearance or forgiveness on the HAMP-modified first-lien, although  servicers may choose to forbear or forgive more than that amount. According to  Treasury, nearly 61,000 second liens had been modified under 2MP, including  nearly 13,000 that involved full extinguishments.", "Home Affordable Unemployment Program (UP): This program provides  forbearance on mortgage loans to borrowers whose hardship is related to  unemployment. Borrowers who indicate that their hardship is related to  unemployment when being considered for HAMP must be evaluated for UP and,  if qualified, receive an offer for forbearance. At their discretion, however,  servicers may offer a HAMP trial period instead, although they must document  their reasons. Servicers are not required to offer UP forbearance to borrowers  whose delinquency exceeds 12 months of scheduled monthly mortgage  payments. The minimum duration of UP forbearance is 12 months unless the  borrower finds a job during that time. There is no maximum forbearance period,  and servicers may extend forbearance in increments at their discretion.  Servicers must reduce monthly payments during the forbearance period to no  more than 31 percent of monthly gross income, but may opt to suspend them in  full. When the forbearance period ends, the servicer must evaluate the borrower  for HAMP or other modifications to resolve the delinquency. As of December  2011, more than 18,000 UP forbearance agreements had been started.", "Home Affordable Foreclosure Alternatives (HAFA): Borrowers who cannot  afford to keep their homes must be considered for short sales and deeds-in-lieu  of foreclosure (DIL) under the HAFA program. Borrowers may be considered for  HAFA after being considered for HAMP or upon the borrower\u2019s request.  Borrowers who qualify for a HAFA short sale must sign and return a short sale  agreement that lasts for a minimum of 120 days and that lists the minimum  price, allowable transaction costs, and monthly mortgage payments to be made  during the period of the agreement, if applicable. Borrowers may also qualify for  HAFA if they have received an offer on their property and submit a request for a  short sale.  Through HAFA, a borrower may also receive a DIL either as a  condition of the short sale agreement if the property doesn\u2019t sell or separately  without a requirement to market the property. In all HAFA transactions, the title  must be clear, any subordinate lien holders must release their liens, and  investors must agree to the transaction. According to Treasury data, about  26,000 nonenterprise HAFA short sales and DILs had been completed as of  December 2011.", "Fannie Mae has outlined the  requirements for foreclosure  mitigation programs in its Single  Family Servicing Guide, which are  summarized here. These guidelines  apply only to mortgages that are  owned or guaranteed by Fannie  Mae.", "Fannie Mae recently changed its  foreclosure mitigation workout  hierarchy to require servicers to first  evaluate whether borrowers face a  temporary or permanent hardship.  Temporary hardships may be  addressed with repayment plans and  temporary forbearance. Permanent  or long-term hardships may be  addressed with modifications (which  may include forbearance) under the  Home Affordable Modification  Program (HAMP), Fannie Mae\u2019s  standard loan modifications, short  sales or deeds-in-lieu of foreclosure  (DIL) under the Home Affordable  Foreclosure Alternatives program  (HAFA) or Fannie Mae\u2019s own  program. Fannie Mae also has a  program to lease back a property  that has been conveyed through a  DIL to the former homeowner, called  a deed-for-lease. Previously Fannie  Mae required servicers to evaluate  borrowers for a HAMP modification  before considering them for other  foreclosure mitigation actions.", "Repayment Plans and Forbearance: A repayment plan is an agreement  between servicer and borrower that gives the borrower a period of time to  reinstate the mortgage by making regular monthly payments plus an additional  amount to repay the delinquency. Servicers may also offer forbearance to  borrowers, which suspends or reduces payments for up to 6 months.  Forbearance periods longer than 6 months require written agreements with the  borrower and written approval from Fannie Mae. Fannie Mae also has  unemployment forbearance, which is the first action servicers must consider for  unemployed borrowers. Fannie Mae clarified the requirements for this action in  early 2012. Unemployment forbearance initially lasts for 6 months or until the  borrower is reemployed, whichever occurs first. If the borrower completes the  initial unemployment forbearance period and remains unemployed, the servicer  may offer extended unemployment forbearance for up to 6 more months with  Fannie Mae\u2019s approval. For all forbearance programs, once the borrower\u2019s  hardship is resolved, the forbearance period ends and the borrower must repay  the full amount, enter a repayment plan, or receive a loan modification or other  foreclosure mitigation action. Fannie Mae completed about 90,000 repayment  plans and forbearance agreements under these programs between January  2009 and December 2011.", "Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP): Servicers must evaluate  borrowers for HAMP before considering them for other modification options.

Servicers use  Treasury\u2019s net present value (NPV) model to estimate the financial outcome of  modifying or not modifying the loan. Unless the NPV result for not modifying the  loan exceeds the NPV result for modifying the loan by more than $5,000, the  servicer must move forward with the HAMP modification.  Borrowers who are  approved for HAMP begin with a trial period that lasts at least 3 months.  Modifications become permanent after borrowers have successfully completed  the trial period.

In addition, if the current loan-to-value (LTV) ratio exceeds 115  percent, the servicer must forbear up to 30 percent of the principal balance to  bring the LTV ratio down to 115 percent. These changes must reduce monthly  payments by at least 10 percent, and the borrower\u2019s front-end debt-to-income  ratio must be greater than or equal to 10 percent and less than or equal to 55  percent in order for the modification to proceed. Fannie Mae offers up to $1,600  in incentives for each modification, depending on how early in the delinquency  the modification takes effect.", "Prior to October 2011, Fannie Mae delegated authority to its largest servicers,  which represent approximately 90 percent of loans, to offer modifications to  borrowers who met specified eligibility criteria according to a standard set of  waterfall steps. This modification structure was aimed at making monthly  payments more affordable. Fannie Mae paid servicers $800 for each approved  modification.

Borrowers who qualify for a HAFA  short sale must sign and return an agreement that lasts for 120 days and lists  the minimum list price for the short sale, allowable transaction costs, and  monthly mortgage payments for the period of the agreement. A HAFA DIL is  generally available to borrowers who are unable to sell their properties under the  HAFA short sale process. In certain instances\u2014such as a serious illness, death,  military relocation or in other cases when a borrower has no interest or ability to  market the property\u2014the servicer may offer DIL without going through the HAFA  short sale process.

If the borrower does not qualify for  HAMP, the servicer evaluates the  borrower for a Freddie Mac standard  loan modification. If the borrower is  not eligible for a modification, the  servicer evaluates the borrower for a  short sale or deed-in-lieu of  foreclosure (DIL) under the Home  Affordable Foreclosure Alternatives  program (HAFA), and then under  Freddie Mac\u2019s own program.", "Repayment Plans and Forbearance: A repayment plan is an agreement  between the servicer and a borrower that gives the borrower a set period to  reinstate the mortgage by making the borrower\u2019s contractual payments plus an  additional amount to repay the delinquency. Forbearance is another temporary  relief option that typically involves reducing or suspending payments for a period  of time, and Freddie Mac has three different types of forbearance. Short-term  forbearance, which does not require Freddie Mac\u2019s approval, is a written  agreement that either suspends payments for up to 3 months or reduces  payments for up to 6 months.  Long-term forbearance, which requires a written  agreement and Freddie Mac\u2019s written approval, is available under certain  circumstances\u2014for example, when the borrower is experiencing a hardship due  to long-term or permanent disability\u2014and reduces or suspends monthly  payments for 4 to 12 months. Unemployment forbearance was added in early  2012. Servicers must consider unemployed borrowers for unemployment  forbearance first.

FHA provides servicers with incentive payments of  $100 to $200 for Type I special forbearance agreements, depending on  servicers\u2019 performance ratings. FHA does not provide incentives for Type II  agreements because servicers can receive them for the subsequent loan  modifications or partial claims.

If the conditions are not satisfied,  the servicer may seek VA prior approval to modify the loan if they have  determined that the event or circumstance that caused the delinquency has  been or will be resolved and is not expected to reoccur. The traditional loan  modification results in a loan with a fixed interest rate that does not exceed the  current market rate plus 50 basis points. The term of the loan may be extended  to the shorter of 360 months after the due date of the first payment on the  modification or 120 months after the original maturity date. According to VA  officials, servicers are expected to use VA\u2019s underwriting guidance on  affordability to determine whether the borrower can make the monthly payments,  including recommended thresholds for residual income and debt-to-income  ratios, with appropriate consideration of exculpatory or mitigating circumstances.  If servicers determine that a traditional modification is not sufficient, they may  evaluate the borrowers for a HAMP-style modification according to the  guidelines VA issued in 2010.

A  loan that is in foreclosure must be removed from foreclosure status in order to  be modified. Borrowers must be owner-occupants of the property and be  committed to occupying the property as a primary residence. The servicer must  verify the property\u2019s physical condition through an inspection before approving a  modification. The term of the loan modification should not exceed 360 months  from the date of the original loan, because USDA\u2019s guarantee is only in effect for  30 years from the date of the original loan. Loan modifications may include  reducing interest rates, including to below market levels; capitalizing all or a  portion of past due amounts into the mortgage balance; and reamortizing the  balance due. The modified balance may exceed the original loan balance and  may equal more than 100 percent of the property\u2019s current value. Modified loans  that become delinquent are to be treated as new delinquencies, and servicers  are to go through the full loss mitigation process. USDA does not offer servicers  incentive payments for completing loan modifications. According to USDA,  almost 13,000 loan modification servicing plans were approved between  January 2009 and December 2011.", "Special Loan Servicing: Under regulations finalized in September 2010, USDA  authorized servicers to provide additional relief to borrowers when traditional  servicing methods do not provide a means to cure the default.  As with loan  modifications, the borrower must be in default or facing imminent default and  must occupy the property as the primary residence and intend to continue doing  so. Under this authority, called special loan servicing, servicers must reduce the  interest rate to the market rate plus 50 basis points and extend the loan term up  to 30 years. If necessary, the servicer may reduce the interest rate further,  extend the term of the loan to up to 40 years from the date of the modification,  and/or advance funds to satisfy the borrower\u2019s past due amount, including legal  fees and costs related to a canceled foreclosure. In addition, the servicer may  defer principal. The sum of funds advanced cannot exceed 30 percent of the  unpaid principal balance at the time of default and cannot cover past due  amounts of more than 12 months of principal, interest, taxes, and insurance.  USDA will reimburse the servicer for this amount and the borrower will execute a  subordinate lien that is due when the property is sold or the mortgage paid off.  Borrowers who are delinquent at the time of special loan servicing must  complete a 3-month trial period, and borrowers who are in imminent default a 4- month trial period. According to USDA, 143 special loan servicing modification  plans were approved between January 2009 and December 2011.", "Preforeclosure Sales and Deeds-in-Lieu of Foreclosure (DIL): A  preforeclosure sale, also known as a short payoff or short sale, is the first option  servicers are to consider after determining that a borrower cannot resolve a  default. A preforeclosure sale is generally for an amount that is less than the  borrower\u2019s total indebtedness on the loan. The preforeclosure sale period is  typically 3 months, and the servicer must review the sale plan every 30 days. If  no closing date is scheduled within 90 days, the servicer may discuss the  likelihood of a sale with the real estate broker and determine whether to extend  the sale period by 30 days (if a sale is likely) or end the sale period. USDA  provides servicers with incentive payments of up to $1,000 for each completed  sale. According to USDA, almost 3,000 preforeclosure sale servicing plans were  approved between January 2009 and December 2011.", "A DIL is a voluntary transfer of a property from the borrower to the holder for a  release of all obligations under the mortgage. A DIL is preferable to foreclosure  because it avoids the time and expense of a legal foreclosure action, and the  property is generally in better physical condition because the borrower is  cooperating with the servicer. USDA provides servicers with incentive payments  of up to $250 for each completed DIL transaction. According to USDA, more  than 200 DIL servicing plans were approved between January 2009 and  December 2011.", "Refinancing can provide relief to  borrowers who need lower monthly  payments, but borrowers who are  delinquent or who owe more than  their homes are worth are generally  unable to qualify. Here we present  information on federal refinance  programs that specifically target  distressed borrowers.", "Home Affordable Refinance Program: The Home Affordable Refinance  Program (HARP) was announced in February 2009 as a way to help borrowers  who were current on their mortgage payments but unable to refinance because  of declining home values. Under HARP, such borrowers can benefit from  reduced interest rates that make their mortgage payments more affordable. Only  mortgages owned by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are eligible. Initially, HARP  targeted borrowers with current loan-to-value (LTV) ratios between 80 percent  and 105 percent, although in July 2009 the Federal Housing Finance Agency  (FHFA) revised those requirements to include borrowers with current LTV ratios  of up to 125 percent. To respond to continued weakness in the housing market,  including the large number of borrowers with significant negative equity (current  LTV ratios that are greater than 125 percent), FHFA announced changes to  HARP in October 2011. Among these changes was the removal of the LTV  cap\u2014allowing borrowers with current LTV ratios above 125 percent to  refinance\u2014and reduced delivery fees (fees that the enterprises charge to  servicers and that are typically passed on to the borrower). The standard  mortgage insurance requirements for these refinance loans were relaxed so that  borrowers who did not have mortgage insurance on their existing loan did not  have to purchase it for their refinanced loan, something that would typically be  required for a loan with an LTV ratio of more than 80 percent   FHA Refinance for Homeowners in Negative Equity Positions: Treasury  worked in conjunction with FHA to establish the FHA Refinance for Borrowers in  Negative Equity Positions (FHA Short Refinance), which is in part supported by  TARP funds. For loans refinanced under the FHA Short Refinance program,  Treasury will pay claims on those loans up to a predetermined percentage after  FHA has paid its portion of the claim. This program took effect in September  2010 and provides an opportunity to borrowers who are current on their  mortgage payments and who have loans not insured by FHA that have current  LTV ratios greater than 100 percent to refinance into an FHA-insured mortgage.  In order to qualify, investors must write down at least 10 percent of the  outstanding principal and achieve an LTV ratio of no more than 97.75 percent.  Through December 2011, FHA Short Refinance has had limited success,  reaching 646 borrowers.", "Borrowers who receive a refinance under the FHA Short Refinance program and  who have second liens may qualify for relief under the Treasury/FHA Second  Lien Program.

We took a 15-percent sample of this set of loans that  resulted in a set of 7,608,603 prime (and Alt-A) mortgages and 608,704  subprime mortgages. For each mortgage, the CoreLogic database  provided information on selected loan and borrower characteristics at  origination. It also provided a series of monthly observations on, among  other items, the balance, scheduled payment, interest rate, and mortgage  status (current; 30,60, or 90 or more days delinquent; in foreclosure; real  estate owned; or paid in full). This yielded a panel data set with a  sequence of monthly observations for each loan. Because we required  information on month-to-month changes for certain loan characteristics,  such as balance and interest rate, we needed complete and reliable  information on these characteristics for each month that a loan was active  during the period. However, many mortgages, particularly subprime  mortgages, had an incomplete set of monthly observations, often  because a servicer stopped providing information to CoreLogic.

Some changes to mortgage terms  were expected, but others were not. For instance, in the case of a fully  amortizing, fixed-rate mortgage, the interest rate should not change for  the entire duration of the mortgage. Thus any change to the interest rate  should indicate a modification. But in the case of an adjustable rate  mortgage (ARM) or hybrid mortgage, the interest rate changes in  expected ways according to reset provisions in the mortgage contract.  Thus, a change to the interest rate in a month in which a rate change was  expected and by an amount consistent with identified reset parameters  would likely not indicate a modification. Our decision rules differed  depending on whether a mortgage was a fixed-rate mortgage, ARM, or  hybrid mortgage.", "Because we could observe month-to-month changes in interest rates and  loan balance, our algorithms focus on interest rate decreases, balance  increases, and balance decreases that were likely to indicate a  modification. We relied on rules developed by Federal Reserve Bank  researchers to inform our initial screens. Their approach screened out  quite small changes and set upper and lower bounds on balance  changes. In some contexts, they also used information on a loan\u2019s  performance status as part of their decision rules\u2014for instance, by  requiring that observed changes be counted as modifications only if the  mortgage was delinquent before the observed change. We modified  these concepts, initially, accepting as potential modifications even very  small changes in interest rates and balances. We did not impose upper  bounds on balance changes, and we did not require that loans be  delinquent. We made the latter decision because the HAMP program  provides modifications for borrowers who are in imminent risk of default  on their mortgages, even though they may be current in their payments.  Additionally, in the case of prime, subprime and Alt-A hybrid loans, and  subprime ARM loans, we compared the interest rate in the month of a  rate change to the rate that equaled the loan\u2019s specified margin and the  specified index interest rate that was used to determine any adjustments.  If the rate in the month of a rate change was lower than our calculated  rate by more than 100 basis points, we accepted the change as a  modification because the decrease was large relative to what would be  expected.", "We placed each identified action into one of five broad categories:  capitalization accompanied by a rate reduction; capitalization only; rate  reduction only; balance decrease accompanied by a rate reduction; and  balance reduction only. For a month-to-month balance decrease, we  could not distinguish between balance forbearance and balance  forgiveness. In addition, because these month-to-month changes were  net changes, we could not identify modifications in which arrears were  added to the balance (capitalization) at the same time as an offsetting  balance reduction. For example, we could not distinguish a (net) balance  decrease modification from a modification in which a capitalization is  more than offset by balance forbearance or forgiveness. Similarly, we  could not distinguish a (net) balance increase modification from a  modification in which a capitalization is less than offset by balance  forbearance or forgiveness.", "After examining the resulting volume, timing, and composition of our initial  set of identified actions and incorporating information from OCC mortgage  metric data, we tightened our screens by adjusting the lower bounds,  including upper bounds, and imposing some loan performance conditions  (see table 2).

However, for months in which we  did find a rate change or balance change, we solved for the amortization  period associated with other mortgage characteristics at modification, and  estimated whether and by how much the mortgage term had been  extended. Specifically, we placed each action into one of three term  extension categories: with term extension (if the estimated term extension  was between 4 and 200 months); no term extension (if the estimated term  extension was less than 4 months or greater than 200 months); or  unknown term extension (if we were not able to calculate a measure of  term extension)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Robustness Test", "paragraphs": ["Our algorithms performed well when applied to a database of mortgages  containing information reported by servicers on both modified and  nonmodified loans.

We did  not develop algorithms for this type of modification because of data  limitations and evidence that term extensions only were not frequent.

We also note that, the redefault rate can be affected by  the type of loan modification action. Typically, the modification lowers the  monthly principal and interest payments by changing the interest rate,  term, or loan balance. We use reduced-form multivariate probabilistic  regression models, an approach used to examine choices and evaluate  various events or outcomes, to help determine these effects.", "Accordingly, based on economic reasoning, data availability, and  previous studies on loan performance, we use a relatively flexible  specification to estimate the likelihood that a loan that has been modified  redefaults.equals 100 if a loan that has been permanently modified redefaults within  6 months and 0 if the loan is still active and current.

For policy purposes, the payment change is important for  loan modifications because it indicates whether the modification is  affordable to the consumer. But while the payment change is important to  the consumer, the type of modification action is also important to the  lender/investor, because certain actions may not be feasible given the  terms of the mortgage or could result in lower returns. For this reason, we  also discuss the effects of the modification actions, independent of the  resulting payment change. In general, modification actions that make the  loan affordable are expected to lower the redefault rate.", "Payment change: Using the coefficient estimate of -0.174 for the  impact of payment change in table 22, we note that the larger the  reduction in monthly principal and interest payments, the less likely  the loans are to redefault. In particular, a 24-percent (the average)  reduction in monthly payments would reduce the likelihood of  redefault by 4 percentage points from the baseline redefault rate of 18  percent to 14 percent.", "Rate change: Using the coefficient estimate of -0.008 for the impact  of rate change in table 22, we find that the larger the reduction in the  interest rates of loans that receive interest rate reductions and at least  one other modification action, the lower the redefault rate. A decrease  of 302 bps (the average) would decrease the redefault rate by 2  percentage points from the baseline redefault rate of 16 percent to 14  percent.", "Balance reduction: Although the coefficient estimate for the impact  of balance reduction in table 22 indicates, unexpectedly, that  modifications that include balance reductions increase redefaults, the  result is generally not robust.

Both rates are lower than the overall redefault  rate for all HAMP loans, which was 15 percent.

As an example, irrespective of the modification  action (except for balance reduction), the redefault rate is 12 percent for  loans receiving a 40-percent reduction (the lowest redefault rate), but  rises to 20 percent for loans receiving a reduction of less than 10 percent.  The data also show that the majority of the loans received payment  reductions of less than 30 percent.

Overall,  borrower and loan characteristics at the time of modification are predictive  of redefault. Large payment reductions generally help borrowers with high  credit risks more than they help other borrowers. High-risk borrowers  generally have high CLTV ratios, high unemployment rates after  modification, and increased delinquency prior to modification. These  borrowers are sensitive to large payment reductions possibly because  they cannot afford their mortgages, but we could not control for  affordability in the model because of a lack of usable data on the debt-to- income (DTI) ratio.", "We find that payment reductions are more effective in reducing redefault  rates for borrowers with high CLTV ratios, especially those with ratios  above 125 percent (see table 28 and fig. 22). For instance, the baseline  redefault rate is 18 percent for borrowers with a CLTV of at least 125  percent and 13 percent for those with a CLTV of less than 95 percent.  With a payment reduction of less than 10 percent, the redefault rates are  25 percent and 16 percent for these two groups, respectively, but fall to  16 percent and 12 percent for payment reductions of 30 percent to 39  percent.

For instance, the baseline  redefault rate is 18 percent for borrowers who are located in areas that  experienced higher unemployment rates and 13 percent for those  experiencing lower unemployment rates. With a payment reduction of  between 50 to 59 percent, the redefault rate reduces to about 14 and 12  percent, respectively. Among the loans we analyzed, the proportion of  loans located in areas with increases in or no change in unemployment  rates was slightly lower than those located in areas with decreases in  unemployment rates. For both unemployment categories, the majority of  the loans received payment reductions of less than 30 percent.", "Payment reductions are more effective for borrowers who are 90 days or  more past due (see table 30 and fig. 24). For instance, the baseline  redefault rate is 17 percent for borrowers who are 90 days or more  delinquent. But with a payment reduction of at least 40 percent, the  redefault rate reduces to 13 percent. The payment reductions are  generally not very effective for the other borrowers, including those in  foreclosure. Among the loans we analyzed, almost three-quarters were  90 days or more past due. For all loan performance categories, the  majority of the loans received payment reductions of less than 30 percent.", "To ensure that the results were reliable, we performed several checks of  robustness for the main results reported for the CoreLogic data set in  column 1 of table 22 for payment reductions. We find that the results of  the checks are generally consistent with what we have reported.", "First, we estimated the model for different durations after the  modifications\u201412 and 18 months\u2014instead of 6 months. The baseline  redefault rate is 35 percent within 12 months of modification, and a 23- percent (the average) reduction in payments decreases the redefault rate  by 8 percentage points to 27 percent. Similarly, within 18 months of  modification, the redefault rate decreases from a baseline of 51 percent to  45 percent for a payment reduction of 18 percent (the average). Second,  as already indicated some loans had multiple modifications. Similar  estimates were obtained when we used only the latest modification action  for loans that received multiple modifications. Third, as in other studies,  the data were limited to loans that entered the CoreLogic database within  3 months of origination. This would help to reduce potential survivorship  bias. Also, we restricted the sample to loans originated since January  2005, including those originated since the housing boom. For both of  these cases, the results were similar to the main results. Fourth, the  significance of the estimates was unchanged when we estimated robust  standard errors. Finally, the results were unchanged when we clustered  the standard errors by zip codes.", "See, for example, Agarwal and others (2011a) which uses FICO credit scores and the  documentation status of the loans at origination. Since the data are not available for  documentation status, we used the delinquency status of the borrower and the FICO  credit scores at the time of the modification, both of which are predictive of redefault. way. For instance, low-quality loans would be more likely to redefault than  high-quality loans, because screening on unobservable characteristics is  less important for the latter pool of loans. But if the estimates show that  the conditional redefault rates are similar or low-quality loans were less  likely to redefault, then unobserved characteristics related to loan quality  are likely not the reason for the redefaults. The robustness check  suggests that the results are not likely to be biased by unobserved  borrower characteristics.", "We also excluded loans owned or guaranteed by the enterprises and  estimated the models. Loans owned or guaranteed by the enterprises  differ from private-label securitized loans in terms of underwriting  standards, default risk guarantee, servicer incentives, and modification  restrictions.
