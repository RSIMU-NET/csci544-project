According to guidance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which is responsible for providing guidance for and assessing agency continuity plans, a key element of a viable capability is the proper identification of essential functions. GAO previously reported on agency continuity plan compliance, and determined that a number of agencies and their components did not have continuity plans in place on October 1, 2002, and those that were in place did not generally comply with FEMA's guidance. GAO was asked to testify on its most recent work in continuity planning, which is discussed in a separate report, being released today (GAO-05-577). In this report, GAO reviewed to what extent (1) major federal agencies used sound practices to identify and validate their essential functions, (2) agencies had made progress since 2002 in improving compliance with FEMA guidance, and (3) agency continuity of operations plans addressed the use of telework arrangements (in which work is performed at an employee's home or at a work location other than a traditional office) during emergencies."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Many of the 23 agencies that GAO reviewed reported using sound practices for identifying and validating essential functions, but few provided documentation sufficient for GAO to confirm their responses. (GAO identified these sound practices based on published literature and in consultation with experts on continuity planning.) Agency responses indicate that--although aware of the practices--agencies may not have followed them thoroughly or effectively. Further, the essential functions identified by agencies varied widely: the number of functions identified in each plan ranged from 3 to 538 and included ones that appeared to be of secondary importance. The absence in FEMA's guidance of specific criteria for identifying essential functions contributed to this condition. Subsequent guidance significantly addresses the sound practices that GAO identified. Also, the White House has begun a process to improve continuity planning. If this guidance and process are implemented effectively, they could lead to improved identification of essential functions in the executive branch. As of May 1, 2004, agencies had made progress in improving compliance with FEMA guidance, but significant weaknesses remained. Agencies that had plans in place in both years showed significant improvement in the area of tests, training, and exercises. However, although some improvement occurred for other planning areas, important weaknesses remained: for example, 31 of 45 plans did not fully identify mission-critical systems and data necessary to conduct essential functions. Inadequate oversight by FEMA contributed to the level of weaknesses in agency continuity plans. FEMA plans to improve oversight using an online readiness reporting system, which it plans to have fully operational later this year, and it has already taken other steps to help agencies improve their plans, such as conducting an interagency exercise. However, FEMA does not plan to verify the readiness information that agencies will report in the system. Finally, even though FEMA's continuity planning guidance in place in May 2004 did not address telework, one agency's continuity plan at that time included plans to use telework in response to an emergency. In addition, 10 agencies reported that they planned to use telework following a COOP event, but their plans were not clearly documented. In its report, GAO made recommendations aimed at helping to improve continuity planning. These included establishing a schedule for the completion of recently initiated efforts, developing a strategy for short-term oversight in the meantime, and developing and implementing procedures that verify the agency-reported data used in oversight of agency continuity of operations planning. The report includes comments from FEMA. In commenting, FEMA agreed that there has been improvement in COOP plans and that additional oversight is needed."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I appreciate the opportunity to participate in the Committee\u2019s  hearing on federal continuity of operations planning. As you know,  essential government services can be interrupted by a range of  events, including terrorist attacks, severe weather, or building-level  emergencies. Federal agencies are required by Presidential Decision  Directive 67 to develop plans for ensuring the continuity of such  services in emergency situations. The Federal Emergency  Management Agency (FEMA), which was designated executive  agent for executive branch continuity of operations (COOP)  planning, issued Federal Preparedness Circular 65 in July 1999 as  planning guidance to agencies. The circular states that, in order to  have a viable COOP capability, agencies should identify their  essential functions. These functions then provide the basis for  subsequent planning steps. The circular also identified eight  elements of a viable COOP capability.", "We previously reviewed agency COOP plan compliance with  FEMA\u2019s guidance, at your request.

Such disruptions, particularly if  prolonged, can lead to interruptions in essential government  services. Prudent management, therefore, requires that federal  agencies develop plans for dealing with emergency situations,  including maintaining services, ensuring proper authority for  government actions, and protecting vital assets.", "Until relatively recently, continuity planning was generally the  responsibility of individual agencies. In October 1998, Presidential  Decision Directive (PDD) 67 identified the Federal Emergency  Management Agency (FEMA)\u2014which is responsible for responding  to, planning for, recovering from, and mitigating against disasters\u2014 as the executive agent for federal COOP planning across the federal  executive branch. FEMA was an independent agency until March  2003, when it became part of the Department of Homeland Security  (DHS), reporting to the Under Secretary for Emergency  Preparedness and Response. Under PDD 67, its responsibilities  include  \u25cf  formulating guidance for agencies to use in developing viable plans;  \u25cf  coordinating interagency exercises and facilitating interagency  coordination, as appropriate; and  \u25cf  overseeing and assessing the status of COOP capabilities across the  executive branch.", "According to FEMA officials, the directive also required that  agencies have COOP plans in place by October 1999.", "In July 1999, FEMA first issued Federal Preparedness Circular  (FPC) 65.

At that  time, we determined that most agencies identified at least one  function as essential, but the functions varied in number and  apparent importance. Furthermore, while 20 of 23 agencies had  documented COOP plans, none addressed all the guidance in FPC  65. We identified inadequate guidance and oversight as factors  contributing to these weaknesses, and recommended that DHS  (1) ensure that agencies without plans develop them, (2) ensure that  agencies address weaknesses in their plans, and (3) conduct  assessments of plans that included an independent verification of  agency-provided data and an assessment of identified essential  functions. In response to these recommendations, DHS reported in  July 2004 that it (1) was developing an online system to collect data  from agencies on the readiness of their continuity plans that would  evaluate compliance with the guidance, (2) had conducted an  interagency exercise, and (3) had developed a training program for  agency continuity planning managers.

The memorandum noted that in the past  many departments and agencies had had difficulty clearly  identifying and articulating their essential functions. It attributed  this difficulty, in part, to the lack of a defined set of national-level  essential functions to guide agency continuity planning, resulting in  multiple efforts to develop agency essential functions for different  specific purposes (e.g., planning for Year 2000 computer continuity,  information technology planning, and critical infrastructure  planning). Further, it noted that departments and agencies  sometimes do not distinguish between a \u201cfunction\u201d and the specific  activities necessary to perform the function.", "To address these issues, the memorandum identified eight National  Essential Functions that are necessary to lead and sustain the  country during an emergency and, therefore, must be supported  through continuity capabilities.

The memorandum asked agencies to reply by February 18,  2005.", "The memorandum emphasized the need for the involvement of  senior-level agency officials, calling for each agency\u2019s functions to  be first approved by an official with agencywide responsibilities.  The memorandum then laid out a process by which the functions  would be validated by an interagency group within the Homeland  Security Council. According to FEMA officials, two agencies\u2019  essential functions have already been reviewed, and there are plans  to complete all agency reviews by the end of the summer. The  validated functions would then be used to support development of a  new continuity policy and would be used to develop and implement  improved requirements for capabilities, inform the annual budget  process, establish program metrics, and guide training and exercises  and other continuity program activities. The memorandum did not  set any time frames for these later steps.", "Together, FEMA\u2019s revised guidance and the guidance from the  White House significantly address the best practices that we  identified.

The Under Secretary\u2019s letter drew  attention to a number of actions taken after the May 1, 2004, cutoff  date for our assessment. Finally, the Under Secretary pointed out  that the readiness reporting system that FEMA is developing was  not intended to be a COOP plan assessment tool, but that it instead  provides key officials with the ability to determine plan status in  near real time.
