In this report, GAO examines (1) HHS's planning efforts for ensuring an adequate supply and distribution of the nation's health care workforce and (2) the extent to which individual HHS health care workforce programs contribute to meeting national needs.

HHS's current strategic plan includes broad strategies\u2014such as improving access to comprehensive primary and preventive medical services in historically underserved areas and supporting federally funded health centers\u2014to which department officials said the health care workforce programs relate. However, these strategies do not explicitly reference workforce issues or specify how these programs contribute towards HHS's current strategic goals and performance targets. The health care workforce performance measures tracked by HHS and its agencies are specific to individual workforce programs and do not fully assess the overall adequacy of the department's workforce efforts. The Office of the Secretary leads workforce planning efforts, but it does not have an ongoing formal effort to ensure that the workforce programs distributed across its different agencies are aligned with national needs. Multiple external stakeholders, such as the Institute of Medicine and the Council on Graduate Medical Education, have reported that graduate medical education (GME) funding lacks the oversight and infrastructure to track outcomes, reward performance, and respond to emerging workforce challenges and that a more coordinated effort could help to ensure an adequate supply and distribution of the health care workforce. Consistent with leading practices, a coordinated department-wide planning effort is important to ensure that these efforts are aligned and managed effectively to meet workforce needs.", "While HHS's workforce programs support education and training for multiple health professions, its largest programs do not specifically target areas of workforce need, such as for primary care and rural providers. For example, its two Medicare GME programs accounted for about three-quarters of HHS's fiscal year 2014 obligations for health care workforce development. However, HHS cannot target existing Medicare GME program funds to projected workforce shortage areas because the programs were established by statute and funds are disbursed based on a statutory formula that is unrelated to projected workforce needs. HHS has limited legal authority to target certain existing programs to areas of emerging needs and has taken steps to do so within its existing authorities, such as the approval of certain demonstration projects to test new payment models for Medicaid GME funds. Further, the President's budget has proposed additional authorities that would allow HHS to implement new education and training programs and payment reforms intended to support primary care providers, but these authorities have not been enacted and officials did not know the extent to which they would be sufficient to address identified needs. External stakeholders have recommended additional reforms that would allow these programs to better targets areas of need. Without a comprehensive and coordinated planning approach, HHS cannot fully identify gaps and actions to address those gaps, including determining whether additional legislative proposals are needed to ensure that its programs fully meet workforce needs."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that HHS develop a comprehensive and coordinated planning approach that includes performance measures, identifies any gaps between its workforce programs and national needs, and identifies actions to close these gaps.

According to some studies, a growing demand for services, an aging  population, population growth, and increased access to insurance  resulting from the implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable  Care Act (PPACA) could result in provider shortages that could limit  patient access to care. In addition to current workforce shortages for  primary care and in rural areas, according to federal projections, by 2025,  there will be national or regional shortages in a number of health  professions, such as dentistry, psychiatry, general surgery, and nursing.  Some experts report that maintaining access to care could require an  increased supply of providers, while others suggest that access can be  improved through policy options. For example, they note that access to  care could be increased through greater use of technology, such as  telemedicine; changing the mix of providers delivering care; and changing  the pattern of practice, such as by providing more team-based care or by  eliminating currently provided care that is either unnecessary or of limited  value.", "The federal government\u2014largely through the Department of Health and  Human Services (HHS)\u2014funds a large number of education and training  programs to help ensure a sufficient supply and distribution of physicians,  nurses, dentists, and other health care professionals who provide care  directly to patients. These programs are managed by multiple HHS  component agencies, but in fiscal year 2014 about 90 percent of funding  came through the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) for  graduate medical education (GME) payments to hospitals and other  institutions that train physician residents. Most of the remaining HHS  workforce funding in 2014 was administered by the Health Resources and  Services Administration (HRSA) and generally offers financial assistance  to students or institutions to encourage students to train and work in  specific needed professions and regions. PPACA expanded many of  these programs, in addition to creating new ones to increase training in  direct health care professions and care in rural areas. Effective strategic  planning and timely workforce projections are important mechanisms for  HHS to manage its health care workforce programs, although we have  previously found that HHS has faced certain challenges in this area.", "Given the increased demands facing the nation\u2019s health care workforce  and the diversity of HHS\u2019s existing programs, you asked us to study   HHS\u2019s activities to ensure that federal funding is aligned with the nation\u2019s  health care needs.

Specifically, we reviewed the four most recent  HHS strategic plans (covering the periods 2014-2018, 2010-2015, 2007- 2012, and 2004-2009), as well as the President\u2019s recent budget proposals  for HHS and HHS\u2019s annual performance plans and reports\u2014which  include performance goals and measures\u2014for fiscal years 2014, 2015,  and 2016. We also reviewed the most recent strategic plan for each HHS  agency responsible for health care workforce programs, and we  interviewed agency officials to determine how its health care workforce  strategies are aligned with related strategies in the most recent HHS  strategic plan. We also interviewed HHS officials to identify HHS\u2019s  rationale for its current approach to strategic planning for the health care  workforce. We evaluated HHS\u2019s strategic planning and other efforts  against the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 (GPRAMA), as well as  leading practices for strategic planning and performance measurement  identified in prior GAO work. Finally, we reviewed recently published  reports by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) and other organizations that  have examined HHS\u2019s health care workforce programs and made  recommendations.", "To examine the extent to which individual HHS health care workforce  programs contribute to meeting national health care workforce needs, we  identified a list of 72 HHS programs that provided funding for workforce  development in fiscal year 2014. For each of these 72 programs, HHS  provided basic funding and performance information. From this listing, we  selected the 12 programs with the highest obligations\u2014ranging from $42  million to $8 billion\u2014in fiscal year 2014. These 12 programs accounted  for 96 percent of the total obligations of the 72 programs.

(See app. I for a list of these 12 programs.) For each of these 12  programs we did the following:  reviewed performance measures to determine how they contribute  toward department and agency goals;  reviewed documentation and interviewed responsible officials to  determine how HHS monitors these programs and how the workforce  programs align with HHS strategic planning goals;  compared agency performance management practices to criteria from  GPRAMA as well as leading practices identified in prior GAO work; examined the extent to which these programs meet identified areas of  health care workforce need; to identify areas of need, we reviewed the  literature on the health care workforce, as well as workforce projection  reports issued by HRSA that estimate key future areas of shortages in  the nation\u2019s health care workforce, examining the most recent HRSA  reports presenting projections for physicians, nurses, dentists, and  other clinical specialties;  reviewed documentation from HHS to identify changes that HHS has  made or proposed to the structure or allocation of program funds to  meet emerging health care workforce needs; and  reviewed the statutory requirements relevant to the permissible uses  of program funds and confirmed our understanding with agency  officials.", "We conducted this performance audit from December 2014 to December  2015 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

These agencies include HRSA, CMS, ACF, the Indian Health Service  (IHS), and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services  Administration (SAMHSA). (See fig. 2.) In addition, HHS has several  advisory bodies that make recommendations to the Secretary about  several topics.

These strategies generally do not explicitly reference  health care workforce training or education, but instead use broad  statements that concurrently encompass numerous different components  and methods for improving access to and quality of health care. For  example, as part of one strategy, HHS seeks to improve access to  comprehensive primary and preventative medical services in historically  underserved areas and to support federally funded health centers. While  not explicit in the plan, HHS officials indicated that developing the health  care workforce is one element that contributes to these strategies.

Further, while an earlier HHS strategic  plan (2007-2012) did not have a workforce-specific strategic goal, it also  had one objective and corresponding strategies on health care workforce  planning, similar to the detailed strategies in the 2010-2015 plan.  However, HHS officials told us that in developing the current strategic  plan, the department decided to remove most of the workforce-specific  language because it determined that workforce development was an  intermediate step in achieving the department\u2019s broader strategic goals of  improving access to and quality of health care.

For example, HHS has published a series of  strategic initiatives outlining the Secretary\u2019s priorities. In 2014, one of  these priorities was developing the health care workforce. This  document identified specific strategies for developing the health care  workforce, such as targeting resources to areas of high need and  strengthening the primary care workforce.

However, as of November 2015, HHS had not released  an update to this series of initiatives since the new Secretary assumed  office in June 2014. In addition, previous presidential annual budgets  have included proposals for improving HHS\u2019s health care workforce  programs.

Specifically, a  coordinated planning approach is essential to (1) setting targets for these  workforce programs and other efforts; (2) identifying and communicating  whether there are gaps between existing workforce programs and future  needs; and (3) determining whether agencies have the necessary  information to assess the reach and effectiveness of their programs.  While coordination at the program level is important, it does not take the  place of, or achieve the level of, overall department coordination that we  have previously found to be the key to successful coordination.", "Recently, multiple stakeholders reported that a more coordinated federal  effort\u2014possibly managed at the department level\u2014could help to ensure a  more adequate supply and distribution of the health care workforce,  especially given changes in the delivery of care. For example, in  examining federal GME funding, IOM and COGME each stated that the  GME program lacks the oversight and infrastructure to track outcomes,  reward performance, and respond to emerging workforce challenges.  IOM\u2019s recommendations for reforming GME include developing a  strategic plan for oversight of GME funding, as well as taking steps to  modernize GME payment methods based on performance to ensure  program oversight and accountability. Both entities suggested that GME  payments are neither sustainable in the long run nor the most effective  method to developing the health care workforce to meet future projected  health care needs. In each case, the organization recommended the  creation of a new entity to provide oversight of national workforce  efforts. Moreover, Congress also recognized the need for greater  coordinated attention to workforce planning when it authorized the  creation of the National Health Care Workforce Commission. Although the  Commission has not received an appropriation, it was authorized to  provide advice to HHS and Congress about workforce supply and  demand and to study various mechanisms to finance education and  training. According to HHS officials, to the extent possible, the department  has been able to complete work related to a number of the Commission\u2019s  planned functions, but certain critical functions remain unaddressed. For  example, the Commission would have been required to submit an annual  report to Congress and the administration that would include, among  other things, information on implications of current federal policies  affecting the health care workforce and on workforce needs of  underserved populations.

For example,  the State Innovation Model demonstration at the Center for Medicare and  Medicaid Innovation is providing financial and technical support to states  for the development and testing of state-led, multi-payer health care  payment and service delivery models that are intended to improve health  system performance, increase quality of care, and decrease costs for  Medicare, Medicaid, and Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program  beneficiaries\u2013and for residents of participating states. According to  HHS, a number of states are using the opportunity of participating in the  demonstration to reform GME and make investments in the physician  training more accountable. Both Vermont and Connecticut have been  awarded funding as \u201cmodel testing states\u201d based on their state innovation  proposals. HHS indicated that these states proposed innovative GME  mechanisms, outside of those traditionally supported by CMS, to help  better meet their health workforce needs.", "HHS officials also reported that the Center for Medicare & Medicaid  Innovation conducted demonstrations to test new approaches to paying  providers. For example, in 2012, the center initiated the graduate nurse  education demonstration to increase the number of graduate nursing  students enrolled in advance practice registered nurse training programs.", "The demonstration increased reimbursement for their clinical training by  $200 million over 4 years."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HHS\u2019s Proposed Authorities May Not Fully Address Alignment of Its Largest Workforce Programs with National Needs", "paragraphs": ["HHS has proposed additional authorities intended to help address  changing health care workforce needs, although they may not fully align  the department\u2019s programs with national needs. In both fiscal years 2015  and 2016, the President\u2019s budget proposed to reduce a portion of  Medicare\u2019s GME payments made to hospitals by 10 percent. It also  proposed investing in a new program to provide additional GME funding  for primary care and rural communities. The 10-year, $5.3 billion \u201ctargeted  support\u201d grant to be run by HRSA would build upon the work of HRSA\u2019s  Teaching Health Centers Graduate Medical Education Payment Program  and would train 13,000 physicians in primary care or other high-need  specialties in teaching hospitals and other community-based health care  facilities, with a focus on ambulatory and preventive care. According to  HHS officials, these proposals are intended to serve as a first step to  improve the alignment of GME funding with health care needs. The fiscal  year 2016 budget also proposed continuation of programs, authorized  under PPACA and Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010  (HCERA), to provide primary care providers with higher Medicare and  Medicaid payments as a way to incentivize health care providers to offer  primary care services to Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. HHS  officials indicated that the implementation of these proposals would help  officials recognize any successes and gaps, and, if necessary, they could  then develop any additional proposals to supplement the programs.  However, while implementing these proposed programs would provide  greater funding to some areas of need, HHS officials stated that they do  not know the full extent to which these proposals are sufficient to address  identified health care workforce needs. While HHS officials indicated that  the department planned to determine their sufficiency and identify  remaining gaps after these proposals were enacted, the department does  not have a comprehensive plan from which to evaluate the impact of the  new programs or make a complete assessment of any gaps.", "External stakeholders\u2014such as IOM, Medicare Payment Advisory  Commission (MedPAC), and COGME\u2014have identified various reforms to  HHS\u2019s largest health care workforce programs to better target these  programs to emerging areas of health care workforce need. HHS officials  told us that some of the reforms proposed by these stakeholders were the  basis for some of the department\u2019s past budget and legislative proposals.  For example, IOM convened a panel of experts that recommended  restructuring Medicare GME payments to help align the programs to the  health needs of the nation. In its 2014 report, IOM proposed, among  other things, (a) developing a new center at CMS to administer GME  program payment reform and manage demonstrations of new GME  payment models and (b) the creation of a transformation fund within the  GME programs to finance payment demonstrations. In a report released  in 2014, COGME concurred with IOM that there is a need to reform GME  payments and, among other things, recommended expanding the GME  program\u2019s clinical training environment into the ambulatory and  community setting. While an advocate for teaching hospitals\u2014 Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC)\u2014has cautioned  against reductions in GME funding, it has also proposed reforms to the  GME program and Medicare payment policy to bolster primary care  training and reduce geographic disparities."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["While HHS maintains that developing an adequate supply and distribution  of the health care workforce is a priority for the department, it has  removed explicit language about goals and objectives related to  workforce issues from its current strategic plan, which is the primary  planning mechanism to address this issue. HHS\u2019s lack of specific  planning goals for the health workforce in its current strategic plan makes  it challenging for the department to plan and to maintain accountability.  Moreover, the department does not currently have a comprehensive set  of performance measures and targets to assess whether its workforce  efforts and the specific individual workforce programs managed by its  agencies are collectively meeting the department\u2019s broader strategic goal  of strengthening health care by improving access and quality.", "Because the responsibilities for HHS\u2019s workforce efforts, programs, and  resources are dispersed among many agencies, it is important that HHS  have a department-wide approach regarding its strategies and the actions  needed to ensure an adequate supply and distribution of the nation\u2019s  workforce. For example, while HRSA manages the largest number of  workforce programs and the development of workforce projections, the  vast majority of workforce development funds are administered by CMS\u2014 for which workforce planning is not a key mission. It is also important for  HHS to comprehensively assess the extent to which its many workforce  programs, collectively, are adequate to address changing health care  workforce needs. Multiple stakeholders have made recommendations to  improve these programs. However, because the majority of workforce  funds must be dispersed based on statutory requirements unrelated to  projected workforce needs, HHS has limited options to retarget them.  HHS has proposed additional authorities in the past, but these have not  been enacted, and HHS officials acknowledge that these additional  authorities may not be sufficient to fully address the existing program  limitations identified by stakeholders. Without a comprehensive and  coordinated approach to program planning, HHS cannot fully identify the  gaps between existing programs and national needs, identify actions  needed to address these gaps, or determine whether additional legislative  proposals are needed to ensure that its programs fully meet workforce  needs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To ensure that HHS workforce efforts meet national needs, we  recommend that the Secretary of Health and Human Services develop a  comprehensive and coordinated planning approach to guide HHS\u2019s health  care workforce development programs\u2014including education, training, and  payment programs\u2014that  includes performance measures to more clearly determine the extent  to which these programs are meeting the department\u2019s strategic goal  of strengthening health care;  identifies and communicates to stakeholders any gaps between  existing programs and future health care workforce needs identified in  HRSA\u2019s workforce projection reports;  identifies actions needed to address identified gaps; and  identifies and communicates to Congress the legislative authority, if  any, the Department needs to implement the identified actions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft copy of this report to HHS for its review and HHS  provided written comments, which are reprinted in appendix IV.

For example, HHS noted that it coordinates workforce  planning efforts through the HHS department-level and agency-specific  budget, legislative development, health policy research and innovation  work, performance management, and strategic planning. HHS also  indicated that the National Health Care Workforce Commission, created  under PPACA, has the potential to enhance HHS\u2019s ability to implement a  more comprehensive and coordinated planning approach, but that the  commission has not received federal appropriations. In the absence of  appropriations for this commission, HHS stated that it has undertaken  some of the commission\u2019s health care workforce planning and  coordination activities, to the extent possible. In response to our  recommendation, HHS indicated that it could convene an interagency  group to assess (a) existing workforce programs, (b) performance  measurement, (c) budgetary and other proposals, (d) gaps in workforce  programs, and (e) potential requests to the Congress for modified or  expanded legislative authority. We agree that a regular and ongoing  initiative focused on the coordination of health care workforce programs  could provide an important first step toward ensuring a more  comprehensive and coordinated planning approach.", "HHS also reiterated that its health care workforce programs contribute to  its broad goals of access and quality from its strategic plan, as was  described in our draft report.
