The General Services Administration (GSA) is authorized to provide each former president with suitable office space appropriately furnished and equipped at a location specified by the former president. The law does not, however, provide any guidance on the appropriate amount of space that is to be provided. For fiscal year 2000, GSA's rent charged to former President Bush was $144,000, former President Carter $89,283, former President Ford $105,099, and former President Reagan $256,671. Former President Clinton's office was not finished until late August 2001. His annual rent payment to GSA for fiscal year 2002 is estimated to be about $354,000. The federal government is paying the entire lease cost for all of the former presidents' offices, according to GSA officials. The rental rates GSA has paid for former presidents' offices are generally comparable to rents paid for similar properties in the same areas. The Carter Presidential Center has provided additional space for President Carter's use at no cost to the government. The Secret Service maintains space close to each of the former presidents' offices and pays rent to GSA for that space. The office staffs of former presidents ranged from six to 19 persons, including paid staff, volunteers, and interns. In addition to receiving federal compensation, most paid staff members also receive compensation from other sources. According to representatives of each former president, the staff is not involved with political fund-raising activities.

Former President Bush\u2019s office eliminated about 1,300 square feet of unneeded office space in 1994, about 1 year after he first occupied his office. About 119 square feet of storage space was added during 1999.

The rental rate per square foot for the Social Security office, which is located on a lower floor, is about $57.18. The Clinton rental rate is about 4 percent higher.

The amount of interior construction depends upon the condition of the leased space and the planned layout: it might already be configured so that only minor modifications are necessary, or the space could require extensive work. If interior construction is necessary, GSA tries, as part of its negotiation with the building owner, to persuade the owner to pay for some of the construction costs. For example, as part of the lease cost, the owner may provide an allowance of $5 per square foot. According to GSA officials, the condition of the commercial leasing market at the time GSA negotiates with the owner determines, to some extent, what the rent and build-out allowance will be. If quality space is in short supply, GSA officials said that rental rates go up and allowances offered or provided by building owners go down.", "If the costs of the construction exceed the allowance provided by the owner, GSA and the former president, as the tenant, are responsible for the additional costs. Such costs can be charged against the former president\u2019s account in one lump-sum, or GSA can amortize the cost as part of the rent over some period of time. We found that at least two of the former presidents\u2019 offices, using Transition Act funds, chose the lump-sum payment to pay for part of their office interior construction costs. We could not determine if similar payments were made for the other three former presidents\u2019 offices, because records were not readily available. However, based upon discussions we had with GSA officials, we believe it is likely that this method was chosen as well. Using the funds on a lump- sum basis keeps the rent costs lower than if those costs were amortized and collected as part of the monthly rent. In the GSA lease files for former Presidents Bush and Clinton, we found documentation stating that the former presidents authorized the use of their transition funds for this purpose. According to a GSA budget official, this is an allowable expenditure of Transition Act funds because they can be used for office space. According to the budget official, it was his experience that this was the preferred method. Former President Bush authorized $134,500 and former President Clinton authorized $415,000 of their Transition Act funds for the construction of their offices interior space. Former President Clinton\u2019s total transition budget was $1,525,000, of which about $878,000 was obligated as of June 30, 2001.", "Once the interior construction is finished, the office needs to be furnished with desks, chairs, computers, telephone systems, and so forth.

We inspected each former president\u2019s office complex and did not see anything that might be considered in excess of what would be found in quality office space elsewhere. Walls were generally painted, no wallpaper, and the furniture was generally government issue. According to GSA officials, a former president is allowed interior space that is comparable to the quality of space provided to an executive department head. Since the former president\u2019s pension is based upon the salary of a cabinet official, it is reasonable to expect that the office quality would be comparable. We visited two cabinet officer offices as part of this assignment, and on previous occasions we have visited offices such as an U.S. Attorney\u2019s office and judicial chambers.

They said that while everything regarding real estate is negotiable, it would be reasonable to assume that a high-floor office with a good view or an office with a good view in general could be expected to command a higher rental rate. Because so many factors influence what the final rental rate would be, such as the supply and demand for office space, GSA officials could not provide a definitive incremental rental amount generally associated with a higher floor location or an office with a good view.
