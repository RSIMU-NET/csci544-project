Traditional Medicare provider payment systems reward the volume of services instead of the quality or efficiency of care by paying physicians for each service provided. Some health systems, which can be hospitals, physicians, health plans, or a combination, use financial incentive programs to reward physicians for improving quality and efficiency with the goal of better outcomes for patients and savings for hospitals and payers. Federal laws that protect patients and the integrity of federal programs, including Medicare, limit health systems\u0092 ability to implement financial incentive programs.

GAO analyzed relevant laws and agency guidance and documentation; and interviewed agency officials, legal experts, and provider stakeholders."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Certain financial incentive programs are permitted within the framework of federal fraud and abuse laws, but stakeholders GAO spoke with reported that the laws, regulations, and agency guidance have created challenges for program design and implementation. The Stark law and anti-kickback statute, which restrict financial relationships among providers, have statutory and regulatory exceptions and safe harbors, respectively, that permit financial incentive programs that meet specific criteria. However, there are no exceptions or safe harbors specifically for financial incentive programs intended to improve quality and efficiency, and legal experts reported that the constraints of existing exceptions and safe harbors make it difficult to design and implement a comprehensive program for all participating physicians and patient populations. The CMP law prohibits hospitals from paying physicians to reduce or limit services, and OIG has interpreted the law to apply to the reduction or limitation of any services, whether or not those services are medically necessary. The CMP law does not include statutory exceptions to this prohibition, and OIG does not have the authority to create exceptions through regulation. Through its advisory opinion process, OIG, however, has indicated that it would not impose sanctions for specific financial incentive programs that otherwise violated the CMP law but presented a low risk of fraud and abuse. Legal experts stated that innovative arrangements are difficult to structure and that the advisory opinion process is burdensome.", "Through alternative approaches, HHS has approved implementation of otherwise prohibited financial incentive programs that incorporate safeguards, under its statutory authority to conduct demonstrations and other initiatives. Specifically, CMS has conducted demonstration projects to test financial incentive programs that reward quality and efficiency. These demonstration projects included safeguards, such as linking payments to quality measures, to protect program and patient integrity. CMS has incorporated safeguards into the Medicare Shared Savings Program, which allows eligible providers to participate as accountable care organizations to share savings with the Medicare program. As specifically authorized for the Medicare Shared Savings Program, CMS and OIG will waive fraud and abuse laws for, among other things, the distribution of shared savings in the Medicare Shared Savings Program, subject to certain requirements. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation within CMS is also implementing programs to test financial incentives.", "GAO\u0092s work suggests that stakeholders\u0092 concerns may hinder implementation of financial incentive programs to improve quality and efficiency on a broad scale. Stakeholders\u0097government agencies and health care providers\u0097likely will continue to have different perspectives about the optimal balance between innovative approaches to improve quality and lower costs and retaining appropriate patient safeguards. HHS reviewed a draft of this report and in its written comments, clarified its position on CMS\u0092s authorities to create exceptions and issue waivers to permit certain financial incentive programs, noting that its authority to issue waivers is broader than its authority to create Stark exceptions. We modified the draft to reflect the Department\u0092s position."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["For many years the United States has devoted an increasing proportion  of its gross domestic product (GDP) and federal budget to the provision of  health care services. National health expenditures rose from  approximately 7 percent of GDP in 1970 to approximately 18 percent\u2014 $2.5 trillion\u2014in 2009. Over this same period, the proportion of federal  budget outlays devoted to health care increased even more rapidly from  approximately 8.3 to 26.9 percent. Medicare spending, which represents  a large share of federal health care expenditures, is projected to increase  from approximately $519 billion in 2010 to approximately $922 billion in  2020. We have long expressed concern that the increases in Medicare  spending are unsustainable, especially in light of evidence that suggests  that greater spending does not necessarily translate to better health care  quality.", "The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, Institute of Medicine  (IOM), and other experts have recommended that payments for health  care should contain stronger incentives for quality and efficiency. IOM, in  its 2001 report \u201cCrossing the Quality Chasm: A New Health System for  the 21st Century\u201d, recommended that payment methods should, among  other things, provide an opportunity for providers to share in the benefits  of quality improvement, align financial incentives with the implementation  of care processes based on best practices and the achievement of better  patient outcomes, and enable providers to coordinate care for patients  across settings and over time. However, current provider payment  systems used by traditional Medicare create conflicting incentives and  contribute to the growth in spending by rewarding volume of services  regardless of quality and cost, leading to duplication and overutilization  of services that is wasteful and potentially harmful. Specifically, under  traditional Medicare, hospitals are paid a predetermined fixed amount for  each hospital stay regardless of the number of services provided, but  physicians receive payment for each service delivered and have little  incentive to coordinate the provision of care or control the volume of  services.", "Physicians play a central role in the generation of health care  expenditures, and the incentive for physicians to order more services has  a broad impact on total spending. While the services they provide directly  to patients account for an estimated 20 percent of total health care  expenditures, their influence is estimated to account for up to 90 percent  of these expenditures because they either directly or indirectly control or  influence most of the health services that are provided. For example,  physicians admit patients to hospitals, and they order services such as  imaging studies and laboratory tests. As some policy experts have noted,  many factors give physicians an incentive to order more services than  may be necessary, including a physician culture that values  meticulousness, the scarcity of data comparing the effectiveness of  different treatments and interventions, and the fear of malpractice  lawsuits. In conjunction with these factors, paying physicians for an  intervention that may only be justified by a slim clinical rationale adds a  strong financial incentive to deliver more services.", "Faced with these challenges, policymakers, health care providers, and  others have sought ways to improve the quality of care and at the same  time reduce costs. While the federal government examines various  reforms to payment mechanisms, some health systems are  implementing financial incentive programs to promote the quality and  efficiency of care by rewarding physicians for meeting quality benchmarks  and improving efficiency. Proponents of these programs believe they  have the potential to result in better health outcomes for patients, and  savings for hospitals and third-party payers, such as private health plans  and public health programs including Medicare. Congress has included  various reforms in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act  (PPACA), including those that align incentives for hospitals and  physicians to improve health care quality and efficiency in conjunction  with efforts to develop collaborative care models for the Medicare  program. For example, PPACA requires that the Department of Health  and Human Services (HHS) establish a shared savings program\u2014the  Medicare Shared Savings Program\u2014that encourages coordination of  care under Medicare Parts A and B and promotes accountability for  patient populations. Under the Medicare Shared Savings Program,  eligible health systems that achieve savings for Medicare by improving  quality and efficiency may receive a share of the savings they generate  as financial incentive payments. Health systems that implement other  financial incentive programs must comply with various federal laws in  their efforts to reward quality and efficiency.", "A number of federal laws apply to financial relationships among hospitals,  physicians, health plans, and other entities. Among other things, these  laws limit health systems that deliver care to Medicare beneficiaries from  implementing financial incentive programs that could, for example,  influence providers to recommend medically inappropriate services or  withhold costly services that are medically necessary. These federal laws  were designed to protect patients and the integrity of federal health care  programs, including Medicare. They include, among others, the physician  self-referral law (known as the Stark law), the anti-kickback statute,  and the Civil Monetary Penalties (CMP) law.

The Stark law also prohibits these entities  that perform the designated health services from presenting, or causing to  be presented, claims to Medicare or billing any individual, third-party  payer, or other entity for these services. The Stark law includes a  number of exceptions and authorizes the Secretary of HHS to create  regulatory exceptions for financial relationships that do not pose a risk of  patient or program abuse.

According to CMS officials, this \u201cno risk\u201d  requirement is high and limits their ability to create new regulatory  exceptions to the Stark law. In 2008 CMS attempted to use its authority to  propose a new exception covering financial incentive programs.  However, the \u201cno risk\u201d requirement necessitated a narrow exception with  many structural safeguards in light of the risk that financial incentive  programs could be used to disguise payments for referrals or adversely  affect patient care.

As a result, this financial incentive program does not align  incentives between the health system and independent physicians who  have privileges at the hospital. To incentivize quality improvement on a  broader scale, hospital officials told us they were able to use another  Stark law exception to implement a separate financial incentive program  to include independent physicians. Specifically, because the health  system had a health plan component, the health system was able to use  the physician incentive plan exception in creating a financial incentive  program for independent physicians to reward them for meeting a  separate set of quality measures\u2014the Healthcare Effectiveness Data  Information Set (HEDIS). The physician incentive plan exception  permits financial incentive plans that are administered and paid through  health plans under certain conditions. Hospitals or health systems without  a health plan component would have to design a financial incentive  program to fit into other exceptions to include independent physicians.  Additionally, operating multiple financial incentive programs covering  different populations of physicians may create potential inefficiencies  through redundancy or conflicting program objectives.", "In addition, most of the legal experts we spoke with told us that it is  difficult for health systems to navigate the Stark law, and one legal expert  told us that as a result health systems have terminated existing financial  incentive programs or refrained from starting new programs. Some legal  experts also told us that the requirements for complying with the Stark  exceptions are difficult to apply when crafting financial incentive  programs. In particular, they told us it is challenging to establish whether  incentive payments meet the Stark fair market value exception, which in  part requires that compensation be consistent with fair market value of  services provided. One legal expert we spoke with noted that the Stark  law\u2019s fair market value exception potentially applies to payments from  hospitals to physicians. For salary, the fair market value exception can be  satisfied by using published surveys of wages to determine the fair  market value of services provided. However, according to this legal  expert, the exception becomes more difficult to apply when trying to  determine the fair market value in connection with incentive payments,  separate from compensation, for meeting performance goals. Specifically,  some legal experts told us that the exception is unclear about how to  measure the fair market value of services when those services involve  meeting a clinically based outcome measure for a financial incentive  program to improve quality. Additionally, it would be difficult to calculate  the value of services not provided as a result of the physician providing  higher quality care leading to better health outcomes.", "Some legal experts also told us that many of the Stark exceptions on  which they rely require that compensation, including incentive payments  from hospitals to physicians, not reflect the volume or value of referrals  made by the physician. incentive programs may be structured so that incentive payments are  distributed to all participating physicians without being directly related to  any individual physician\u2019s compliance with quality improvement criteria.  Therefore, all participating physicians would receive the same payment  without necessarily contributing the same level of effort. As a result,  according to some of the legal experts we spoke with, an  underperforming physician would not have an incentive to change his or  her practices to improve the quality of care.", "E.g., 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1395nn(e)(2)(ii), 1395nn(e)(3)(A)(v), 1395nn(e)(5)(B).", "Financial incentive programs limited to commercial patients may also  implicate federal fraud and abuse laws.

Financial incentive programs limited to commercial patient  populations may \u201cspill over\u201d to Medicare patients. For example, a financial  incentive program that rewards quality improvement for commercial  patient outcomes may influence how a participating physician treats  Medicare patients. To protect themselves from Stark law and anti- kickback statute violations, health systems may structure their programs  to fit into an exception or safe harbor in case a Medicare patient is  inadvertently included in the program. For example, officials from a  hospital system in a major urban area in the Midwest told us the hospital  entered into a financial incentive program to share savings with a  commercial payer for its commercial patient population only. These  officials told us their program only includes employed physicians to further  protect the providers from Stark law or anti-kickback statute violations if a  Medicare patient is inadvertently included in the program.", "Financial incentive programs limited to commercial patients also might  include Medicare patients in other ways. For example, a commercial  insurer that used a hospital\u2019s achievement of quality benchmarks could  include the hospital\u2019s Medicare patients in determining whether the  benchmarks are met. In 2008, OIG issued a favorable advisory opinion in  response to a request from a hospital seeking to implement a financial  incentive program to reward physicians for meeting quality targets for  commercial patients. The requester-hospital was participating in a pay- for-performance program with a private insurer, under which the hospital  would be rewarded with a bonus payment for achieving quality targets  based on health outcomes of all patients, including Medicare patients.  The hospital stated that it needed to implement a financial incentive  program with its physicians in order to achieve those quality targets and  would reward physicians with a share of the bonus payment received  from the private insurer. OIG determined that the program implicated the  anti-kickback statute because the program relied on all hospital patient  data, which included data for Medicare patients, instead of using only  commercial patient data, to determine incentive payments for  physicians.not to impose sanctions for this program.", "In its advisory opinion on the matter, however, OIG elected  OIG officials told us that they did not take any Stark law or anti-kickback  statute enforcement actions on the basis of providers\u2019 implementation of  pay-for-performance programs or gainsharing arrangements from fiscal  years 2005 through 2010.

They  stated that MCOs, unlike hospitals, can more readily identify the patients  participating in the network. OIG further reasoned that patients who enroll  in an MCO understand that their physicians will have an economic  incentive with respect to managing their care, and in return, patients  share in any savings through increased benefits, such as reduced  copayments and the addition of outpatient prescription drug coverage.  By contrast, in OIG\u2019s view, patients in traditional Medicare incur  substantial additional financial obligations in exchange for access to  physicians of their choice.", "According to OIG, hospitals may align incentives with physicians to  achieve cost savings through means that do not violate the CMP law. For  example, depending on the circumstances, an arrangement where the  hospital pays the physicians a fixed fee that is fair market value for  specific services rendered would compensate the physicians for their  effort and not for a reduction or limitation in services. Achieving savings  through actions that do not adversely affect the quality of patient care  may require substantial effort on the part of the physicians. Depending on  the circumstances, if the financial incentive program is based on the  physician\u2019s efforts rather than a percentage of cost savings, the program  may not violate the CMP law. According to OIG officials, even if the  program leads to a reduction or limitation of services, as long as the  payment is not for the purpose of reducing services, the program would  not violate the CMP law. For example, a hospital could pay a physician to  complete his or her rounds by a specific time, which may result in patients  being evaluated for discharge earlier. The payment is not tied to a  reduction or limitation of services, but if patients are not hospitalized  longer than necessary, this arrangement makes it possible for the hospital  to be efficient and reduce costs.", "One legal expert and an industry group stakeholder we spoke with  consider OIG\u2019s interpretation of the CMP law overly broad\u2014prohibiting  payment from hospitals to physicians to induce the reduction or limitation  of any service, regardless of medical necessity. In February 2009, an  industry group stakeholder wrote to OIG contending that the agency  should interpret the CMP law in the context of Medicare\u2019s requirements  that only medically necessary services are covered by the program. Since  Medicare only covers medically necessary services, and the CMP law  prohibits reduction or limitation of Medicare services, according to this  stakeholder, the CMP law should be interpreted as prohibiting a reduction  or limitation of medically necessary services.", "Some legal experts we spoke with and two industry group stakeholders  consider the CMP law a major hurdle to the development and  implementation of financial incentive programs that allow the hospital to  reward physicians for lowering hospital costs and improving quality by  reducing medically unnecessary services. Similarly, an industry group  stakeholder, in a September 2010 statement to OIG, claimed that the  CMP law constrains the development of financial incentive programs that  would align hospital and physician incentives to provide more cost- effective care by, for example, encouraging more careful choice among  available generic and brand name drugs or use of outpatient rather than  inpatient services. This stakeholder noted that physicians are concerned  that participation in such gainsharing arrangements exposes them to  liability under the CMP law. Another industry group stakeholder, in a   May 2008 statement, asserted that the CMP law has dissuaded providers  from pursuing financial incentive programs using specific practice  protocols, even those based on clinical evidence and recognized as best  practices, because of provider concern that OIG might find that the  program provided an incentive to reduce or limit services.", "Some legal experts told us that their health system clients have  implemented financial incentive programs to reward quality, and they also  include efficiency measures that could reduce or limit services but do not  tie incentive payments to these measures to avoid implicating the CMP  law. Although physicians are not rewarded for meeting these efficiency  measures, their performance in meeting these benchmarks may be  monitored and information may be shared with the physician as  feedback, possibly providing a nonfinancial incentive to improve  efficiency. For example, one legal expert described an arrangement  between a hospital and its independent physicians to reward quality. The  original goal of the program was to reduce the length of stay for patients.  In addition to quality measures such as adhering to clinical protocols and  meeting patient satisfaction benchmarks, the hospital wanted to include  efficiency measures, such as standards for inpatient admission that could  have limited admissions, but the physicians\u2019 attorney was concerned that  the program would violate the CMP law. Specifically, the attorney was  concerned that including standards for inpatient admissions could lead to  a reduction of services if, for example, a patient who did not meet these  standards was denied admission to the hospital even if admission was  not necessary. In response to these concerns, the hospital tied incentive   Although the program retained the  payments only to quality measures.efficiency measures, such as medically inappropriate days, these  measures were tied to widely used clinical standards, no payment was  tied to them, and they were used only to collect information on physician  performance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OIG Permits Certain Financial Incentive Programs through Its Advisory Opinion Process, but Stakeholders Reported Challenges in Implementing These Programs", "paragraphs": ["In its 1999 SAB, OIG interpreted the CMP law to prohibit gainsharing  arrangements in response to hospitals\u2019 implementation of \u201cblack box\u201d  gainsharing arrangements in the 1990s. In OIG\u2019s view, those gainsharing  arrangements, in which physicians were paid for overall cost savings  without the hospitals determining the specific actions the physicians took  to generate the savings, posed a high risk of abuse. According to OIG,  the black box gainsharing arrangements provided little accountability,  insufficient safeguards against improper referral payments, and lacked  objective performance measures to ensure that quality of care was not   In various documents addressing the matter, OIG  adversely affected.has noted its concern with the potential effect gainsharing has on the  quality of care provided to Medicare patients. Specifically, OIG\u2019s concerns  include stinting on patient care, \u201ccherry picking\u201d healthy patients and  steering sicker and more costly patients to hospitals that do not offer such  arrangements, payments in exchange for patient referrals, and unfair  competition among hospitals offering cost-sharing programs to foster  physician loyalty and to attract more referrals.", "OIG has recognized, however, that certain gainsharing arrangements  may reduce costs and improve quality without compromising care or  rewarding referrals. Specifically, OIG has recognized that certain  gainsharing arrangements, while potentially violating the CMP law and  the anti-kickback statute, present a minimal risk of fraud and abuse that  these laws were intended to address. On this basis, OIG has indicated  that it would not subject specific arrangements approved in advisory  opinions to sanctions. Through its advisory opinion process, OIG has  evaluated certain gainsharing arrangements that could implicate the CMP  law and anti-kickback statute. Since 2001, OIG has issued 14 advisory   In these opinions, OIG  opinions on specific gainsharing arrangements.concluded that the arrangements presented a low risk of abuse and that  they would not, therefore, be subject to sanction. While OIG advisory  opinions provide important guidance to providers about what may or may  not be sanctioned by OIG, the opinions only address the anti-kickback  statute and the CMP law. Because CMS, not OIG, has responsibility for  interpreting the Stark law, OIG gainsharing opinions do not address the  legality of these arrangements under the Stark law. CMS has not received  any requests to issue advisory opinions on gainsharing arrangements,  and therefore has not done so.", "In evaluating the risks posed by these gainsharing arrangements, OIG  looked for measures that promote accountability, provide adequate  quality controls, and protect against payments for referrals. The cost  saving measures included in the approved gainsharing arrangements can  generally be categorized as product standardization measures, product  substitution, opening packaged items only when needed, or limiting the  use of certain supplies or devices.features that, when taken together, OIG determined they provided  sufficient safeguards to reduce the risk of program and patient abuse so  that OIG would not seek sanctions against the health system for violation  of the CMP law. These safeguards include  specific cost-saving actions and resulting savings that are clearly and  separately identified; credible medical support that implementation of the arrangement  would not adversely affect patient care; payments that are based on all procedures and do not reflect the  differences among individual patients\u2019 insurance coverage; protection against inappropriate reductions in services by utilizing  objective historical and clinical measures to establish baseline  thresholds below which no savings accrue to the physicians; protections in the product standardization portion of the arrangement  to further protect against inappropriate reductions in services by  ensuring that individual physicians will still have available the same  selection of devices after implementation of the arrangement as  before; written disclosure provided to patients whose care may be affected by  the arrangement and an opportunity for patients to review the cost  savings recommendations prior to admission to the hospital; financial incentives that are reasonably limited in duration and  amount; and profits that are distributed to the physicians on a per capita basis,  mitigating any incentive for an individual physician to generate  disproportionate cost savings.", "According to OIG, improperly designed or implemented arrangements  could be vehicles to disguise payments for referrals. OIG found that the  specific gainsharing arrangements evaluated in the advisory opinions  could violate the anti-kickback statute, but the agency stated it would not  impose sanctions for those arrangements because they included  safeguards that reduced the likelihood that the arrangement would be  used to attract referring physicians or to increase referrals from existing  physicians. Due to the circumstances of the arrangements, as well as the  included safeguards, OIG determined that the arrangements presented a  low risk of fraud or abuse under the anti-kickback statute. Although the  advisory opinions have focused on specific service lines, such as cardiac  and orthopedic surgery, OIG officials stated that they are willing to  evaluate gainsharing arrangements for other service lines. However, to  date, OIG has not been asked to do so.", "In February 2009, one industry group stakeholder asked OIG in writing to  withdraw the agency\u2019s SAB that interpreted the CMP law as prohibiting  gainsharing. The industry group asserted that the agency\u2019s subsequent  advisory opinions permitting implementation of certain gainsharing  arrangements represent an \u201cimplicit acknowledgment that the  experiences and context that gave rise to the 1999 Bulletin  have  changed significantly.\u201d Specifically, according to this stakeholder, tools,  such as the proliferation of quality measures, are now available to prevent  financial incentives from causing harm to patients. However, according to  OIG officials, although the health care delivery environment has changed  since the CMP law was enacted, the payment systems that led to the  enactment of the CMP law are still in use.", "Legal experts and stakeholders told us that multiple challenges are  associated with implementing gainsharing arrangements since OIG  issued its SAB, despite the availability of OIG\u2019s advisory opinion process.  Some legal experts told us they were reluctant to use the advisory opinion  process because it is expensive and time-consuming. Some experts  noted that, in their experience, legal expenses incurred in obtaining an  advisory opinion ranged from $15,000 to over $50,000 depending on the  complexity of the arrangement, in addition to other costs associated with  developing arrangements. The financial incentive program expert we  spoke with reported that it took over a year of review before OIG issued  its first advisory opinion approving a novel gainsharing program. Some  industry group stakeholders said that because the advisory opinions are  only applicable to the requesting health system, other health systems  cannot rely on the advisory opinions for assurance that OIG will not  enforce the CMP law, even though OIG officials told us the agency did  not take any enforcement actions against financial incentive programs for  fiscal years 2005 through 2010.", "Health systems implementing gainsharing arrangements have structured  their arrangements to be identical to those already approved, thereby  lowering but not eliminating the overall risk that the arrangement would  result in sanction for violating the CMP law. For example, we spoke with  officials from a health system in the Northeast that is implementing a  gainsharing arrangement with its orthopedics division. According to these  officials, the health system is relying exclusively on the elements of  previous OIG gainsharing advisory opinions to define the parameters of  its gainsharing arrangement. Officials told us that they will not be pursuing  areas for savings that OIG has not previously approved. However, even  when implementing a gainsharing arrangement that has already been  approved, legal experts told us there are challenges. Some legal experts  told us that gainsharing arrangements permissible under OIG\u2019s advisory  opinions are narrow, and the approved gainsharing arrangements focus  on certain procedural areas and include specific measures, such as  limiting the use of certain surgical supplies and substitution of less costly  items for those items currently used by the physicians.

These demonstration projects and programs are designed for  specific types of providers and health systems, and some health systems  may not be willing or eligible to participate.", "CMS has conducted demonstration projects to test financial incentive  programs that include safeguards to protect program and patient integrity.  For example, CMS, as authorized by the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005,  designed the Medicare Hospital Gainsharing Demonstration to determine  whether gainsharing arrangements could align incentives between  hospitals and physicians to improve the quality and efficiency of care as  well as hospital operation and financial performance. The demonstration  project involved arrangements between hospitals and physicians under  which the hospitals made gainsharing payments to physicians that were a  share of the savings incurred directly as a result of collaborative efforts to  improve overall quality and efficiency. CMS officials told us that this  demonstration incorporated safeguards to protect program and patient  integrity. Specifically, these safeguards included the requirement that  providers meet quality thresholds by linking incentive payments to quality  measures; that the financial incentive payment be limited to 25 percent of  the amount normally paid for similar cases; and that payments not be  based on the volume or value of referrals.

The Medicare Shared Savings  Program is designed to pay providers on a fee-for-service basis, and will,  at least in theory, help align incentives by sharing potential savings with  providers that agree to meet quality and efficiency standards. According  to CMS, the program incorporates the following broad categories of  safeguards: quality measures; legal structure and governance  requirements; patient-centeredness; monitoring; disclosure and  transparency requirements; and program integrity screens. These  safeguards are intended to protect patient and program integrity by  ensuring that patient needs and experiences inform the delivery of care  and ACO governance.

As a type of financial  relationship, health systems must take these laws into account when  structuring financial incentive programs. Health systems can implement  certain types of financial incentive programs through, for example, various  Stark law exceptions, anti-kickback safe harbors, or the agencies\u2019  advisory opinion processes, although hospitals may not reward the  limitation or reduction of services\u2014even those services that are not  medically necessary\u2014without first obtaining OIG approval.", "Although health systems can implement certain types of financial  incentive programs that may result in better patient health outcomes and  lower health care costs, the challenges of implementing these programs  within the current legal framework may, for some health systems,  outweigh the potential benefits of doing so. As the stakeholders we spoke  with reported, there are significant challenges to designing and  implementing financial incentive programs through the available options.  There are no exceptions and safe harbors specifically for financial  incentive programs, and the Stark law\u2019s \u201cno risk\u201d requirement for new  exceptions, makes it difficult for CMS to craft an exception that allows for  innovative, effective programs while ensuring that the Medicare program  and patients face no risk from abuses. As such, the constraints of existing  exceptions and safe harbors make it difficult to design and implement a  comprehensive program for all participating physicians and patient  populations. Furthermore, for some health systems, OIG\u2019s interpretation  of the CMP law constrains the development of financial incentive  programs that would align hospital and physician incentives to provide  more cost-effective care, and hospitals may be reluctant to pursue an  advisory opinion because of the time, expense, and uncertainty involved.  As a result, health systems are more likely to implement only those  programs that mirror already approved programs or none at all.", "CMS\u2019s various demonstrations, the Medicare Shared Savings Program,  and programs implemented by the Innovation Center provide other  opportunities for some health systems to implement these programs  without the associated challenges of conforming to some of the federal  fraud and abuse laws.

HHS commented that the narrowness of the proposed 2008 Stark law  exception was dictated by this strict legal standard.
