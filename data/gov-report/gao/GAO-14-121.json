BOP had a fiscal year 2013 operating budget of about $6.5 billion, and BOP projects that its costs will increase as the federal prison population grows. According to officials, BOP's biggest challenge is managing the increasing federal inmate population, and related responsibilities, within budgeted levels. Generally, BOP is appropriated funds through two accounts: S&E and B&F. To prepare its annual congressional budget justification for DOJ, BOP estimates its costs and resource requirements and sends its requested amounts to DOJ. GAO was asked to review BOP's budget justifications.", "This report (1) identifies the types of costs that compose BOP's budget accounts as presented in its budget justifications, and (2) assesses the extent to which opportunities exist to enhance the transparency of information in BOP's budget justifications for congressional stakeholders and decision makers.

This growth is due predominantly to increases in prison populations, which are the primary cost driver of BOP's budget. The other two program, project and activity (PPA) elements in the S&E account are associated with the care and custody of federal offenders in contract facilities and maintenance and administration. BOP's Buildings and Facilities (B&F) account, which makes up on average less than 3 percent of its budget, pays for costs associated with site planning; acquisition; and construction of new facilities and costs of remodeling and renovating existing facilities, and related costs. In fiscal year 2014, the budget justification reflected a total of $6.9 billion; of which over 95 percent ($6.8 billion) was for BOP's S&E account.", "GAO found that BOP is collecting more detailed quantitative cost data on the components that constitute each PPA, which could be useful to congressional decision makers when reviewing BOP's budget justification. In accordance with departmental and Office of Management and Budget guidance, BOP's budget justifications summarize amounts by PPA, so BOP is not required to provide additional funding data below the PPA level in its budget justification. Providing this information to Congress could help clarify what BOP proposes to spend on specific categories and subcategories reflected in its budget justification. For example, BOP's budget justification for fiscal year 2014 included $2.5 billion for the Inmate Care and Programs PPA element and included narrative information for categories such as Medical Services, Food Service, Education and Vocational Training, Psychology Services, and Religious Services, as well as narrative summaries for various subcategories. However the budget justification did not include proposed funding amounts for each of these categories. GAO's analysis shows that this additional information can be useful in identifying trends and cost drivers that may affect future costs. For example, GAO's analysis identified variations in the dollar amounts associated with the cost components that constitute the PPA, such as drug abuse treatment and education, which could affect decision making for that PPA. However, BOP's current budget justification does not include this detail. Congressional decision makers have previously requested additional information about BOP's budget presentations and data below the PPA level. BOP's budget requests for its S&E account have increased 33 percent since fiscal year 2008, which makes transparency in its budget justifications even more crucial. Consulting with congressional decision makers to determine if it would be helpful to include in its budget justifications the additional cost information that DOJ already collects would help provide reasonable assurance that BOP is fully meeting congressional decision makers' needs and would enhance the transparency of its budget justifications. BOP also provides narrative summaries of its initiatives, services, and organizational units in categories and subcategories under each PPA.

For example, BOP  includes narrative in the budget justification to describe costs related to  categories such as Medical Services and Food Service, among others. As  figure 6 shows, there are similarities in the FMIS data fields for which  BOP captures detailed cost information and those categories BOP uses  to describe its budget justifications. This additional information could  provide congressional decision makers with additional insights into factors  driving BOP\u2019s budget.", "While BOP does not provide in its budget justifications information on the  cost components composing each PPA, BOP officials already capture this  information, using data from FMIS, as part of their annual budget  development process. We requested specific, quantitative information  below the PPA level and BOP provided us with dollar amounts associated  with the data fields in FMIS that constitute Inmate Care and Programs,  Institution Security and Administration, and Contract Confinement PPAs  for fiscal years 2008 through 2014. Using the additional detailed  information from DOJ\u2019s FMIS provided by BOP budget officials, we were  able to identify changes over time in the cost components composing  each PPA, which is information congressional decision makers could use  when reviewing BOP\u2019s budget justification. For example, we analyzed  changes in the dollar amounts associated with FMIS cost component data  fields that make up the Inmate Care and Programs PPA element over  time. The results of our analysis show that BOP\u2019s proposed spending for  the Inmate Care and Programs PPA has continually increased from fiscal  years 2008 through 2013; however, BOP\u2019s FMIS data showed variations  in the dollar amounts associated with the cost components that constitute  the PPA. For example, changes in dollar amounts for medical services  have increased by about 50 percent from fiscal years 2008 to 2014, and  decreased slightly for the 2 most recent fiscal years\u20142013 and 2014.  According to officials, the changes in dollar amounts reflect changes in  the prison population and implementation of policy initiatives intended to  lower costs.

BOP has fully  incorporated closed circuit television technology in its higher-security facilities, which has enhanced  supervision and provides valuable intelligence in the management of federal inmates. For practical  purposes, all other security measures, processes, and activities can be called internal security,  commencing when an inmate is admitted and terminating upon his or her release.  Staff supervise inmates in living units, work areas, visiting areas, dining halls, and any other area  where inmates may be located or have access. Regularly scheduled counts are conducted several  times a day (five on weekdays, six on weekends) in all institutions to monitor the whereabouts of  inmates. Work supervisors and program personnel are held strictly accountable for all inmates  under their supervision.", "Violations of institution regulations are dealt with through the Inmate Disciplinary Process.  Correctional staff members conduct investigations of the alleged misconduct and forward the  findings to the Unit Discipline Committee. Depending on the seriousness of the charge, the Unit  Discipline Committee will make a finding, or refer the report to the Discipline Hearing Officer for  disposition. When practical, inmates are afforded the opportunity to participate in, and present  evidence at a due process hearing before findings are made. Inmates may appeal these decisions  utilizing the administrative remedy process.", "The Administrative Segregation program provides for the separation of inmates who require closer  supervision and monitoring from those in the general population. Such cases include, but are not  limited to, protective custody, serious escape risks, threats to the security and orderly running of the  institution. The Disciplinary Segregation program provides for segregation of offenders who have  been found guilty of violations of rules through the Inmate Disciplinary Process.", "The Facility Maintenance program is designed to adequately maintain and continue to safely  operate the physical plants of BOP institutions. Facilities vary in age from those recently  constructed to those 100 or more years old. Thirty-four of the BOP facilities are over 50 years old.  As of January 2013, BOP facilities are situated on 46,030 acres of land and contain approximately  63.4 million square feet of floor area, all of which must be maintained and furnished with utility  services. Each institution maintains communication systems including complete private automatic  branch exchange telephone systems, radio systems including base station and mobile units, and  several electronic detection and control systems.  Complex heating and air conditioning systems, high-pressure steam power plants, sophisticated  hospital equipment, emergency electrical power systems and fire protection, and life safety systems  all require regular maintenance.

However, there are policy guidelines that allow funding  of maintenance projects (work requests) costing more than $10,000 in certain circumstances. Some  exceptions would include emergencies or security threats such as hurricanes or disturbances.  Maintenance and repair requirements in excess of $10,000 are normally included in the  Modernization and Repair program of the Buildings and Facilities budget.  The work within the maintenance program is accomplished almost entirely by inmate crews under  staff supervision. Each work crew consists of a staff foreman and 10 to 20 inmates. Each institution  must have highly skilled staff with experience and training in every phase of construction and  maintenance work including steam fitting, air conditioning, mechanics, or electronics repair. A few  specific jobs are contracted out because special skills or equipment items are required, or because  the work may be extremely dangerous. Examples of these jobs include elevator inspection and  repair, radio frequency alignment, and water tower painting.", "The Staff Training Academy (STA) at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) in  Glynco, Georgia, provides introductory and advanced correctional training for BOP law enforcement  staff. The Introduction to Correctional Techniques (ICT) program is a 5-week program for a total of  159 hours of instruction that is taught in two phases. Phase I consists of 2-weeks of training at the  institution, and Phase II consists of a 3-week training program at the STA. The STA oversees the  curriculum development and administration of the 2-week (56-hour) ICT Phase I course provided at  all institutions for new employees prior to attending the ICT Phase II course at the STA. The ICT  Phase II is a 3-week (103-hour) program of instruction that covers hostage situations, ethics,  interpersonal communication skills, special offenders, diversity, inmate discipline, legal procedures,  and so forth. Successful completion of this program (academics, firearms, and the Physical Ability  Test) is required for continued employment of newly hired staff entering into law enforcement  positions. In fiscal year 2012, 2,279 new employees participated in 60 classes of the ICT program.  The STA provided advanced correctional skills training for trainers in disturbance control, firearms,  bus operations, self-defense, and side-handle baton in fiscal year 2012. The STA also provides  advanced correctional training for Marksman/Observer and Witness Security Escort. The majority of  the advanced training programs are conducted at BOP institutions, resulting in substantial cost  avoidance in training costs.", "All BOP institutions operate outpatient ambulatory care clinics. These clinics provide a range of  outpatient services to inmates similar to those provided by ambulatory clinics found in most  communities, that is, primary health care. The clinics serve as the first level of diagnostic and  treatment services to sentenced and presentenced inmates. New institutions are typically given 2  years after activation to obtain accreditation from the Joint Commission. Care Level I institutions are  not required to achieve or maintain this accreditation because they predominantly house healthy  inmate populations. All Health Services programs and operations are subject to internal review  (Program Review) and must maintain accreditation by the American Correctional Association. Each  institution is also required to provide data to the Health Services Division (HSD) in the form of  outcome measures for a variety of clinical conditions (HIV, hypertension, diabetes, and so forth).  These evaluative and accreditation activities provide HSD with valuable data regarding the quality  and appropriateness of health care in BOP.

BOP policy requires that every inmate admitted to a BOP facility be given  an initial psychological screening, which consists of psychological interviews, social history reviews,  and behavioral observation. The purposes of the screening are to identify special treatment or  referral needs, provide information useful in future crisis counseling situations, identify strengths as  well as potential adjustment problems to imprisonment, and discuss possible program needs with  the inmates and provide information about these programs. In addition, BOP psychologists have  traditionally provided the courts, parole officials, and prison administrators with comprehensive  psychological evaluations of offenders.  Inmates with mental health needs are offered a range of services, including crisis counseling,  individual and group psychotherapy, clinical case management, psychiatric treatment, and  specialized residential treatment programs. Acutely mentally ill inmates may receive these services  within BOP\u2019s Psychiatric Referral Centers. However, most mental health treatment is provided in  regular institutions.
