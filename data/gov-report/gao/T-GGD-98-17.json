The consultative process provides an important opportunity for Congress and the executive branch to collectively ensure that agency missions are focused, goals are results-oriented, and strategies and funding expectations are appropriate.

We also found that the plan could be improved by additional stakeholder input, including interagency coordination. Finally, due to the complex set of factors that determine regulatory outcomes, measuring program impacts presents challenges to CFTC in addressing the requirements of the Results Act, as it does for regulatory agencies in general. However, the use of program evaluations to derive results-oriented goals and to measure the extent those goals are achieved is one key to the success of the process.
