TSA has focused its efforts on, among other things, more efficiently allocating, deploying, and managing the Transportation Security Officer (TSO) workforce--formerly known as screeners; strengthening screening procedures; developing and deploying more effective and efficient screening technologies; strengthening domestic air cargo security; and developing a government operated watch-list matching program, known as Secure Flight. For example, in response to GAO's recommendation, TSA developed a plan to periodically review assumptions in its Staffing Allocation Model used to determine TSO staffing levels at airports, and took steps to strengthen its evaluation of proposed procedural changes. TSA also explored new passenger checkpoint screening technologies to better detect explosives and other threats, and has taken steps to strengthen air cargo security, including increasing compliance inspections of air carriers. Finally, TSA has instilled more discipline and rigor into Secure Flight's systems development, including preparing key documentation and strengthening privacy protections. While these efforts should be commended, GAO has identified several areas that should be addressed to further strengthen security. For example, TSA made limited progress in developing and deploying checkpoint technologies due to planning and management challenges. In addition, TSA faces resource and other challenges in developing a system to screen 100 percent of cargo transported on passenger aircraft in accordance with the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007. GAO further identified that TSA faced program management challenges in the development and implementation of Secure Flight, including developing cost and schedule estimates consistent with best practices; fully implementing the program's risk management plan; developing a comprehensive testing strategy; and ensuring that information security requirements are fully implemented. A variety of crosscutting issues have affected DHS's and TSA's efforts in implementing its mission and management functions. For example, TSA can more fully adopt and apply a risk-management approach in implementing its security mission and core management functions, and strengthen coordination activities with key stakeholders. For example, while TSA incorporated risk-based decision making when modifying checkpoint screening procedures, GAO reported that TSA's analyses that supported screening procedural changes could be further strengthened. DHS and TSA have strengthened their efforts in these areas, but more work remains."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I appreciate the opportunity to participate in today\u2019s hearing to discuss the  security of our nation\u2019s commercial aviation system. The Transportation  Security Administration (TSA) was established in November 2001 with the  mission to protect the transportation network while also ensuring the free  movement of people and commerce. Since its inception, TSA has focused  much of its efforts on aviation security, and has developed and  implemented a variety of programs and procedures to secure commercial  aviation. To implement these efforts, TSA funding for aviation security has  totaled about $26 billion since fiscal year 2004. In carrying out its broader  homeland security responsibilities, the Department of Homeland Security  (DHS) faces the daunting challenge of determining how to allocate its  finite resources within the transportation system and across all sectors to  address threats and strengthen security.", "My testimony today focuses on TSA\u2019s efforts to ensure the security of the  following key areas of commercial aviation, which represent about $4.5  billion of the President\u2019s budget request for TSA for fiscal year 2009: 1)  screening operations, including transportation security officer (TSO) and  private screener allocations, screening procedures, and checkpoint  screening technologies; 2) air cargo; and 3) passenger watch-list matching.   In particular, I will address the numerous efforts TSA has taken or plans to  take to strengthen security in these areas and the challenges that remain,  as well as crosscutting issues that have impeded TSA\u2019s efforts.", "My comments are based on GAO reports and testimonies issued from  February 2004 through July 2008 addressing the security of the nation\u2019s  commercial aviation system. We also obtained selected updates to this  work from TSA officials in June and July 2008. We conducted these  performance audits in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the  audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable  basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We  believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA), enacted in  November 2001, created TSA and gave it responsibility for securing all  modes of transportation. As part of this responsibility, TSA oversees  security operations at the nation\u2019s more than 400 commercial airports,  including establishing requirements for passenger and checked baggage  screening and ensuring the security of air cargo transported to, from, and  within the United States. TSA has operational responsibility for  conducting passenger and checked baggage screening at most airports,  and has regulatory, or oversight, responsibility, for air carriers who  conduct air cargo screening. While TSA took over responsibility for  passenger checkpoint and baggage screening, air carriers have continued  to conduct passenger watch-list matching in accordance with TSA  requirements, which includes the process of matching passenger  information against the No Fly List and Selectee lists before flights depart.     TSA is currently developing a program, known as Secure Flight, to take  over this responsibility from air carriers for passengers on domestic  flights, and plans to assume from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection  (CBP) this pre-departure name-matching function for passengers on  international flights traveling to or from the United States.", "Prior to ATSA, passenger and checked baggage screening had been  performed by private screening companies under contract to airlines.  ATSA established TSA and required it to create a federal workforce to  assume the job of conducting passenger and checked baggage screening at  commercial airports. The federal screener workforce was put into place,  as required, by November 2002. Passenger screening systems are  composed of three elements: the people (TSOs) responsible for  conducting the screening of airline passengers and their carry-on items,  the technology used during the screening process, and the procedures  TSOs are to follow to conduct screening. Collectively, these elements help  to determine the effectiveness and efficiency of passenger screening  operations.", "TSA\u2019s responsibilities for securing air cargo include, among other things,  establishing security rules and regulations governing domestic and foreign  passenger air carriers that transport cargo, domestic and foreign all-cargo  carriers that transport cargo, and domestic freight forwarders. TSA is also  responsible for overseeing the implementation of air cargo security  requirements by air carriers and freight forwarders through compliance  inspections, and, in coordination with DHS\u2019s Science and Technology  (S&T) Directorate, for conducting research and development of air cargo  security technologies. Air carriers (passenger and all-cargo) are  responsible for implementing TSA security requirements, predominantly  through TSA-approved security programs that describe the security  policies, procedures, and systems the air carrier will implement and  maintain to comply with TSA security requirements. Air carriers must also  abide by security requirements issued by TSA through security directives  or emergency amendments to air carrier security programs.", "Air carriers use several methods and technologies to screen domestic and  inbound air cargo. These include manual physical searches and  comparisons between airway bills and cargo contents to ensure that the  contents of the cargo shipment matches the cargo identified in documents  filed by the shipper, as well as using approved technology, such as X-ray  systems, explosives trace detection systems, decompression chambers,  explosive detection systems, and certified explosive detection canine  teams. Under TSA\u2019s security requirements for domestic, outbound and  inbound air cargo, passenger air carriers are currently required to  randomly screen a specific percentage of nonexempt air cargo pieces  listed on each airway bill. TSA\u2019s air cargo security requirements currently  allow passenger air carriers to exempt certain types of cargo from physical  screening.  For such cargo, TSA has authorized the use of TSA-approved  alternative methods for screening, which can consist of verifying shipper  information and conducting a visual inspection of the cargo shipment. TSA  requires all-cargo carriers to screen 100 percent of air cargo that exceeds a  specific weight threshold.  As of October 2006, domestic freight  forwarders are also required, under certain conditions, to screen a certain  percentage of air cargo prior to its consolidation. TSA, however, does not  regulate foreign freight forwarders, or individuals or businesses that have  their cargo shipped by air to the United States. Under the Implementing  Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007, DHS is required to  implement a system to screen 50 percent of air cargo transported on  passenger aircraft by February 2009, and 100 percent of such cargo by  August 2010.", "The prescreening of airline passengers who may pose a security risk  before they board an aircraft is one of many layers of security intended to  strengthen commercial aviation. To further enhance commercial aviation  security and in accordance with the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism  Prevention Act of 2004, TSA is developing the Secure Flight program to  assume from air carriers the function of matching passenger information  against government-supplied terrorist watch-lists for domestic flights.   TSA expects to assume from air carriers the watch-list matching for  domestic flights beginning in January 2009 and to assume this watch-list  matching function from CBP for flights departing from and to the United  States by fiscal year 2010."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "TSA Has Made Significant Enhancements to Its Passenger Screening Operations, but Can Further Strengthen Its Efforts", "paragraphs": ["TSA has taken steps to strengthen the three key elements of the screening  system\u2014people (TSOs and private screeners), screening procedures, and  technology\u2014but has faced management, planning and funding challenges.  For example, TSA has implemented several efforts intended to strengthen  the allocation of its TSO workforce. We reported in February 2004 that  staffing shortages and TSA\u2019s hiring process had hindered the ability of  some Federal Security Directors (FSD)\u2014the ranking TSA authorities  responsible for leading and coordinating security activities at airports\u2014to  provide sufficient resources to staff screening checkpoints and oversee  screening operations at their checkpoints without using additional  measures such as overtime. Since that time, TSA has developed a Staffing  Allocation Model to determine TSO staffing levels at airports. FSDs we  interviewed during 2006 as part of our review of TSA\u2019s staffing model  generally reported that the model is a more accurate predictor of staffing  needs than TSA\u2019s prior staffing model. However, FSDs expressed concerns  about assumptions used in the fiscal year 2006 model related to the use of  part-time TSOs, TSO training requirements, and TSOs\u2019 operational support  duties. To help ensure that TSOs are effectively utilized, we recommended  that TSA establish a policy for when TSOs can be used to provide  operational support. Consistent with our recommendation, in March 2007,  TSA issued a management directive that provides guidance on assigning  TSOs, through detail or permanent promotion, to duties of another  position for a specified period of time. We also recommended that TSA  establish a formal, documented plan for reviewing all of the model  assumptions on a periodic basis to ensure that the assumptions result in  TSO staffing allocations that accurately reflect operating conditions that  may change over time. TSA agreed with our recommendation and, in  December 2007, developed a Staffing Allocation Model Rates and  Assumptions Validation Plan. The plan identifies the process TSA plans to  use to review and validate the model\u2019s assumptions on a periodic basis.", "Although we did not independently review TSA\u2019s staffing allocation for  fiscal year 2008, TSA\u2019s fiscal year 2009 budget justification identified that  the agency has achieved operational and efficiency gains that enabled  them to implement or expand several workforce initiatives involving  TSOs. For example, TSA implemented the travel document checker  program at over 259 of the approximately 450 airports nationwide during  fiscal year 2007. This program is intended to ensure that only passengers  with authentic travel documents access the sterile areas of airports and  board aircraft. TSA also deployed 643 behavior detection officers to 42  airports during fiscal year 2007. These officers screen passengers by  observation techniques to identify potentially high-risk passengers based  on involuntary physical and physiological reactions.", "In addition to TSA\u2019s efforts to strengthen the allocation of its TSO  workforce, TSA has taken steps to strengthen passenger checkpoint  screening procedures to enhance the detection of prohibited items.  However, we have identified areas where TSA could improve its  evaluation and documentation of proposed procedures. In April 2007, we  reported that TSA officials considered modifications to its standard  operating procedures (SOP) based on risk information (threat and  vulnerability information), daily experiences of staff working at airports,  and complaints and concerns raised by the traveling public. We further  reported that for more significant SOP modifications, TSA first tested the  proposed modifications at selected airports to help determine whether the  changes would achieve their intended purpose, as well as to assess its  impact on screening operations. However, we reported that TSA\u2019s data  collection and analyses could be improved to help TSA determine whether  proposed procedures that are operationally tested would achieve their  intended purpose. We also found that TSA\u2019s documentation on proposed  modifications to screening procedures was not complete. We  recommended that TSA develop sound evaluation methods, when  possible, to assess whether proposed screening changes would achieve  their intended purpose and generate and maintain documentation on  proposed screening changes that are deemed significant. DHS generally  agreed with our recommendations and TSA has taken some steps to  implement them. For example, for several proposed SOP changes  considered during the fall of 2007, TSA provided documentation that  identified the sources of the proposed changes and the reasons why the  agency decided to accept or reject the proposed changes.", "With respect to technologies, we reported in February 2007 that S&T and  TSA were exploring new passenger checkpoint screening technologies to  enhance the detection of explosives and other threats. Of the various  emerging checkpoint screening projects funded by TSA and S&T, the  explosive trace portal, the bottled liquids scanning device, and Advanced  Technology Systems have been deployed to airport checkpoints. A number  of additional projects have initiated procurements or are being researched  and developed. For example, TSA has procured 34 scanners for screening  passenger casts and prosthetic devices to be deployed in July 2008. In  addition, TSA has procured 20 checkpoint explosive detection systems  and plans to deploy these in August 2008. Further, TSA plans to finish its  testing of whole body imagers during fiscal year 2009 and begin deploying  150 of these units by fiscal year 2010.", "Despite TSA\u2019s efforts to develop passenger checkpoint screening  technologies, we reported that limited progress has been made in fielding  explosives detection technology at airport checkpoints in part due to  challenges S&T and TSA faced in coordinating research and development  efforts. For example, we reported that TSA had anticipated that the  explosives trace portals would be in operation throughout the country  during fiscal year 2007. However, due to performance and maintenance  issues, TSA halted the acquisition and deployment of the portals in June  2006. As a result, TSA has fielded less than 25 percent of the 434 portals it  projected it would deploy by fiscal year 2007. In addition to the portals,  TSA has fallen behind in its projected acquisition of other emerging  screening technologies. For example, we reported that the acquisition of  91 whole body imagers was previously delayed in part because TSA  needed to develop a means to protect the privacy of passengers screened  by this technology.", "While TSA and DHS have taken steps to coordinate the research,  development and deployment of checkpoint technologies, we reported in  February 2007 that challenges remained. For example, TSA and S&T  officials stated that they encountered difficulties in coordinating research  and development efforts due to reorganizations within TSA and S&T. Since  our February 2007 testimony, according to TSA and S&T, coordination  between them has improved. We also reported that TSA did not have a  strategic plan to guide its efforts to acquire and deploy screening  technologies, and that a lack of a strategic plan or approach could limit  TSA\u2019s ability to deploy emerging technologies at those airport locations  deemed at highest risk. TSA officials stated that they plan to submit the  strategic plan for checkpoint technologies mandated by Division E of the  Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008, during the summer of 2008. We  will continue to evaluate S&T\u2019s and TSA\u2019s efforts to research, develop and  deploy checkpoint screening technologies as part of our ongoing review."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "TSA Has Taken Action to Strengthen Air Cargo Security, but May Face Challenges in Developing a System to Screen All Cargo Transported on Passenger Aircraft", "paragraphs": ["TSA has taken steps to enhance domestic and inbound air cargo security,  but more work remains to strengthen this area of aviation security. For  example, TSA has issued an Air Cargo Strategic Plan that focused on  securing the domestic air cargo supply chain. However, in April 2007, we  reported that this plan did not include goals and objectives for addressing  the security of inbound air cargo, or cargo transported into the United  States from a foreign location, which presents different security challenges  than cargo transported domestically. We also reported that TSA had not  conducted vulnerability assessments to identify the range of security  weaknesses that could be exploited by terrorists related to air cargo  operations. We further reported that TSA had established requirements for  air carriers to randomly screen air cargo, but had exempted some  domestic and inbound cargo from screening. With respect to inbound air  cargo, we reported that TSA lacked an inspection plan with performance  goals and measures for its inspection efforts, and recommended that TSA  develop such a plan. TSA is also taking steps to compile and analyze  information on air cargo security practices used abroad to identify those  that may strengthen DHS\u2019s overall air cargo security program, as we  recommended. According to TSA officials, the agency\u2019s proposed Certified  Cargo Screening Program (CCSP) is based on their review of foreign  countries\u2019 models for screening air cargo. TSA officials believe this  program will assist the agency in meeting the requirement to screen 100  percent of cargo transported on passenger aircraft by August 2010, as  mandated by the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission  Act of 2007.", "Through TSA\u2019s proposed CCSP, the agency plans on allowing the  screening of air cargo to take place at various points throughout the air  cargo supply chain. Under the CCSP, Certified Cargo Screening Facilities  (CCSF), such as shippers, manufacturing facilities and freight forwarders  that meet security requirements established by TSA, will volunteer to  screen cargo prior to its loading onto an aircraft. Due to the voluntary  nature of this program, participation of the air cargo industry is critical to  the successful implementation of the CCSP. According to TSA officials, air  carriers will ultimately be responsible for screening 100 percent of cargo  transported on passenger aircraft should air cargo industry entities not  volunteer to become a CCSF.  In July 2008, however, we reported that TSA  may face challenges as it proceeds with its plans to implement a system to  screen 100 percent of cargo transported on passenger aircraft by August  2010. Specifically, we reported that DHS has not yet completed its  assessments of the technologies TSA plans to approve for use as part of  the CCSP for screening and securing cargo. We also reported that although  TSA has taken steps to eliminate the majority of exempted domestic and  outbound cargo that it has not required to be screened, the agency  currently plans to continue to exempt some types of domestic and  outbound cargo from screening after August 2010.  Moreover, we found  that TSA has begun analyzing the results of air cargo compliance  inspections and has hired additional compliance inspectors dedicated to  air cargo.  However, according to agency officials, TSA will need  additional air cargo inspectors to oversee the efforts of the potentially  thousands of entities that may participate in the CCSP once it is fully  implemented. Finally, we reported that more work remains for TSA to  strengthen the security of inbound cargo. Specifically, the agency has not  yet finalized its strategy for securing inbound cargo or determined how, if  at all, inbound cargo will be screened as part of its proposed CCSP."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DHS Has Made Progress in Developing and Implementing the Secure Flight Program, but Challenges Remain That May Hinder the Program Moving Forward", "paragraphs": ["Over the past several years, TSA has faced a number of challenges in  developing and implementing an advanced prescreening system, known as  Secure Flight, which will allow TSA to assume responsibility from air  carriers for comparing domestic passenger information against the No Fly  and Selectee lists. We reported in February 2008 that TSA had made  substantial progress in instilling more discipline and rigor in developing  and implementing Secure Flight, but that challenges remain that may  hinder the program\u2019s progress moving forward. For example, TSA had  taken numerous steps to address previous GAO recommendations related  to strengthening Secure Flight\u2019s development and implementation, as well  as additional steps designed to strengthen the program.  Among other  things, TSA developed a detailed, conceptual description of how the  system is to operate, commonly referred to as a concept of operations;  established a cost and schedule baseline; developed security requirements;  developed test plans; conducted outreach with key stakeholders;  published a notice of proposed rulemaking on how Secure Flight is to  operate; worked with CBP to integrate the domestic watch list matching  function with the international watch list matching function currently  operated by CBP; and issued a guide to key stakeholders (e.g., air carriers  and CBP) that defines, among other things, system data requirements.   Collectively, these efforts have enabled TSA to more effectively manage  the program\u2019s development and implementation.", "However, challenges remain that may hinder the program\u2019s progress  moving forward. In February 2008, we reported that TSA had not (1)  developed program cost and schedule estimates consistent with best  practices; (2) fully implemented its risk management plan; (3) planned for  system end-to-end testing in test plans; and (4) ensured that information- security requirements are fully implemented. To address these challenges,  we made several recommendations to DHS and TSA to incorporate best  practices in Secure Flight\u2019s cost and schedule estimates and to fully  implement the program\u2019s risk-management, testing, and information- security requirements. DHS and TSA officials generally agreed with these  recommendations.

These issues  have impeded the department\u2019s and TSA\u2019s progress since its inception and  will continue to confront the department as it moves forward. For  example, DHS and TSA have not always implemented effective strategic  planning efforts and have not yet fully developed performance measures  or put into place structures to help ensure that they are managing for  results. For example, with regard to TSA\u2019s efforts to secure air cargo, we  reported in October 2005 and April 2007 that TSA completed an Air Cargo  Strategic Plan that outlined a threat-based risk-management approach to  securing the nation\u2019s domestic air cargo system.  However, TSA had not  developed a similar strategy for addressing the security of inbound air  cargo, including how best to partner with CBP and international air cargo  stakeholders. In addition, although DHS and TSA have made risk-based  decision making a cornerstone of departmental and agency policy, TSA  could strengthen its application of risk management in implementing its  mission functions. For example, TSA incorporated risk-based decision  making when making modifications to airport checkpoint screening  procedures, to include modifying procedures based on intelligence  information and vulnerabilities identified through covert testing at airport  checkpoints. However, in April 2007, we reported that TSA\u2019s analyses that  supported screening procedural changes could be strengthened.  For  example, TSA officials based their decision to revise the prohibited items  list to allow passengers to carry small scissors and tools onto aircraft  based on their review of threat information\u2014which indicated that these  items do not pose a high risk to the aviation system\u2014so that TSOs could  concentrate on higher threat items. However, TSA officials did not  conduct the analysis necessary to help them determine whether this  screening change would affect TSO\u2019s ability to focus on higher-risk  threats.", "We also reported that, although improvements are being made, homeland  security roles and responsibilities within and between the levels of  government, and with the private sector, are evolving and need to be  clarified.  For example, we reported that opportunities exist for TSA to  work with foreign governments and industry to identify best practices for  securing air cargo, and recommended that TSA systematically compile and  analyze information on practices used abroad to identify those that may  strengthen the department\u2019s overall security efforts.  TSA has  subsequently reviewed the models used in two foreign countries that rely  on government-certified screeners to screen air cargo to facilitate the  design of the agency\u2019s proposed CCSP. Regarding efforts to respond to in- flight security threats, which, depending on the nature of the threat, could  involve more than 15 federal agencies and agency components, in July  2007, we recommended that DHS and other departments document and  share their respective coordination and communication strategies and  response procedures, to which DHS agreed.", "Mr. Chairman this concludes my statement.
