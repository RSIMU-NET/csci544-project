Although the overall security situation in Iraq has improved since 2006, the actual and perceived threat across governorates and neighborhoods continues to impede Iraqi returns and reintegration. Problems in securing property restitution or compensation and shelter have made it difficult to return and reintegrate. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) reported that 43 percent of the internally displaced that it surveyed did not have access to their homes, primarily because their property was occupied or destroyed. IOM also reported that one-third of the heads of returnee families it assessed were unemployed. Iraq continues to lack adequate access to essential services--that is, food, water, sanitation, electricity, health services, and education. Moreover, insufficient government capacity and commitment cross over each of the problem areas and serve as a deterrent to returns and reintegration. The international community has taken action to address the impediments that displaced Iraqis face, but the extent to which these efforts will result in reintegration of displaced Iraqis is uncertain. International and nongovernmental organizations, supported by U.S. and other donor funding, have initiated projects. However, the extent to which these projects specifically target and affect reintegration is not consistently measured. The Iraqi government has initiated efforts to encourage returns and reintegration. However, progress in this area has been limited due to insufficient commitment and capacity, according to international and U.S. officials. Iraq, the United States, and other members of the international community do not have an integrated international strategy for the reintegration of displaced Iraqis. The international community lacks integrated plans because Iraqi Ministry of Displacement and Migration planning efforts stalled due to limitations of authority, capacity, and broader Iraqi government support, according to U.S. and international officials; the United Nation's (UN) strategy and plans have not specifically focused on reintegration; and an unclassified version of the current U.S. government strategy has not been made publicly available. This situation has hindered efforts to efficiently assess the needs of internally displaced Iraqis and returnees. Moreover, the international community has not yet reached an agreement on goals and expected outcomes for reintegration. Also, the UN has not integrated data on returnee needs from the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) into its new Inter-Agency Information and Analysis Unit (IAU), which was established to provide a central point for collecting and assessing data, and UNHCR is not taking advantage of IAU resources and coordination efforts. Furthermore, it is difficult for stakeholders to effectively delineate roles and responsibilities and establish coordination and oversight mechanisms. One area with significant potential for inefficiencies is in the establishment and operation of numerous assistance centers and mobile units across Iraq by various entities to assist returnees, the internally displaced, and other vulnerable Iraqis."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that (1) the Secretary of State (State) and U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) Administrator assist Iraq in developing an effective integrated international strategy for reintegrating displaced Iraqis; (2) State and USAID make publicly available an unclassified version of the current U.S. strategy; (3) State encourage UNHCR to share primary data collected and take advantage of the IAU efforts; and (4) State and USAID work with UNHCR and others to inventory and assess the operations of the various assistance centers to determine and achieve an optimal framework.

According to IOM, tens of thousands of Iraqi  families have returned and the number of returnees is slowly increasing;  however, UNHCR officials question the sustainability of these returns. On  February 27, 2009, President Obama stated that it is in the United States\u2019  strategic interest\u2014and a moral responsibility\u2014to help displaced Iraqis.  According to the President, the U.S. government \u201cwill work with the Iraqi  government over time to resettle refugees and displaced Iraqis within  Iraq\u2014because there are few more powerful indicators of lasting peace  than displaced citizens returning home.\u201d", "GAO assessed U.S. and international efforts to reintegrate internally  displaced Iraqis and returning Iraqi refugees.

To identify conditions that pose a challenge to  reintegrating displaced Iraqis, we reviewed research papers and  assessments; strategies and policy papers; program implementation,  monitoring, and progress reports; and related documents. We assessed  challenges by considering factors such as their significance and the degree  to which they could be generalized, and then grouped them by category.  To identify the actions that the United States, Iraq, and the international  community have taken to address these conditions and reintegration, we  reviewed policy, strategy, planning, and funding documents; UN appeals;  monitoring and progress reports; and related documents. To determine the  extent to which the United States, Iraq, and the international community  have an effective strategy to address the reintegration of displaced Iraqis,  we reviewed policy, strategy, and planning documents from the U.S. and  Iraqi governments, the UN, UNHCR, and IOM. We interviewed U.S. agency,  Iraqi government, international organization, NGO, and research  institution officials and reviewed their documents to determine known  issues and problems.

We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Iraq has had a long history of displacement due to wars and the policies of  the Saddam Hussein regime. That regime instituted \u201cArabization\u201d policies  to force out many non-Arabs from Kirkuk and the surrounding areas and  replace them with Arab citizens to strengthen the regime\u2019s political control  over the areas\u2019 oil fields and fertile lands. Displacement occurred during  the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980\u2019s; the campaign against the Kurds, which  intensified after the war in 1988; the draining of the marshes in southern  Iraq during the war and again after the first Gulf War in 1991; and the 2003  fall of the Saddam Hussein regime. UNHCR reported in December 2009  that an estimated 2.76 million individuals were displaced in Iraq, 1.2  million of which had been displaced prior to 2006. The latest wave of  large-scale displacement occurred after the February 2006 bombing of the  Al-Askari Mosque in Samarra, which triggered a rise in sectarian violence.  According to State and UN reports, insurgents, death squads, militias, and  terrorists increased their attacks against civilians in 2006. According to  UNHCR and IOM, there was a sharp increase in the numbers of Iraqis  abandoning their homes for other locations in Iraq and abroad as a result  of the sectarian intimidation and violence that erupted during this period.  IOM reported that the majority of the Iraqi displacement occurred in 2006  and 2007. According to IOM, as of September 2008, about 90 percent of the  post-2006 IDPs in Iraq originated from Baghdad, Diyala, and Ninewa  governorates (see fig. 1).", "According to IOM, 4 years after the Al-Askari bombing, displaced families  are returning and new displacement is rare; however, the number of those  displaced who had returned (returnees) remains well below the estimated  number of those who remain displaced. As of the end of 2009, UNHCR  estimated that of those who were displaced before and after the Al-Askari  bombing, 745,630 IDPs and 433,696 refugees had returned. IOM reported  in February 2010, that of those who were displaced after the 2006 Al- Askari bombing, IOM returnee field monitors had identified an estimated  374,166 returnees. Additionally, the numbers of returnees varies by  governorate, with Baghdad experiencing the largest share of IDP and  refugee returns, according to UNHCR. The majority of those who initially  returned were IDPs rather than refugees, which is a pattern that has been  seen in other displacement situations worldwide, according to IOM and  UNHCR officials. IOM reported in February 2010, that its assessments of  an estimated 1.3 million IDPs identified by its field monitors, showed that  49 percent of all post-Al-Askari bombing IDPs want to return to their  places of origin, 29 percent want to remain and integrate into their current  places of displacement, 19 percent want to resettle to a third location, and  3 percent are waiting to make a decision.", "According to UNHCR officials, displaced Iraqis tend to be educated and  come from urban, middle-class backgrounds, which is in sharp contrast to  displaced communities in other nations. UNHCR also reported that the  displaced Iraqi population comprises Sunnis, Shias, Christians, and other  groups that were forced to relocate to areas where they constitute the  dominant groups. According to IOM, 58 percent of the 1.3 million IDPs  that they had assessed reported to be Shia Muslim and 33 percent reported  to be Sunni Muslim, as of February 2010 (see fig. 2); however, religious  affiliations and ethnicity varied by governorates. According to UNHCR,  21 percent of the Iraqi refugees that were actively registered in  neighboring countries at the end of 2008 identified themselves as Shia  Muslims, and 56 percent identified themselves as Sunni Muslims   (see fig. 3).", "The UN\u2019s Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement defines an  internally displaced person as one who has been forced or obliged to leave  his or her home as a result of armed conflict, generalized violence,  violation of human rights, or disaster, but has not crossed an international  border. A refugee, as defined by the 1951 UN Convention Relating to the  Status of Refugees and its 1967 protocol, is a person who \u201cowing to a well- founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality,  membership of a particular social group, or political opinion, is outside the  country of his nationality, and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling  to avail himself of the protection of that country.\u201d According UNHCR\u2019s  Handbook for Repatriation and Reintegration Activities, reintegration is  a process that should result in the disappearance of differences in legal  rights and duties between returnees and their compatriots and the equal  access of returnees to services, productive assets, and opportunities.  UNHCR\u2019s Handbook also states that such a process assumes that refugees  return to societies that are more or less stable, and, when this is not the  case, returnees and communities in areas of return should benefit equally  from improved access to productive assets and social services. According  to UNHCR, voluntary repatriation and reintegration is the preferred  durable solution for refugees.", "Iraqi and U.S. government entities, international organizations, and NGOs  play significant roles in addressing Iraqi displacement in Iraq and the  region.

According to DOD, overall violence in  Iraq, after peaking in 2007, remains at its lowest level in 5 years. However,  the level and nature of violence has varied by governorate. DOD reported  that from December 2009 to February 2010, about 73 percent of the  attacks occurred in 4 out of the 18 governorates\u2014Baghdad, Diyala,  Ninewa, and Salah al-Din. The first three of these governates account for  89 percent of the displacement occurring after the February 2006 Samarra  Al-Askari Mosque bombing, according to the UN. In contrast, the  Kurdistan Region, with its relatively homogenous population and the  presence of the Kurdish security forces, remained relatively safe and  stable, according to DOD.", "Many displaced Iraqis may be afraid of returning because of the fear of  violent reprisals from militants and members of opposing sects, according  to USAID and UNHCR officials. IOM reported in 2008 that returnees were  threatened, shot at, or killed after returning home. An MODM official  reported that one of the initial families that had returned to a Baghdad  neighborhood was killed as a warning to others not to return. UNHCR and  IOM officials stated that some displaced Iraqis, particularly those from  targeted minority groups, have no plans to return out of fear of  persecution. According to the UN, although a decrease in violence in Iraq  has been observed, grave and systematic human rights violations persist  and remain largely unreported. The UN also reported that violence against  professionals, women, and members of minority communities occur often  and are rarely punished.", "Moreover, many displaced Iraqis and returnees have had difficulties in  accessing services, including those provided by humanitarian  organizations, because of obstacles such as curfews, checkpoints, and  areas affected by intense fighting, according to UNHCR, IOM, other UN  agencies, and NGOs. In addition, according to UNHCR, the precarious  security situation is requiring UNHCR to increase investments in the  security of staff and may continue to limit UNHCR\u2019s mobility inside Iraq  (see fig. 4).

According to a 2009 United States Institute of Peace (USIP) report, the  lack of policies addressing displacement-related property issues is a major  obstacle to returns and may prolong instability, hinder reconciliation, and  nurture grievances along ethnic or sectarian lines. In November 2009, IOM  reported that about one-third of surveyed returnees found their homes in  bad condition. In February 2009, IOM reported that 43 percent of the  post-2006 Samarra bombing IDPs surveyed did not have access to their  homes, primarily because the property was occupied or destroyed (see fig.  5); and that 38 percent did not know the status of their property, often  because they could not safely access it. According to the 2009 USIP  report and IOM, hundreds of thousands of displaced families are estimated  to have homes that are occupied or used by strangers, such as militants,  squatters, other displaced Iraqis, or, in rare cases, Iraqi Army or other  government officials, sometimes resulting in multiple scenarios of  competing claims. Many displaced Iraqis have also lost personal property,  business stock, usage rights for farm land, and farming equipment,  according to the report. Moreover, a number of returnees with leases to  apartments have had difficulties in reclaiming their accommodations  because, in some cases, landlords took advantage of their tenants\u2019 absence  to re-lease the properties at higher rents, according to the 2009 USIP  report.", "Further complicating property restitution and compensation are the Iraqi  government\u2019s policies that distinguish between Iraqis who were displaced  before and after the U.S.-led invasion in March 2003. The implementation  of these policies has yet to be proven effective for either group. For pre- March 2003 cases, the Commission for the Resolution of Real Property  Disputes was established in 2006 to address property issues resulting from  the Ba\u2019athist regime\u2019s policies of forced displacement, according to the  2009 USIP report. According to the report, the commission\u2019s  \u201cquasijudicial\u201d system is not well adapted to the nature and number of  cases and thus is cumbersome and prone to delays. As of January 2009, the  commission had decided about 67,000 cases of the approximately 150,000  cases filed since March 2004. However, due to appeals and re-reviews, only  about 30,000 decisions were deemed final and enforceable and  compensation was paid only in about 1,000 cases. Moreover, USIP  reported that data are not available regarding the number of claimants\u2014 with decisions in their favor\u2014able to reoccupy their houses or land. An  Iraqi government official stated that many IDPs typically require more  assistance than what the government provides to replace lost properties  and rebuild or repair damaged homes.", "For post-March 2003 cases, the Iraqi government initially deemed that  property violations were the fault of terrorists and criminals and thus were  a law enforcement problem that could be resolved in the courts, if needed.  According to the 2009 USIP report, the existing legal framework may have  been inadequate to fairly resolve complex displacement cases and to  effectively handle the potentially large caseload. In 2008, according to the  U.S. government and IOM, the Iraqi government recognized the need to  further address property issues and thus initiated changes to its policies  and efforts.", "The property restitution and compensation problem is further exacerbated  by the reported lack of adequate shelter. UN-HABITAT reported in July  2009 that Iraq had a housing shortage of at least 1.5 million units, and  demand was increasing. According to UN-HABITAT, just over 70 percent  of Iraqis lived in urban areas, and more than 10 percent of the houses in  these areas had more than 10 occupants and more than 35 percent had   3 or more people per room. According to IOM, displaced families continue  to have difficulty in finding adequate housing in their places of  displacement, even several years after leaving home. IOM reported that  IDPs\u2019 shelter arrangements include renting, moving in with friends and  relatives, occupying empty public buildings, establishing collective  settlements, and other arrangements (see fig. 6). However, these  arrangements may not be sustainable because they pose costs to both the  displaced and their host communities. For example, IOM reported that the  majority of internally displaced Iraqis are living in rental accommodations,  but, as time passes, rent prices increase and their ability to pay decreases.  Friends and relatives, already struggling to provide for themselves, are  additionally burdened by housing the displaced, according to UN- HABITAT. Moreover, IDPs living in settlements or public buildings may  often be at risk from eviction by local authorities or private owners.

IOM also  found that employment rates were higher in certain governorates, such as  Baghdad. Employment for IDPs has also been scarce and varied across the  governorates, according to USAID. According to IOM, 31.7 percent of the  IDP families assessed had at least one employed family member as of  December 2009. In general, employment in Iraq is scarce, according to  USAID and UNHCR officials. The UN reported in January 2009 that the  unemployment rate was 18 percent. In addition, the UN and IOM  estimate that over 50 percent of the active population is unemployed or  underemployed, and that over 55 percent may face difficulties in covering  basic living costs. Underemployment and poverty pose a significant risk to  the reconciliation and stability of the country, according to the UN.", "Moreover, IOM officials said that regaining former employment is difficult  for displaced Iraqis. According to an international organization, the largest  employer in Iraq is the government, but, according to IOM, returnees have  difficulty in regaining prior government employment, either due to  discrimination or corruption. In March 2010, State reported allegations of  employment discrimination by several ministries based on religious,  ethnic, and political affiliations. The agricultural sector is the second- largest contributor to the economy, according to the UN. IOM reported the  need to provide returnees and IDPs in rural areas who want to farm with  the necessary means, such as land, seeds, fertilizers, tools, poultry, and  cattle. In addition, according to IOM officials, many skilled professionals  became displaced, and the longer they are displaced, the greater the  likelihood that their skills will become outdated. Furthermore, MODM  reported that Iraq lacks procedures to recognize professional certificates  and diplomas acquired abroad. Officials from the United Nations Office for  the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) and UNHCR are  concerned that Iraqi refugees from professional or middle-class  backgrounds may be reluctant to return for low-skilled and low-paying  jobs, which could potentially affect government capacity and economic  growth in Iraq."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Inadequate Access to Essential Services May Impede Iraqi Returns and Reintegration", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Food and Nonfood Items", "paragraphs": ["The lack of access to food and nonfood items is a deterrent to returns and  reintegration, according to UNHCR officials.

According to IOM, IDP families have also reported having no or partial  access to the Public Distribution System. The World Food Program  (WFP) reported in 2008 that distribution across the country had been  uneven due to the conflict. Many IDP families have had difficulties in  obtaining the proper documents to register for the Public Distribution  System in their new locations, which is required to obtain rations,  according to UNHCR officials.

The policy set a goal to find durable solutions  for displaced Iraqis, established objectives, stressed the rights of displaced  persons, described the basic needs of Iraqi IDPs, and recommended  activities to address the needs.

In addition, IMC officials said the Iraqi government  has not been proactive in providing squatters with the 6 months of rental  assistance due under Decree 262. Moreover, according to OCHA and IMC,  MODM issued a Ministerial Order on February 12, 2009 that precluded  further registration of IDPs for benefits and refocused efforts on  monitoring returnees. According to OCHA, the order sought to prevent  double registrations and forgery; however, it may restrict legitimate IDPs\u2019  access to benefits. OCHA further noted that the Ministerial Order may  restrict unregistered IDPs\u2019 ability to register as returnees and receive  benefits under Decree 262 and Order 101, since they have to be registered  as IDPs first to re-register as returnees.", "According to U.S. government officials, a key indicator for Iraqi  government progress will be how the Iraqi government, at the central,  governorate, and local levels, moves forward with its funding for and  implementation of Order 54 regarding returns and reintegration in Diyala.

At UN Country Team meetings and UN Assistance Mission  for Iraq activities, officials at one agency stated that while some  information is shared, organizations \u201cprotect their turf,\u201d and opportunities  to build on the efforts of others are lost. According to IOM and UNHCR,  although organizations try to avoid conflicts by focusing their efforts in  different sectors\u2014such as UNHCR focusing its projects on shelter and  property issues, IOM focusing on livelihood projects, and WFP focusing on  delivery of food\u2014efforts may overlap. For example, WFP is expanding its  focus in Iraq to include livelihood projects. According to IMC,  coordinating committees are prolific in Iraq but they are not always  effective. For example, according to IMC, IMC and USAID/OFDA were  working on shelter rehabilitation in one area, only to find out from field  staff that UNHCR was doing similar work. According to IMC officials, they  have been involved in the UN sector outcome teams, but the meetings  were generally held in Amman without an Iraqi government presence,  thereby limiting effective coordination.", "One area with significant potential for overlap is the establishment of  numerous assistance centers and mobile units across Iraq to register or  assist returnees, IDPs, and vulnerable Iraqis. International and U.S.  government officials expressed concerns about the need for multiple  centers, possible inefficiencies, and extent to which the MODM will be  capable of assuming responsibilities for centers in the future. Although  each center initially had its own purpose, some of the activities at these  centers now overlap, and all require oversight and administrative support,  according to international organization officials. A number of these  centers are funded by State and USAID and managed or supported by  MODM, UNHCR, IMC, and IOM. A sample of these centers includes the  following:    MODM Return and Assistance Centers: According to UNHCR, as of July  2010, MODM had established three main Return and Assistance Centers\u2014 two in Baghdad (Karkh and Resafa) and one in Diyala\u2014to register and  assist displaced Iraqis who want to return to their original homes. In  addition, each of the 14 MODM branches outside of Baghdad and Diyala  has a Registration Department where the same functions are performed.  The centers register new arrivals, streamline returnee access to assistance,  offer returning Iraqis legal aid and advice, assist in resolving property  disputes, help replace lost documents, and help with access to MODM and  government benefits. IMC supports the Karkh and Diyala centers with  funding from USAID and strategic guidance from UNHCR. According to an  IMC official, IMC is essentially comanaging the centers at MODM\u2019s request  because MODM lacks trained staff. IMC also supports some of the MODM  Registration Departments. UNHCR, with State\u2019s PRM funding, supports  operations of the Resafa center, including its mobile teams, and supports  two of the Karkh center mobile teams. According to UNHCR, although it is  not ideal to have a medical NGO co-operating the centers, IMC was one of  the few UNHCR partners and international NGOs positioned in Iraq when  the centers were established.", "UNHCR Protection and Assistance Centers: As of March 2010, UNHCR  had established and continued to operate 15 Protection and Assistance  Centers and 40 associated mobile teams that provide services to displaced,  returning, and vulnerable Iraqis and others in all 18 governorates in Iraq.", "As of May 2010, the centers included a total of 125 staff, including lawyers,  social workers, monitors, and public information and database officers.  The centers conduct protection monitoring assessments to identify needs,  gather information, and identify opportune interventions regarding basic  human rights and physical security; provide legal assistance addressing a  broad spectrum of needs, including legal counseling and interventions and  access to services, documentation, and compensation; provide assistance  and referrals to services and other stakeholders, such as authorities,  NGOs, UNHCR, or other Protection and Assistance Centers; and provide  briefings and information sessions to raise awareness of protection needs.", "UNHCR Return Integration Community Centers: In mid-2009, UNHCR  established and began operating 12 Return Integration Community Centers  to expand its capacity to reach out to return communities. The centers  coordinate with and relay information to local communities; conduct  needs assessments; and address the social, assistance, and information  needs of displaced and returning IDPs and refugees. Six of the centers are  based in Baghdad and the others are based in Anbar, Basrah, Diyala,  Kirkuk, Missan, and Ninewa. UNHCR plans to increase the number of  these centers to at least 16 in 2010. As of May 2010, these centers included  a total of 159 staff.", "IOM Community Outreach and Women Centers: IOM and its partners are  establishing four Women Centers with funding from State. The centers will  provide legal aid, psychosocial support, health counseling, and livelihood  support to the most vulnerable IDP and returnee female-headed  households in Baghdad, Diyala, and Missan.", "After our fieldwork discussions with UNHCR and U.S. government  officials, UNHCR informed us in June 2010 that it was taking action to  address the multiple assistance centers and potential for duplication and  lost efficiencies. First, UNHCR informed us that it had agreed to merge all  Protection and Assistance Centers and Return Integration Community  Centers in 2011 to reduce administrative costs. Second, UNHCR, in  discussions with the U.S. Embassy, suggested that all MODM Return and  Assistance Center activities be placed under one management umbrella.  According to UNHCR, doing so would enable them to have a more  harmonized approach that would avoid potential confusion and  duplication. UNHCR also stated that this approach will provide it with the  opportunity to harmonize staff payments and incentives."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["It is in the U.S. government\u2019s interest to work with Iraq and international  community stakeholders to develop an integrated international strategy  for reintegrating displaced Iraqis that transitions efforts and costs over  time to the Iraqi government. First, Iraq is a sovereign nation that should  lead efforts to address impediments to the return and reintegration of all  displaced Iraqis. Second, in MODM\u2019s National Policy on Displacement, the  Iraqi government states that it cannot address this issue without the help  of the international community. Third, in fiscal year 2009, the United  States funded more than one-half of the humanitarian assistance provided  to Iraq, and the lack of an international strategy may result in lost  efficiencies and wasted funds. One possible example of this may be the  administration of many assistance centers and mobile units across Iraq.  Furthermore, President Obama stated in his February 2009 speech on  responsibly ending the war in Iraq that the United States will pursue a  transition to Iraq and that the United States has a moral responsibility to  help displaced Iraqis. We recognize that strategies themselves are not end  points, but starting points, and that implementation is the key. However,  an integrated strategy\u2014along with transparent goals and shared, accurate  data on the conditions and effectiveness of projects\u2014is useful in  suggesting ways to enhance the value of plans, filling in gaps, speeding  implementation, guiding resource allocations, and providing oversight  opportunities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To enhance the ability of the Iraqi and U.S. governments, international  organizations, and NGOs to effectively plan and integrate their efforts to  assist and reintegrate displaced Iraqis, we recommend that the Secretary  of State and the USAID Administrator work with the appropriate  international organizations to assist the Iraqi government in developing an  international strategy that addresses impediments to return and prepares  for and facilitates the return and reintegration of displaced Iraqis.", "To ensure that the U.S. goals and plans are fully integrated with those of  Iraq and other international community stakeholders and that progress  toward meeting those goals is transparent, we recommend that the  Secretary of State and USAID Administrator make public an unclassified  version of the current U.S. strategy and their implementing plans for  assisting and reintegrating displaced Iraqis, including their goals,  performance measures, and progress assessments.", "To ensure that the U.S. and Iraqi governments, other donors, international  organizations, and implementing partners have the best data available  regarding the numbers and needs of IDPs, returnees, and other vulnerable  Iraqis, in the most efficient manner, we recommend that the Secretary of  State encourage UNHCR to share its raw data and methodology with the  IAU and take advantage of IAU expertise and coordinated efforts.", "To ensure the effective and efficient use of resources by its implementing  partners, we recommend that the Secretary of State and USAID  Administrator work with UNHCR and its other implementing partners to  take inventory of and assess the purposes, organization, operations, and  results of the various assistance, return, and registration centers and  mobile units in Iraq to determine and achieve an optimal framework for  assisting IDPs, returnees, and other vulnerable Iraqis."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Departments of State and Defense  and USAID.

When reintegration challenges and efforts  were intertwined with efforts to assist internally displaced and vulnerable  Iraqis, we included both in our scope. We conducted fieldwork in  Washington, D.C.; New York City (United Nations (UN) agencies); Geneva,  Switzerland (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR),  International Organization for Migration (IOM), and other international  organization headquarters); and Iraq.

We documented evidence from multiple sources and  validated it with knowledgeable U.S., UN, IOM, and NGO officials to  ensure accuracy. In addition, we also considered data compiled by IOM  through the assessments and surveys that it has conducted of Iraqi IDPs  and returnees since 2006. To determine the reliability of IOM data on  conditions in Iraq, we interviewed officials from IOM, USAID, PRM, the  U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, and the Brookings Institution and reviewed  IOM\u2019s data collection methodology and reports. The 2009 assessments of  internally displaced persons (IDP) covered more than 80 percent of the  estimated total of about 270,000 IDP families; however, it cannot be  generalized to the population of all IDPs. The 2009 survey of identified  returnee families was based on a sample of 4,061 of the 58,110 returnee  families. The survey cannot be generalized to all returnee families because  it relied on a mixture of random and judgmental sampling methods and  had a low response rate. These two data sources cannot be directly  compared because of their different populations, data collection methods,  and sample sizes. We determined that in conjunction with testimonial and  documentary evidence, the IOM data are sufficiently reliable to describe  the conditions that impede reintegration for those surveyed, but that the  data cannot be used to make inferences to the larger IDP and returnee  populations in Iraq.", "To identify the actions that the United States, Iraq, and the international  community have taken to address these conditions, we reviewed policy,  strategy, planning, and funding documents; UN funding appeals;  monitoring and progress reports; and related documents and interviewed  officials from the U.S. and Iraqi governments, international organizations,  NGOs, and research institutes.
