In February 2012, GAO found that FEMA lacked a process to coordinate application reviews and made award decisions with differing levels of information. To better identify potential unnecessary duplication, GAO recommended that FEMA collect project-level information and enhance internal coordination and administration of the programs. DHS concurred. The fiscal year 2013 President's Budget, proposed the establishment of the National Preparedness Grant Program (NPGP), a consolidation of 16 FEMA grant programs into a single program. However, Members of Congress raised concerns about the NPGP and have not approved the proposal. As a result, FEMA officials reported that the agency was drafting new guidance for the execution of the NPGP based on pending Congressional direction on fiscal year 2013 appropriations. If approved, and depending on its final form and execution, the NPGP could help mitigate the potential for unnecessary duplication and address GAO's recommendation to improve internal coordination. In March 2013, FEMA officials reported that FEMA intends to start collecting and analyzing project-level data from grantees in fiscal year 2014; but has not yet finalized data requirements or fully implemented the data system to collect the information. Collecting appropriate data and implementing project-level enhancements as planned would address GAO's recommendation and better position FEMA to identify potentially unnecessary duplication.", "FEMA has made progress addressing GAO's March 2011 recommendation that it develop a national preparedness assessment with clear, objective, and quantifiable capability requirements and performance measures; but continues to face challenges developing a national preparedness system that could assist FEMA in prioritizing preparedness grant funding. For example, in March 2012, FEMA issued the first National Preparedness Report, which describes progress made to build, sustain, and deliver capabilities. FEMA also has efforts underway to assess regional, state, and local preparedness capabilities. In April 2012, FEMA issued guidance on developing Threat and Hazard Identification and Risk Assessments (THIRA) to self-assess regional, state, and local capabilities and required states and local areas receiving homeland security funds to complete a THIRA by December 2012. However, FEMA faces challenges that may reduce the usefulness of these efforts. For example, the National Preparedness Report notes that while many programs exist to build and sustain preparedness capabilities, challenges remain in measuring progress over time. According to the report, in many cases, measures do not yet exist to gauge performance, either quantitatively or qualitatively. Further, while FEMA officials stated that the THIRA process is intended to develop a set of national capability performance requirements and measures, such requirements and measures have not yet been developed. Until FEMA develops clear, objective, and quantifiable capability requirements and performance measures, it is unclear what capability gaps currently exist and what level of federal resources will be needed to close such gaps. GAO will continue to monitor FEMA's efforts to develop capability requirements and performance measures."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO has made recommendations to DHS and FEMA in prior reports.

These factors include overlap  among grant recipients, goals, and geographic locations, combined with  differing levels of information that FEMA had available regarding grant  projects and recipients. Specifically, we found that FEMA made award  decisions with differing levels of information and lacked a process to  coordinate application reviews. To better identify potential unnecessary  duplication, we recommended that FEMA (1) take steps to ensure that it  collects project information at the level of detail needed to better position  the agency to identify any potential unnecessary duplication within and  across the four grant programs, and (2) explore opportunities to enhance  FEMA\u2019s internal coordination and administration of the programs.

First, the fiscal year 2013 President\u2019s  Budget outlined a plan to consolidate most of FEMA\u2019s preparedness  grants programs, and FEMA officials expect this action would reduce or  eliminate the potential for unnecessary duplication. The fiscal year 2013  President\u2019s Budget proposed the establishment of the National  Preparedness Grant Program (NPGP), a consolidation of 16 grant  programs (including the 4 grants we analyzed in our February 2012  report) into a comprehensive single program. According to FEMA officials,  the NPGP would eliminate redundancies and requirements placed on  both the federal government and grantees resulting from the existing  system of multiple individual, and often disconnected, grant programs.  For example, FEMA officials said that the number of applications a state  would need to submit and the federal government\u2019s resources required to  administer the applications would both decrease under the consolidated  program. However, Members of Congress have expressed concern about  the consolidation of the 16 grant programs and Congress has not yet  approved the proposal. In October 2012, FEMA officials told us that  Members of Congress had asked FEMA to refine the NPGP proposal to  address concerns raised by stakeholders, such as how local officials will  be involved in a state-administered grant program. As of March 2013,  FEMA officials reported that the agency was drafting guidance for the  execution of the NPGP based on stakeholder feedback and direction from  Congress pending the fiscal year 2013 appropriations bill. If the NPGP is  not authorized in fiscal year 2013, FEMA officials stated that the agency  plans to resubmit the request for the fiscal year 2014 budgetary cycle. If  approved, and depending on its final form and execution, the  consolidated NPGP could help reduce redundancies and mitigate the  potential for unnecessary duplication, and may address the  recommendation in our February 2012 report to enhance FEMA\u2019s internal  coordination and administration of the programs.", "Second, in March 2013, FEMA officials reported that the agency intends  to start collecting and analyzing project-level data from grantees in fiscal  year 2014; however, FEMA has not yet finalized specific data  requirements and has not fully established the vehicle to collect these  data\u2014a new data system called the Non-Disaster Grants Management  System (ND Grants). As of March 2013, FEMA officials expect to develop  system enhancements for ND Grants to collect and use project-level data  by the end of fiscal year 2013. FEMA officials stated that FEMA has  formed a working group to develop the functional requirements for  collecting and using project-level data and plans to obtain input from  stakeholders and consider the cost effectiveness of potential data  requirements. In alignment with data requirement recommendations from  a May 2011 FEMA report, the agency anticipates utilizing the new project- level data in the grant application process starting in fiscal year 2014.  Collecting appropriate data and implementing ND Grants with project- level enhancements as planned, and as recommended in our February  2012 report, would better position FEMA to identify potentially  unnecessary duplication within and across grant programs.", "Third, in December 2012, FEMA officials stated that there are additional  efforts underway to improve internal administration of different grant  programs. For example, officials stated that a FEMA task force has been  evaluating grants management processes and developing a series of  recommendations to improve efficiencies, address gaps, and increase  collaboration across regional and headquarters counterparts and financial  and programmatic counterparts. These activities represent positive steps  to improve overall grants management, but they do not include any  mechanisms to identify potentially duplicative projects across grant  programs administered by different FEMA entities."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "FEMA Has Made Progress in Establishing National Preparedness Capabilities, but Challenges Remain in Establishing Performance Measures That Could Assist in Prioritizing Grant Funding", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "FEMA Has Faced Challenges Developing a National Assessment of Preparedness", "paragraphs": ["According to DHS and FEMA strategic documents, national preparedness  is the shared responsibility of the \u201cwhole community,\u201d which requires the  contribution of a broad range of stakeholders, including federal, state, and  local governments, to develop preparedness capabilities to effectively  prevent, protect against, mitigate the effects of, respond to, and recover  from a major disaster. Figure 1 provides an illustration of how federal,  state, and local resources provide preparedness capabilities for different  levels of government and at various levels of incident effect (i.e., the  extent of damage caused by a natural or manmade disaster). The greater  the level of incident effect, the more likely state and local resources are to  be overwhelmed.", "We have previously reported on and made recommendations related to  DHS\u2019s and FEMA\u2019s efforts to develop a national assessment of  preparedness, which would assist DHS and FEMA in effectively  prioritizing investments to develop preparedness capabilities at all levels  of government, including through its preparedness grant programs.  Such an assessment would  identify the critical elements at all levels of government necessary to  effectively prevent, protect against, mitigate the effects of, respond to,  and recover from a major disaster (i.e., preparedness capabilities),  such as the ability to provide lifesaving medical treatment via  emergency medical services following a major disaster; develop a way to measure those elements (i.e., capability  performance measures); and assess the difference between the amount of preparedness needed at  all levels of government (i.e., capability requirements) and the current  level of preparedness (i.e. capability level) to identify gaps (i.e.,  capability gaps).", "The identification of capability gaps is necessary to effectively prioritize  preparedness grant funding.", "However, we have previously found that DHS and FEMA have faced  challenges in developing and implementing such an assessment. Most  recently, in March 2011, we reported that FEMA\u2019s efforts to develop and  implement a comprehensive, measurable, national preparedness  assessment were not yet complete. Accordingly, we recommended that  FEMA complete a national preparedness assessment and that such an  assessment should assess capability gaps at each level of government  based on capability requirements to enable prioritization of grant  funding. We also suggested that Congress consider limiting  preparedness grant funding until FEMA completes a national  preparedness assessment. In April 2011, Congress passed the fiscal year  2011 appropriations act for DHS, which reduced funding for FEMA  preparedness grants by $875 million from the amount requested in the  President\u2019s fiscal year 2011 budget. The consolidated appropriations act  for fiscal year 2012 appropriated $1.7 billion for FEMA Preparedness  grants, $1.28 billion less than requested. The House committee report  accompanying the DHS appropriations bill for fiscal year 2012 stated that  FEMA could not demonstrate how the use of the grants had enhanced  disaster preparedness."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FEMA Has Made Progress in Establishing Preparedness Capabilities", "paragraphs": ["In March 2011, the White House issued Presidential Policy Directive 8 on  National Preparedness (PPD-8), which called for the development of a  national preparedness system that includes a comprehensive approach to  assess national preparedness. According to PPD-8, the approach should  use a consistent methodology to assess national preparedness  capabilities\u2014with clear, objective, and quantifiable performance  measures. PPD-8 also called for the development of a national  preparedness goal, as well as annual preparedness reports (both of  which were previously required under the Post-Katrina Act). To address  PPD-8 provisions, FEMA issued the National Preparedness Goal in  September 2011, which established a list of preparedness capabilities for  each of five mission areas (prevention, protection, mitigation, response,  and recovery) that are to serve as the basis for preparedness activities  within FEMA, throughout the federal government, and at the state and  local levels. In November 2011, FEMA issued the National  Preparedness System, which described an approach and cycle to build,  sustain, and deliver the preparedness capabilities described in the  National Preparedness Goal. The system contains six components to  support decision making, resource allocation, and progress  measurement, including identifying and assessing risk and estimating  capability requirements. According to the system, measuring progress  toward achieving the National Preparedness Goal is intended to provide  the means to decide how and where to allocate scarce resources and  prioritize preparedness. Finally, in March 2012, FEMA issued the first  National Preparedness Report, designed to identify progress made  toward building, sustaining, and delivering the preparedness capabilities  described in the National Preparedness Goal. According to FEMA  officials, the National Preparedness Report also identifies what they  consider to be national-level capability gaps."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Challenges Remain in Establishing Capability Requirements and Performance Measures That Could Assist in Prioritizing Preparedness Grant Funding", "paragraphs": ["While FEMA issued the first National Preparedness Report, the agency  has not yet established clear, objective, and quantifiable capability  requirements and performance measures that are needed to identify  capability gaps in a national preparedness assessment, as recommended  in our March 2011 report. As previously noted, such requirements and  measures would help FEMA identify capability gaps at all levels of  government, which would assist FEMA in targeting preparedness grant  program funding to address the highest-priority capability gaps. According  to the National Preparedness Report, FEMA collaborated with federal  interagency partners to identify existing quantitative and qualitative  performance and assessment data for each of the preparedness  capabilities. In addition, FEMA integrated data from the 2011 State  Preparedness Reports, which are statewide survey-based self- assessments of capability levels and requirements submitted by all 56  U.S. states and territories. Finally, FEMA conducted research to identify  independent evaluations, surveys, and other supporting data related to  preparedness capabilities.", "However, limitations associated with some of the data used in the  National Preparedness Report may reduce the report\u2019s usefulness in  assessing national preparedness. First, in October 2010, we reported that  data in the State Preparedness Reports\u2014one of the key data sources for  the National Preparedness Report\u2014could be limited because FEMA  relies on states to self-report such data, which makes it difficult to ensure  data are consistent and accurate. Second, at the time the National  Preparedness Report was issued, in March 2012, states were still in the  process of updating their efforts to collect, analyze, and report  preparedness progress according to the new preparedness capabilities  issued along with the National Preparedness Goal in September 2011. As  a result, the report states that assessment processes, methodologies,  and data will need to evolve for future iterations of the report. Third, the  report\u2019s final finding notes that while many programs exist to build and  sustain preparedness capabilities across all mission areas, challenges  remain in measuring progress over time. According to the report, in many  cases, measures do not yet exist to gauge performance, either  quantitatively or qualitatively. Therefore, while programs may exist that  are designed to address a given capability gap, the nation has little way of  knowing whether and to what extent those programs have been  successful.", "Thus, as of March 2013, FEMA has not yet completed a national  preparedness assessment, as we recommended in our March 2011  report, which could assist FEMA in prioritizing grant funding. However,  FEMA officials stated that they have efforts under way to assess regional,  state, and local capabilities to provide a framework for completing a  national preparedness assessment. For example, in April 2012, FEMA  issued guidance on developing Threat and Hazard Identification and Risk  Assessments (THIRA), which were initially required to be completed by  state and local governments receiving homeland security funding by  December 31, 2012. Guidance issued for development of the THIRAs  describes a process for assessing the various threats and hazards facing  a community, the vulnerability of the community, as well as the  consequences associated with those threats and hazards. For example,  using the THIRA process, a jurisdiction may identify tornadoes as a  hazard and asses its vulnerabilities to and the consequences of a tornado  striking the jurisdiction, as well as the capabilities necessary for an  effective response. Using the THIRA results, a jurisdiction may then  develop a strategy to allocate resources effectively to achieve self- determined capability requirements by closing capability gaps.", "According to FEMA officials in March 2013, the THIRAs are to be used by  state, regional, and federal entities for future planning efforts. At the state  level, FEMA guidance notes that state officials are to use the capability  requirements they identified in their respective 2012 THIRAs in their  future State Preparedness Reports. FEMA officials stated that they  planned to use both the THIRAs and the State Preparedness Reports to  identify states\u2019 (self-reported) capability gaps based on capability  requirements established by the state. At the regional level, each of the  10 FEMA regions is to analyze the local and state THIRAs to develop  regional THIRAs. At the national level, the local, state, and regional  THIRAs are collectively intended to provide FEMA with data that it can  analyze to assist in the identification of national funding priorities for  closing capability gaps. The outcome of the THIRA process is intended to  be a set of national capability performance requirements and measures,  which FEMA officials stated they intend to incorporate into future National  Preparedness Reports. As of March 2013, FEMA officials are working to  coordinate their review and analysis of the various THIRAs through a  THIRA Analysis and Review Team. The team plans to conduct ongoing  meetings to discuss common themes and findings from the THIRAs and  intends to develop an initial proposed list of national preparedness grant  funding priorities by summer 2013.", "Depending on how the THIRA process is implemented and incorporated  into future National Preparedness Reports, such an approach could be a  positive step toward addressing our March 2011 recommendation to  FEMA to develop a national preparedness assessment of existing  capabilities levels against capability requirements. Such a national  preparedness assessment may help FEMA to (1) identify the potential  costs for developing and maintaining required capabilities at each level of  government, and (2) determine what capabilities federal agencies should  be prepared to provide. While the recently completed THIRAs and 2012  National Preparedness Report are positive steps in the initial efforts to  assess preparedness capabilities across the nation, capability  requirements and performance measures for each level of government  that are clear, objective, and quantifiable have not yet been developed.  As a result, it is unclear what capability gaps currently exist, including at  the federal level, and what level of resources will be needed to close such  gaps through prioritized preparedness grant funding. We will continue to  monitor FEMA\u2019s efforts to develop capability requirements and  performance measures.", "Chairman Brooks, Ranking Member Payne, and Members of the  subcommittee, this completes my prepared statement.
