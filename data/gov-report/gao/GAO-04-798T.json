Since that time, other federal entities  have issued enterprise architecture frameworks, including the  Department of Defense (DOD) and the Department of the Treasury.  In September 1999, the federal CIO Council published the Federal  Enterprise Architecture Framework, which was intended to provide  federal agencies with a common construct for their architectures,  thereby facilitating the coordination of common business processes,  technology insertion, information flows, and system investments  among federal agencies. The Federal Enterprise Architecture  Framework describes an approach, including models and  definitions, for developing and documenting architecture  descriptions for multiorganizational functional segments of the  federal government.", "In February 2002, OMB established the Federal Enterprise  Architecture Program Management Office to develop the FEA,  which, according to OMB, is intended to facilitate governmentwide  improvement through cross-agency analysis and identification of  duplicative investments, gaps, and opportunities for collaboration,  interoperability, and integration within and across agency programs.  The FEA is composed of five \u201creference models\u201d describing the  federal government\u2019s (1) business (or mission) processes and  functions, independent of the agencies that perform them,  (2) performance goals and outcome measures, (3) service delivery  means, (4) information and data definitions, and (5) technology  standards.

OMB characterizes the business  reference model as being the foundation of the FEA. It describes the  businesses of the federal government, independent of the agencies  that perform them. According to OMB, the purpose of the business  reference model is to provide the basis for analyzing IT investments  and associated budget requests relative to whether they support  common business functions, processes, and activities.

As  discussed earlier in this statement, a true enterprise architecture is  intended to provide a blueprint for optimizing an organization\u2019s  business operations and implementing the IT that supports them.  Accordingly, well-defined enterprise architectures describe, in  meaningful models, both the enterprise\u2019s \u201cas-is\u201d and \u201cto-be\u201d  environments, along with the plan for transitioning from the current  to the target environment. To be meaningful, these models should  be inherently consistent with one another, in view of the many  interrelationships and interdependencies among, for example,  business functions, the information flows among the functions, the  security needs of this information, and the services and applications  that support these functions.", "Our reading of the four available reference models does not  demonstrate to us that this kind of content exists in the FEA, and  thus we believe that the FEA is more akin to a point-in-time  framework or classification scheme for federal government  operations. Our discussions with OMB officials confirmed our  reading of the FEA. Accordingly, if agencies use the FEA as a model  for defining the depth and detail for their own architectures, the  agencies\u2019 enterprise architectures may not provide sufficient  content for driving the implementation of systems.", "Is the expected relationship between agencies\u2019 enterprise  architectures and the FEA clearly articulated? According to OMB,  the FEA is to inform agency enterprise architectures. For example,  OMB has stated that although it is not mandating that the business  reference model serve as the foundation for every agency\u2019s business  architecture, agencies should invest time mapping their respective  business architectures to the FEA. Similarly, OMB has stated that  agencies\u2019 alignment of their respective architectures to the service  component reference model and the technical reference model will  enable each agency to categorize its IT investments according to  common definitions.", "Such descriptions of the agency enterprise architecture/FEA  relationship, in our view, are not clear, in part because definitions of  such key terms as alignment, mapping, and consistency were not  apparent in the FEA. As with any endeavor, the more ambiguity and  uncertainty there is with requirements and expectations, the greater  the use of assumptions and thus deviation from the intended course  of action. This is particularly true in the area of enterprise  architecture.", "How will the security aspects of the FEA be addressed? Our work  has found that a well-defined enterprise architecture should include  explicit discussion of security, including descriptions of security  policies, procedures, rules, standards, services, and tools.  Moreover, security is an element of the very fabric of architecture  artifacts and models and thus should be woven into them all. As our  experience in reviewing agency security practices and research of  leading practices shows, security cannot be an afterthought when it  comes to engineering systems or enterprises.", "OMB has stated that it plans to address security through what it  terms a \u201csecurity profile\u201d to be added to the FEA.

Further, OMB collaborated with the CIO Council and  us on the Practical Guide to Federal Enterprise Architecture,  Version 1.0. As a means of promoting agencies\u2019 enterprise  architecture use, OMB has also included requirements for having  and using enterprise architectures as part of the budget process,  which began with the fiscal year 2002 budget cycle and, according to  OMB officials, has continued since then. OMB has also worked  through the CIO Council, which is chaired by OMB, to improve  enterprise architecture management and use.", "Despite OMB\u2019s longstanding advocacy and support for enterprise  architecture, we reported in 2002 that OMB needed to advance the  level of enterprise architecture management maturity by exercising  stronger leadership and improved oversight and by identifying  governmentwide solutions to common enterprise architecture  management challenges facing agencies. Accordingly, we  recommended that the OMB Director, in collaboration with the  federal CIO Council, use our maturity framework and the agency  baseline information provided in our February 2002 report as the  basis for helping agencies to advance the state of their respective  enterprise architecture development, implementation, and  maintenance efforts, and for measuring agency progress. We further  recommended that in doing so, the OMB Director require agencies  to (1) submit to OMB an annual update of the agency\u2019s satisfaction  of each of the core elements contained in our maturity framework  and (2) have this update verified by the agency\u2019s inspector general  or comparable audit function before it is submitted to OMB.  Additionally, we recommended that the OMB Director, in  collaboration with the CIO Council, develop and implement a plan  to address the governmentwide impediments to greater agency use  of enterprise architectures. We recommended that, at a minimum,  this plan should include the two primary challenges identified in our  2002 report\u2014that is, agency executive management understanding  of enterprise architectures and the availability of enterprise  architecture human capital expertise. Finally, we recommended that  the director report annually to the Senate Committee on  Governmental Affairs and the House Committee on Government  Reform on the results of OMB\u2019s annual update of the state and  progress of federal agencies\u2019 enterprise architecture efforts. OMB  officials generally agreed with the findings and conclusions of our  report and stated that they would consider using our framework.", "As previously noted, we reported in 2003 that agencies had  collectively made little progress toward improving their enterprise  architecture maturity. In commenting on this report, OMB officials  told us that they were still considering using our framework as a  basis for evaluating agencies\u2019 progress in developing and  implementing their architectures, but had not committed to doing so  because they were still reviewing options. Additionally, these  officials did not have any plans to address governmentwide  impediments to greater agency use of architectures. Further, they  said that OMB has provided and plans to continue to provide  information to the Congress on the state of agency enterprise  architecture efforts and on progress in implementing the FEA. As a  result, we again called for stronger leadership and reiterated the  recommendations we made in our February 2002 report, with the  modification that OMB use version 1.1 of our framework and the  baseline data from our 2003 report. Additionally, we recommended  that the OMB Director, in developing and implementing the plan we  previously recommended to address governmentwide impediments  to greater agency use of enterprise architectures, ensure that the  plan provides for identifying agencies that have effectively  overcome enterprise architecture management challenges and  sharing those and other lessons learned and best practices.

This forum has  created a means for chief architects across federal agencies to  systematically collaborate on matters of mutual concern and  interest. Vehicles for this collaboration include periodic meetings, a  listserve to share information and ideas, and special gatherings that  focus on specific issues. As another example, OMB recently released  for comment version 1.0 of an agency enterprise architecture  assessment tool. The tool is intended to help individual agencies  assess their enterprise architecture programs. According to OMB,  this initial version will be revised to reflect comments it receives.", "In summary, enterprise architecture development and use in the  federal government are maturing, but they are not mature. Given  that effective development and use of enterprise architectures are  critical to federal agencies achieving breakthrough levels of  performance, senior leadership across the government needs to  elevate its attention to this essential transformation and  modernization tool. While progress on this front has occurred over  the last few years, it has been spotty, and in our view, considerable  maturation is needed before the federal government will be  positioned to reap the rewards that others have reported from  effective architecture development and use. The fact remains that  until agencies have and use well-defined enterprise architectures,  they will be severely challenged in their ability to effectively  leverage IT in transforming their operations. Recent steps by OMB  and the CIO Council to assume stronger leadership roles are  encouraging. However, hard work lies ahead to clarify and evolve  the FEA, and to ensure that well-managed architecture programs\u2014 ones that produce architecture blueprints that can be implemented  and become integral parts of the fabric of institutional strategic  planning, investment decision-making, and budget execution\u2014are  actually established across the government. These are important  goals, which we support, and we will continue to work with OMB  and the CIO Council throughout the multistep process needed to  ensure that the FEA is appropriately described, matured, and used,  and to advance the state of agency enterprise architecture efforts.", "Mr. Chairman, that concludes my testimony.
