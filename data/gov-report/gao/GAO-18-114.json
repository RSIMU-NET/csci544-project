While the three large e-marketplaces that we  interviewed offer their sellers additional services that help sellers  calculate and collect sales taxes, not all sellers take advantage of this  service. None of the e-marketplaces that we interviewed could provide us  data on the extent to which their sellers currently collect sales tax. Given  the lack of available data, we made a conservative estimate of potential  revenue gains to states if given the authority to require all e-marketplace  sellers to taxes on all their sales.

For those states that permit taxpayers to report use taxes  on their income tax returns, it is estimated that only about 1 to 2 percent  of returns include use tax payments. Unlike estimates for individual  compliance with use tax, estimates for business compliance are high,  ranging from 70 to 90 percent. Some tax practitioners we interviewed  told us that businesses routinely retain records of their taxable and tax- exempt purchases, including remote purchases, and are more likely to be  compliant with any use taxes.", "We identified at least four states that have begun implementing new laws  intended to increase consumer use tax compliance.

Those  familiar with multistate collection explained that because the software  used for multistate collection is easily scaled up, retailers already using  such systems, would incur few challenges to adapt to this expanded  authority. Further, larger retailers that already collect in many states  would already have the systems in place for collection under expanded  authority.

Two people familiar with the use of tax software told us that  although many standard business software products generally include  some sales tax functionality, these systems do not always fully support  businesses selling in multiple tax jurisdictions. As a result, sellers with  more widespread collection obligations typically use specialized multistate  sales tax software. A representative from a Certified Public Accounting  (CPA) firm explained that costs are incurred both when businesses collect  sales tax from customers, and when they remit the tax to the appropriate  state revenue department.

This is especially true for those selling goods treated differently by  different states and those that do not use easily-integrated software.  Costs for collection software include, start-up costs, licensing fees,  administrative costs, and options for premium services, such as preparing  or automatically filing sales tax returns. Start-up costs are the costs  associated with setting up the software for first use.", "Tax practitioners told us that software is necessary for multistate  collection because of the complexity created by unstandardized  requirements across jurisdictions. As we note above, tax policy specialists  have cited figures as high as 12,000 and as low as 10,000 for the number  of tax jurisdictions in the United States.

Mapping requires coding all of a  business\u2019s product offerings to the taxation categories used by the  software. One software provider told us that generally, these software  products do not require businesses to research the legal categorization in  each state\u2019s laws; however, it does require businesses to categorize  products with sufficient precision for the software to assign its tax status  based on state laws. For example, apparel is treated differently across  states. Pennsylvania exempts clothing, except for formal apparel; items  made of real, imitation, or synthetic fur; and athletic apparel. Across the  border, New York State exempts clothing sold for less than $110;  however, some jurisdictions do not apply these exemptions and charge a  local sales tax on these items.", "The initial product mapping required before using multistate tax software  can be labor intensive. As such, we expect that businesses setting up  software for the first time, and selling goods which states treat differently  will have more labor-intensive product-mapping work. Some software  providers offer consulting services to assist businesses with mapping  their offerings. Software providers, however, treat these services as a  premium option so businesses will generally incur extra costs for using  these services.", "Several people familiar with the use of sales tax software said that errors  in mapping products can expose businesses to liability in the form of  uncollected taxes. Recognizing the wide variations in sales tax laws, a  group of states launched the Streamlined Sales Tax Initiative in 1999.  The initiative was designed to standardize these variations and provide  software assistance to make it easier for businesses to comply with state  and local sales and use tax laws. This initiative sought to shield  businesses from liability by directing software providers participating in  the effort to complete mapping for businesses and assume liability for  errors. However, more recent changes allow software providers to  negotiate these issues directly with their business clients. According to a  representative of the Streamlined Sales Tax Governing Board, 24 states  have passed legislation to conform to the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax  Agreement. These states account for a third of the United States  population, but many of the largest states (in terms of population) are not  fully participating.", "Software integration, or establishing a connection between existing  business software and the new multistate tax software, will be required for  businesses that begin to use multistate tax software. Two software  providers we spoke with said that they have already created integration  modules for the most common business software packages in use today.  One explained that integration with these common business systems is  generally the least expensive and may come at no cost to the business.  However, businesses using customized software or software that is not in  common use may see higher costs to integrate these systems. Some  businesses may need to integrate several systems with the collection  software. This integration may be required for transactions such as  processing sales through different retail channels or ensuring that  merchandise returns are removed from existing collections.", "Businesses will also face additional costs to license the necessary  software functionality from the provider. A public accounting firm told us  that these on-going licensing fees are generally lower in the first year,  than the one-time costs associated with mapping and integration.  Licensing costs generally are a function of the volume of information  requests sent to the tax database maintained by the software provider.", "In estimating costs to license multistate collection software, online  businesses must consider both the number of completed transactions  they anticipate as well as the browsing behavior of those using their  websites. A CPA firm we interviewed explained how these software  packages work. Whenever a business website calculates a sales tax  amount, it does so by sending an information request to a rate and  address database maintained by the software provider. Importantly, this  process is often an automated function of the \u201cshopping cart\u201d system,  which may calculate a sales tax amount whenever a customer changes  the goods in the shopping cart, even in the absence of a completed sale.  As such, businesses must account for both completed transactions as  well as how often customers change the bundle of goods in the online  shopping cart. For example, customers may use shopping carts while  comparison shopping on different websites. Our market research found  licensing costs as low as $12 per month for up to 30 information requests  each month, and as high as $200,000 per year for unlimited information  requests.", "Businesses and others familiar with sales tax software told us that  licensing fees are only one of multiple costs required to collect sales  taxes in multiple states. As such, simplification proposals that include  provisions for states to pay these licensing fees may not mitigate  significant costs to businesses transitioning to software assisted  multistate collection. Businesses will still incur start-up costs and  additional administrative costs, even when states pay the licensing fees  on the use of the software. Even under such proposals when software  comes with no licensing fees, mapping can be labor intensive for  businesses selling products that state tax laws treat differently, and  integration can create costs for businesses using custom software or  software that is not widely used. Further, for software to reduce  administrative costs, it must be integrated with more than just a  business\u2019s shopping cart system. However, simplification proposals that  only cover software licensing costs and integration with the shopping cart  system may leave businesses with the costs of a more extensive  integration. Businesses would either have to incur additional costs to  better integrate sales tax software with existing business information  systems (such as a general ledger accounting system), or regularly  reconcile receipts and records manually to prepare sales tax returns for  all states where it makes sales.", "Additional costs for software include administrative costs associated with  use of the software. These costs are incurred because even automated  software requires some administrative work by staff. The use of optional  premium services offered by software providers may further reduce these  administrative costs, but increase software costs in the process.  Administrative costs tend to be highest, as a proportion of taxes collected,  for the smallest sellers. Some businesses told us that collecting sales tax  in all jurisdictions where they have customers would increase staffing  costs, even when collection is facilitated by software. Premium services  commonly offered by software providers assist businesses with preparing  and filing tax returns. While electing to use these services may save  businesses labor costs, they incur additional fees to use these premium  services.", "We interviewed several businesses based in states that do not collect a  sales tax. They told us that they are already researching software options  should the need to collect sales tax on all remote sales arise.

Our sources of sales estimates did not disaggregate them by  type of purchaser or types of use. In order to estimate the percentage of  business-to-business sales that would be exempt, we used input-output  account tables prepared by the Department of Commerce\u2019s Bureau of  Economic Affairs.

During this period  some companies\u2019 collection policies or nexus changed from the date  when Internet Retailer published its Top 1000 list in April. For example,  the largest Internet retailer completed agreements with the remaining few  states where it was not previously collecting sales tax.

Compared to the top  100 companies, these remaining 900 companies were far less likely to  have nexus (or said they were collecting) in all or most states. About half  the remaining 900 companies only had nexus (or said they were  collecting) in one state. In terms of tax dollars, we estimated that these  900 Internet retailers were already collecting from 44 to 49 percent of the  potential taxes that states and local governments could require to be  collected if given expanded authority on all remote sales.
