These estimated requirements have varied widely, ranging from $4 billion to $10 billion annually over the next several years. In our April 1997 report, we concluded that these estimates varied so widely because of differing views about what kinds of projects and airports to include as part of an estimate. In that report, we provided four estimates of future development, varying upon how many categories of projects are included. Our estimates ranged from $1.4 billion per year to fund safety, security, noise mitigation, and reconstruction projects; $2.8 billion if other high-priority projects, primarily capacity-related projects, are added; $6.1 billion for all AIP-eligible projects; and $10.1 billion per year to fund all types of projects, including those not eligible for AIP funding."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Airports\u2019 Funding Sources Vary", "paragraphs": ["Airports rely on a variety of funding sources, some public and some private, to finance their capital development.

Additional information on each of these funding sources and their distribution among various categories of airports is contained in appendix I.", "As figure 2 shows, total airport funding varies year to year. For example, funding in 1993 declined by 45 percent from 1992. This variability results primarily from year-to-year changes in the amount of funding from bonds, which in turn is affected by changing interest rates, the demand for air travel, and airlines\u2019 agreements with airports.", "The amount and type of funding varies considerably by the type of airport. The 71 large and medium hub airports, which accounted for almost 90 percent of all passenger traffic, also obtained 79 percent of all funding in 1996, while the 3,233 other national system airports accounted for the remaining 21 percent of the funding. In addition, as shown in figure 3, large and medium hub airports rely most heavily on private airport bonds, which constitute roughly 62 percent of their total funding, while the other airports rely on federal grants for about half of their funding.

Funding for 1996 is shown by source; planned spending is shown by the relative priority of the projects. FAA\u2019s highest priorities are for projects to meet safety, security, and environmental requirements, including noise mitigation, and for projects that maintain existing infrastructure (reconstruction). Other high-priority projects are primarily for adding capacity, while other AIP-eligible projects are a relatively lower priority, such as projects aimed at helping airports better meet FAA\u2019s design standards. Some projects, such as expanding commercial space in terminals and parking garages, are typically not eligible for funding from FAA. Although a difference may exist between funding and planned spending in total, there is a much closer match between funding from AIP and planned spending on FAA\u2019s highest-priority projects (reconstruction and mandates). In the aggregate, the $1.372 billion in AIP grants in 1996 roughly equates to the $1.414 billion in estimated development planned for the highest-priority projects.

The difference may actually be even greater if it were not for $250 million in special facility bonding for a single cargo/general aviation airport. For this group of airports, the $782 million in 1996 AIP grants surpasses the annual estimate of $750 million for reconstruction, noise mitigation, and federally mandated projects.", "As a portion of total funding, the potential funding difference for the 71 large and medium hub airports is comparatively less than for their smaller counterparts (see fig. 6). However, because total expenditures for capital projects are so much greater for these airports, this smaller portion represents a potential shortfall of $1.5 billion, or $87 million greater than smaller airports\u2019 collective shortfall.

For example, increasing funding through grant programs will increase the extent to which the government can specify the recipient, the project, and the amount of funds that will be awarded because grant programs facilitate such targeting better than other funding mechanisms. However, because grant programs in general are relatively costly to administer, increasing funding through grants would increase administrative costs more than a similar amount from bonds or airport revenues.", "The funding mechanisms also differ with respect to who bears the cost of airport financing. These differences affect the extent to which beneficiaries pay in proportion to the benefits they receive\u2014a measure of economic efficiency and equity. In choosing, for example, between bonds and grants, it is useful to consider that they may have different efficiency and equity effects because of differences in the share of costs borne by users and nonusers of airports under each funding mechanism. Grants are funded through AIP, which is, in turn, funded primarily by the ticket tax. Thus, users pay for grants to airports. In contrast, part of the cost of tax-exempt bonds is borne by nonusers of airports because the interest earned by bondholders is exempt from federal income taxation. As a result, more of the cost of bond financing is borne by nonusers of airports than in the case of grants. Even so, it is uncertain whether using bonds to increase funding would improve or worsen the overall efficiency and equity of airport financing. This uncertainty arises because of the uncertainty in determining how much nonusers benefit from airport development that may stimulate economic development in the community surrounding any given airport. As a result, it is difficult to compare such benefits with the costs that nonusers currently bear. If, as some believe, these benefits are small, then increasing the use of bonds could reduce the overall efficiency and equity of airport financing. But this decrease in equity and efficiency might be justified because bonds have lower administrative costs than grants."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Increasing AIP Would Help Smaller Airports", "paragraphs": ["Increasing the total AIP funding would benefit smaller airports more than hub airports under the existing distribution formula. Increasing the level of AIP under the existing distribution formula provides a slightly increasing share of AIP funds to the smaller airports, with a concomitant decrease for the large and medium hub airports. The Congress increased AIP funding for fiscal year 1998 by $240 million to $1.7 billion, but $647 million less than the 1998 authorized level of $2.347 billion, a funding level supported by the airport groups\u2014the American Association of Airport Executives (AAAE) and Airports Council International-North America (ACI-NA). Both the National Civil Aviation Review Commission and the Air Transport Association (ATA), the commercial airline trade association, have recommended that future AIP funding levels be stabilized at a minimum of $2 billion annually. Table 3 provides the amount and share of funds that may go to hub airports and other smaller airports if AIP funding were made available at the current ($1.7 billion), proposed ($2.0 billion), and authorized ($2.347 billion) levels under the existing distribution formula.", "Smaller airports\u2019 increasing share of AIP under higher funding levels is due primarily to higher levels of state apportionment funds and higher levels of discretionary funding if AIP funding increases. State apportionment funds constitute 18.5 percent of the total program funding, and those funds are for general aviation airports. As AIP increases, state entitlement funds increase from $314.5 million (at a $1.7 billion level of AIP), to $370 million (at $2.0 billion of AIP), and finally to $434.2 million (at $2.347 billion of AIP). Under the current formula, the amount of apportionment funds for primary airports remains constant and, therefore, increasing total funding causes discretionary funding to account for an increasing proportion of the total funds. Greater discretionary funding, in turn, means more funding for smaller airports because one-third of discretionary funding in excess of $300 million is directed to general aviation and other commercial service airports. For example, the one-third set-aside for general aviation and other commercial service airports increases from $29.9 million at the $1.7 billion level, to $81.3 million at the $2.0 billion level, and finally to $140.7 million at the $2.347 billion level.", "While the National Civil Aviation Review Commission and the ATA have recommended a minimum funding level of $2.0 billion for AIP, the ATA also has recommended redefining airport categories and the distribution formula for AIP. The ATA proposes that national system airports be grouped into four categories and that a specified portion of AIP funds be distributed to airports in each category. As table 4 shows, a slightly higher portion of a $2.0 billion AIP would go to the larger airports and a slightly smaller portion to the smaller airports under the ATA\u2019s proposal than under the current approach.", "Under the ATA\u2019s proposal, the 55/45 percent distribution would remain constant at higher levels of AIP funding.

Airport groups have actively supported increasing the amount of funding airports can raise through PFCs by eliminating the current $3 per passenger ceiling. Meanwhile, the ATA actively opposes any increase in PFCs because it would increase passenger costs and, the association believes, reduce passenger traffic. The National Civil Aviation Review Commission stated that the PFC ceiling will need to be raised if AIP funding is not substantially greater than $2 billion per year, but the Commission has also recommended that airlines have a greater voice than they currently do in deciding whether an airport needs a PFC.", "According to airport groups, airports require more PFC funding to reduce congestion at airports, especially for passengers trying to access the airport and moving through the terminal. For some airports, roadside and terminal congestion may be more severe than that on the airfield and harder to finance, according to airport groups, because airlines are not as supportive of nonairfield projects, and these projects are ineligible for or a low priority for AIP grants. As a result, a majority of past and future PFC collections are dedicated to terminal and airport access projects and interest payments on debt.", "As of January 1, 1998, 264 commercial service airports\u2014almost half of all such airports\u2014imposed a PFC. The larger the airport, the greater the likelihood that a PFC is in place (see fig. 7). About three-quarters of large and medium hub airports impose a PFC, while only 45 percent of nonhub and less than 10 percent of other commercial service airports impose a PFC.", "If the airports currently charging PFCs were to increase them to $4, $5, or $6 per passenger instead of the current $3 limit, total collections would increase to $1.5 billion, $1.9 billion, and $2.2 billion, respectively, on the basis of 1996 enplanements and collection rates. On the basis of 1996 passenger levels, PFC collections could increase to $2.9 billion, but only if all commercial airports imposed a $6 PFC. Figure 8 shows the estimates by airport category. If enplanements continue to grow as expected, then future collections will be proportionally greater.", "Increasing the PFC ceiling would not substantially benefit smaller commercial airports. Because smaller airports have relatively few enplanements, PFCs do not generate much funding. In addition, while the PFC program requires large and medium hub airports that impose a PFC to forgo a portion of their AIP grants so that these funds can be redirected to smaller airports, most of these larger airports are already returning their maximum amount, according to FAA officials.", "When PFCs were first introduced, airport groups hoped that PFCs would provide airports with additional cash flow that could be used to support more airport bonds and, therefore, capital development. However, the issuance of PFC-backed bonds has been limited, in part, by the Department of Transportation\u2019s authority to terminate a PFC if the airport does not use its collections as agreed or if it violates the Airport Noise and Capacity Act. Since 1995, FAA has worked to lessen the likelihood of termination by instituting a lengthy review and termination process, and, as a result, in 1996, two airports issued bonds secured by future PFC collections, and other airports are currently considering following suit.

In addition, the act authorized a pilot to privatize a limited number of airports. Thus far, these two innovative methods have attracted only limited interest among airports.

FAA\u2019s study, released in March 1996, determined that investment at large and medium hub airports has kept pace with aviation growth and that therefore these airports generally do not face systemic financial constraints. However, the study also found that small hub airports may be financially constrained, particularly in connection with terminal and other nonairfield projects. FAA\u2019s study examined four alternatives\u2014a federal guarantee for airport loans; using AIP to fund reserve accounts that act as a safety margin for future interest and principal payments; using AIP to pay for bond insurance; and using AIP to capitalize an airport loan fund\u2014as innovative means to increase airport investment.

Thus far, FAA has received 30 applications and approved 5 projects with grants totaling $15.36 million. All five projects test the first innovative use of grants\u2014allowing local contributions in excess of standard grant matching amounts, which for most airports and projects are otherwise fixed at 10 percent. FAA and state aviation representatives generally support the concept of flexible matching because it means that projects that otherwise might not get under way because of a lack of funding from FAA, can get started sooner; in addition, flexible funding may ultimately increase funding to airports.

As a way to test privatization\u2019s potential, the Congress directed FAA to establish a limited pilot program under which some of these constraints would be eased.

State revolving loan funds have been successfully employed to finance other types of infrastructure projects, such as waste water projects and, more recently, drinking water and surface transportation projects. While loan funds can be structured in various ways, basically they use federal and state moneys to capitalize the funds, from which loans are then made. Interest and principal payments are recycled to provide additional loans. Once established, loan funds can more quickly expand by issuing bonds using the funds\u2019 capital and loan portfolio as collateral. These revolving funds would not create any contingent liability for the U.S. government because they would be under state control. Some officials of bond rating agencies, underwriting firms, and federal and state transportation agencies believe that revolving loan funds would help smaller airports that have trouble obtaining affordable debt financing. Loan funds could also help speed construction and lower construction costs by providing financing up front, instead of incrementally, as is the case with AIP grants, according to a rating agency official.", "FAA cannot use AIP grants to capitalize state loan funds because AIP construction grants can go only to a designated airport and project. Recently, FAA received an application from a state for an AIP grant to help establish a revolving fund as part of FAA\u2019s pilot program for innovative financing. However, the application was denied because FAA officials determined that such a grant could be construed as a guarantee of airport debt, which is expressly prohibited under the program. Currently, Florida is the only state with an established revolving loan program. Since 1985, the state has provided $75 million in loans to airports for land acquisition and capital projects. While some of the loans are later reimbursed through AIP grants for eligible projects, the state funds the loan program itself. In addition, 39 states have established state infrastructure banks (SIB) using federal and state grant money to fund surface transportation projects.This same SIB structure could also be used to fund aviation projects, and at least one state\u2014Ohio\u2014has already authorized its SIB to fund aviation projects using state funds."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The total funding for airport development peaked in 1992 in real terms and declined to about $7 billion in 1996.

Thirty years ago, general obligation bonds, which are backed by the taxing power of a governmental unit, were far more common because of their stronger credit standing and therefore lower financing costs.

We did not, however, audit how the databases were compiled or test their overall accuracy, except in the case of state grant data from the National Association of State Aviation Officials, which we independently confirmed. We subtotaled each funding stream by year and airport category and added to other funding streams to determine the total funding.

To evaluate the Air Transport Association\u2019s proposal, we categorized airports and distributions on the basis of 1996 enplanements and operational data. To evaluate the effects of raising the PFC ceiling, we estimated potential PFC collections under $4, $5, and $6 PFCs on the basis of 1996 enplanements and collection rates under two scenarios: (1) with only those airports currently with a PFC imposing one and (2) all airports imposing a PFC. To evaluate various innovative financing proposals, we first identified various proposals and initiatives from discussions with aviation industry associations and FAA and a review of prior studies and legislation. Specifically, the results of FAA\u2019s March 1996 report to the Congress on innovative approaches to the use of federal funds formed the basis for the primary alternatives we considered.
