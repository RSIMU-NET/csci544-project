In addition to creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment, such actions may negatively affect an employee\u2019s career. Sex discrimination is any practice or procedure that denies employment opportunities because of one\u2019s sex. This includes matters related to hiring, development, advancement, and overall treatment.

These rights are set forth in title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, and the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978.", "In 1980, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) issued regulations recognizing sexual harassment as an unlawful employment practice. Subsequent case law clarified that unlawful sexual harassment exists when unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature are committed as a condition of employment or basis for employment action (\u201cquid pro quo\u201d), or when this conduct creates a hostile work environment. A key word is \u201cunwelcome,\u201d because unlawful sexual harassment may exist when the target perceives that he or she is being harassed, whether or not the perpetrator intended to create a hostile environment. EEOC has the authority to enforce federal sector antidiscrimination laws, issuing rules and regulations as it deems necessary to carry out its responsibilities. It issued revised guidelines for processing EEO complaints, including sexual harassment, that became effective in October 1992.", "NIH is one of several Public Health Service agencies within HHS and is the principal biomedical research agency of the federal government.

We also interviewed agency officials at NIH, the Public Health Service, and HHS involved with handling such situations in order to familiarize ourselves with EEO-related activities.", "We obtained statistics on formal sexual harassment and sex discrimination complaints that were filed between October 1, 1990, and May 31, 1994, and reviewed those complaints filed during this period and subsequently closed. We also reviewed 20 complaints that were handled as part of NIH\u2019s expedited sexual harassment process between September 1, 1992, and May 31, 1994. Under this accelerated procedure, officials from the involved ICD were required to immediately advise OEO officials about any sexual harassment allegations that came to their attention. OEO was then required to complete its inquiry within 2 weeks. NIH\u2019s EEO complaint process is outlined in greater detail in appendix I. We did not compare the number and type of complaints filed by NIH employees with those filed by employees at other governmental institutions.", "To obtain an agencywide perspective on the sexual harassment and sex discrimination environment at NIH, we sent questionnaires to a stratified random sample of 4,110 persons who were NIH employees as of the end of fiscal year 1993. We asked these employees for their insights, opinions, and observations (anonymously) about sexual harassment and sex discrimination at NIH as well as their opinions about NIH\u2019s EEO system. The results of our survey, which can be projected to the universe from which it was selected, are shown in their entirety in appendix II. The overall usable response rate was 64.3 percent. The percentages presented in this report are based on the number of NIH employees who responded to the particular question being discussed. Because the survey results come from a sample of NIH employees, all results are subject to sampling errors. For example, the estimate that 32 percent of the employees have experienced sexual harassment is surrounded by a 95 percent confidence interval from 30 to 34 percent. All of the survey results in this report have 95 percent confidence intervals of less than + 5 percent unless otherwise noted. All reported comparisons of female and male responses are statistically significant unless otherwise noted. It should be noted that our questionnaire methodology, which is described in greater detail in appendix III, did not include comparing NIH with other governmental institutions.", "We also contacted agency officials at NIH, the Public Health Service, and HHS to obtain estimated costs associated with processing sexual harassment and sex discrimination complaints.

These complaints were filed primarily by female employees. Closed formal complaints we reviewed overwhelmingly identified immediate supervisors and/or management officials as the alleged harassers. However, employees in general did not consider these groups to be the only sources of sexual harassment at NIH. Coworkers and contractors were also identified as alleged harassers. Actions reportedly taken most often by sexually harassed employees to deal with their situations included ignoring the situation or doing nothing, avoiding the harasser, asking/telling the harasser to stop the offensive behavior, discussing the situation with a coworker and/or asking the coworker to help, or making a joke of the situation.", "Over 96 percent of NIH employees who said they were sexually harassed reported that they decided not to file complaints or take some other personnel action. Some of the more prevalent reasons employees gave for choosing not to file EEO complaints, grievances, or adverse action appeals were that (1) they did not consider the incident to be serious enough, (2) they wanted to deal with it themselves, and/or (3) they decided to ignore the incident. Also, some of the employees who chose not to file complaints believed the situation would not be kept confidential, the harasser would not be punished, filing a complaint would not be worth the time or cost, and/or that they would be retaliated against.", "Although it remains small as a proportion of the workforce, the number of EEO complaints filed by NIH employees alleging sexual harassment has increased in recent years.

NIH also got good reviews from its employees for encouraging them to contact ICD EEO officers and/or OEO regarding any sexual harassment concerns. Only 5.5 percent of employees viewed sexual harassment to be more of a problem at NIH than it was a year earlier, and 34.5 percent of the employees did not perceive sexual harassment to be a problem at all at NIH.

Male and female employees who said they experienced sexual harassment indicated that most of the uninvited, unwanted sexual attention consisted of gossip regarding people\u2019s sexual behavior; sexual jokes, remarks, and teasing; and negative sexual remarks about a group (e.g., women, men, homosexuals). For the most part, employees reported that it was instigated by coworkers, supervisors, and/or contractors who worked on the NIH campus. Very few employees said that the sexual harassment they experienced included receiving or being shown nude or sexy pictures (4.8 percent); being pressured for a date (4 percent); receiving requests or being pressured for sexual favors (1.5 percent); receiving letters, phone calls, or other material of a sexual nature (1.4 percent); and threatened, attempted, or actual rape or sexual assault (0.4 percent).

However, about 10 percent of employees who alleged discrimination reported that they took the next step and filed an EEO complaint, grievance, or adverse action appeal with the appropriate NIH office. Some of the more prevalent reasons why employees chose not to file actions were concerns that they would not be treated fairly, that filing a complaint would not be worth the time or cost, that they would be retaliated against, that the situation was not serious enough, and/or that the situation would not be kept confidential. Many employees also decided to ignore the situation or to try to deal with their situations themselves.", "Between October 1990 and May 1994, 209 informal and 111 formal sex discrimination complaints were filed by female and male employees at NIH. Formal complaints that were closed during this time period were filed for multiple reasons, the most common being nonselection for promotion, lack of promotion opportunity, and objection to job evaluation ratings. The alleged discriminators were people with authority over the complainants and could therefore alter the conditions under which the complainants worked.", "Within NIH, more than half of the women employees (58.4 percent) said they believed the current sex discrimination situation to be as much of a problem as it was 1 year earlier, and 37 percent of the men said the same. Although the percentages were small, a larger percentage of men (7.2 percent) than women (6.1 percent) considered the problem to be at least somewhat worse.

A number of employees also reported they observed that women and men at NIH did not have similar opportunities for visibility (15.5 percent) or similar success finding mentors (22.8 percent), nor did they get equally desirable assignments (19.0 percent). About 44 percent of the employees reported they believed family responsibilities kept women at NIH from being considered for advancement more than they did for men and about 50 percent expressed the view that an \u201cold boy network\u201d prevented women at NIH from advancing in their careers.

Partly in response to these controversies, NIH management has, in recent years, taken actions aimed at improving the agency\u2019s EEO climate. Beginning with the fiscal year 1993 rating period, EEO became a critical element on managerial performance ratings and can have an impact on overall ratings and determinations of pay increases.

All 10 ICDs offered some form of sexual harassment prevention training. Six ICDs required all of their employees to receive such training, three ICDs required this training only for managers and supervisors, and one ICD had no attendance requirements. Most of the ICDs chose either to conduct their own training sessions or to have OEO conduct the training. In a few cases, the training was developed and/or presented by contractors.

For those who indicated that they believed sexual harassment was directed toward them, we inquired about what the respondent did to deal with the situation. We asked a set of similar questions to see how individuals dealt with sex discrimination when it affected them. We also asked for respondents\u2019 views on NIH\u2019s equal employment opportunity (EEO) system and asked some general questions about the respondents\u2019 work setting and background. Due to the sensitive nature of the information we required, the questionnaire was anonymous. It did not contain any information that could identify an individual respondent. A postcard containing an identification number was included in the package sent to NIH employees. The postcard was to be mailed back to GAO separately from the questionnaire. Receipt of the postcard allowed us to remove names from our mailing list. The questionnaire was first mailed in early January 1994. In late February, we sent out a follow-up mailing, which contained another questionnaire to those in our sample who did not respond to our first mailing. In mid-April, we sent a letter to those who still had not yet responded, urging them to take part in the survey.", "The questionnaire was designed by a social science survey specialist in conjunction with GAO evaluators who were knowledgeable about the subject matter. We pretested the questionnaire with 15 NIH employees from a number of occupational categories before mailing to help ensure that our questions were interpreted correctly and that the respondents were willing to provide the information required. After the questionnaires were received from survey respondents, they were edited and then sent to be keypunched. All data were double keyed and verified during data entry. The computer program used in the analysis also contained consistency checks."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Sampling Methodology", "paragraphs": ["Our study population represents the approximately 13,000 white-collar employees at NIH and excludes staff fellows and contract employees. Since NIH is composed of 26 institutes, centers, and divisions (ICD), we wanted the results of our survey to provide specific estimates for the 5 largest ICDs and a general estimate for the remaining 21 ICDs. In addition, we wanted to look specifically at the experiences of male and female employees in the five largest ICDs and in the other ICDs as a whole. We asked NIH to provide us with a computer file containing the names and home addresses of all NIH employees. From this list, we deleted staff fellows and \u201cblue collar\u201d employees. We used standard statistical techniques to select a stratified random sample from this universe of names. The sample contained 4,110 employees of the universe of 13,473 employees. Table III.1 presents the universe and sample sizes for each stratum.", "Because this survey selected a portion of the universe for review, the results obtained are subject to some uncertainty or sampling error. The sampling error consists of two parts: confidence level and range. The confidence level indicates the degree of confidence that can be placed in the estimates derived from the sample. The range is the upper and lower limit between which the actual universe estimate may be found. For example, if all female employees of the Clinical Center had been surveyed, the chances are 19 out of 20 that the results obtained would not differ from our sample estimates by more than 5 percent."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Questionnaire Response Rates", "paragraphs": ["Not all NIH employees who were sent questionnaires returned them.

To find this out, in June 1994 we conducted a small-scale, nonstatistical telephone survey of 41 NIH employees who were in our sample but did not respond to the questionnaire. We asked these individuals two questions that were included in the questionnaire. The first was the extent to which they believed sexual harassment was a problem at NIH as a whole and at their ICD. The second was a similar question regarding sex discrimination. Although these 41 employees perceived less sexual harassment and sex discrimination than did the 2,642 employees that responded earlier, the differences in their perceptions were not statistically significant. We decided to not modify the main survey results on the basis of the 41 telephone respondents\u2019 views because the telephone respondents did not form a statistically representative sample and the observed differences were not statistically significant.", "The 2,642 usable returned questionnaires have been weighted to represent the study population of 13,473 white-collar employees at NIH (excluding staff fellows and contract employees). The weighted total population size for the sample was slightly different (13,460) due to rounding errors introduced in the sample weighting process.", "Because we sampled a portion of NIH employees, our survey results are estimates of all employees\u2019 views and are subject to sampling error. For example, the estimate that 32 percent of the employees have experienced sexual harassment is surrounded by a 95 percent confidence interval of + 2 percent. This confidence interval thus indicates that there is about a 95-percent chance that the actual percentage falls between 30 and 34 percent.

For example, differences in how a particular question is interpreted, in the sources of information that are available to respondents, or in the types of people who do not respond can introduce unwanted variability into the survey results.

If the complaint is not resolved and the employee chooses to file a formal complaint with HHS, an additional $8,700 in costs could be borne by HHS\u2019 Office of Human Relations and NIH\u2019s OEO. This includes the cost of an investigation, which HHS contracts out to an investigative firm.", "The procedures for handling sexual harassment complaints differ from those established for handling other types of EEO complaints. In order to speed up the process, an investigation is contracted for when an informal complaint has been filed. This shifts the costs for the investigation from the formal to the informal stage. An HHS official said that under this process, total costs (informal and formal) can range from $10,225 to $11,825.

However, the employee can later file an informal complaint if he/she is not satisfied with the outcome. NIH attorneys are also involved in EEO complaints that are appealed to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\u2019s (EEOC) Office of Federal Operations if the complainant is not satisfied with the outcome of the formal complaint stage.
