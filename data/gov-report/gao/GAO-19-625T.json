According to prior GAO work, this information could help decision makers identify significant climate risks as an initial step toward managing them.", "The federal government faces fiscal exposure from climate change risks in several areas, including:", "Disaster aid: due to the rising number of natural disasters and increasing reliance on federal assistance. GAO has previously reported that the federal government does not adequately plan for disaster resilience. GAO has also reported that, due to an artifically low indicator for determining a jursidiction's ability to respond to disasters that was set in 1986, the Federal Emergency Management Agency risks recommending federal assistance for juridisctions that could recover on their own.", "Federal insurance for property and crops: due, in part, to the vulnerability of insured property and crops to climate change impacts. Federal flood and crop insurance programs were not designed to generate sufficient funds to fully cover all losses and expenses. The flood insurance program, for example, was about $21 billion in debt to the Treasury as of April 2019. Further, the Congressional Budget Office estimated in May 2019 that federal crop insurance would cost the federal government an average of about $8 billion annually from 2019 through 2029.", "Operation and management of federal property and lands: due to the hundreds of thousands of federal facilities and millions of acres of land that could be affected by a changing climate and more frequent extreme events. For example, in 2018, Hurricane Michael devastated Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida, with a preliminary repair estimate of $3 billion.", "The federal budget, however, does not generally account for disaster assistance provided by Congress or the long-term impacts of climate change on existing federal infrastructure and programs. GAO has reported that more complete information about fiscal exposure could help policymakers better understand the trade-offs when making spending decisions.", "Further, federal investments in resilience to reduce fiscal exposures have been limited. As GAO has reported, enhancing resilience can reduce fiscal exposure by reducing or eliminating long-term risk to people and property from natural hazards. For example, a 2018 interim report by the National Institute of Building Sciences estimated approximate benefits to society in excess of costs for several types of resilience projects. While precise benefits are uncertain, the report estimated that for every dollar invested in designing new buildings to particular design standards, society could accrue benefits amounting to about $11 on average.", "The federal government has invested in individual agency efforts that could help build resilience within existing programs or projects. For example, the National Climate Assessment reported that the U.S. military integrates climate risks into its analysis, plans, and programs. In additon, as GAO reported in March 2019, the Disaster Recovery Reform Act of 2018 could improve resilience by allowing the President to set aside a portion of certain grants for pre-disaster mitigation. However, the federal government has not undertaken strategic government-wide planning to manage climate risks.", "GAO's March 2019 High-Risk report identified a number of recommendations GAO has made related to fiscal exposure to climate change. The federal government could reduce its fiscal exposure by implementing these recommendations. Among GAO's key government-wide recommendations are:", "Entities within the Executive Office of the President (EOP) should work with partners to establish federal strategic climate change priorities that reflect the full range of climate-related federal activities;", "Entities within EOP should use information on potential economic effects from climate change to help identify significant climate risks and craft appropriate federal responses;", "Entities within EOP should designate a federal entity to develop and update a set of authoritative climate observations and projections for use in federal decision making, and create a national climate information system with defined roles for federal agencies and certain nonfederal entities; and", "The Department of Commerce should convene federal agencies to provide the best-available forward-looking climate information to organizations that develop design standards and building codes to enhance infrastructure resilience."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for the opportunity to discuss our work on how to limit the  federal government\u2019s fiscal exposure by better managing climate change  risks, an area that has been on our High-Risk List since February 2013.  Addressing climate change risks requires advanced planning and  investment to reduce the need for far more costly steps in the decades to  come, which, as we have previously reported, the federal government is  not well organized to do. The costs associated with recent disasters have  illustrated the need for such planning and investment. In 2018 alone,  there were 14 separate billion-dollar weather and climate disaster events  across the United States, with a total cost of at least $91 billion, according  to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).  Further, on June 6, 2019, a supplemental appropriation of approximately  $19.1 billion was signed into law for recent disasters.", "The U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP), which  coordinates and integrates the activities of 13 federal agencies that  research changes in the global environment and their implications for  society, reported in its November 2018 Fourth National Climate  Assessment that climate change is playing a role in the increasing  frequency of some types of extreme weather that lead to the billion-dollar  disasters. These changes include the rise in vulnerability to drought,  lengthening wildfire seasons, and the potential for extremely heavy  rainfall becoming more common in some regions.

We reported that, according to  the two national-scale studies available at the time that examined the  economic effects of climate change across U.S. sectors, potential  economic effects could be significant and these effects will likely increase  over time for most of the sectors analyzed. For example, for 2020  through 2039, one of the studies estimated from $4 billion to $6 billion in  annual coastal property damages from sea level rise and more frequent  and intense storms. In addition, the national-scale studies we reviewed  and several experts we interviewed for the September 2017 report  suggested that potential economic effects could be unevenly distributed  across sectors and regions. For example, one of the studies estimated  that the Southeast, Midwest, and Great Plains regions will likely  experience greater combined economic effects than other regions, largely  because of coastal property damage in the Southeast and changes in  crop yields in the Midwest and Great Plains (see figure 1). This is consistent with the findings of the Fourth National Climate Assessment.  For example, according to that assessment, the continued increase in the  frequency and extent of high-tide flooding due to sea level rise threatens  America\u2019s trillion-dollar coastal property market and public infrastructure  sector.", "As we reported in September 2017, information on the potential economic  effects of climate change could help federal decision makers better  manage climate risks, according to leading practices for climate risk  management, economic analysis we reviewed, and the views of several  experts we interviewed. For example, such information could inform  decision makers about significant potential damages in different U.S.  sectors or regions. According to several experts and our prior work, this  information could help federal decision makers identify significant climate  priorities as an initial step toward managing climate risks. Such a first  step is consistent with leading practices for climate risk management and  federal standards for internal control. For example, leading practices  from the National Academies call for climate change risk management  efforts that focus on where immediate attention is needed. As noted in  our September 2017 report, according to a 2010 National Academies  report, other literature we reviewed, and several experts we interviewed,  to make informed choices, decision makers need more comprehensive  information on economic effects to better understand the potential costs  of climate change to society and begin to develop an understanding of the  benefits and costs of different options for managing climate risks."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Federal Government Faces Fiscal Exposure from Climate Change Risks, but Does Not Have Certain Information Needed to Help Make Budget Decisions", "paragraphs": ["The federal government faces fiscal exposure from climate change risks  in a number of areas, and this exposure will likely increase over time, as  we concluded in September 2017. In the March 2019 update to our  High-Risk List, we summarized our previous work that identified several  of these areas across the federal government, including programs related  to the following:", "Disaster aid. The rising number of natural disasters and increasing  reliance on federal assistance are a key source of federal fiscal  exposure, and this exposure will likely continue to rise. Since 2005,  federal funding for disaster assistance is at least $450 billion. In  September 2018, we reported that four hurricane and wildfire  disasters in 2017 created an unprecedented demand for federal  disaster resources and that hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria  ranked among the top five costliest hurricanes on record.  Subsequently, the fall of 2018 brought additional catastrophic  disasters such as Hurricanes Florence and Michael and devastating  California wildfires, with further needs for federal disaster assistance.  Disaster costs are projected to increase as certain extreme weather  events become more frequent and intense due to climate change\u2014as  observed and projected by USGCRP. In July 2015, we reported that  the federal government does not adequately plan for disaster  resilience and that most federal funding for hazard mitigation is  available after a disaster. In addition, our prior work found that the  Federal Emergency Management Agency\u2019s (FEMA) indicator for  determining whether to recommend that a jurisdiction receive disaster  assistance\u2014which was set in 1986\u2014is artificially low because it does  not accurately reflect the ability of state and local governments to  respond to disasters. Without an accurate assessment of a  jurisdiction\u2019s capability to respond to a disaster without federal  assistance, we found that FEMA runs the risk of recommending that  the President award federal assistance to jurisdictions that have the  capability to respond and recover on their own.", "Federal insurance for property and crops. The National Flood  Insurance Program (NFIP) and the Federal Crop Insurance  Corporation are sources of federal fiscal exposure due, in part, to the  vulnerability of the insured property and crops to climate change.  These programs provide coverage where private markets for  insurance do not exist, typically because the risk associated with the  property or crops is too great to privately insure at a cost that buyers  are willing to accept. From 2013 to 2017, losses paid under NFIP and  the federal crop insurance program totaled $51.3 billion. Federal  flood and crop insurance programs were not designed to generate  sufficient funds to fully cover all losses and expenses, which means  the programs need budget authority from Congress to operate. The  NFIP, for example, was about $21 billion in debt to the Treasury as of  April 2019. Further, the Congressional Budget Office estimated in  May 2019 that federal crop insurance would cost the federal  government an average of about $8 billion annually from 2019  through 2029.", "Operation and management of federal property and lands. The  federal government owns and operates hundreds of thousands of  facilities and manages millions of acres of land that could be affected  by a changing climate and represent a significant federal fiscal  exposure. For example, the Department of Defense (DOD) owns and  operates domestic and overseas infrastructure with an estimated  replacement value of about $1 trillion. In September 2018, Hurricane  Florence damaged Camp Lejeune and other Marine Corps facilities in  North Carolina, resulting in a preliminary Marine Corps repair estimate  of $3.6 billion. One month later, Hurricane Michael devastated Tyndall  Air Force Base in Florida, resulting in a preliminary Air Force repair  estimate of $3 billion and upwards of 5 years to complete the work. In  addition, we recently reported that the federal government manages  about 650 million acres of land in the United States that could be  vulnerable to climate change, including the possibility of more  frequent and severe droughts and wildfires. Appropriations for  federal wildland fire management activities have increased  considerably since the 1990s, as we and the Congressional Research  Service have reported.", "Although the federal government faces fiscal exposure from climate  change across the nation, it does not have certain information needed by  policymakers to help understand the budgetary impacts of such  exposure. We have previously reported that the federal budget  generally does not account for disaster assistance provided by  Congress\u2014which can reach tens of billions of dollars for some  disasters\u2014or the long-term impacts of climate change on existing federal  infrastructure and programs. For Example, as we reported in April 2018,  the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s (OMB) climate change funding  reports we reviewed did not include funding information on federal  programs with significant fiscal exposures to climate change identified by  OMB and others\u2014such as domestic disaster assistance, flood insurance,  and crop insurance. A more complete understanding of climate change  fiscal exposures can help policymakers anticipate changes in future  spending and enhance control and oversight over federal resources, as  we reported in October 2013. For budget decisions for federal programs  with fiscal exposure to climate change, we found in the April 2018 report  that information that could help provide a more complete understanding  would include: (1) costs to repair, replace, and improve the weather- related resilience of federally-funded property and resources; (2) costs for  federal flood and crop insurance programs; and (3) costs for disaster  assistance programs, among other identified areas of fiscal exposure to  climate change. To help policymakers better understand the trade-offs  when making spending decisions, we recommended in the April 2018  report that OMB provide information on fiscal exposures related to climate  change in conjunction with future reports on climate change funding."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Investments in Resilience to Climate Change Impacts Have Been Limited", "paragraphs": ["Although the federal government faces fiscal exposure to climate change,  its investments in resilience to climate change impacts have been limited.  One way to reduce federal fiscal exposure is to enhance resilience by  reducing or eliminating long-term risk to people and property from natural  hazards. For example, in September 2018 we reported that elevating  homes and strengthened building codes in Texas and Florida prevented  greater damages during the 2017 hurricane season. In addition, one  company participating in a 2014 forum we held on preparing for climate- related risks noted that for every dollar it invested in resilience efforts, the  company could prevent $5 in potential losses. Finally, a 2018 interim  report by the National Institute of Building Sciences examined a sample of  federal grants for hazard mitigation. The report estimated approximate  benefits to society (i.e., homeowners, communities, etc.) in excess of  costs for several types of resilience projects through the protection of  lives and property, and prevention of other losses. For example, while  precise benefits are uncertain, the report estimated that for every grant  dollar the federal government spent on resilience projects, over time,  society could accrue benefits amounting to the following:", "About $3 on average from projects addressing fire at the wildland  urban interface, with most benefits (69 percent) coming from the  protection of property (i.e., avoiding property losses).", "About $5 on average from projects to address hurricane and tornado  force winds, with most benefits (89 percent) coming from the  protection of lives. This includes avoiding deaths, nonfatal injuries,  and causes of post-traumatic stress.", "About $7 on average from projects that buy out buildings prone to  riverine flooding, with most benefits (65 percent) coming from the  protection of property.", "The interim report also estimated that society could accrue benefits  amounting to about $11 on average for every dollar invested in designing  new buildings to meet the 2018 International Building Code and the 2018  International Residential Code\u2014the model building codes developed by  the International Code Council\u2014with most benefits (46 percent) coming  from the protection of property.", "We reported in October 2009 that the federal government\u2019s activities to  build resilience to climate change were carried out in an ad hoc manner  and were not well coordinated across federal agencies. Federal  agencies have included some of these activities within existing programs  and operations\u2014a concept known as mainstreaming. For example, the  Fourth National Climate Assessment reported that the U.S. military  integrates climate risks into its analysis, plans and programs, with  particular attention paid to climate effects on force readiness, military  bases, and training ranges. However, according to the Fourth National  Climate Assessment, while a significant portion of climate risk can be  addressed by mainstreaming, the practice may reduce the visibility of  climate resilience relative to dedicated, stand-alone approaches and may  prove insufficient to address the full range of climate risks.", "In addition, as we reported in March 2019, the Disaster Recovery Reform  Act of 2018 (DRRA) was enacted in October 2018, which could improve  state and local resilience to disasters. DRRA, among other things, allows  the President to set aside, with respect to each major disaster, a  percentage of the estimated aggregate amount of certain grants to use for  pre-disaster hazard mitigation and makes federal assistance available to  state and local governments for building code administration and  enforcement. However, it is too early to tell what impact the  implementation of the act will have on state and local resilience.", "The federal government has made some limited investments in resilience  and DRRA could enable additional improvements at the state and local  level. However, we reported in September 2017 that the federal  government had not undertaken strategic government-wide planning to  manage significant climate risks before they become fiscal exposures.  We also reported in July 2015 that the federal government had no  comprehensive strategic approach for identifying, prioritizing, and  implementing investments for disaster resilience. As an initial step in  managing climate risks, most of the experts we interviewed for the  September 2017 report told us that federal decision makers should  prioritize risk management efforts on significant climate risks that create  the greatest fiscal exposure. However, as we reported in our March  2019 High-Risk List, the federal government had not made measurable  progress since 2017 to reduce fiscal exposure in several key areas that  we have identified. The High-Risk List identified Limiting the Federal  Government\u2019s Fiscal Exposure by Better Managing Climate Change  Risks as an area needing significant attention because the federal  government has regressed in progress toward one of our criterion for  removal from the list."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Federal Government Could Reduce Its Fiscal Exposure by Focusing and Coordinating Federal Efforts", "paragraphs": ["As we reported in March 2019, the federal government could reduce its  fiscal exposure to climate change by focusing and coordinating federal  efforts. However, the federal government is currently not well organized  to address the fiscal exposure presented by climate change, partly  because of the inherently complicated and crosscutting nature of the  issue. We have made a total of 62 recommendations related to limiting  the federal government\u2019s fiscal exposure to climate change over the  years, 12 of which have been made since February 2017. As of  December 2018, 25 of these recommendations remained open. In  describing what needs to be done to reduce federal fiscal exposure to  climate change, our March 2019 High-Risk report discusses many of the  open recommendations. Implementing these recommendations could  help reduce federal fiscal exposure. Several of them, including those  highlighted below, identify key government-wide efforts needed to help  plan for and manage climate risks and direct federal efforts toward  common goals, such as improving resilience:", "Develop a national strategic plan: In May 2011, we recommended  that appropriate entities within the Executive Office of the President  (EOP), including OMB, work with agencies and interagency  coordinating bodies to establish federal strategic climate change  priorities that reflect the full range of climate-related federal activities,  including roles and responsibilities of key federal entities.", "Use economic information to identify and respond to significant  climate risks: In September 2017, we recommended that the  appropriate entities within EOP use information on the potential  economic effects of climate change to help identify significant climate  risks facing the federal government and craft appropriate federal  responses. Such federal responses could include establishing a  strategy to identify, prioritize, and guide federal investments to  enhance resilience against future disasters.", "Provide decision makers with the best available climate  information: In November 2015, we reported that federal efforts to  provide information about climate change impacts did not fully meet  the climate information needs of federal, state, local, and private  sector decision makers, which hindered their efforts to plan for climate  change risks. We reported that these decision makers would benefit  from a national climate information system that would develop and  update authoritative climate observations and projections specifically  for use in decision-making. As a result, we recommended that EOP  (1) designate a federal entity to develop and periodically update a set  of authoritative climate observations and projections for use in federal  decision-making, which other decision makers could also access; and  (2) designate a federal entity to create a national climate information  system with defined roles for federal agencies and nonfederal entities  with existing statutory authority.", "Consider climate information in design standards: In November  2016, we reported that design standards, building codes, and  voluntary certifications established by standards-developing  organizations play a role in ensuring the resilience of infrastructure to  the effects of natural disasters. However, we reported that these  organizations faced challenges to using forward-looking climate  information that could help enhance the resilience of infrastructure. As  a result, we recommended in the November 2016 report that the  Department of Commerce, acting through the National Institute of  Standards and Technology\u2014which is responsible for coordinating  federal participation in standards organizations\u2014convene federal  agencies for an ongoing government-wide effort to provide the best  available forward-looking climate information to standards-developing  organizations for their consideration in the development of design  standards, building codes, and voluntary certifications.", "In conclusion, the effects of climate change have already and will  continue to pose risks that can create fiscal exposure across the federal  government and this exposure will continue to increase. The federal government does not generally account for such fiscal exposure to  programs in the budget process nor has it undertaken strategic efforts to  manage significant climate risks that could reduce the need for far more  costly steps in the decades to come. To reduce its fiscal exposure, the  federal government needs a cohesive strategic approach with strong  leadership and the authority to manage risks across the entire range of  related federal activities.
