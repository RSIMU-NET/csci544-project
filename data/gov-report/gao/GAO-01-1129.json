Furthermore, studies have found that products sometimes contain harmful contaminants or much more of an active ingredient than is indicated on the label. Unproven anti-aging and alternative medicine products also pose an economic risk to seniors. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) have identified several products that make advertising or labeling claims with insufficient substantiation, some costing consumers hundreds or thousands of dollars apiece. Federal and state agencies have efforts under way to protect consumers of these products.

Many  alternative medicine products, including dietary supplements, have  widespread popular appeal among consumers, and some have yielded  promising results in studies that focus on chronic health conditions that  affect many older adults, such as depression, dementia, and arthritis. For  example, some studies have suggested that St. John\u2019s wort may counteract  feelings of mild to moderate depression and that ginkgo biloba may  improve cognitive performance in dementia. At the same time, regulators  and medical experts are concerned that some products have health risks or  are marketed with misleading and unsubstantiated claims.", "Some companies promote their products to senior citizens by using \u201canti- aging\u201d or \u201ccure-all\u201d claims for which there is little or no supporting  scientific evidence of either safety or efficacy. In addition, there are  concerns that some of these products may cause physical or economic  harm.  Seniors are thought to be at particular risk of physical harm because  they often take multiple prescription pharmaceuticals, increasing their risk  of possibly dangerous supplement-drug interactions. Seniors can also be  harmed indirectly if they decide to follow an unsubstantiated alternative  regimen and forgo needed conventional medical treatment.  There is also  concern that seniors may be wasting money on products that have little or  no therapeutic value.", "Since 1994, when the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act  (DSHEA) was enacted, sales of dietary supplements have soared.  A  significant number of these products are herbal supplements, and others  are nonherbal specialty supplements. DSHEA permits dietary supplements  to feature so-called structure/function label claims, which are statements  that an ingredient in the product will benefit a body\u2019s structure (such as  \u201cbuilds strong bones\u201d) or function (such as \u201cpromotes restful sleep\u201d). As  we reported last year, consumers may incorrectly view such statements as  claims to reduce the risk of or to treat a disease.", "In light of these concerns, you asked us to examine (1) whether there is  evidence that anti-aging and alternative medicine products, particularly  dietary supplements aimed at conditions of aging, cause physical harm to  senior citizens; (2) whether there is evidence that questionable anti-aging  and alternative medicine products cause economic harm to senior citizens;  and (3) federal and state oversight efforts to protect consumers from  questionable anti-aging and alternative medicine products.", "To address these questions, we obtained documents from and interviewed  officials with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Federal Trade  Commission (FTC), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), state Attorneys  General (AG) offices, and state health departments, as well as  representatives of the dietary supplement industry and other interested  organizations and experts.  We also reviewed the scientific literature on  dietary supplements and other products marketed as anti-aging therapies.  Our work focused primarily on those products that purport to have anti- aging properties or which claim to address chronic diseases and conditions  common among senior citizens, such as cancer, memory loss, and arthritis.

The survey found that  12 percent used herbal remedies. Other studies have found that 16 to 18  percent of Americans used dietary supplements, including amino acids and  over-the-counter hormones.", "When considering only senior citizens, surveys have generally found that as  many as 40 percent of seniors used herbal and specialty supplements at  some time in the previous year, with a smaller percentage reporting regular  use.  For example, a survey conducted in 1999 for Prevention Magazine  found that 43 percent of seniors used herbal supplements and 23 percent  used specialty supplements in the previous year. This study also found that  one-quarter of older Americans often use herbal and specialty supplements  in combination with prescription medications.  A recent unpublished  Harris Poll survey conducted for the Dietary Supplement Education  Alliance (June and July 2001) found that 12 percent of those aged 65 or  older used herbal supplements and 9 percent used specialty supplements  on a regular basis.  Surveys have found that many older Americans use  these supplements to maintain overall health, increase energy, improve  memory, and prevent and treat serious illness, as well as to slow the aging  process, among other purposes.  Products frequently used by seniors to  address aging concerns include herbal supplements such as evening  primrose, ginkgo biloba, ginseng, kava kava, saw palmetto, St. John\u2019s wort,  and valerian, and specialty supplements such as chondroitin, coenzyme  Q10, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), glucosamine, melatonin, omega-3  fatty acids (fish oil), shark cartilage, and soy proteins (see app. II for details  regarding these substances)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Research on Alternative Medicine Products", "paragraphs": ["NIH\u2019s National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine  (NCCAM) has noted that preliminary evidence-based reviews suggest that  some alternative therapies may have beneficial effects.

For example, one source stated  that increased memory performance and learning capacity have been  established experimentally for ginkgo biloba. One controlled study has  shown positive results for ginkgo biloba in tests of cognitive performance  in dementia. Similarly, some reviews have suggested that studies of  glucosamine in the treatment of osteoarthritis found positive results, as  did studies of St. John\u2019s wort for depression.

DSHEA does not require manufacturers  of dietary supplements to demonstrate either safety or efficacy to FDA  prior to marketing them.  However, if FDA subsequently determines that a  dietary supplement is unsafe, the agency can ask a court to halt its sale. For  dietary supplements, the Health and Human Services Secretary may  declare the existence of an imminent hazard from a dietary supplement,  after which the Secretary must initiate an administrative hearing to  determine the matter, which may then be reviewed in court.

FTC can ask companies to remove misleading or unsubstantiated claims  from their advertising and it can seek monetary redress for conduct  injurious to consumers in appropriate cases.  FTC published an advertising  guide for the dietary supplements industry in November 1998 that  reminded the industry that advertising must be truthful and that objective  product claims must be substantiated.

Although precise estimates of the physical harm  caused to senior citizens by questionable anti-aging and alternative  products are not available, there is evidence in the medical literature that  seniors are at risk for adverse effects, that dietary supplements are  contraindicated for individuals with some underlying health problems, and  that a variety of frequently used dietary supplements can have dangerous  interactions with drugs that are being taken concurrently.  Although  documented adverse effects from most herbal and specialty supplements  are generally mild, potential complications from supplements that might be  contraindicated under certain circumstances and from interactions with  certain prescription medications may be serious.  In addition, there is  evidence that 1 in 10 herbal products may be contaminated with pesticides  and heavy metals, which can have serious health consequences. Adverse  event reports received by FDA and others give an indication of some  possible risks. FDA has issued warnings to consumers and industry about  the health risks of several dietary supplement products. Recognizing these  health risks, the American Medical Association has recommended that  dietary supplements and herbal remedies include specific warnings on  their labels, and several trade associations representing manufacturers,  suppliers, and distributors of dietary supplements have instituted voluntary  programs to reduce the risk of potentially harmful products."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Scientific Evidence Shows Potential Adverse Effects, Contraindications, and Drug Interactions for Some Popular Supplements", "paragraphs": ["Our review of the medical literature identified several areas where  individuals, particularly seniors, may be at risk of physical harm due to  adverse effects--especially if dietary supplements are used when they are  contraindicated--or interactions between these dietary supplement  products and prescription or over-the-counter drugs.", "The literature suggests that among healthy adults, most supplements when  taken alone have been associated with only rare and minor adverse effects.  These include stomach distress, headache, breast tenderness, restlessness,  skin reactions, and hypersensitivity to sunlight. However, others are  associated with more serious adverse effects.  For example, the literature  suggests that DHEA may increase the risk of breast, prostate, and  endometrial cancer, and shark cartilage has been associated with thyroid  hormone toxicity.", "Contraindications have been identified in the literature for several  supplements. Ginseng is not recommended for persons with hypoglycemia.  Kava kava may worsen symptoms of Parkinson\u2019s disease.  Saw palmetto is  contraindicated for patients with breast cancer, and valerian should not be  used by those with liver or kidney disease without first consulting a  physician. A recent study also suggested that echinacea (promoted to help  fight colds and flu), ephedra (promoted as an energy booster and diet aid),  garlic, ginkgo biloba, ginseng, kava kava, St. John\u2019s wort, and valerian may  pose particular risks to people during surgery, with complications including  bleeding, cardiovascular instability, and hypoglycemia.  Other potential  complications cited were an increase in the sedative effect of anesthetics  and increased metabolism of many drugs.", "The literature also identifies a number of possible interactions with  prescription medications. Since seniors take more prescription medicines  on average than do younger adults, the risk of interactions among seniors  may be higher. For example, evening primrose oil, garlic, ginkgo biloba,  ginseng, glucosamine, and St. John\u2019s wort magnify the effect of blood- thinning drugs such as warfarin or coumadin. We also identified reports  suggesting that ginkgo biloba may reduce the effects of seizure medications  and glucosamine may have a harmful effect on insulin resistance.", "An additional concern is that individuals with potentially serious health  conditions may seek alternative therapies, some of which are unproven, in  lieu of conventional medical therapies, and may do so without consulting  their physician.  For example, the Prevention Magazine survey we  described earlier found that 39 percent of the respondents aged 65 or older  who used a herbal supplement to prevent or treat a disease used the herbal  remedy instead of an over-the-counter medication and 34 percent had tried  a herbal remedy instead of a prescription medication.  Surveys have also  found that individuals who use alternative therapies (either in conjunction  with or instead of traditional therapies) often do not discuss this fact with  their physicians. For example, one survey found that only 39 percent of  adults who used an alternative therapy said they informed their doctor,  and a Harris poll survey found that 49 percent of respondents who used a  dietary supplement informed their doctor.  In addition, many respondents  in that survey were found to have misperceptions about the responsible use  of supplements.

Some  pesticides and heavy metals, for example, are probable carcinogens and  can be toxic to the liver and kidney or impair oxygen transport in the blood.   One commercial laboratory found contamination in samples from  echinacea, ginseng, and St. John\u2019s wort products.  As much as 20 times the  level of pesticides allowable by the U.S. Pharmacopeia was found in two  samples of ginseng.

Three percent of the specialty supplement  products showed signs of contamination.", "Some scientific studies have found that there may be significantly more  active ingredient in some herbal and specialty supplement products than is  indicated on the label.  Amounts of active ingredients that exceed what is  indicated on a product label may increase the risk of overdose for some  patients. For pharmaceuticals, the tolerable range of product content is  between 90 and 110 percent of the amount of active ingredient stated on  the label.  For example, one study of DHEA found that only 44 percent of  the products sampled were within this range and one brand contained 150  percent of the amount indicated on the label. In a study of ephedra, one  product was shown to have  as much as 154 percent of the active ingredient  indicated on the label. A study of feverfew (promoted as a migraine  prophylaxis) found that 22 percent of the products tested contained more  than 110 percent of what the authors considered to be the therapeutic dose  of its active ingredient, in two cases doubling that amount. Studies of  ginseng have found that product concentrations varied nearly fivefold  across different products and that 38 percent of the products tested had  more than 110 percent of the amount of active ingredient on the label, four  of them containing more than twice as much. Studies of SAM-e (promoted  as an antidepressant and in the treatment of the joint pain, stiffness, and  inflammation associated with osteoarthritis) and St. John\u2019s wort also found  that products frequently contained more of the active ingredient than  indicated on the label.
