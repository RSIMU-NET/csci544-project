These tools have the potential to, among other things, better include the public in the governing process. However, agency use of these technologies can present risks associated with properly managing and protecting government records and sensitive information, including personally identifiable information. In light of the rapidly increasing popularity of Web 2.0 technologies, GAO was asked to identify and describe current uses of Web 2.0 technologies by federal agencies and key challenges associated with their use. To accomplish this, GAO analyzed federal policies, reports, and guidance related to the use of Web 2.0 technologies and interviewed officials at selected federal agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security, the General Services Administration, and the National Archives and Records Administration."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Federal agencies are using Web 2.0 technologies to enhance services and support their individual missions. Federal Web managers use these applications to connect to people in new ways. As of July 2010, we identified that 22 of 24 major federal agencies had a presence on Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. Several challenges in federal agencies' use of Web 2.0 technologies have been identified: (1) Privacy and security. Agencies are faced with the challenges of determining how the Privacy Act of 1974, which provides certain protections to personally identifiable information, applies to information exchanged in the use of Web 2.0 technologies, such as social networking sites. Further, the federal government may face challenges in determining how to appropriately limit collection and use of personal information as agencies utilize these technologies and how and when to extend privacy protections to information collected and used by third-party providers of Web 2.0 services. In addition, personal information needs to be safeguarded from security threats, and guidance may be needed for employees on how to use social media Web sites properly and how to handle personal information in the context of social media. (2) Records management and freedom of information. Web 2.0 technologies raise issues in the government's ability to identify and preserve federal records. Agencies may face challenges in assessing whether the information they generate and receive by means of these technologies constitutes federal records and establish mechanisms for preserving such records, which involves, among other things, determining the appropriate intervals at which to capture constantly changing Web content. The use of Web 2.0 technologies can also present challenges in appropriately responding to Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests because there are significant complexities in determining whether agencies control Web 2.0-generated content, as understood within the context of FOIA. Federal agencies have begun to identify some of the issues associated with Web 2.0 technologies and have taken steps to start addressing them. For example, the Office of Management and Budget recently issued guidance intended to (1) clarify when and how the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 applies to federal agency use of social media and Web-based interactive technologies; and (2) help federal agencies protect privacy when using third-party Web sites and applications."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for the opportunity to testify today on the use of \u201cWeb  2.0\u201d technologies by federal government agencies and the challenges  associated with the use of these technologies.", "Federal agencies are increasingly using recently developed  technologies (commonly referred to as \"Web 2.0\" technologies) that  offer flexible, sophisticated capabilities for interaction with  individuals, allowing agencies and the public to publish comments,  photos, and videos directly on agency-sponsored Web pages.

The memorandum encouraged executive departments  and agencies to harness new technologies to put information about  their operations and decisions online so that it would be readily  available to the public. It also encouraged the solicitation of public  feedback to identify information of the greatest use to the public,  assess and improve levels of collaboration, and identify new  opportunities for cooperation in government.

The Privacy Act of 1974 places  limitations on agencies\u2019 collection, disclosure, and use of personal  information maintained in systems of records. The act describes a  \u201crecord\u201d as any item, collection, or grouping of information about an  individual that is maintained by an agency and contains his or her  name or another personal identifier. It also defines \u201csystem of  records\u201d as a group of records under the control of any agency from  which information is retrieved by the name of the individual or by  an individual identifier.", "However, because of the nature of Web 2.0 technologies, identifying  how the act applies to the information exchanged is difficult. Some  cases may be more clear-cut than others. For example, as noted by a  participant discussing Web 2.0 challenges at a recent conference  sponsored by DHS, the Privacy Act clearly applies to systems owned  and operated by the government that make use of Web 2.0  technologies. Government agencies may also take advantage of  commercial Web 2.0 offerings, in which case they are likely to have  much less control over the systems that maintain and exchange  information. For example, a government agency that chooses to  establish a presence on a third party provider\u2019s service, such as  Facebook, could have limited control over what is done with its  information once posted on the electronic venue. Given this limited  control, key officials we interviewed said they are unsure about the  extent to which personal information that is exchanged in such  forums is protected by the provisions of the Privacy Act.", "Ensuring that agencies are taking appropriate steps to limit  the collection and use of personal information through social  media. Privacy could be compromised if clear limits are not set on  how the government uses personal information to which it has  access in social networking environments. Social networking sites,  such as Facebook, encourage people to provide personal  information that they intend to be used only for social purposes.  Government agencies that participate in such sites may have access  to this information and may need rules on how such information can  be used. While such agencies cannot control what information may  be captured by social networking sites, they can make  determinations about what information they will collect and what to  disclose. However, unless rules to guide their decisions are clear,  agencies could handle information inconsistently. Individual privacy  could be affected, depending upon whether and how government  agencies collect or use personal information disclosed by  individuals in interactive settings.", "Extending privacy protections to the collection and use of  personal information by third party providers. Individuals  interacting with the government via Web 2.0 media may provide  personal information for specific government purposes and may not  understand that the information may be collected and stored by  third-party commercial providers. It also may not be clear as to  whose privacy policy applies when a third party manages content on  a government agency Web site. Accordingly, agencies may need to  be clear about the extent to which they make use of commercial  providers and the providers\u2019 specific roles. Uncertainty about who  has access to personal information provided through agency social  networking sites could diminish individuals\u2019 willingness to express  their views and otherwise interact with the government.", "Safeguarding personal information from security threats that  target Web 2.0 technologies. Federal government information  systems have been targeted by persistent, pervasive, aggressive  threats. In addition, as the popularity of social media has grown,  they have increasingly been targeted as well. Thus as agencies make  use of Web 2.0 technologies, they face persistent, sophisticated  threats targeting their own information as well as the personal  information of individuals interacting with them. The rapid  development of Web 2.0 technologies makes it challenging to keep  up with the constantly evolving threats deployed against them and  raises the risks associated with government participation in such  technologies.", "Further, the Federal Information Security Management Act states  that agencies are responsible for the security of information  collected or maintained on their behalf and for information systems  used or operated on their behalf. The extent to which FISMA makes  federal agencies responsible for the security of third-party social  media Web sites may depend on whether such sites are operating  their systems or collecting information on behalf of the federal  government, which may not be clear.", "Training government participants on the proper use of social  networking tools. Use of Web 2.0 technologies can result in a  blending of professional and personal use by government  employees, which can pose risks to their agencies. When an  individual identifies him- or herself on a social media site as a  federal employee, he or she provides information that may be  exploited in a cyber attack on the agency. However, federal  guidance may be needed for employees on how to use social media  Web sites properly and how to handle personal information in the  context of social media.

A challenge associated with  government use of Web 2.0 technologies, including government  blogs and wikis and Web pages hosted by commercial providers, is  the question of whether information exchanged through these  technologies constitute federal records pursuant to the Federal  Records Act. The National Archives and Records Administration  (NARA) has issued guidance to help agencies make decisions on  what records generated by these technologies should be considered  agency records. According to the guidance, records generated when  a user interacts with an agency Web site may form part of a set of  official agency records. NARA guidance also indicates that content  created with interactive software on government Web sites is owned  by the government, not the individuals who created it, and is likely  to constitute agency records and should be managed as such. Given  these complex considerations, it may be challenging for federal  agencies engaging the public via Web 2.0 technologies to assess the  information they generate and receive via these technologies to  determine its status as federal records.", "Establishing mechanisms for preserving Web 2.0 information  as records. Once the need to preserve information as federal  records has been established, mechanisms need to be put in place to  capture such records and preserve them properly. Proper records  retention management needs to take into account NARA record  scheduling requirements and federal law, which requires that the  disposition of all federal records be planned according to an agency  schedule or a general records schedule approved by NARA. The  records schedule identifies records as being either temporary or  permanent and sets times for their disposal.", "These requirements may be challenging for agencies because the  types of records involved when information is collected via Web 2.0  technologies may not be clear. For example, part of managing Web  records includes determining when and how Web \u201csnapshots\u201d  should be taken to capture the content of agency Web pages as they  existed at particular points in time. Business needs and the extent to  which unique information is at risk of being lost determine whether  such snapshots are warranted and their frequency. NARA guidance  requires that snapshots be taken each time a Web site changes  significantly; thus, agencies may need to assess how frequently the  information on their sites changes.", "Comments by individuals on agency postings may need to be  scheduled in addition to agency postings. In the case of a wiki,  NARA guidance requires agencies to determine whether the  collaborative wiki process should be scheduled along with the  resulting final product. In addition, because a wiki depends on a  collaborative community to provide content, agencies are required  to make determinations about how much content is required to  make the wiki significant or \u201cauthoritative\u201d from a record  perspective.", "The potential complexity of these decisions and the resulting  record-keeping requirements and processes can be daunting to  agencies.", "Ensuring proper adherence to the requirements of FOIA.

Determining whether  Web 2.0 records qualify as \u201cagency records\u201d under FOIA\u2019s definition  is a complex question. FOIA\u2019s definition focuses on the extent to  which the government controls the information in question.  According to the Department of Justice\u2019s FOIA guidance, courts  apply a four-part test to determine whether an agency exercises  control over a record. They examine: (a) who created the record and  the intent of the record creator; (b) whether the agency intended to  relinquish control; (c) the agency\u2019s ability to use or dispose of the  record; and (d) the extent to which the record is integrated into the  agency\u2019s files. Agency \u201ccontrol\u201d is also the predominant  consideration in determining whether information generated or  maintained by a government contractor is subject to FOIA\u2019s  requirements.

Once these issues are understood, measures  can then be developed and implemented to address them. Several  steps have been taken to identify these issues and to begin  developing processes and procedures to address them:  In June 2009, DHS hosted a two-day public workshop to discuss  \u25cf  leading practices for the use of social media technologies to further  the President\u2019s Transparency and Open Government Initiative. The  workshop consisted of panels of academic, private-sector, and  public-sector experts and included discussions on social media  activities of federal agencies and the impact of those activities on  privacy and security. In November 2009, DHS released a report  summarizing the findings of the panels and highlighting potential  solutions. According to a DHS official involved in coordinating the  workshop, the array of issues raised during the workshop\u2014which  are reflected in the challenges I have discussed today\u2014remain  critically important to effective agency use of Web 2.0 technologies  and have not yet been fully addressed across the government.  \u25cf  NARA has issued guidance outlining issues related to the  management of government information associated with Web 2.0  use. The agency recently released a brief document, Implications of  Recent Web Technologies for NARA Web Guidance, as a supplement  to its guidance to federal agencies on managing Web-based records.  The document discusses Web technologies used by federal  agencies\u2014including Web portals, blogs, and wikis\u2014and their  impact on records management. NARA officials recognize that the  guidance does not fully address more recent Web 2.0 technologies,  and they said the agency is currently conducting a study of the  impact of those technologies and plans to release additional  guidance later this year.  \u25cf  that it had negotiated terms-of-service agreements with several  social networking providers, including Facebook, MySpace, and  YouTube. The purpose of these agreements was to provide federal  agencies with standardized vehicles for engaging these providers  and to resolve legal concerns raised by following the terms and  conditions generally used by the providers, which posed problems  for federal agencies, including liability, endorsements, advertising,  and freedom of information. As a result, other federal agencies can  take advantage of these negotiated agreements when determining  whether to use the providers\u2019 services.", "In April 2009, the General Services Administration announced  \u25cf  The Office of Management and Budget (OMB), in response to  President Obama\u2019s January 2009 memorandum promoting  transparency and open government, recently issued guidance  intended to (1) clarify when and how the Paperwork Reduction Act  of 1995 (PRA) applies to federal agency use of social media and  Web-based interactive technologies; and (2) help federal agencies  protect privacy when using third-party Web sites and applications.  Specifically, a memo issued in April 2010 explained that certain  uses of social media and web-based interactive technologies would  not be treated as \u201cinformation collections\u201d that would otherwise  require review under the PRA. Such uses include many uses of  wikis, the posting of comments, the conduct of certain contests, and  the rating and ranking of posts or comments by Web site users. It  also states that items collected by third party Web sites or platforms  that are not collecting information on behalf of the federal  government are not subject to the PRA.", "In addition, a memorandum issued by OMB in June 2010 called for  agencies to provide transparent privacy policies, individual notice,  and a careful analysis of the privacy implications whenever they  choose to use third-party technologies to engage with the public.   The memo stated\u2014among other things\u2014that prior to using any  third-party Web site or application, agencies should examine the  third-party\u2019s privacy policy to evaluate the risks and determine  whether it is appropriate for agency use. Further, if agencies post  links on their Web sites that lead to third-party Web sites, they  should notify users that they are being directed to non-government  Web sites that may have privacy policies that differ from the  agency\u2019s. In addition, the memo required agencies to complete a  privacy impact assessment whenever an agency\u2019s use of a third- party Web site or application gives it access to personally  identifiable information.", "In summary, federal agencies are increasingly using Web 2.0  technologies to enhance services and interactions with the public,  and such technologies have the potential to transform how federal  agencies engage the public by allowing citizens to become more  involved in the governing process and thus promoting transparency  and collaboration.
