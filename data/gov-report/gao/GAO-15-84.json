CBP and VBA's disability compensation had formal mechanisms for reviewing customer feedback, but the other agencies did not.

To address our two objectives, we selected  agencies and their services for our review based on prior work in which  we surveyed 12 federal agencies (which are among those with the most  widespread contact with the public) about 13 services they provided.  For the prior report, five of those agencies were selected for additional  follow-up interviews\u2014based on their responses to key survey questions\u2014 in order to gain a fuller understanding of their responses.
