Under an agreement with the state, DOE must treat the waste to prepare it for removal from Idaho by 2035. Construction on the IWTU, EM's facility to treat such waste, was completed in 2012, but initial testing of the SBW treatment process revealed design problems. EM has since been working to reengineer the IWTU. Total project construction and reengineering expenditures have reached nearly $1 billion as of February 2019.", "GAO was asked to review EM's efforts to treat and dispose of the SBW and calcine waste.

EM's cost and schedule estimates for IWTU reengineering did not fully meet selected best practices for cost (i.e., did not account for all costs) and schedule estimates (e.g., did not have a valid critical path). For example, EM did not follow best practices for a comprehensive cost estimate because EM did not include both government and contractor costs over the entire project. As of February 2019, EM has experienced approximately $64 million in added costs and a more than 1-year delay in IWTU reengineering. Without fully following best practices for cost and schedule estimates, EM is at risk of future cost overruns and delays in meeting its target disposal milestones.", "Based on GAO's review of EM documents, EM faces challenges with its plans for SBW disposal at its preferred disposal site, the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP), an underground repository for waste contaminated by nuclear elements, near Carlsbad, New Mexico. These challenges include a statutory prohibition on the disposal of high-level waste (HLW) at WIPP. Further, EM does not have a strategy or timeline to address these challenges or to identify an alternative disposal pathway. Without such a strategy or timeline, EM risks not meeting its commitments with Idaho to prepare the SBW for removal from the state by 2035.", "EM faces challenges implementing its selected technology to further treat 1.2 million gallons of granular calcine waste and selecting a potential waste disposal pathway. For example, DOE has identified challenges with retrofitting the IWTU for calcine waste treatment. As a result, EM is deferring further development of its plans to treat the calcine waste. EM officials said that the agency is making progress toward calcine waste disposal by testing options for removing the waste from its storage bins, a precursor to treating or packaging the waste for disposal. However, EM does not have a strategy or timeline for determining its next steps for the treatment and disposal of calcine waste. Such a strategy could help EM in seeking alternatives to its selected treatment technology and provide assurance that it will meet its commitments with Idaho for removing calcine waste from the state by the end of 2035."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making five recommendations, including that DOE develop a strategy for the disposal of the waste.

Since  the early 1990s, the state of Idaho has raised concerns about the  potential for legacy waste from these activities to contaminate the Eastern  Snake River Plain Aquifer, which is situated beneath the INL site. Two  types of waste were of principal concern: (1) 900,000 gallons of sodium- bearing waste (SBW), a liquid waste that contains large quantities of  sodium and other nitrates, and (2) 1.2 million gallons of calcine waste, a  highly radioactive dried waste. In a 1995 court-approved agreement  between DOE and the state of Idaho (1995 settlement agreement), DOE  agreed to treat the SBW to a solid form by December 31, 2012, and treat  the SBW and the calcine waste so that it is ready for disposal outside of  the state by a target date of 2035. However, in the decades since DOE  signed this and other agreements with the state of Idaho, DOE continues  to struggle to meet the 2012 milestone.", "The Idaho Department of Environmental Quality monitors DOE\u2019s  compliance with this and other agreements regarding cleanup milestones  at INL. Within DOE, the Office of Environmental Management (EM), as  part of its Idaho Cleanup Project, oversees the cleanup of radioactive and  hazardous waste at INL, including SBW and calcine waste. EM manages  both of these wastes as high-level waste (HLW) that also contains  hazardous chemicals, which is referred to as mixed HLW. In 2005, EM  contracted for the design and construction of a facility known as the  Integrated Waste Treatment Unit (IWTU) to treat the SBW and, following  significant facility modifications, to treat the calcine waste for disposal.  EM stated in a 2005 Federal Register notice that its preferred disposal  site for the solidified SBW is DOE\u2019s Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP),  the nation\u2019s repository for defense-related transuranic waste located near  Carlsbad, New Mexico. EM also stated in a 2002 environmental impact  statement that it plans to dispose of the calcine waste in a geologic  repository once the waste has been treated to meet standards for land  disposal.", "EM expended $571 million from December 2006 through April 2012 to  develop and construct the IWTU to treat the SBW, at which point the  agency declared construction complete and transitioned the management  of the IWTU from a capital asset project to an operations activity.  However, during system testing of the facility in June 2012, the IWTU  experienced a malfunction that damaged equipment and revealed  problems with the facility\u2019s design and inadequate oversight and  management systems, according to DOE and contractor reports. As a  result, as of June 2019, EM had not started IWTU operations to treat  waste as planned. The DOE Office of Inspector General in 2016 found  that significant lapses in DOE\u2019s project management contributed to  problems with the facility.", "Since 2012, EM has been attempting to prepare the IWTU to treat the  SBW to meet its commitments to the state of Idaho. In 2016, EM awarded  its multiyear contract for the Idaho Cleanup Project to Fluor Idaho, LLC.  As part of the contract, EM adopted a four-phased approach that Fluor  Idaho proposed called the IWTU Resolution of Technical Issues Project  (the IWTU reengineering project). The four phases are (1) identifying  problems, (2) implementing changes, (3) confirming fixes through testing,  and (4) conducting performance testing using a small amount of  radioactive waste. Under this approach, the cost and schedule of each  phase were to be determined based on the results of the previous phase,  according to EM officials with the Idaho Cleanup Project.", "From April 2012 through February 2019, EM expended $416 million  toward getting the facility to begin treating waste as planned. As of March  2019, the project was in phase two, and EM officials with the Idaho  Cleanup Project estimated that phase three may begin in summer 2019,  and phase four in early 2020. Through February 2019, construction and  operations expenditures for the IWTU have reached nearly $1 billion.  Further, because EM missed a deadline to initiate treatment of the SBW  in the IWTU and deadlines in the 1995 settlement agreement, DOE is  prohibited from shipping spent nuclear fuel to INL and is required to pay  the state of Idaho financial penalties that have reached $6,000 per day.  Through June 2019, DOE had accrued financial penalties of $6.2  million, and these penalties will continue to accrue until DOE initiates  waste treatment in the IWTU.", "We have previously reported that EM faces substantial future cleanup  costs and has decades of additional work remaining at contaminated  DOE sites, such as at INL. DOE\u2019s total environmental liability grew to  $494 billion in fiscal year 2018 and represents the largest share of the  federal government\u2019s environmental liability (86 percent). Because of  substantial and increasing estimated cleanup costs like this, we have  included the federal government\u2019s environmental liability on our list of  agencies and program areas that are at high risk of fraud, waste, abuse,  and mismanagement or that are most in need of transformation.  Further, we have also previously found problems with EM\u2019s management  of capital asset projects and operations activities. DOE\u2019s management  of projects and contracts has been on our high-risk list since 1990  because DOE\u2019s record of inadequate project management and oversight  of contractors has left the department vulnerable to fraud, waste, abuse,  and mismanagement. In our February 2019 high-risk report, we note that  while DOE has made some progress toward addressing its challenges  with contract and project management, EM needs to take action to  understand the root causes of its challenges and incorporate program  and project management best practices into its policies.", "You asked us to review EM\u2019s efforts to treat and dispose of the SBW and  calcine waste at INL. This report examines (1) the extent to which EM\u2019s  management of the IWTU reengineering project follows selected project  management best practices; (2) the challenges, if any, EM faces in the  disposal of the SBW; and (3) the challenges, if any, EM faces in the  treatment and disposal of the calcine waste.", "To address all three objectives, we visited INL in December 2017 to  obtain documentation and interview officials from EM, which exercises its  responsibility for the hazardous waste cleanup at INL through its Idaho  Cleanup Project. We also interviewed representatives at INL from Fluor  Idaho, LLC, EM\u2019s current contractor for the cleanup of both the SBW and  calcine waste at the site. Further, we visited Hazen Research, Inc., a  subcontractor to Fluor Idaho, to observe pilot testing facilities for the  IWTU reengineering project and discuss the status of the project with an  EM Idaho Cleanup Project official and representatives from Hazen  Research, Inc., and Fluor Idaho.", "To assess the extent to which EM\u2019s management of the IWTU  reengineering project follows selected project management best  practices, we selected project management best practices related to  developing project cost and schedule estimates and project monitoring,  such as through the use of an earned value management (EVM) system  and independent reviews. We selected these best practices because  they have been identified as being central to DOE\u2019s management of  projects from our previous work as well as included in the Project  Management Institute\u2019s A Guide to the Project Management Body of  Knowledge\u2014Sixth Edition. To assess the IWTU reengineering project\u2019s  cost estimate, we compared EM\u2019s estimates for phases one and two of  the reengineering project to best practices from GAO\u2019s Cost Estimating  and Assessment Guide (cost guide), focusing on the comprehensiveness  characteristic. To assess the IWTU reengineering project\u2019s schedule  estimate, we compared EM\u2019s March 2018 integrated master schedule for  the project to best practices from GAO\u2019s Schedule Assessment Guide  (schedule guide), focusing on the well-constructed and comprehensive  characteristics. To assess EM\u2019s monitoring of the project, we used our cost guide to assess data from EM\u2019s EVM system for the IWTU  reengineering project from March 2017 through February 2018, which  included phases one and two of the project. Lastly, to assess the extent  to which DOE has conducted independent reviews of the IWTU  reengineering project, we reviewed DOE\u2019s policy related to reviews of  projects with commissioning or start-up risks and documentation that  EM\u2019s Idaho Cleanup Project prepared for these reviews.", "To examine challenges EM faces in the disposal of the SBW, we  reviewed federal laws, regulations, and DOE\u2019s order and manual for  radioactive waste management. We also reviewed documentation  related to EM\u2019s plans for the disposal of the SBW, such as environmental  impact statements. We interviewed DOE officials from its Office of the  General Counsel, EM\u2019s Office of Regulatory Compliance, EM\u2019s Office of  Nuclear Materials, EM\u2019s Office of Waste and Materials Management, and  EM\u2019s Idaho Cleanup Project.

DOE primarily regulates  radioactive components of HLW under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as  amended, and the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, as amended.  These acts define HLW as (1) the highly radioactive waste material  resulting from the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel, including liquid  waste produced directly in reprocessing and any solid material derived  from such liquid waste that contains fission products in sufficient  concentrations, and (2) other highly radioactive material that the Nuclear  Regulatory Commission determines by rule, consistent with existing law,  requires permanent isolation. DOE considers calcine waste HLW  because it is solidified liquid waste produced during the reprocessing of  spent nuclear fuel. EM manages the SBW as mixed HLW because,  according to reports from DOE and National Academies,  (1) the SBW  was produced in the later stages of spent nuclear fuel reprocessing, (2)  the tanks in which the SBW is stored previously held HLW, (3) the SBW is  stored in a location at INL where waste is managed as HLW, and (4) the  waste contains hazardous chemicals subject to RCRA and EPA\u2019s  implementing regulations or authorized state programs that operate in lieu  of the federal program. HLW must be disposed of in a geologic repository  unless the Nuclear Regulatory Commission approves an alternative  disposal site.", "DOE Order 435.1 and Manual 435.1-1 describe the department\u2019s policy  and requirements for managing DOE\u2019s radioactive waste, including HLW,  to ensure that it is managed in a manner that is protective of worker and  public health and safety and the environment. Manual 435.1-1 also  established processes to determine whether waste resulting from  reprocessing spent nuclear fuel can be managed as transuranic waste or  low-level waste if certain criteria are met, which is referred to as a  determination that the waste is incidental to reprocessing. According to  the manual, HLW is waste incidental to reprocessing if, among other  things, the waste has been processed, or will be processed, to remove  key radionuclides to the maximum extent technically and economically  practicable.", "Hazardous components of mixed HLW are regulated by EPA or  authorized states under RCRA. EPA\u2019s regulations require hazardous  waste to meet certain treatment standards before land disposal of the  waste unless a variance is granted. The regulations specify that the  treatment standard (i.e., the required method for treatment) for Idaho\u2019s  mixed HLW is vitrification\u2014the immobilization of waste in glass. Where  EPA has authorized states to implement hazardous waste management  programs, those state programs operate instead of the federal program.  EPA, under RCRA, has authorized the state of Idaho to administer its  own hazardous waste management program.

According to our cost  guide, a comprehensive cost estimate should reflect the project\u2019s  technical requirements and current schedule and account for all  possible costs. While the cost estimate was based on documented  technical information, it was not based on a standardized work  breakdown structure. Without a standard, product-oriented work  breakdown structure to facilitate the tracking of resource allocations  and expenditures, EM may not be able to reliably estimate the cost of  future similar programs. While assumptions are listed in EM\u2019s  documents describing the cost estimates, no document discusses  whether the assumptions came from inputs from technical subject  matter experts or whether the assumptions are associated with  specific risks. Since assumptions are best guesses, best practices  state that the risk associated with any of these assumptions changing  need to be identified and assessed.", "Further, the IWTU reengineering project\u2019s cost estimate was not  complete because it did not account for all possible costs. According  to our cost guide, a life cycle cost estimate provides an exhaustive  and structured accounting of all resources and associated cost  elements required to develop, produce, deploy, and sustain a  particular program. The project\u2019s cost estimate did not reflect all life  cycle costs, in part because estimates for phases three and four of the  project had not been developed at the time of our review. Best  practices state that all costs be included in an estimate, even in early  stages, such as at a rough order of magnitude. EM officials from the  Idaho Cleanup Project said that a cost estimate was not developed for  the total cost of the IWTU reengineering project because of the  approach for negotiating the cost and schedule baseline prior to the  start of each phase.

According to our  schedule guide, a well-constructed schedule includes activities that  are logically sequenced; a valid critical path; and a reasonable  amount of total float, meaning an accurate reflection of the schedule\u2019s  flexibility. EM\u2019s March 2018 schedule had minimal sequencing  issues and a continuous critical path, with the exception of an external  dependency, and the critical path was free of lags and constraints.  However, there were long duration activities on the critical path that  should be reevaluated to determine if they can be broken into more  manageable pieces. Without a valid critical path, management cannot  focus on activities that will detrimentally affect the key program  milestones and deliveries if they slip. Additionally, the schedule  estimate included unreasonably large values of positive and negative  float. According to best practices, a schedule should identify  reasonable values of float so that the schedule\u2019s flexibility can be  determined to help accommodate for delays. EM officials from the  Idaho Cleanup Project explained that the amount of total float was a  result of the methods they used to structure the logic of the schedule  estimate, which according to our best practices may have caused the  schedule to be overly optimistic. According to scheduling best  practices, without accurate values of total float, the schedule cannot  be used to identify activities that could be permitted to slip and thus  release and reallocate resources to activities that require more  resources to be completed on time. Inaccurate values of total float  also falsely depict true program status, which could lead to decisions  that may jeopardize the program. In addition, the March 2018  schedule contained 14 activities with large amounts of negative float,  meaning that these activities were behind schedule.

For example, the schedule had activities that  were described as level of effort but were not assigned the level of  effort activity type. Level of effort activities represent effort that has no  measurable output and, according to best practices, should be clearly  marked so they do not interfere with the critical path.

In addition,  EM officials from the Idaho Cleanup Project acknowledged that a  schedule for waste treatment operations at the project has not been  developed. Further, these officials noted that design modifications to the  IWTU are expected to reduce its operating capability, lengthening the  time needed to treat the SBW. As a result, EM and Fluor Idaho plan to  renegotiate the cost of their contract related to the treatment of the waste  in the project, according to EM Idaho Cleanup Project officials.  Specifically, because of the modifications to the project, the rate at which  the SBW is treated will be slower than initially estimated, according to EM  officials from the Idaho Cleanup Project. Treatment of all 900,000 gallons  of the SBW was originally estimated to be completed in 10 months, but  agency officials now estimate that treatment may take from 3 to 7 years\u2014 as much as eight times longer than originally planned.

EM identified WIPP as its preferred disposal site for the SBW in a 2005  Record of Decision document, but in March 2019 EM officials told us  that a final decision on the disposal path for the SBW had not been made.  The three main challenges EM faces in its plan to dispose of the SBW at  its preferred disposal site are: (1) the permit for WIPP prohibits the SBW  from being disposed of at WIPP, (2) federal law prohibits HLW from being  disposed of at WIPP, and (3) there are existing capacity limitations to  disposal at the WIPP facility. EM has taken some steps to address these  challenges, as discussed further below.", "WIPP permit\u2019s prohibition of the disposal of certain tank waste. New  Mexico amended its permit for WIPP in 2004 to prohibit waste that has  ever been managed as HLW, including the SBW at INL, from being  disposed at WIPP unless the disposal of such waste is specifically  approved through a permit modification. In 2013, DOE and its contractor  responsible for operating and managing the facility filed a request with the  state of New Mexico to modify the WIPP permit to remove this prohibition,  which could allow the SBW to be disposed of at WIPP if EM determined  that the SBW is waste incidental to reprocessing. However, the process  was put on hold following the suspension of operations at WIPP in 2014,  according to officials from DOE\u2019s Carlsbad Field Office and New Mexico\u2019s  Environment Department. In April 2019, officials from New Mexico\u2019s  Environment Department said that they anticipated holding discussions  with DOE and its contractor for the facility regarding the prohibition after  the renewal of the WIPP permit in July 2020. However, a representative  from a New Mexico environmental organization said that this proposed  modification would likely face strong public opposition. This  representative noted that previous DOE attempts to expand the types of  waste that could be disposed of at WIPP caused significant public concern in New Mexico. Further, New Mexico Environment Department  officials told us that processing permit modifications of this nature would  likely require public hearings and opportunities for input and may take as  long as 2 years or more to complete.", "Federal statutory prohibition on HLW disposal at WIPP. The Waste  Isolation Pilot Plant Land Withdrawal Act prohibits disposal of HLW at  WIPP. Therefore, to enable EM to dispose of the SBW at WIPP, the  SBW would need to be classified as non-HLW, or the act would need to  be amended to remove the prohibition. DOE has a process for  determining that certain waste resulting from reprocessing spent nuclear  fuel, such as the SBW and calcine waste, could be managed as either  transuranic waste or low-level waste, which are not HLW. Under DOE  Order 435.1 and Manual 435.1-1, DOE may determine that waste is  incidental to reprocessing and therefore manage the waste as transuranic  waste or low-level waste if it meets certain criteria. EM began  developing documentation supporting a waste incidental to reprocessing  determination for the SBW in 2001. For example, in September 2001, EM  requested consultation from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which  oversees the nuclear power industry, on a draft waste incidental to  reprocessing determination so that the SBW could be managed as  transuranic waste and disposed of at WIPP rather than in an HLW  repository.", "DOE\u2019s Authority to Determine That Certain  Waste Is Not HLW  In 2002, while litigation over the Department  of Energy\u2019s (DOE) authority to use DOE Order  435.1 and Manual 435.1-1 was pending, DOE  sought enactment of legislation clarifying its  authority to manage portions of tank waste  that have low levels of radioactivity as low- level waste. In response, Congress enacted  section 3116 of the Ronald W. Reagan  National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal  Year 2005 in October 2004. Under section  3116, radioactive waste resulting from the  reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel is not high- level waste (HLW) if the Secretary of Energy,  in consultation with the Nuclear Regulatory  Commission, determines that it meets  specified conditions. These conditions include  that the waste does not require disposal in a  deep geologic repository and has had highly  radioactive radionuclides removed to the  maximum extent practical. However, section  3116 only applies to waste stored at DOE  sites in Idaho and South Carolina that is not  transported from those states. Therefore,  DOE cannot use section 3116 to classify the  sodium-bearing waste (SBW) as transuranic  waste for disposal as DOE\u2019s agreements with  Idaho require the SBW to be removed from  the state.", "However, DOE\u2019s authority to use Order 435.1 and Manual 435.1-1 to  classify the SBW and other waste from reprocessing as non-HLW was  challenged in a federal lawsuit in 2001, resulting in EM suspending its  development of the waste incidental to reprocessing determination.  Following the dismissal of the lawsuit on procedural grounds, EM  restarted the internal process for developing the waste incidental to  reprocessing determination for the SBW, according to EM officials and  documents. For example, EM identified the waste incidental to  reprocessing determination for the SBW as a priority item for executive  decision-making in a 2017 EM study on mission operations. Internal  discussions about this determination continued between EM and DOE  into 2018, but the waste incidental to reprocessing determination was not  finalized, according to EM officials.", "In October 2018, EM published a notice in the Federal Register seeking  public comment on its proposed interpretation of the statutory definition of  HLW, which EM officials said could help the agency make a decision  about the classification of the SBW. EM also published a supplemental  notice in June 2019 to modify the interpretation and provide additional  information to the public, such as on the role of the Nuclear Regulatory  Commission and states. Table 1 presents the statutory definition, the  proposed interpretation from the October 2018 Federal Register notice,  and the modified interpretation from the June 2019 Federal Register  notice. EM officials told us that under the new interpretation, waste  would be disposed of in accordance with its characteristics (which  determines risk) instead of solely based on the source of the waste  (which does not determine risk).", "Stakeholders, including members of the public, state and local  governments, tribes, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, expressed  a range of perspectives about EM\u2019s proposed interpretation in public  comments. For example, some stakeholders submitted comments  expressing concern about the Nuclear Regulatory Commission being  excluded from the determination of what is HLW under the interpretation.  These comments also stated that the interpretation is contrary to federal  law and that the interpretation will elicit legal challenges. Other  stakeholders expressed support for the interpretation in comments  submitted to EM stating, for example, that the proposed interpretation  could accelerate the cleanup of tank waste at DOE sites and result in cost  savings.", "According to an EM document, potential benefits of the interpretation, if  implemented, include a more risk-based approach to waste classification,  which could provide a more cost-effective and timely approach to DOE\u2019s  cleanup mission. However, EM officials stated that it was premature to  discuss the administrative actions, such as revising orders or regulations  that would be required to implement the new interpretation. The June  2019 Federal Register notice states that DOE will consider what actions  may be needed and appropriate to update applicable DOE directives,  such as Order 435.1 and Manual 435.1-1, in light of this interpretation and  address any revisions in future actions. EM officials also told us that they  did not have a timeline for implementing the new interpretation. Further,  EM officials stated that if the HLW interpretation is implemented,  alternative disposal options could also be considered for the SBW, but  they declined to specify what those options could be.", "Limitations on disposal at WIPP. Further, existing limitations in the  disposal space at WIPP could affect the disposal of the SBW at the  facility. We reported in September 2017 that DOE does not currently have  sufficient disposal space at WIPP for the waste identified in its 2016  annual inventory report\u2014a document that tracks waste intended to be  disposed of at the facility. Specifically, DOE will need to expand the  repository to accommodate this waste as well as other potential waste,  such as the SBW, for which DOE has yet to determine if it meets all of  WIPP\u2019s waste acceptance criteria. In March 2019, DOE officials stated  that WIPP could be expanded within the current Waste Isolation Pilot  Plant Land Withdrawal Act boundary for the site to accommodate the  current planned waste and additional waste inventories. Specifically,  DOE officials said that mining for a new disposal panel and design work  for additional disposal panels was under way, and mining of the additional  panel was scheduled to commence in 2021. Further, in September 2017  we also reported that additional potential waste beyond what is captured  in the inventory could exceed WIPP\u2019s statutory capacity. However, in  December 2018, New Mexico\u2019s Environment Department approved a  modification to the WIPP permit\u2014which was requested by DOE and its  contractor that operates and manages WIPP\u2014that will change the way  waste volume is calculated to exclude empty space inside waste packing.  According to DOE officials, this means that additional waste can be  disposed of at WIPP under the existing statutory limit. Further, DOE  officials stated that the revised counting methodology will reduce an  overstatement in the volume of record for emplaced waste by about 30  percent. However, in January 2019 three environmental organizations  filed lawsuits challenging the modification, which the court consolidated  and, in May 2019, stayed pending mediation.", "EM officials said that if the office is not able to dispose of the SBW at  WIPP, its plan is to dispose of the SBW\u2014once it is treated to a solid form  in the IWTU\u2014with the calcine waste in an HLW geologic repository.  However, there is still no HLW disposal site in the United States. In 2008,  DOE submitted a license application to the Nuclear Regulatory  Commission for an HLW repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada, about  100 miles northwest of Las Vegas. In 2010, however, DOE terminated its  efforts to obtain a license for the Yucca Mountain repository.", "Under the 1995 settlement agreement with the state of Idaho, DOE is  required to treat the SBW so that it is ready for disposal outside of the  state by a target date of 2035.

According to standards for internal control, federal agency management  should identify, analyze, and respond to risks related to achieving a  defined objective. Until it develops such a strategy, including a timeline,  to implement the actions required to achieve its preferred disposal  pathway, or an alternative, for the SBW, EM will not have reasonable  assurance that it can achieve its preferred plan for disposal or begin  identifying an alternative.

In December 2009  EM identified hot isostatic pressing as its preferred treatment technology  for preparing the calcine waste for land disposal outside of Idaho. Hot  isostatic pressing is a manufacturing process that applies elevated  temperatures and pressurized gas to materials in a containment vessel,  resulting in a ceramic waste form. EM officials from the Idaho Cleanup  Project told us that while hot isostatic pressing is a technology used in  other industries, such as in industrial manufacturing, it has not been used  before to treat HLW. Further, hot isostatic pressing would require a  variance or an EPA regulation establishing a new treatment standard  prior to land disposal. According to EM Idaho Cleanup Project officials  and agency documents, EM selected hot isostatic pressing as the  treatment technology because EM\u2019s analyses assumed it would result in  significant cost savings for disposal at Yucca Mountain compared to other  methods.", "In February 2011, an independent DOE review team issued a preliminary  technology readiness assessment for using hot isostatic pressing for  calcine waste treatment as part of DOE\u2019s process for managing capital  asset projects. The review team identified several concerns, such as  whether components of the technology would be mature enough to meet  EM\u2019s planned milestones and challenges with EM\u2019s decision to retrofit  and reuse the IWTU for the calcine waste treatment mission. EM officials  from the Idaho Cleanup Project said that the decision to retrofit and reuse  the IWTU for the calcine waste after treating the SBW resulted from  reluctance within DOE to build another \u201cfirst-of-a-kind\u201d treatment facility.  However, the review team\u2019s report stated that the decision to retrofit the  facility may result in logistical and physical maintenance challenges  because of space limitations and height requirements.", "Based on the results of an independent analysis of alternatives for calcine  waste disposition, published in April 2016, EM decided to suspend  developing the hot isostatic pressing technology, according to EM officials  from the Idaho Cleanup Project. DOE initiated this analysis of  alternatives in response to a new requirement from the Secretary of  Energy and because hot isostatic pressing is not a mature technology for  HLW, according to EM\u2019s summary report for the analysis. The report  identified uncertainties and challenges with the use of hot isostatic  pressing when compared to other potential treatment options given,  including that hot isostatic pressing is significantly different than vitrification and  would require the development and acceptance of testing protocols to  validate that it produces a robust waste form, hot isostatic pressing had the second greatest estimated cost (more  than $2 billion) of the options assessed in the analysis of alternatives, hot isostatic pressing represented the highest operational safety risk  of all of the options assessed given its use of high pressures and  temperatures, and other treatment options may perform better for managing the waste  because of significant advances in technology since the selection of  hot isostatic pressing in 2009.", "The independent team performing this analysis also concluded that  uncertainties regarding plans for an HLW geologic repository also affect  EM\u2019s ability to move forward with selecting a treatment technology.  According to EM officials from the Idaho Cleanup Project and documents,  EM\u2019s selection of hot isostatic pressing was based on assumptions  developed based on sending the waste to the Yucca Mountain disposal  facility. Specifically, an important factor in the selection of hot isostatic  pressing as the treatment technology was its ability to provide the lowest  volume of final waste, while producing a robust waste form, which would  reduce disposal costs at Yucca Mountain. As previously noted, the  licensing for developing the Yucca Mountain facility was terminated in  2010. The team performing the analysis of alternatives concluded that  because selecting an appropriate treatment technology greatly depends  on the calcine waste\u2019s disposal path and associated waste form  performance requirements, EM should defer making a final decision on  the treatment technology until the performance objectives of the disposal  path are better defined."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "EM Is Focusing on Interim Activities for Calcine Waste Treatment and Disposal but Does Not Have a Strategy, Including a Timeline, for Addressing Challenges", "paragraphs": ["While further decisions regarding a treatment technology for the calcine  waste are suspended, EM officials from the Idaho Cleanup Project said  that they are taking steps to demonstrate to regulators from Idaho\u2019s  Department of Environmental Quality that they are making progress to  prepare the calcine waste for disposal outside the state.

EPA  officials told us that if EM wanted to proceed with plans for the direct  disposal of the calcine waste in a geologic repository, EM would need,  among other things, to seek a no-migration variance from EPA. A  petition for a no-migration variance must demonstrate, to a  reasonable degree of certainty, that the hazardous components would  not leak or escape once the HLW is buried underground for as long as  the waste remains hazardous. EPA officials added that there is a very  high bar for such variances; only one such request has been  approved since 1984, and it was later rescinded. In February 2019, an  EM Idaho Cleanup Project official told us that EM has met with  officials from the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality and EPA  to receive their preliminary input on this approach.", "EM Idaho Cleanup Project officials said that they are focusing in the  near term on developing and testing a system to retrieve the calcine  waste from its storage vessels, called bin sets. According to EM  documents, retrieval of the calcine waste from the bin sets is a  precursor to treating or packaging the waste for disposal, and there  are several challenges to address in developing an effective retrieval  system. As a result, EM directed its contractor to conduct a project  to retrieve calcine waste from the oldest bin set and move it to a  partially empty bin set under EM\u2019s contract for hazardous waste  cleanup at INL. The project serves to both test different forms of  technologies and also to cease use of the older bin set, which does  not have the same structural integrity as the other bin set because of  its design, according to EM officials from the Idaho Cleanup Project  and documents.

However, EM has no strategy or timeline for  making any changes to DOE policies and regulations that may be  required to implement its new interpretation or for making decisions  regarding disposing of the SBW. Until it develops such a strategy,  including a timeline, to implement the actions required to achieve its  preferred disposal pathway, or an alternative, for the SBW, EM will not  have reasonable assurance that it can achieve its preferred plan for  disposal or begin the process of identifying an alternative. Further, if EM  implements its new interpretation of HLW and uses this definition to  classify the SBW as non-HLW, there is significant risk for extended  litigation, which may delay EM\u2019s plans to dispose of the SBW at its  preferred disposal site.", "Moreover, EM faces challenges in completing treatment of the calcine  waste by a target date of December 31, 2035, in light of its decision to  suspend development of the selected treatment technology, hot isostatic  pressing, and the absence of an HLW geologic repository. Even though  EM is studying alternatives to using hot isostatic pressing to prepare the  calcine waste for disposal, it has not developed a strategy or a timeline  for determining its plans for treating this waste for disposal. Without  developing such a strategy, including a timeline, for the treatment and  disposal of the calcine waste to ensure that EM meets the milestone for  completing the treatment of the waste by December 31, 2035, EM does  not have reasonable assurance that it can meet its milestones."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making five recommendations to DOE:", "The Secretary of Energy should direct the Assistant Secretary of EM  to develop cost estimates for the IWTU reengineering project and the  SBW treatment operations that meet best practices for being  comprehensive (e.g., account for all costs).

Regarding the cost estimate, DOE committed to  developing cost estimates that meet best practices and stated that cost  estimates for phases three and four of the IWTU reengineering project  have been developed and reviewed by the Defense Contract Audit  Agency. For the schedule estimate, DOE stated that the schedules for  phases three and four have been developed and that the inclusion of  these phases in the schedule is in accordance with best practices for the  well-constructed characteristic. With regard to the EVM system, DOE  stated that cost and performance data will be included in the EVM system  in accordance with EVM best practices once contract negotiations are  completed, which the agency estimated would conclude by December 31,  2019.", "DOE also agreed with our recommendations to develop a strategy,  including a timeline, for the disposal of the SBW and calcine waste. DOE  further stated that EM is in the process of developing a site options  analysis for INL and other EM sites to identify opportunities to complete  cleanup work through more efficient and innovative approaches over the  next decade. This analysis is expected to be completed in fiscal year  2020, according to DOE. DOE stated that EM\u2019s HLW interpretation issued  in June 2019 could potentially open new disposal pathways for some  reprocessing waste, such as SBW and calcine, while noting that  decisions about whether and how this interpretation will apply to existing  wastes have yet to be made.", "In its written comments, DOE disagreed with our recommendation to seek  clarification from Congress on DOE\u2019s authority to classify the SBW as  other than HLW if such clarification is necessary to avoid extended  litigation. DOE stated the agency does not require additional clarification  from Congress to classify reprocessing waste as other than HLW. We are  deleting our recommendation but continue to believe that there is  significant risk for extended litigation if EM implements its new  interpretation of HLW and uses this definition to classify the SBW as non- HLW.

To address  these three objectives, we conducted a site visit to DOE\u2019s Idaho National  Laboratory (INL) in December 2017. During the site visit, we obtained  documentation and interviewed officials from EM, which is responsible for  hazardous waste cleanup at INL through its Idaho Cleanup Project. We  also interviewed representatives from Fluor Idaho, LLC, which is the  private contractor that manages hazardous waste cleanup at INL for EM,  including the cleanup of the SBW and calcine waste. In addition, we  conducted a site visit to Hazen Research, Inc., a subcontractor to Fluor  Idaho, to observe pilot testing facilities for the IWTU reengineering project  and discuss the status of the project with an EM official from the Idaho  Cleanup Project and representatives from Hazen Research, Inc., and  Fluor Idaho.", "To assess the extent to which EM\u2019s management of the IWTU  reengineering project meets selected project management best practices,  we first identified areas deemed to be important to project management  based on our previous work on DOE projects and leading practices from  the Project Management Institute, which are generally recognized as  leading practices for project management. Specifically, we reviewed the  project management leading practices identified in the Project  Management Institute\u2019s A Guide to the Project Management Body of  Knowledge\u2014Sixth Edition. From this review, we selected project  management practices related to developing cost and schedule estimates  and conducting project monitoring through the use of earned value  management (EVM) and independent reviews. We then conducted  assessments of these best practices, as discussed below.", "Cost. To determine the extent to which the cost estimate for the IWTU  reengineering project is reliable, we conducted an abridged analysis of  the IWTU reengineering project\u2019s cost estimate, focusing on its  comprehensiveness. Typically, in analyzing a cost estimate against best  practices in GAO\u2019s Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide (cost guide),  we examine four characteristics, each defined by multiple criteria:  credible.", "For this review, we assessed the cost estimate for the IWTU  reengineering project against the comprehensive characteristic, in part  because EM officials told us that they had yet to develop a cost estimate  for the program beyond phases one and two at the time of our review.  Specifically, we reviewed the cost estimate for the operation of the IWTU  and the IWTU reengineering project, which, at the time of our review, was  only developed for phases one and two of the project. If a cost estimate is  not comprehensive (that is, complete), then it cannot fully meet the well- documented, accurate, or credible best practice characteristics. For  instance, if the cost estimate is missing some cost elements, then the  documentation will be incomplete, the estimate will be inaccurate, and the  result will not be credible because of the potential underestimating of  costs and the absence of a full risk and uncertainty analysis. See  appendix II for a summary assessment of the IWTU reengineering  project\u2019s cost estimate compared to selected best practices.", "Schedule. To assess EM\u2019s schedule for the IWTU reengineering project,  we conducted an abridged analysis of the IWTU reengineering project\u2019s  schedule, focusing on comprehensiveness and the degree to which it is  well-constructed. Typically, in analyzing a schedule estimate against best  practices in GAO\u2019s Schedule Assessment Guide (schedule guide), we  examine four characteristics, each defined by multiple criteria:  controlled.", "For this review, we assessed the IWTU reengineering project schedule  that EM provided in March 2018 against the well-constructed  characteristic, in part because EM officials told us that they had yet to  develop a schedule estimate for the totality of the reengineering project  because of Fluor Idaho\u2019s phased approach. If a schedule estimate is not  well-constructed, it will not be able to properly calculate dates and predict  changes in the future. When activities are missing logic links, the  schedule will not be able to automatically transmit these delays to future  activities that depend on them. When this happens, the schedule will not  allow a sufficient understanding of the program as a whole, and users of  the schedule will not have confidence in the dates and the critical path. In  addition, we evaluated the comprehensive characteristic because it  contributed to our analysis of EM\u2019s EVM system, as described below. See  appendix II for a summary assessment of the IWTU reengineering  project\u2019s schedule estimate compared to selected best practices.", "EVM. In addition, we analyzed EM\u2019s use of EVM as a way to assess its  monitoring of the IWTU reengineering project\u2019s cost and schedule. EVM  measures the value of work accomplished in a given period and  compares it with the planned value of work scheduled for the period and  with the actual cost of the work accomplished. It is an industry standard  and is considered a best practice for conducting cost and schedule  performance analysis for projects. Our EVM analysis focused on Fluor  Idaho\u2019s EVM data for the IWTU reengineering project contained in cost  performance reports from March 2017 to February 2018 and the project  schedule that EM provided in March 2018. Specifically, we compared this  project documentation with EVM best practices as identified in our cost  guide. Our research has identified a number of best practices that are  the basis of effective EVM and should result in reliable and valid data that  can be used for making informed decisions. These best practices have  been collapsed into three high-level characteristics of a reliable EVM  system, which are establish a comprehensive EVM system, ensure that the data resulting from the EVM system are reliable, and ensure that the program management team is using EVM data for  decision-making purposes.", "See appendix III for our summary assessment of the IWTU reengineering  project\u2019s EVM data compared to best practices. EVM data are considered  reliable if the overall assessment ratings for each of the three  characteristics are substantially or fully met. If any of the characteristics  are not met, minimally met, or partially met, then the EVM data cannot be  considered reliable.", "Independent reviews. To assess the extent to which DOE has  conducted independent reviews of the IWTU reengineering project, we  examined DOE and EM policies to identify requirements for conducting  reviews of operations activities. Specifically, we reviewed a 2016 DOE  memorandum that established that DOE\u2019s Project Management Risk  Committee (PMRC) would provide independent review of selected  projects in the operational release phase, the PMRC\u2019s standard operating  procedures, and EM\u2019s guidance for projects in the operational release  milestone. We examined documentation from the PMRC\u2019s reviews of the  IWTU reengineering project, including documentation that EM officials  from the Idaho Cleanup Project prepared for these reviews and  recommendations that the PMRC made to EM for the project. In addition,  we spoke with officials from DOE\u2019s Office of Project Management, which  serves as the secretariat of the PMRC; EM\u2019s Office of Acquisition &  Project Management; and EM\u2019s Idaho Cleanup Project about independent  reviews of projects in the operational release phase.", "To examine challenges EM faces in the disposal of the SBW, we  reviewed federal laws, regulations, and DOE policies on radioactive  waste management, including those described in DOE Order 435.1 on  radioactive waste management and its implementation manual. In  addition, we examined EM\u2019s October 2018 and June 2019 Federal  Register notices, which provide DOE\u2019s new interpretation of the statutory  definition of high-level radioactive waste (HLW). We also reviewed  documentation related to EM\u2019s plans for disposing of the SBW at DOE\u2019s  Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) in New Mexico, such as Record of  Decision documents for proposed actions that require development of  environmental impact statements, and the hazardous waste facility permit  for WIPP that the New Mexico Environment Department issued.
