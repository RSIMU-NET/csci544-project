However, FAA efforts to track related costs may result in incomplete information. FAA established a means of tracking the costs associated with some UAS-activities in certain offices, but many, if not all, FAA offices are doing work related to both manned aviation and UAS. FAA officials stated that they do not know or plan to assess the extent to which staff who split their time between UAS-activities and other responsibilities are tracking those costs. Furthermore, FAA's future costs to conduct oversight and provide air navigation services are largely unknown due to the changing nature of the industry and its early stage of development. Ensuring that information on UAS-related costs is complete and reliable now could put FAA in a better position to identify those costs as they evolve and possibly expand in the future.", "The extent to which FAA should recover costs for its UAS-related activities, and what fees are appropriate, are policy decisions for the administration and Congress. Accordingly, this report does not recommend any specific fee mechanism. Nonetheless, planning and consideration of policy goals, using available guidance on user fee design, could better position FAA to inform future decision-making on these issues as it proceeds with UAS integration. Since 2015, FAA has collected a registration fee from UAS operators, but most of FAA's UAS costs are not related to registration or covered by this fee. A stakeholder group established by FAA identified potential fee mechanisms and concluded in 2018 that the aviation industry, FAA, and Congress should identify revenue streams to help fund FAA's UAS activities. Further, GAO guidance and Office of Management and Budget instructions provide a framework, including information requirements, for designing effective user fees. FAA officials said that they have not considered user fee mechanisms as part of their planning because they have been awaiting this report to inform their decision-making. By using available guidance as part of its planning, FAA could incorporate steps, such as identifying costs and beneficiaries, which would benefit future fee design considerations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is recommending that FAA (1) implement a process to ensure UAS-related cost information is complete and (2) use available guidance on effective fee design to incorporate steps, as part of UAS integration planning, that will inform future fee design considerations.

As the UAS sector grows, so could demands on FAA\u2019s  staffing and other resources required to develop, oversee, and implement  the rules and systems needed for safe integration, such as air navigation  services to manage UAS traffic. There is concern from aviation industry  groups, however, that current funding levels for UAS integration efforts  could (1) impede the swift integration of UAS into the national airspace  and (2) erode resources available for FAA\u2019s activities related to manned  aviation. FAA\u2019s operations are funded, in large part, by the Airport and  Airway Trust Fund, which receives revenues from taxes and fees on  airline tickets, aviation fuel, and cargo shipments paid by manned aircraft users.

For  example, some suppliers provide LAANC services to UAS operators  among the general public, while others process applications for  airspace access only for certain UAS operators. Prior to operating in  controlled airspace near airports, UAS operators use these  applications or portals to apply for airspace authorizations. These  requests are checked against the data provided through the UAS data  exchange, and if approved, UAS operators receive authorization to fly  in the area\u2014within minutes, in some cases.

FAA  established a pilot program in 2017 to develop and demonstrate early  versions of UAS traffic management operations.

According to FAA officials, the codes are used to identify travel,  procurement, time and attendance, and costs related to special events,  among other UAS-related activities. The effort was intended to address  the administration\u2019s and Congress\u2019 interest in greater cost visibility.  According to FAA officials, the project codes to track UAS costs have  been implemented in the Office of Aviation Safety\u2014including the UAS  Integration Office, Flight Standards Service, and Office of Rulemaking\u2014 and staff within the Air Traffic Organization (not including air traffic  controllers).

However, with no way to  assess the extent to which the project codes have been implemented,  FAA is unable to tell whether it has met the intent of using the codes:  greater visibility into UAS-related costs. For instance, FAA does not  currently have visibility via the project codes into time spent on UAS  activities outside of the Office of Aviation Safety and the Air Traffic  Organization.", "According to OMB instructions to agencies on financial-reporting  requirements and standards for federal financial accounting, agencies  should report the full cost of each program\u2014to include both direct and  indirect costs and the costs of identifiable supporting services provided by  other offices within the agency.

With no assurance that the project codes  are resulting in information that is complete, FAA risks making decisions  based on information that is unreliable for the purpose of understanding  the full costs of its UAS activities. Efforts to track costs need not be overly  complex: federal financial-accounting standards note that agencies  should consider the precision desired and needed in cost information and  the practicality of data collection and processing, among other  considerations, when designing cost-accounting processes. For example,  FAA could build on its existing project codes for UAS-related activities by  monitoring the extent to which the project codes have been used agency- wide. Alternatively, FAA may identify other methods of accounting for  UAS-related costs, if there are some costs not easily tracked using the  project codes.

According to FAA and stakeholders  we spoke to, in addition to costs to continue regulatory activities and  safety oversight, FAA\u2019s future costs will depend on the extent of FAA\u2019s  involvement in the everyday operation and oversight of systems, such as  those related to UAS traffic management, and the extent to which FAA  becomes a provider of UAS-related services. Examples of how FAA\u2019s  costs could evolve and possibly expand in each of these areas include:", "Regulatory development costs: Current costs for activities such as  the development of new UAS regulations by the UAS Integration  Office could change as UAS become more integrated into the national  airspace. As previously discussed, the industry is changing rapidly  and new uses for UAS are being developed, uses that will require  additional FAA regulation and oversight. FAA cannot know the extent  to which additional rulemaking activities will be required for UAS  technologies and uses that the industry has not yet contemplated or  developed. Costs to develop regulations involve input from offices  across FAA, such as the Office of the Chief Counsel, where FAA  officials are unsure if staff are consistently using the project codes to  track their costs for UAS-related activities. As such, FAA may not  have visibility into the extent to which these UAS-related costs may  change over time.", "Safety oversight costs: As part of its safety mandate, FAA is  responsible for enforcing compliance with established regulations for  both manned aircraft and UAS. Several offices within FAA have a role  in UAS compliance and enforcement, including the Flight Standards  Service and the Office of Security and Hazardous Materials Safety. As  we have recently reported, while FAA has sole responsibility for  enforcement of UAS regulations, the agency has focused on engaging  and educating law enforcement and public safety agencies at all  levels\u2014federal, state, and local\u2014and, to a lesser extent, conducting  surveillance to ensure compliance with UAS regulations. While local  law enforcement agencies may often be in the best position to deter  or respond to UAS incidents, they may not have information on how to  respond or what information to share with FAA. According to FAA  officials, the Office of Security and Hazardous Materials Safety is one  of the offices in which FAA officials do not know if staff are tracking  their activities and costs related to UAS through use of the project  codes discussed above. Given the uncertainty about the division of  responsibilities between federal, state, and local law enforcement, it is  unclear how costs for safety oversight and enforcement will evolve  and possibly expand in the future.", "Provision and oversight of UAS services and facilities: FAA will  eventually incur costs related to providing air navigation and other  services to UAS operators, oversight of UAS service providers, and  potential infrastructure, but the extent of FAA\u2019s eventual role in the  provision of these services and related oversight is not yet  understood, in part, because the industry is still evolving and it is  unclear what FAA services will be provided in the future. Some  stakeholders believe that an increased industry role in providing air  navigation services could keep FAA\u2019s costs for these activities  relatively low. For example, the UAS Traffic Management Concept of  Operations envisions that leveraging private entities to provide a  variety of UAS traffic management services will reduce the  infrastructure and manpower burden on FAA and, thus, reduce  associated costs.", "FAA envisions that the Flight Information Management System\u2014a  system through which FAA can provide directives and enable  information exchange between UAS service suppliers, UAS operators,  and FAA\u2014is the component of the UAS traffic management system  that FAA will build and manage. FAA has not yet estimated the costs  of developing or implementing this system because, according to FAA  officials, the agency is still many steps away from developing the core  infrastructure and regulatory requirements. As UAS integration  progresses and as more UAS are operating in the same airspace as  manned aircraft, additional solutions may be needed to manage UAS  traffic at higher altitudes, which will also incur costs. For instance,  FAA anticipates that air traffic controllers will have a role in de- conflicting manned aircraft and unmanned aircraft and could provide  air-traffic-control services to UAS in controlled airspace. FAA officials  stated it will be necessary to collect data on the direct and indirect  costs of UAS for air-traffic-control services in the future. According to  FAA, a new air-traffic-control-cost-allocation study is underway, but  FAA does not currently have the information on UAS operations that  would be necessary to assign air traffic control costs to UAS users.", "Beyond system development, once traffic management systems are  designed and operational, FAA will incur costs related to its role in  overseeing providers of UAS traffic management services as well as  operating and maintaining the Flight Information Management  System. FAA currently provides UAS operators with services related  to registration, aircraft certification, and waivers for operation that fall  outside existing regulations, but those services may change  depending on future rulemaking. When it becomes clearer what  services FAA will likely provide and how it will provide those services,  FAA will be better positioned to estimate its costs to inform its budget  requests and plan for the future, as it has done for systems that have  already been implemented. For example, FAA has estimated future  costs associated with the LAANC program, which was implemented in  2018. FAA anticipates obligating approximately $35.64 million from  the facilities and equipment account and $26.6 million from the  operations account to further develop and operate the LAANC system  from fiscal years 2019 through 2023, as shown in table 3.", "Indirect Costs: In addition to direct costs related to rulemaking,  oversight, and provision of services, FAA will continue to incur indirect  costs such as those associated with the operation and maintenance of  FAA facilities and systems. FAA officials said they do not plan to  conduct analysis through which they could allocate indirect costs for  UAS, because FAA\u2019s appropriations and funding structure do not  require them to track costs in this way. However, as previously  discussed, OMB instructions to agencies on financial-reporting  requirements state that agencies should report the full cost of each  program including indirect costs.", "As discussed, FAA\u2019s efforts to track costs related to UAS activities may  result in incomplete data, and as the UAS industry evolves and becomes  more integrated, tracking costs may become even more complex.  Generally, FAA officials stated that differentiating between costs related  to UAS and manned aviation will not be necessary as UAS become  further integrated into the national airspace and FAA\u2019s mission because  the agency does not track costs in this way for any other mission areas.  However, as discussed later in this report, there is widespread consensus  among manned and unmanned aviation industry stakeholders that UAS  costs should be borne by the UAS industry rather than the manned  aviation industry, and policy makers may opt to recover these costs  through user fees or some other mechanism in the future.

The Task Group also identified five  different fee mechanisms through which FAA could recover some of the  costs of its activities from UAS users, a topic we discuss in this section.", "The extent to which costs are recovered from UAS users and the  methods by which costs are recovered are policy decisions for the  administration and Congress. Since 2015, FAA has used one fee  mechanism\u2014a $5 registration fee, the same as the fee to register a  manned aircraft\u2014to recover some of the costs associated with  administering the UAS registration requirement. Most of FAA\u2019s UAS- related costs are in areas unrelated to UAS registration.

It is important to note  that given the tradeoffs involved in establishing user fees, different users  and stakeholders may have varying perspectives and opinions on what  would be an appropriate fee structure. As these are policy decisions, this  report does not recommend any specific fee mechanism. Instead, the  considerations and examples we present are intended to inform decision- making by laying out issues to take into account when designing user  fees. As discussed in our User Fee Design Guide, determining how UAS  user fees should be set and collected involves a number of steps.

As  previously discussed, while the costs of some current regulatory and  operational activities related to UAS are known, some current and  most future costs are unclear. Recognizing that generating and  maintaining reliable cost data can be expensive, OMB instructions  note that program cost should be determined or estimated from the  best available records of the agency. Accordingly, policy makers could  opt to implement fees to recover the estimated costs of each activity  as regulations, services, and systems are established, and adjust fees  periodically based on actual costs.", "Determine which costs to recover: The next step is to determine  the extent of the costs for each activity that should be recovered  through user fees based on policy goals. For example, as discussed,  many of FAA\u2019s current costs relate to the \u201csetup\u201d or integration of UAS  into the national airspace, including the costs to develop and  promulgate UAS operational rules. Policy makers may or may not  decide to recover these current costs from future users. For example,  policy makers may decide not to recover these costs based on the  idea that the goal of promulgating UAS-related regulations may be  related to the general safety of the airspace, rather than providing  benefits to specific users. Additionally, some stakeholders we  interviewed stated that the costs of startup activities (like rulemaking)  and safety oversight activities (like enforcing existing regulations)  should not be recovered through user fees because these activities  are core government functions. Rather, these stakeholders advocated  funding such activities through appropriations from general revenues.  However, as we have discussed in prior work, fees have frequently  been used to support agencies\u2019 regulatory programs.

Policy makers may decide that, to account for benefits to those  who don\u2019t directly engage in UAS activities, a percentage of FAA\u2019s UAS- related costs should be funded with general revenues. For instance, as  the Congressional Research Service has reported, there has been  general acceptance that appropriations to the FAA from general revenues  account for the public benefits of FAA\u2019s regulation of the national  airspace. Additionally, while the manned aviation industry will benefit  from regulations and oversight that reduce the potential for disruption in  the airspace caused by UAS, UAS operators benefit from the regulation  and safety oversight of the manned aviation industry as well.

Here, for example, the UAS traffic management  system may include points in the process when users are required to  obtain an FAA authorization or notify FAA or UAS traffic-management  service providers of operation requirements. Those points may provide an  opportunity for fee collection. Similarly, as FAA does for current UAS  registration fees, online systems for other services could provide an  opportunity for FAA to collect fees associated with those activities.

For example, stakeholders noted that a  point-of-sale tax would not apply to home-built or second-hand UAS  users and the tax would not be linked to actual use of the UAS (that  is, the UAS activities that might impose costs on FAA)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FAA\u2019s Lack of Planning to Consider Possible Fee Mechanisms Could Impede Future Design of UAS User Fees", "paragraphs": ["FAA officials told us that they have not yet identified or studied potential  UAS fee mechanisms or analyzed the findings included in the Task Group  3 report because they have been waiting for the results of our work to  inform their decision-making and planning. OMB instructions to agencies  related to user fees establish that\u2014to increase efficiency of resource  allocation and reduce burden on taxpayers\u2014agencies should recover  costs when special benefits are delivered to specific users and that  agencies must review all agency programs on a biennial basis to  determine whether fees should be assessed. Similarly, federal internal  control standards note that management should identify, analyze, and  respond to significant change\u2014such as increasing costs related to a  change in mission like the integration of UAS to the national airspace\u2014 using a forward-looking process.", "Given the evolving nature of the UAS industry, it is unclear how UAS  users and associated government activities and services fit into FAA\u2019s  existing funding structure. As the balance of FAA\u2019s activities gradually  shifts to include increased focus on UAS-related activities, those activities  continue to be funded by a combination of manned aviation users  (through revenue to the Airport and Airway Trust Fund) and taxpayers  (through general revenues). The revenues to the Airport and Airway Trust  Fund are from taxes on airline tickets, cargo, and fuel, but are not closely  linked to the costs to FAA of providing specific services. In 2007, FAA and  the administration proposed a new funding system that would rely more  on cost-based fees for specific manned aviation activities. This proposal,  however, was never implemented. We previously testified regarding this  proposal, noting that such fees could allow FAA to better identify funding  options that link revenues and costs and improve transparency by  showing how much is being spent on specific FAA activities, but that  achieving these goals would depend on the soundness of FAA\u2019s cost  allocation methodology and extent to which revenues are linked to  costs.", "The provision in the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 for GAO to conduct  this review, FAA\u2019s tasking statement for Task Group 3, and statements  made by Task Group 3 in its final report suggest an interest among  Congress, FAA, and industry stakeholders, respectively, in considering  user fees as an option for recovering the costs of FAA\u2019s UAS activities.  Implementation of cost-based user fees for UAS would be different from  FAA\u2019s longstanding funding structure for manned aviation, but may not  necessitate a change in that existing structure for areas of FAA\u2019s mission  other than UAS. Indeed, the Task Group 3 report expresses a  consensus that options for UAS funding should not be constrained by the  current traditional aviation funding structure, and any recommended  funding structure should not alter the current structure of funding for  traditional, manned aviation. As UAS integration continues to evolve, FAA  may identify ways that the current aviation funding structure can be  adjusted to recover costs related to UAS operations. For instance, FAA  officials noted that, once large UAS cargo and passenger operations have  been established, those operations could become subject to the same  excise taxes on fuel, cargo, and passengers as are manned operations.", "As we have discussed, fees to recover FAA\u2019s costs for its UAS activities  need not be assessed on a program-wide basis. That is, fees to recover  the costs of individual UAS activities can be implemented separately  either as new rules or systems are developed or as FAA reviews its  activities and identifies areas in which services to UAS users are incurring  costs that could be recovered. Further, fees based on costs to FAA  estimated as each rule or system is developed can be periodically  adjusted as needed. As explained in our User Fee Design Guide, periodic  reviews of user fees can help ensure that Congress, stakeholders, and  agencies have complete information about changing program costs and  that fees remain aligned with program costs. As UAS integration  continues, ongoing conversations between Congress, FAA, and  stakeholders may provide additional insight into how fees can be  implemented to accomplish goals.", "To date, FAA has not incorporated steps into its existing UAS planning  efforts to identify potential fee mechanisms. Considering potential user  fees as part of these efforts\u2014such as FAA\u2019s annual UAS implementation  planning\u2014could better position FAA to design effective user fees should  policy makers task FAA with implementing them. For instance, collecting  information on costs and beneficiaries as new UAS-related services are  developed and implemented could ensure that data needed to design  effective user fees are available. Similarly, considering ways to collect  revenue\u2014such as through third parties or online systems\u2014as services  and systems are being developed or adapted for UAS users, could  facilitate future implementation of fees. As an example of the type of  planning that may be needed, FAA officials said that identifying the costs  of UAS traffic management services for the purpose of setting fees would  involve (1) tracking which UAS are using the national airspace and (2)  tracking and categorizing the type of operations conducted. Incorporating  a means of collecting these data during the planning and development of  traffic management systems would be useful to future fee-design  considerations in this area. This is not to say that cost recovery  considerations should drive the development of regulations or systems at  the expense of mission goals. Rather, such planning would offer  opportunities for FAA to examine systems, policies, and regulations that  have been designed to accomplish the goals of UAS integration in order  to assess (1) how each system, policy, or regulation will affect FAA\u2019s  costs; (2) the need for additional resources; and (3) potential options for  collecting revenue."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["FAA is tasked with managing the integration of UAS into the national  airspace within the context of many competing priorities and limited  resources. Without a process to ensure information on UAS-related costs  is complete for either current or future efforts, neither FAA, nor the  administration, or Congress have reliable information about the total costs  of FAA\u2019s UAS-related activities and therefore may lack the information  needed to effectively prioritize resources. Further, this information could  inform the design of effective user fees, should policy makers decide that  such fees are appropriate.
