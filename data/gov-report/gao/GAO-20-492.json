In 2008, the SSA OIG  reported that EDCOR letters were not effective in either  communicating wage-reporting problems to employers or identifying  correct wage earners. For example, the OIG found that 74 percent  of employers who reported W-2s with mismatched names and SSNs  did not receive letters. Most employers that did not receive letters  submitted 10 or fewer mismatched W-2s whereas SSA only sent  letters to employers that submitted more than 10 mismatched W-2s.

First,  WHC lock-in letters would be more likely to reach their intended  recipients, making them potentially more effective in obtaining their  intended responses. IRS sends lock-in letters to employers, and IRS  officials said the agency typically has accurate address information for  employers.

According to a 2018 TIGTA report, compliance with lock- in letters could further be improved if IRS took action against employers  who do not comply with the letters and adjust employees\u2019 withholdings  accordingly. TIGTA recommended that IRS penalize employers who do  not respond. IRS has agreed to consider penalties, and officials told us  the agency is evaluating opportunities to do so.", "Third, we have previously reported that IRS is less likely to collect taxes  owed the longer it takes IRS to contact taxpayers.

IRS officials said the agency has an obligation to protect all  taxpayers, including potential employment-related identity fraudsters. IRS  officials told us that IRS previously sent lock-in letters for cases involving  mismatched names and SSNs but stopped in 2012 because the agency  wanted to avoid potentially disclosing an employment-related identity  fraudster\u2019s identifying information, such as the names of their employers,  to those individuals whose SSNs were used to commit employment fraud.", "However, IRS could also redact personally identifiable information in the  lock-in letters as it already does this when mailing tax return transcripts.  For example, in response to data privacy concerns, in September 2018  IRS began including just the first four characters of business names on  tax return transcripts requested by taxpayers. This approach could also  be used for sending lock-in letters to employees to reduce disclosures of  personally identifiable information in instances where lock-in letters do not  reach their intended recipients.", "IRS officials told us that WHC\u2019s limited resources prevent the program  from addressing all underwithholding cases currently identified by the  program.

Automated  Underreporter (AUR) programming prevents these taxpayers from being  selected due to wage discrepancies. Instead, AUR analyzes these  taxpayers for reporting discrepancies for other income types, such as  investment income.", "IRS officials told us excluding these taxpayers from AUR\u2019s W-2 checks  helps IRS avoid burdening some victims who may be otherwise selected  based on wages earned by a fraudster using the taxpayers\u2019 name and  SSN. Selected victims would be required to follow up with IRS to avoid  being assessed tax liabilities. Following up would be particularly  burdensome for victims whose names and SSNs are used by fraudsters  year after year.", "Taxpayers with IDT action codes on their accounts are eligible for  analysis and selection by other enforcement programs based on  discrepancies in W-2 reporting; however, these programs\u2019 low selection  rates suggest that it is unlikely IRS will follow up with these victims and  notify them of these discrepancies. For example, although Nonfiler  analyzes these taxpayers for evidence of income indicating a filing  requirement, TIGTA found that IRS notified just 25,105 or 14 percent of  all 179,878 nonfiler cases identified in fiscal year 2016 of these  discrepancies. Likewise, although IDT victims may be selected for  examination, IRS data show that the agency examined about 892,000 or  0.6 percent of all individual income tax returns in fiscal year 2018, the  most recent year for which data are available.", "IRS officials acknowledge that some of the approximately three million  taxpayers with Action Codes 501 or 525 may underreport their own  incomes, and excluding these taxpayers from AUR\u2019s W-2 discrepancy  checks creates an enforcement gap, enabling some victims who actually  underreported their own wages to avoid enforcement. IRS does not know  how many of these taxpayers have underreported wage income.", "However, some IDT victims excluded from AUR\u2019s wage discrepancy  checks may be incentivized to underreport wages and pay less tax than  they owe if they learn IRS is unlikely to hold them accountable for paying  those taxes. Individuals could learn about this enforcement gap, for  example, if they accidentally failed to report wages from an employer and  were not later contacted by IRS. In addition other taxpayers may be  incentivized to falsely claim they are IDT victims to take advantage of this  enforcement gap. In its research into behavioral insights, IRS has found  that taxpayers are more likely to be noncompliant when they perceive  doing so can yield substantial benefits with minimal costs. We have also  previously reported that the extent to which taxpayers misreport income  closely aligns with IRS\u2019s ability to detect such noncompliance.", "In some instances, IRS has information needed to distinguish wages  earned by legitimate taxpayers from those potentially earned by  employment-related identity fraudsters using that same taxpayer\u2019s name  and SSN. For example, IRS can reasonably conclude the legitimate  taxpayer earned the wages if they are reported on a current- or prior-year  return filed by the taxpayer, as this indicates the taxpayer attests to  having worked for the employer who paid the wages.", "Because IRS excludes IDT victims from AUR\u2019s W-2 discrepancy checks,  IRS may not identify or collect taxes owed by some who unintentionally  underreport their wages (e.g., by forgetting to include a W-2 from a  second employer). In addition, IRS is missing an opportunity to incentivize  taxpayers to accurately report their income and avoid intentional  underreporting.", "As previously stated, federal internal control standards call for managers  to both use quality information and respond to risks. According to IRS  officials, modifying AUR to effectively identify the underreporting of wages  actually earned by identity theft victims would require IRS to not only  adjust AUR to include wage discrepancy checks for these taxpayers but  also to change how AUR identifies wage discrepancies. IRS officials told  us that when AUR evaluates a taxpayer\u2019s wage information for  discrepancies, the program evaluates taxpayers based on aggregated W- 2 information. AUR is not programmed to evaluate taxpayers by analyzing  some of their W-2s but not others, such as potential employment fraud W- 2s.", "IRS officials told us modifying AUR to include W-2 discrepancy checks of  these taxpayers while excluding potentially fraudulent W-2s would not be  a cost-effective use of IRS resources at this time. Specifically, officials  noted that AUR discrepancy checks are programmed in the legacy  assembly language code, a low-level computer language initially used in  the 1950s. Although they were unable to provide an estimate for the costs  of modifying this code, IRS officials said the effort would be resource  intensive.", "IRS is modernizing outdated information technology systems, and officials  said it would be more cost effective for the agency to modify W-2  discrepancy checks once the assembly language is replaced.

It would also be consistent with a goal  outlined in IRS\u2019s Strategic Plan to advance the use of data and analytics  to inform decision making and could potentially result in IRS collecting  additional revenue by enabling IRS to analyze wage information for about  three million additional taxpayers to identify any wage reporting  discrepancies.

Identified groups at risk of identity theft. We first reviewed  Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, SSA Office of the  Inspector General, and our prior reports on Social Security number  (SSN) misuse to determine common characteristics of individuals who  are at risk of SSN misuse. These characteristics include being  deceased, elderly, a child, or having three or more wage records  during the 3-month period of our review. Based on these reports, we  defined \u201celderly\u201d as over age 84 and \u201cchildren\u201d as under age 14 for the  purposes of this review.  2.  Identified SSNs at risk of SSN misuse. We used SSA\u2019s full death  file for dates of death for deceased individuals, and its Numerical  Index File (Numident) for dates of birth for living individuals.We next  compared full death file and Numident data to a quarterly extract of  NDNH data listing the names and SSNs of individuals who earned  wages between August and October 2016. We selected data from this  quarter because, at the time of our review, these were the oldest data  for which relevant IRS tax data were also available. We used this  comparison to identify individuals employed between August and  October 2016 who also met at least one of these at-risk  characteristics.", "NDNH is a database of individuals employed in the United States.  Data are collected and reported by state workforce agencies and  federal agencies, and the database is administered by the  Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Office of Child Support  Enforcement. NDNH data are comprised of three types: verified,  unverified, and unverifiable. The verified data\u2014used in this analysis\u2014 have been checked against SSA records to confirm that the name and  SSN match SSA records. Unverified data include data that do not  match on name or SSN, and unverifiable data include data that did  not include enough information to attempt a match (e.g., when states  submit partial or missing name information).", "According to the Department of Health and Human Services, there  were 584,013,484 verified wage records, 18,629,720 unverified, and  91,134,352 unverifiable as of December 31, 2018. Verified data were  used in this analysis to make the estimate more conservative since  cases of potential synthetic identity theft\u2014where the name and SSN  do not match\u2014are excluded from verified data.", "NDNH is designed to assist state child support agencies in locating  parents and taking appropriate, interstate actions concerning child  support orders. Some authorized agencies also use NDNH data to  help prevent overpayments and detect fraud. For example, IRS has  access to NDNH to administer the Earned Income Tax Credit.  However, IRS and SSA are not authorized to use NDNH information  to detect potential employment-related identity fraud.", "We were authorized to use NDNH through the GAO Access and Oversight Act of 2017,  Pub. L. No. 115-3, 131 Stat. 7.", "Form W-2, Wage and Tax Statement (W-2) was not reported on a  2016 tax return.", "When possible, we also limited the analysis to cases where the  taxpayer had a known filing requirement. We also identified cases  that were consistent with misuse of SSNs for employment-related  identity fraud, rather than taxpayer noncompliance. However, we were  unable to determine the total extent of taxpayer noncompliance for  taxpayers included in this analysis.", "Our analysis is not intended to be a comprehensive effort to identify  all potential cases of employment-related identity fraud. We focused  our analysis on cases where matching names and SSNs were used to  obtain employment. These cases pose a risk to SSA, IRS, and  victims, yet little is known about these cases.  4.  Analyzed tax characteristics of potential employment-related  identity theft victims and other taxpayers. Last, we used CDW to  analyze selected tax characteristics of both individuals we identified  as having at least one employer-submitted Form W-2 that was not  reported on a 2016 tax return as well as those where employer- submitted Forms W-2 were reported. For example, we analyzed data  on wage withholding rates, the prevalence of selected IRS identity  theft indicators on taxpayers\u2019 accounts, and IRS enforcement actions  taken against these individuals.", "We assessed IRS procedures against the information gathering and data  analytics leading practices in the Framework for Managing Fraud Risks in  Federal Programs. We did not conduct a comprehensive fraud risk  assessment of the IRS enforcement programs. Our assessment was  limited to the control activities surrounding employment-related identity  fraud.", "We assessed the reliability of the full death file, Numident, NDNH  quarterly wage data, and selected elements of CDW by reviewing  relevant documentation, interviewing knowledgeable agency officials, and  performing electronic testing to determine the validity of specific data  elements in the data. We determined that the data elements used in our  analysis were sufficiently reliable for the purpose of our work to describe  and analyze the potential scope of employment-related identity fraud.", "To assess IRS and SSA actions to detect and prevent employment- related identity fraud as well as notify victims, we reviewed relevant  documentation including IRS\u2019s Internal Revenue Manual and SSA\u2019s  Policy Operations Manual System. We also interviewed knowledgeable  officials from both agencies on SSA and IRS processes for detecting and  preventing employment-related identity fraud and notifying victims. We  compared IRS\u2019s and SSA\u2019s efforts to relevant federal internal control  standards. We also assessed the agencies\u2019 efforts against IRS and  SSA\u2019s respective strategic plans as well as select leading practices to  combat fraud, as identified in the Framework for Managing Fraud Risks in  Federal Programs.", "To evaluate the extent to which IRS and SSA are effectively collaborating  to address employment-related identity fraud, we reviewed relevant  agency documents, such as IRS and SSA\u2019s Combined Annual Wage  Reporting Memorandum of Understanding, other IRS-SSA legal  agreements, meeting minutes from IRS-SSA joint meetings, and policy  manuals. Because of its role with assisting victims and collecting statistics  on identity theft, we interviewed agency officials from the Federal Trade  Commission in addition to knowledgeable officials from IRS and SSA.  Because of its role helping employers verify the identities of employees,  we interviewed officials at the Department of Homeland Security.", "We focused our assessment on SSA and IRS because those agencies  are most directly involved in the wage reporting process used to detect and resolve employment-related identity fraud. We assessed IRS and  SSA\u2019s collaboration efforts against leading practices for collaboration we  have identified in our prior work and against standards for project  management. We identified key elements of each leading practice and  assessed the extent to which SSA and IRS collaboration on employment- related identity theft aligned with leading practices or key elements.", "The performance audit upon which this report is based was conducted  from November 2017 to January 2020 in accordance with generally  accepted government auditing standards.
