Because Y-12 facilities are outdated and deteriorating, NNSA is building a more modern facility--known as the Uranium Processing Facility (UPF). NNSA estimates that the UPF will cost up to $3.5 billion and save over $200 million annually in operations, security, and maintenance costs. NNSA also plans to include more advanced technologies in the UPF to make uranium processing and component production safer. GAO was asked to (1) assess NNSA's estimated cost and schedule for constructing the UPF; (2) determine the extent to which UPF will use new, experimental technologies, and identify resultant risks, if any; and (3) determine the extent to which emerging changes in the nuclear weapons stockpile could affect the UPF project. To conduct this work, GAO reviewed NNSA technology development and planning documents and met with officials from NNSA and the Y-12 plant."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The UPF project costs have increased since NNSA's initial estimates in 2004 and construction may be delayed due to funding shortfalls. NNSA's current estimate prepared in 2007 indicates that the UPF will cost between $1.4 and $3.5 billion to construct--more than double NNSA's 2004 estimate of between $600 million and $1.1 billion. In addition, costs for project engineering and design, which are less than halfway completed, have increased by about 42 percent--from $297 to $421 million--due in part to changes in engineering and design pricing rates. With regard to the project's schedule, NNSA currently estimates that UPF construction will be completed as early as 2018 and as late as 2022. However, because of a funding shortfall of nearly $200 million in fiscal year 2011, NNSA officials expect that the UPF will not be completed before 2020, which could also result in additional costs. NNSA is developing 10 new technologies for use in the UPF and is using a systematic approach--Technology Readiness Levels (TRL)--to gauge the extent to which technologies have been demonstrated to work as intended. Industry best practices and Department of Energy (DOE) guidance recommend achieving specific TRLs at critical project decision points--such as establishing a cost and schedule performance baseline or beginning construction--to give optimal assurance that technologies are sufficiently ready. However, NNSA does not expect all 10 new technologies to achieve the level of maturity called for by best practices before making critical decisions. For example, NNSA is developing a technology that combines multiple machining operations into a single, automated process--known as agile machining--but does not expect it to reach an optimal TRL until 18 months after one of UPF's critical decisions--approval of a formal cost and schedule performance baseline--is made. In addition, DOE's guidance for establishing optimal TRLs prior to beginning construction is not consistent with best practices or with our previous recommendations. As a result, 6 of 10 technologies NNSA is developing are not expected to reach optimum TRLs consistent with best practices by the time UPF construction begins. If critical technologies fail to work as intended, NNSA may need to revert to existing or alternate technologies, possibly resulting in changes to design plans and space requirements that could delay the project and increase costs. Changes in the composition and size of the nuclear weapons stockpile could occur as a result of changes in the nation's nuclear strategy, but NNSA officials and a key study said that the impact of these changes on the project should be minor. For example, the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty signed in April 2010 by the leaders of the United States and Russia would, if ratified, reduce the number of deployed strategic warheads from about 2,200 to 1,550. According to NNSA officials, NNSA and DOD have cooperated closely and incorporated key nuclear weapons stockpile changes into UPF's design. Also, an independent study found that most of the UPF's planned space and equipment is dedicated to establishing basic uranium processing capabilities that are not likely to change, while only a minimal amount--about 10 percent--is for meeting current stockpile size requirements."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making five recommendations for, among other things, improving the UPF's cost and funding plans, ensuring that new UPF technologies reach optimal levels of maturity prior to critical project decisions, and for improving DOE guidance.

Built in the 1940s and 1950s, the uranium processing  operations at the Y-12 plant are outdated and deteriorating. According to  NNSA officials, upgrading the Y-12 plant and maintaining it over the long  term would require costly investments. In addition, the nation\u2019s nuclear  weapons stockpile is shrinking, which has reduced the need for high- capacity enriched uranium activities and nuclear weapons component  production. Therefore, in 2004, NNSA decided to construct a more modern  facility\u2014known as the Uranium Processing Facility (UPF)\u2014that will  consolidate uranium activities at the Y-12 plant from about 800,000 to  350,000 square feet. NNSA estimates the new facility will cost as much as  $3.5 billion but that it will save over $200 million annually in operations,  security, and maintenance costs.", "As NNSA consolidates its facilities, it plans to develop more advanced  technologies to make uranium processing and component production  safer, more effective, and more efficient. Uranium processing uses  chemicals and other means to recover enriched uranium from  disassembled components and other scrap or salvaged materials in  NNSA\u2019s inventory for use as fuel for naval and research reactors and re- use in new or refurbished nuclear weapons components. Component  production includes enriched uranium metalworking and other processes  to assemble new or refurbished nuclear weapons components. Uranium  processing and component production also involve hazardous processes  that could expose workers to radiation or other dangers. NNSA is  developing new, more advanced uranium processing and component  production technologies that it hopes will reduce these potential hazards,  according to NNSA officials. However, the risks inherent in relying on  new, experimental technologies could affect NNSA\u2019s ability to construct  the UPF within established cost and schedule estimates.", "NNSA\u2019s plans for the UPF have also been affected by changes in the  composition and size of the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile. Existing  uranium processing and component production capabilities at the Y-12  plant were designed to meet the large-scale demand that existed during  the Cold War. The end of the Cold War has led to large reductions in the  number of nuclear weapons in the stockpile, reducing the demand for  uranium processing and component production.", "In this context, you asked us to review the UPF. Our objectives were to (1)  assess NNSA\u2019s estimated cost and schedule for constructing the UPF; (2)  determine the extent to which the UPF will use new, experimental  technologies and any risks to the project\u2019s cost and schedule of replacing  the existing, proven technologies; and (3) determine the extent to which  emerging changes in the nuclear weapons stockpile could affect the UPF.", "To assess NNSA\u2019s estimated cost and schedule for constructing the UPF,  we reviewed NNSA and contractor documents describing the project\u2019s  cost and schedule estimates and recent design-related cost and schedule  performance as well as documents showing cost and schedule  implications for the future. We also interviewed officials at NNSA\u2019s Y-12  Site Office and NNSA\u2019s contractor for the Y-12 plant\u2014Babcock & Wilcox  Technical Services Y-12, LLC. To determine the extent to which the UPF  will use new, experimental technologies and how NNSA plans to mitigate  any resultant risks, we reviewed agency and contractor documents,  including NNSA technology readiness reports and an independent study  examining technology-related project risks. In addition, to understand  NNSA\u2019s technology development goals, progress, and obstacles, we  interviewed key NNSA and Y-12 plant officials responsible for maturing  critical UPF technologies. We also visited the existing uranium processing  and component production facilities that will be replaced by the UPF and  observed demonstrations of several of the new technologies being  developed. To determine the extent to which emerging changes in the  nuclear weapons stockpile could affect the UPF project, we reviewed  agency and contractor documents describing the key factors NNSA  considered in developing UPF design plans that meet stockpile  requirements. To obtain an independent perspective on the UPF design  plans and approach, we also talked with officials at the Los Alamos and  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories who design the enriched  uranium components that are to be produced at the UPF. We also  reviewed a key independent study and discussed report findings with the  study\u2019s principal author on how NNSA\u2019s UPF design plans are integrated  with nuclear weapon stockpile requirements and how emerging changes in  the stockpile could affect the UPF project.", "We performed our work between December 2009 and November 2010, in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

The plant\u2019s early mission  included the processing of enriched uranium necessary for building nuclear  weapons. Today, the Y-12 plant continues its mission as NNSA\u2019s primary  facility in the nuclear weapons complex for producing enriched uranium  components necessary for maintaining the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile.  In addition, the Y-12 plant is used for dismantling weapons components,  storing and managing nuclear material suitable for nuclear weapons, and  processing fuel for Naval and research reactors, among other things.", "Currently, the Y-12 plant consists of a patchwork of facilities and  equipment that are not always efficiently connected, requiring the  transport of materials during processing and component production  operations. According to NNSA documents, the workflow is inefficient and  requires a significant number of security personnel to patrol a relatively  large protected area. Moreover, because of age and facility deterioration,  operations and maintenance costs are continually rising with frequent  outages and interruption in work schedules. According to NNSA officials,  the existing facilities also do not meet a number of significant regulatory  and design standards that are either in place or projected to be in the near  future. For example, these facilities do not meet current standards for  protection against natural occurrences or fire. Furthermore, existing Y-12  plant facilities do not provide optimal worker safety and protection from  exposure to radioactive materials, including uranium, and other hazardous  materials. Although these facilities have had periodic upgrades, the  equipment, buildings, and support utilities need to be modernized for the  Y-12 plant to continue to meet its mission, according to NNSA officials.", "NNSA plans to transfer much of the ongoing uranium processing work and  uranium component production that is performed at existing facilities at  the Y-12 plant to the UPF in order to continue to support the nation\u2019s  nuclear weapons stockpile and provide uranium fuel to the U. S. Navy,  among other things. The proposed UPF is to consist of a single,  consolidated uranium processing and component production facility to  encompass less than half the size of the existing Y-12 plant facilities. NNSA  officials expect that a combination of modern processing equipment and  consolidated operations at the UPF will significantly reduce both the size  and cost of enriched uranium processing at the Y-12 plant. Specifically, the  officials said that the more-efficient layout of the new facility and more- modern equipment will significantly reduce processing and production  costs, including costs associated with facility and equipment maintenance  and maintaining worker and environmental health and safety.", "DOE Order 413.3A establishes a process for managing the department\u2019s  major projects\u2014including contractor-run projects that build large  complexes that often house unique equipment and technologies.

As identified by the professional cost- estimating community in our Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide, a  high-quality cost estimate is credible, well documented, accurate, and  comprehensive. However, our January 2010 report found that the UPF\u2019s  current cost estimate prepared in 2007 only partially or somewhat met  these four characteristics. For example, we found the UPF cost estimate  only somewhat credible because an independent cost estimate had not  been conducted. Instead, the project received an independent cost review  as part of an independent technical review. An independent cost review is  less rigorous than an independent cost estimate because it only addresses  the cost estimate\u2019s high-value, high-risk, and high-interest aspects without  evaluating the remainder of the estimate. Moreover, we found the UPF  cost estimate was only somewhat accurate because it was not based on a  reliable assessment of costs most likely to be incurred. The UPF cost  estimate used an estimating methodology that was not appropriate for a  project whose design was not stable and that was still anticipated to  change. NNSA\u2019s technical independent review of the UPF stated that the  project\u2019s cost-estimate range was unsupported in part because it was  prepared with significant detail\u2014for example, the estimate provided a  count of pipings and fittings for the facility\u2014despite the fact that there had  been no design of technical systems or of the building on which to base  these details. Our January 2010 report recommended, among other things,  that DOE follow best practices and conduct an independent cost estimate  for all major projects.", "In response to our recommendation and recent congressional committee  direction, DOE\u2019s Office of Cost Analysis is conducting an independent cost  estimate on the UPF project before critical decision 2\u2014approval of a  formal cost and schedule performance baseline. This independent cost  estimate is expected to be completed by the end of 2010. While this  independent cost estimate may be used by NNSA headquarters officials as  part of its process for approving the project\u2019s performance baseline, it is  uncertain the extent to which Y-12 officials will accept the independent  cost estimate results as reliable. Specifically, NNSA Y-12 project officials  told us that the independent cost estimate will be based, in large part, on a  subjective assessment of the independent cost estimating team\u2019s past  experiences on similar construction projects. This is in contrast to the cost  estimate prepared by the UPF project that is based on a detailed  breakdown of the estimated prices of labor and materials specific to the  UPF. Project officials noted that DOE\u2019s Office of Cost Analysis currently  has no formal process for reconciling the two estimates given their  different approaches. However, officials from DOE\u2019s Office of Cost  Analysis told us that the independent cost estimate will be compared to  the scheduled work and construction requirements specific to the UPF to  understand what assumptions and cost elements are causing differences, if  any, between the two estimates. According to these officials, this  comparison will enable them and NNSA Y-12 project officials to  understand cost risks for the project and determine how to address these  issues. In addition, DOE is in the process of developing draft policy that is  expected to help establish requirements and responsibilities for  developing cost estimates for programs and performing independent  estimates for program and project cost estimates.

For  example, NNSA estimates it will save $54 million annually from the large  reduction in the UPF\u2019s security perimeter when compared to the security  perimeter around existing uranium processing facilities at the Y-12 plant.  NNSA estimates cost savings will also result from the smaller amount of  hazardous and radioactive waste the UPF will generate as compared to the  existing facilities.", "However, these savings may not begin to be realized until the transition  between existing uranium processing facilities at the Y-12 plant and the  new UPF is complete because both may need to operate simultaneously  for an indeterminate period until the old facilities are decontaminated and  decommissioned. For example, the Y-12 plant may need to continue to  maintain some security in and around the old uranium processing facilities  for some time after the UPF is built and operating because significant  quantities of enriched uranium could still be present in the old facilities\u2019  piping and processing equipment during decontamination and  decommissioning. According to NNSA officials, security measures in the  old facilities can be significantly reduced once enriched uranium  inventories are transferred to the UPF.

Consistent with our prior work and DOE\u2019s analysis, a 2007  technical independent review on the UPF project found a large disconnect  between the funding available in NNSA\u2019s annual spending plan and the  assumed annual funding levels in the UPF cost estimate. Specifically, the  review found that planned funding levels for fiscal years 2006 through 2008  did not meet the funding needs for the amount of work planned for those  years. Despite this early warning of funding risks, NNSA officials approved  the initial project cost range a few months after this technical review.", "Moreover, with the submission of the President\u2019s budget for fiscal year  2010, NNSA officials anticipate a funding shortfall of nearly $200 million in  fiscal year 2011 between what NNSA estimated the UPF project needed  and what NNSA included in its budget request to Congress. NNSA officials  said that this shortfall will likely delay project milestones and ultimately  delay the UPF\u2019s estimated project completion from as early as 2018 to at  least 2020 or later. This delay could, in turn, increase project costs.  Potential funding shortfalls in subsequent years have also been identified  as an ongoing high risk by project officials, which could result in  additional unknown project delays and cost increases.", "To address this concern about funding shortfalls, NNSA requested an  internal review in February 2010 to ensure that UPF project funding  expectations from fiscal years 2012 through 2016 are reasonable.  According to NNSA\u2019s briefing on the results of the review, NNSA\u2019s funding  analyses appears to have addressed only whether the project would likely  be able to spend the funds it requests in fiscal years 2012 and 2013.  Importantly, the analysis appears to be incomplete because it (1) covers  only 2 years and (2) does not address whether NNSA can realistically  provide needed UPF funding given other NNSA priorities, such as other  construction projects that will compete for funds in the same years. For  example, according to NNSA\u2019s Future Years Nuclear Security Program  accompanying the DOE\u2019s fiscal year 2011 congressional budget request,  NNSA expects to request about $305 million in fiscal year 2012 to fund the  Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Facility Replacement project at the  Los Alamos National Laboratory, while requesting about one-third that  amount\u2014about $105 million\u2013\u2013for the UPF.

For example, NNSA uses chemicals and other  means to recover enriched uranium from disassembled components and  other scrap or salvaged materials in NNSA\u2019s inventory. Once the uranium  is recovered, it can be transformed into other forms, including powder-like  enriched uranium oxide or uranium metal suitable for storage. In addition,  NNSA uses enriched uranium metalworking processes to, among other  things, prepare new or refurbished nuclear weapons components. For  example, metalworking processes can include heating the uranium into  liquid form so it can be poured into casts to create a variety of needed  components. Metalworking processes also include machining operations  where the uranium metal is cut on special tools at high speeds to create  needed enriched uranium shapes. However, existing technologies at the Y- 12 plant have become outdated, resulting in lesser levels of efficiency than  would be possible with newer technologies.

TRLs were pioneered by the National Aeronautics and  Space Administration (NASA) and have been used by the Department of  Defense (DOD) and other agencies in their research and development  efforts for several years. DOE and NNSA adopted the use of TRLs  agencywide in response to our March 2007 report that recommended that  DOE develop a consistent approach to assessing technology readiness.

For example, the new microwave casting technology is already at  TRL 7. According to NNSA officials, NNSA has recently installed  microwave casting technology in existing facilities at the Y-12 plant to  demonstrate that it will heat enriched uranium as designed in an actual  operational environment. As a result, NNSA will have high assurance that  this technology will work as intended prior to approving the UPF\u2019s formal  cost and schedule performance baseline.", "However, NNSA does not expect to achieve the required levels of  readiness for another key technology. Specifically, based on discussions  with NNSA and contractor officials and our analysis of NNSA documents,  NNSA does not expect one critical technology it is developing\u2014agile  machining\u2014to reach TRL 6 until 18 months after approval of the project\u2019s  cost and schedule performance baseline. Nevertheless, NNSA plans to  approve its performance baseline with less than optimal assurance that  this technology will work as intended. NNSA officials told us they have  developed plans to address risks resulting from this technology readiness  gap. Specifically, NNSA developed a technology maturation plan in early  2010 to track technology development and engineering activities needed to  bring the agile machining technology to TRL 6.", "DOE\u2019s guidance on the use of TRLs is inconsistent with best practices  used by DOD and with our previous recommendations with regard to  technology readiness at another critical decision\u2014start of construction.  Specifically, DOD recommends that technologies reach TRL 7\u2014the level  where a prototype is demonstrated in an operational environment\u2014prior  to beginning its production and deployment phase, or the equivalent of  beginning construction on a DOE project. Similarly, in 2007, we  recommended that DOE construction projects demonstrate TRL 7 or  higher before construction. Reaching this level indicates that the  technology prototype has been demonstrated in an operating environment,  has been integrated with other key supporting subsystems, and is  expected to have only minor design changes. Nevertheless, DOE\u2019s  guidance does not require technologies to advance from TRL 6 to TRL 7  between the approval of a formal cost and schedule baseline and the  beginning of construction. Six of the 10 technologies NNSA is developing  are not expected to reach TRL 7 before UPF construction begins. In the  case of agile machining technology, NNSA expects that the technology will  have only achieved a TRL 6 by December 2014 by the time of its expected  procurement\u20141 full year after construction of the UPF is expected to  begin in December 2013.", "Table 3 provides details on the current TRL for the 10 technologies, the  TRL expected by the approval of a formal cost and schedule baseline in  July 2012, the TRL expected by the start of construction in December 2013,  and whether the expected TRLs meet best practices.", "Because all of the technologies being developed for the UPF will not  achieve optimal levels of readiness prior to project critical decisions,  NNSA may lack assurance that all technologies will work as intended. This  could force the project to revert to existing or alternate technologies,  which could result in design changes, higher costs, and schedule delays. In  addition, other problems have occurred. For example, NNSA recently  downgraded special casting technology from TRL 4 to TRL 3 because,  according to UPF officials, unexpected technical issues occurred that  required additional research and testing to resolve. Although officials  expect this technology to be at TRL 6 by the time a formal cost and  schedule baseline is approved in July 2012, it is not expected to reach TRL  7 before construction begins in December 2013.", "A June 2010 NNSA management review of the UPF also noted that  continued demonstration and testing of UPF technologies is still  necessary. The review stated that, because current operations in the Y-12  plant are expected to continue for over a decade longer, there appears to  be a significant opportunity to demonstrate and test new technologies in  an integrated fashion in the existing facility prior to installing them in the  new facility. The review also noted that, if some technologies do not work  as intended, it is not clear whether the current UPF design can  accommodate the only identified alternative\u2014to revert back to existing  technologies. Furthermore, it noted that even with significant additional  UPF investment, modifying the UPF\u2019s design could further delay the  project. In such an event, the review concluded that continued operation  of existing facilities at the Y-12 plant is NNSA\u2019s only strategy for  addressing such delays."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Emerging Changes in the Composition and Size of the Nuclear Weapons Stockpile May Only Have a Minor Effect on the UPF", "paragraphs": ["According to NNSA officials and an independent study commissioned by  NNSA, emerging changes in the composition and size of the nuclear  weapons stockpile as a result of changes in the nation\u2019s nuclear strategy or  a proposed arms treaty with Russia should have relatively minor effects on  the UPF project. The UPF\u2019s design is based on ensuring the facility has (1)  sufficient capability\u2013\u2013the space and equipment necessary to process  enriched uranium and to produce the specific components for each type of  weapon in the stockpile; and (2) sufficient capacity\u2013\u2013the space and  equipment necessary to produce the required quantities of components for  the stockpile. As such, the elimination of a particular weapon type from  the stockpile could eliminate some capability requirements in the UPF\u2019s  design. Similarly, a reduction in the total number of weapons in the  stockpile could reduce some capacity requirements in the UPF\u2019s design.", "Changes in the composition and size of the stockpile could occur as a  result of changes in the nation\u2019s nuclear strategy. Specifically, the April  2010 Nuclear Posture Review\u2014the third comprehensive assessment of  U.S. nuclear policy and strategy conducted since the end of the Cold War  and conducted by the Secretary of Defense in consultation with the  Secretaries of State and Energy\u2014provides a roadmap for implementing  the President\u2019s agenda for reducing nuclear risks and describes how the  United States will reduce the role and numbers of nuclear weapons in the  nation\u2019s nuclear security strategy, among other things. For example, the  review recommended studying the feasibility of using W-78 warheads that  are currently used on intercontinental ballistic missiles on submarine- launched ballistic missiles. If this occurs, existing warheads used on  submarine-launched ballistic missiles could be eliminated from the  stockpile. According to the review, implementing the steps outlined in the  report to reduce the role and numbers of nuclear weapons will take years  and, in some cases, decades to complete.", "In addition, the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START)  signed in April 2010 by the leaders of the United States and Russia would,  if ratified, reduce the number of deployed strategic warheads from about  2,200 to 1,550. This treaty would replace the now-expired 1991 START I  treaty and supercede the 2002 Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty\u2014also  known as the Moscow Treaty\u2014which expires in 2012. Further decreases  in the size of the stockpile beyond those resulting from the New START  treaty may also be possible. For example, the Nuclear Posture Review  recommended a follow-on analysis to set goals for further warhead  reductions.", "NNSA officials told us that changes in the composition and size of the  nuclear weapons stockpile should have relatively minor effects on the  UPF project. Specifically, NNSA officials told us that they cooperated  closely with DOD during the development of the Nuclear Posture Review  and that several changes resulting from the review have already been  incorporated into the UPF design. In particular, NNSA recently revised its  primary project requirements document to accommodate expected  changes in the composition and size of the nuclear weapons stockpile  resulting from the Nuclear Posture Review and has already begun work to  modify the UPF design to incorporate these changes. NNSA officials told  us that changes made as a result of the close collaboration with DOD have  helped to mitigate negative impact on the UPF project.", "In addition, while NNSA has not formally studied the potential impact on  the UPF if specific nuclear weapon types were eliminated, NNSA officials  told us that such changes would likely not eliminate the need for  capabilities currently designed into the UPF. Specifically, they said that if  a warhead type were eliminated from the stockpile, the UPF\u2019s capabilities  to produce a particular component for that specific warhead could  potentially be eliminated from the project design. According to NNSA  officials, because many of the UPF\u2019s capabilities will be used for common  uranium chemical processing and component production operations, they  therefore, are not limited to producing components for only one type of  warhead. As a result, eliminating one type of warhead from the nuclear  stockpile would not necessarily result in the elimination of a specific  capability from the UPF\u2019s design because that capability could be needed  for producing a wide range of other warhead types. For example, NNSA  officials stated that replacing existing submarine-launched ballistic missile  warheads with the W-78 intercontinental ballistic missile warhead would  not significantly impact the UPF\u2019s design because this action would be  unlikely to eliminate the need for equipment that is already planned to be  installed in the UPF.", "Moreover, an independent study commissioned by NNSA examining the  UPF\u2019s space and major equipment needs concluded that changes in the  size of the stockpile would result in relatively little change to the UPF\u2019s  space and equipment design plans. The study stated that establishing  sufficient capability to meet minimum stockpile composition  requirements\u2013\u2013the ability to process enriched uranium and produce  components for at least one of each weapon type in the stockpile\u2014 accounts for about 90 percent of the project\u2019s planned space and major  equipment. Specifically, establishing minimum capabilities to, among  other things, recover and process enriched uranium; produce, assemble,  and dismantle nuclear weapons components; and produce fuel for naval  nuclear reactors accounts for 91 percent of the facility\u2019s space and 89  percent of the UPF\u2019s major equipment. Only 9 percent of the UPF\u2019s space  and 11 percent of the facility\u2019s major equipment are needed to ensure  sufficient capacity to produce the necessary quantities of components to  meet the requirements of the nuclear weapons stockpile. In other words,  once the minimum capability is established, the overall impact on the  project of modifying capacity to respond to changes in the size of the  stockpile should be relatively minor. NNSA officials told us that adding or  subtracting capacity can be addressed to a large degree by simply adding  or subtracting work shifts on existing equipment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["When completed, the UPF will play an important role in ensuring the  continued safety and reliability of the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile. By  replacing old, deteriorating, and high-maintenance facilities at the Y-12  plant, the UPF offers NNSA an opportunity to improve efficiency, save  costs, and reduce hazards faced by workers at the plant. Because of its  importance and given the size, scope, and expense of the project, it is  critical that NNSA and Congress have accurate estimates of the project\u2019s  costs and schedules. However, cost increases and potential schedule  delays raise concerns about NNSA\u2019s ability to construct the facility within  its cost and schedule goals. In particular, NNSA\u2019s lack of a high-quality  cost estimate for the project and its inability to consistently request and  obtain sufficient project funding is consistent with the problems we  discussed in our prior reports on DOE\u2019s difficulties in contract and project  management, as well as the findings of DOE\u2019s own root cause analysis of  this issue. NNSA is taking steps to provide independent assurance of the  accuracy of its cost estimates for the UPF project. However, although  DOE is developing draft cost estimating policy, NNSA lacks guidance for  reconciling differences between the results of independent cost estimates  and other project cost estimates. Moreover, NNSA\u2019s decision to approve  an initial project cost range immediately after a 2007 technical review  warned of a disconnect between the UPF project\u2019s funding requirements  and NNSA\u2019s future years\u2019 spending plan, and then requesting $200 million  less in fiscal year 2011 than the UPF project estimated it needed, raises  concerns that NNSA is not placing sufficient high-level management focus  on ensuring that UPF\u2019s cost and schedule estimates, and the associated  funding plans these estimates are based upon, are consistent with NNSA\u2019s  broader plans for funding the nation\u2019s nuclear weapons complex.", "Managing a construction project of this type\u2013\u2013particularly one that relies  on several new or experimental technologies\u2013\u2013is inherently challenging,  and it is encouraging that NNSA is taking steps to manage the  development of these technologies. For example, NNSA\u2019s early use of  TRLs has already proven to be helpful in its efforts to mature these  technologies. However, we are concerned because NNSA does not expect  to achieve optimal assurance as defined by best practices that all 10 of  these technologies will work as intended before key project decisions are  made. Furthermore, because DOE\u2019s guidance for using TRLs is  inconsistent with our prior recommendations as well as best practices  followed by other federal agencies, DOE may be making critical decisions  with less confidence that new technologies will work as intended than  other agencies in similar circumstances. As a result, NNSA may be forced  to modify or replace some technologies, which could result in costly and  time-consuming redesign work. Moreover, Congress may not be aware  that NNSA may be making critical decisions to proceed with construction  projects without first ensuring that new technologies reach the level of  maturity called for by best practices."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making five recommendations to improve NNSA\u2019s management of  project funding and technology associated with the UPF project.", "To improve DOE\u2019s guidance for estimating project costs and developing  new technologies, we recommend that the Secretary of Energy take the  following two actions:  Include in the cost estimating policy currently being developed by DOE  specific guidance for reconciling differences, if any, between the results of  independent cost estimates and other project cost estimates.", "Evaluate where DOE\u2019s guidance for gauging the maturity of new  technologies is inconsistent with best practices and, as appropriate, revise  the guidance to ensure consistency or ensure the guidance contains  justification why such differences are necessary or appropriate.", "To improve NNSA\u2019s management of the UPF project, we recommend that  the Secretary of Energy take the following three actions:    Direct the Administrator of NNSA to ensure that UPF\u2019s cost and schedule  estimates, and the associated funding plans these estimates are based  upon, are consistent with NNSA\u2019s future years\u2019 budget and spending plan  prior to approval of the UPF\u2019s performance baseline at critical decision 2.", "Direct the Administrator of NNSA to ensure new technologies being  developed for the UPF project reach the level of maturity called for by  best practices prior to critical decisions being made on the project.", "In the event technologies being developed for the UPF project do not  reach levels of maturity called for by best practices, inform the  appropriate committees and Members of Congress of any NNSA decision  to approve a cost and schedule performance baseline or to begin  construction of UPF without first having ensured that project technologies  are sufficiently mature."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to NNSA for its review and comment.
