JPME research institutions generally provide studies and analysis research that can support academic programs or inform DOD policymakers.", "The National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2013 mandated GAO to review JPME research institutions. GAO's report (1) describes how JPME research institutions have changed in number, funding, and size; (2) evaluates the extent to which DOD assesses JPME research institution performance; and (3) evaluates the extent to which DOD coordinates the research requests of these and other DOD-funded research organizations. GAO identified and examined the 20 JPME research institutions that conduct research as their primary mission and have dedicated personnel. GAO reviewed DOD documents and interviewed officials on changes at the 20 institutions and how they are overseen, as well as the processes to coordinate their research activities and those of 14 other DOD-funded research organizations GAO determined conduct research activities."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Joint Professional Military Education (JPME) research institutions, particularly at the National Defense University, experienced growth in number, funding, and size in terms of staffing levels from fiscal year (FY) 2007 through FY 2011, but the number of institutions as well as funding and staffing levels declined over the past 2 years. For example, total funding for JPME research institutions increased from $30.8 million in FY 2007 to $47.7 million in FY 2011, but subsequently decreased to $40.6 million in FY 2013. GAO identified several factors that contributed to these institutions' growth, including increases in funding provided by outside organizations for research and the creation of new research institutions. Department of Defense (DOD) officials reported that DOD-wide budget reductions, including the effects of sequestration, contributed to decreases in the number, size, and funding for JPME research institutions.", "The extent to which DOD can assess the performance of JPME research institutions is limited by the lack of a comprehensive framework to systematically assess their performance in meeting professional military education and other departmental goals and objectives. JPME colleges and universities have not consistently established measurable goals or objectives linked with performance metrics for their associated research institutions. Best practices state that achieving results in government requires a framework with measurable goals and objectives and metrics to assess progress. Further, oversight mechanisms for the colleges and universities, such as accreditation processes, focus on the quality of JPME academic programs and not on the research institutions' performance. There is no DOD-wide guidance that addresses the intended role of the research institutions in supporting JPME or other departmental goals, or assigns responsibilities for conducting reviews of them, leaving the department without a basis to assess the institutions' stated mission and actual performance against planned or expected results. Therefore, DOD does not have a basis to assess the institutions' missions and performance against expected results, as called for by best practices. Without measurable goals and objectives linked with performance metrics, and clear guidance on their intended roles and assignment of oversight responsibilities, DOD cannot ensure JPME research institutions are effectively accomplishing their missions.", "DOD has not established mechanisms to coordinate requests for research conducted by JPME research institutions and other DOD-funded research organizations because there is no requirement to do so. Although many of these organizations have missions to conduct research in similar topic areas, DOD uses a variety of processes to request studies and analysis research. Specifically, offices within the Office of the Secretary of Defense and the military departments each have their own separate internal processes to manage research requests and do not participate in one another's processes. Best practices on managing for results state that organizations involved in similar missions should coordinate and share information to avoid unnecessary duplication of work. At a time of constrained budgets, fragmentation in DOD's approach to managing its research requests across the department exposes DOD to the risk of potential overlap of studies and analysis research."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DOD take actions to define the role of JPME research institutions, assign responsibilities for assessing performance, and establish a mechanism to coordinate studies and analysis research requests.

To that end, the Department of Defense (DOD) relies on joint  professional military education (JPME), a subset of professional military  education (PME), to educate servicemembers throughout their careers,  broaden their knowledge, improve performance during joint assignments,  and foster collaboration across the military services. In 1989, a  congressional panel undertaking a comprehensive review of PME  strongly expressed the importance of JPME in guiding intellectual thought  on doctrine, tactics, strategy, and the future of each of the military  services. DOD has colleges and universities throughout the country that  not only provide academic instruction in PME and JPME, but also conduct  research. At JPME-granting colleges and universities, research is  conducted by students and professors, as well as by specifically  dedicated research institutions. These JPME research institutions  primarily conduct studies and analysis research that may directly support  both PME and JPME academic programs by providing new concepts for  the classroom or DOD\u2019s broader needs, such as policy development and  planning efforts.", "Given its importance in educating military leaders, a 2010 report from the  House Armed Services Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations  concluded that PME, of which JPME is a subset, warrants more-frequent  congressional oversight. studies of PME were unable to fully identify the costs associated with  DOD\u2019s JPME programs. Specifically, we found that without reliable cost  information, decision makers could be hindered in determining the most- efficient allocation of departmental resources for JPME. Moreover, the  Joint Staff has expressed concerns about considerable budgetary growth  at the National Defense University (NDU), which DOD has characterized  as the premier center for JPME. For example, in a 2012 review, the Joint  Staff concluded that it could not identify a clear link between some of the  activities of NDU\u2019s research institutions and its JPME mission.", "However, our prior workThe National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 mandated  that we review the work performed by JPME research institutions in   In this report, we (1) support of PME and DOD\u2019s broader mission. describe how JPME research institutions have changed in number,  funding, and size and the factors that contributed to any changes; (2)  evaluate the extent to which DOD is assessing the performance of JPME  research institutions in meeting PME and other departmental goals and  objectives; and (3) evaluate the extent to which DOD coordinates  research requests for JPME research institutions and other DOD-funded  research organizations.", "Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, Committee on Armed Services, House of  Representatives, Another Crossroads?

Specifically, we reviewed current strategic plans, mission statements, and  other documentation describing activities of the JPME research  institutions. We also reviewed documentation describing external  oversight mechanisms that monitor the academic quality of JPME  colleges and universities. To further our understanding of any processes  used to assess the performance of JPME research institutions, we used a  standard set of questions to interview DOD officials and personnel at the  JPME colleges and universities. We then reviewed the results of the  interviews and related documents to develop summary findings. In  reviewing this documentation and testimonial evidence, we referred to our  prior work on best practices that identifies elements that constitute a  comprehensive oversight framework. Specifically, these best practices  state that such a framework should include measurable goals and  objectives linked with metrics for assessing progress, which is consistent  with the framework identified in the Government Performance and  Results Act (GPRA), as amended by the GPRA Modernization Act of  2010. We also reviewed this evidence in light of key internal-control  standards that state that federal agencies should conduct reviews by  management at the functional or activity level and compare actual  performance to planned or expected results.", "To determine the extent to which research activities of JPME research  institutions and other DOD-funded research organizations are  coordinated, we included in the scope of our review the 20 JPME  research institutions discussed above and 14 other DOD-funded research  organizations. To identify the other DOD-funded research institutions, we  gathered DOD documentation from the Assistant Secretary of Defense for  Research and Engineering and canvassed knowledgeable DOD officials  in offices responsible for requesting research, such as the military  departments, science and technology executive agents, studies and  analysis research program managers, and the Office of the Secretary of  Defense, including the Offices of the Under Secretary of Defense for  Acquisition, Technology and Logistics and the Under Secretary of  Defense for Policy.

According to DOD officials, these  increases occurred within the context of the then-ongoing operations in  Iraq and Afghanistan, for which the Joint Staff and the military services  expected the JPME research institutions to provide increased support to  the warfighter. In particular, these factors led to an expansion at NDU\u2019s  research institutions during this period. For example, NDU\u2019s research  budget grew primarily due to increases in reimbursable research funded  by outside offices such as the Office of the Secretary of Defense and the  Joint Staff. Reimbursable funding provided to NDU\u2019s research institutions  increased from about $5.6 million in 2007 to about $14.6 million in fiscal  year 2011, as shown in figure 5. Specifically, reimbursable funding for  NDU\u2019s Center for Technology and National Security Policy\u2019s research  increased from about $3.8 million in fiscal year 2007 to about $6.9 million  in fiscal year 2011. Additionally, funding for NDU\u2019s Center for Study of  Weapons of Mass Destruction, which is funded entirely on a reimbursable  basis, more than doubled from $1.5 million in fiscal year 2007 to $3.1  million in fiscal year 2011.", "NDU officials attributed the growth in reimbursable funding to the fact that  research had evolved into a key area of emphasis for the university.  These officials also noted that, as a result, faculty members at the  research institutions were encouraged to pursue research directly funded  by other DOD entities and other U.S. government agencies. To meet the  increased demands for reimbursable research, particularly when in-house  expertise did not exist, NDU increased the number of contractor and  noncontractor researchers at its research institutions.noted that because a significant portion of the NDU workforce, including  that of its research institutions, is made up of senior-level positions,  researcher salaries contributed to the growth in NDU\u2019s research budget.", "We also found that funding for NDU\u2019s research institutions increased as  the result of the transfer of research institutions to NDU as well as the  broadening of missions of other research institutions. For example,  according to DOD officials, in an effort to better deliver education to DOD  and other U.S. government personnel on issues related to ongoing  operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, such as irregular warfare,  counterinsurgency, and stability and reconstruction operations, the Center  for Complex Operations was transferred from the Defense Security  Cooperation Agency to NDU in 2009. Furthermore, funding for the Center  for the Study of Weapons of Mass Destruction at NDU increased due to  DOD\u2019s decision to broaden the Center\u2019s counterproliferation focus  government-wide. Moreover, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  designated the center as the focal point for weapons of mass destruction  education for JPME. As a result, the Joint Staff began to fund the center  in 2008 to perform that mission.", "Other JPME colleges and universities also experienced considerable  increases in research institution funding and staffing levels from fiscal  year 2007 through fiscal year 2011 due to factors such as the creation of  new research institutions and the realignment of others within JPME  colleges and universities. For instance, according to Air Force  documentation and officials, Air University\u2019s increase in staffing levels for  its research institutions can largely be attributed to the establishment of  the Air Force Research Institute in 2008. According to an Air University  official, the establishment of the Air Force Research Institute resulted  from the consolidation and realignment of personnel from existing Air  Force institutions as well as the creation of 18 new positions. Air Force  officials also stated that staffing levels at the Air Force  Counterproliferation Center and the Air Force Center for Strategy and  Technology increased due to increased research requests from the Air  Staff on nuclear and strategic-level research projects, respectively.  Marine Corps University\u2019s increase in staffing levels at its three research  institutions can be attributed to the establishment of the Translational  Research Group in 2010 and increases in staff positions within the  History Division and Middle East Studies center.", "While a variety of factors contributed to the expansion of JPME research  institutions, it has primarily been department-wide budget reductions,  including the implementation of sequestration in fiscal year 2013, that  contributed to their decreases in number, funding, and size. For example,  officials stated that decreases in funding for NDU\u2019s research institutions  and staffing levels resulted from overall reductions at the university due to  declining budgets. Furthermore, according to officials, NDU\u2019s budget for  its research institutions came under increased scrutiny in 2011 with the  issuance of a new mission statement for NDU by the Chairman of the  Joint Chiefs of Staff that prioritized research that more-directly supported  education over reimbursable research. Moreover, according to officials,  the Joint Staff established full-time equivalent caps for both direct and  reimbursable funding in 2012. As a result of actions taken to reduce  NDU\u2019s budget, NDU\u2019s Center for Transatlantic Studies was disestablished  in September 2012, and the decision was made in early 2013 to defund  the Conflict Records Research Center beginning in fiscal year 2014.", "Similarly, DOD-wide budget reductions contributed to decreases in the  funding and size of other JPME research institutions.

Based on this evidence, we determined  that 20 institutions were conducting research as their primary mission and  had dedicated personnel assigned to them and therefore were included in  the scope of our review.", "For our first objective of determining the extent to which JPME research  institutions have changed in number, funding, and size, and the factors  contributing to any changes, we obtained questionnaire responses and  other documentation on the number of research institutions that existed at  JPME colleges and universities from fiscal years 2000 through 2013 and  collected and analyzed available funding and staffing data for these  years for the JPME research institutions. We assessed the reliability of  the funding and staffing data collected by analyzing questionnaire  responses from JPME colleges and universities, which included  information on their data-system management, data quality-assurance  processes, and potential sources of errors and mitigations of those errors.  Based on our review of the data provided and our review of the  questionnaire responses, we concluded that the systems used to provide  the data, and thus the data they provide, are sufficiently reliable for our  audit purposes. However, based on this evidence, we determined that we  were unable to report consistent data on JPME research institution  funding and staffing levels prior to fiscal year 2007, and therefore we are  providing trend data on JPME research institutions from fiscal years 2007  through 2013. Furthermore, although we have identified a number of  factors that could affect data quality, we concluded that these were the  best available data on JPME research institutions. We also concluded  that the data would not lead to an incorrect or unintentional message  since it is corroborated through interviews with cognizant officials at the  National Defense University, Army War College, Army Command and  General Staff College, Air University, Naval War College, and Marine  Corps University. We also discussed the reasons for any trends in these  budget and staffing data with knowledgeable officials in DOD and at the  JPME colleges and universities. Specifically, we conducted interviews  with officials from the Joint Staff; Office of the Under Secretary of Defense  (Comptroller); National Defense University; Army War College; Army  Command and General Staff College; Air University; Naval War College;  and Marine Corps University.", "For our second objective of determining the extent to which DOD is  assessing the performance of JPME research institutions in meeting  professional military education and other departmental goals and  objectives, we obtained and reviewed documentation from the Joint Staff  and the JPME colleges and universities that identify any goals, objectives,  or performance measures for JPME research institutions. Specifically, we  reviewed current strategic plans, mission statements, and other  documentation describing activities of the JPME research institutions. We  also reviewed documentation describing oversight mechanisms that  monitor the academic quality of JPME colleges and universities.  Specifically, we reviewed Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction  (CJCSI) 1800.01D, Officer Professional Military Education Policy, which is  the DOD policy that governs the Joint Staff\u2019s Accreditation of Joint  Education process. We also reviewed reports prepared by external  regional accrediting bodies.processes used to assess the performance of JPME research institutions,  we used a standard set of questions to interview officials with the Joint  Staff; Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force; National Defense  University; Army War College; Army Command and General Staff  College; Air University; Naval War College; and Marine Corps University.

We  also reviewed documentation and interviewed knowledgeable agency  officials about DOD\u2019s approach to coordinate research requests among  DOD organizations. Specifically, we used a standard set of questions to  interview officials with the Office of the Secretary of Defense and the  military services about the processes used to share information with other  offices that also request studies and analysis research. We then reviewed  the results of the interviews and related documents to develop summary  findings. We reviewed the documentary and testimonial evidence in light  of key practices for enhancing and sustaining coordination as described  in best practices. Specifically, best practices state that organizations  involved in similar missions should coordinate and share information to  avoid unnecessary duplication of work. Further, we assessed whether  there were any similarities or dissimilarities among the missions of the  JPME research institutions and other DOD-funded research  organizations. We did this in four ways:", "First, we assessed whether the JPME and DOD-funded research  institutions were conducting science and technology\u2013related research  or studies and analysis\u2013related research, using missions statements  and other documentation provided by DOD to make this  determination. We did not conduct further analysis on other DOD- funded organizations that conduct science and technology research  as that type of research represented a notable difference from the  JPME research institutions that primarily conduct studies and analysis  research.", "Second, for all the JPME and DOD-funded research institutions  conducting studies and analysis research, we reviewed mission  statements and other mission-related information provided by DOD,  and categorized the organization\u2019s mission as falling primarily into 1 or  more of 23 areas of concentration\u2014for example, Asia studies or  leadership and ethics studies. To create the 23 areas of concentration  that were used to categorize mission statements and research project  titles, we reviewed documentation from the JPME research institutions  that identified general topic areas in which the institutions conducted  research. We also reviewed documentation from Federally Funded  Research and Development Centers that identified the core topic  areas within which the Federally Funded Research and Development  Centers were authorized to conduct work. The areas of concentration  are identified as follows: Africa; Asia; Europe; Middle East; Western  Hemisphere; civilian-military issues and irregular warfare; cyber;  energy and environment; force structure and operational issues;  historical; intelligence; leadership and ethics; legal; logistics; nuclear  and weapons of mass destruction; other; personnel and training;  public affairs and communication; resource management; strategy,  policy, and doctrine; technology, acquisition, and systems; war  gaming; and unable to code. We determined that these areas of  concentration we selected were appropriate for comparing JPME  research institutions and other DOD-funded research institutions  because they explain the focus of each organization\u2019s primary studies  and analysis efforts. To complete the content analysis, two GAO  analysts independently reviewed the mission statements and other  mission-related information provided by DOD and coded them into  one or more of the 23 areas of concentration. When the coding was  completed, both analysts reviewed every code made by the other  analyst and indicated whether they agreed or disagreed with the code.  The analysts then met to discuss their coding determinations and to  reach agreement where there were any discrepancies. The results of  our analysis are not generalizable beyond the 20 JPME research  institutions and 14 other DOD-funded research institutions included in  the scope of our review.", "Third, for all the JPME and DOD-funded research institutions  conducting studies and analysis research, we collected a list of  research projects they conducted for fiscal years 2012 and 2013. To  complete the content analysis, one GAO analyst independently  reviewed each of the 2,217 research project titles and coded them  into one or more of the 23 areas of concentration. When the coding  was completed, two GAO analysts shared responsibility to review the  coding made by the first analyst and indicated whether they agreed or  disagreed with the code.
