The agency reportedly spent about $1.5 billion for IT in fiscal year 2013, and it plans to continue modernizing its aging systems. Management controls and human capital are critical in helping ensure effective and efficient IT project implementation.", "GAO was asked to examine SSA's IT modernization efforts. The study (1) assessed selected IT investments to determine the extent to which they adhere to SSA's investment management controls and are improving services and (2) determined how SSA's IT human capital program, including the identification and implementation of critical skills and competencies, is supporting its current and future modernization efforts. To do so, GAO reviewed key management controls for one project from each of five SSA-defined project types, including one project with the highest resources for its type and four randomly selected projects; compared human capital planning documents with relevant guidance; and interviewed relevant SSA officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Social Security Administration\u2019s (SSA) selected information technology (IT) projects did not fully adhere to management controls called for by its IT project management guidance, which are essential to effectively oversee and monitor IT investments. Such controls include, among others, a cost-benefit analysis, risk mitigation plan, and project schedule. For the five projects selected, SSA developed the majority of the documents required to demonstrate adherence to management controls; however, most had limitations. One project that was required to complete 11 control documents had developed 5 without limitations, but the remaining 6 had limitations. For example, while certain risks to the project were identified, the documentation did not include risk mitigation plans, which are essential for avoiding, reducing, and controlling the probability of the occurrence of identified risks. Across the five projects, the most common limitations included a lack of traceability (which is needed to track project history and demonstrate that requirements are met) and inaccurate or incomplete information, such as project schedules that had inaccuracies in key milestone dates. The limitations could be attributed to, among other things, IT oversight systems that did not include all needed data or fully support traceability, and a quality assurance process that was not effectively implemented. The agency recently took steps that should help improve its quality assurance process.", "Further, while SSA stated that its projects have resulted in improved services, it was not able to demonstrate this. In particular, while three of the five projects identified performance measures, these measures generally were not specific enough to determine projects\u2019 contributions to improved services, and baselines against which to measure improvement were not established. Ensuring that management controls are consistently and effectively implemented would help ensure the efficient use of agency resources.", "SSA\u2019s IT human capital program has identified skills and competencies to support certain workforce needs, but lacks adequate planning for the future. The agency has developed IT human capital planning documents, such as its recent Information Resources Management plan and skills inventory gap reports, which identified near-term needs, such as skill sets for the following 2 years. Nevertheless, SSA has not adequately planned for longer-term needs because its human capital planning and analysis are not aligned with long-term goals and objectives and the agency does not have a current succession plan for its IT efforts. The agency has recognized challenges with regard to employee retirements and a recent hiring freeze, which have put constraints on resources for certain investments. While SSA officials stated that an updated human capital operating plan will be completed in June 2014, they could not specify how it would address future IT human capital needs. Until these needs are identified, SSA may lack critical plans for addressing IT resources and skills to support agency-wide IT investment goals."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is recommending that SSA (1) perform effective oversight to ensure control documents are developed, complete, and accurate and that oversight systems include needed data and support traceability; (2) ensure project control documents identify specific performance measures and baselines; and (3) identify long-term IT needs in its updated human capital operating plan.

The review was designed to include one  of each of the five project types\u2014development, maintenance, cyclical,  planning and analysis only, and National Computer Center\u2014defined by  the agency. Specifically, after the data files were determined to be  sufficiently reliable for selecting projects, we judgmentally selected Ready  Retirement Release 1 because it was the largest development project in  the core services portfolio from fiscal years 2010 to 2012 and was related  to SSA\u2019s major investment, Ready Retirement. The remaining four  projects, Earnings Case Management System (ECMS) Release 3,  Medicare Annual, Internet 3441, and Help Desk Activities were chosen  randomly from the planning and analysis, cyclical, maintenance, and  National Computer Center categories, respectively.", "We analyzed industry best practices and guidance used to effectively  control, oversee, and manage IT projects. We also analyzed SSA policies  and guidance to determine key documents associated with the agency\u2019s  IT project management directive and quality assurance processes to  identify the types of management control documents, such as project  proposals, cost-benefit analyses, and project schedules, that SSA relies  on for managing its investments. Among those identified, we chose 11  types of management controls for our evaluation. The 11 types of  documents we selected support key management activities at different  points throughout a project\u2019s life cycles. Further, they were called for in  the agency\u2019s IT project management directive and quality assurance  processes, as well as other external best practices; spanned each phase  of the agency\u2019s project life-cycle process; and were represented in each  randomly selected project. The 11 control types also were intended to  cover key management processes that are undertaken during the select,  control, and evaluative phase(s) and provide critical information regarding  the resources and costs committed as well as the potential benefits or  improvements to service. For each of the five projects, we obtained the  associated control documents from SSA, where available. We then  assessed each of the five projects to determine the controls that were  applicable, based on the project type, and whether they were developed  for the selected projects. We analyzed the documents against the  agency\u2019s guidance and other best practices. Specifically, we compared  the control documents to the agency\u2019s IT project management guidance,  as well as best practices in the Software Engineering Institute\u2019s (SEI)  Capability Maturity Model for Integration (CMMI) for Development  (version 1.3), our IT investment management framework, and our  standards for internal control. The best practices and standards call for  control documentation to, among other things, be traceable, accurate,  consistent, and effectively implemented. We assessed the control  documentation and determined if any limitations, such as inaccuracies or  inconsistencies, in these areas existed.", "To determine whether SSA had improved services, we analyzed  information that was identified in project documentation for measuring the  performance of each investment, where available. Specifically, we  analyzed the agency\u2019s project proposals and supporting documentation to  determine if quantifiable performance measures and baselines, called for  in best practices such as our IT investment management framework,  were identified and measureable for each project. We also interviewed  project managers, project team members, as well as other agency  officials, including the Deputy Commissioner for Systems/Chief  Information Officer, to understand the agency\u2019s processes and control  documents.", "To address the second objective, we obtained and analyzed SSA human  capital plans and data, including its Information Resources Management  (IRM) Strategic Plan for fiscal years 2012 through 2016 and the most  recent updated plan for fiscal years 2014 through 2017, 2-year IT skills  inventory gap reports, IT staffing data for fiscal years 2008-2014, agency- wide succession plan, and its agency-wide human capital plan. We  compared the agency\u2019s plans and documents to best practices we have  identified in strategic human capital management. We also noted any  human capital issues that were identified in interviews with agency  officials or documentation for the selected investments above.", "We assessed the reliability of the data that we used to support the  findings in this report by reviewing relevant IT investment files and  program documentation to substantiate evidence obtained from agency  databases. We analyzed agency database instructions and replicated the  system processes with SSA data files and compared the results with  agency-provided data. We also corroborated documentation on program  processes and projects obtained from SSA through interviews with  agency officials to clarify program processes and documentation. We  determined that the data used in this report are sufficiently reliable. We  have also made appropriate attribution indicating the sources of the data.", "We conducted this performance audit from November 2012 to May 2014  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
