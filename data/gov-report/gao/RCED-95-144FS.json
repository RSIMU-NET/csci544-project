With few exceptions, HUD then takes ownership of, and subsequently sells, these properties. FHA almost always loses money on the sale of foreclosed properties. The costs of settling the lenders\u2019 insurance claims and maintaining and selling the properties are typically higher than the proceeds from the sale of the properties. However, typically, the premiums that FHA receives from borrowers with mortgages insured by FHA more than offset these losses, and FHA\u2019s principal insurance fund for single-family mortgages\u2014the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund (MMI Fund)\u2014has sustained itself over the years and has not required appropriations from the U.S. Treasury.", "Factors external to HUD, such as trends in housing prices, affect both the rate of foreclosure on mortgages insured by FHA and HUD\u2019s recovery of the costs attributable to foreclosed mortgages. For example, declining housing prices can lower the value of properties below the amount of their mortgages. This can lead to increased foreclosures and larger average losses per foreclosure. In addition, HUD\u2019s policies and practices in acquiring, managing, and selling foreclosed single-family properties influence the financial health of the funds and the level of the mortgage insurance premiums that home buyers may be required to pay.", "Concerned about the costs that HUD incurs in acquiring, managing, and selling foreclosed single-family properties, you asked us to provide you with information on (1) the losses on such properties sold during the 3 fiscal years ending September 30, 1994, and the breakdown of the costs associated with these losses, (2) the number of properties that HUD acquired and sold over the 3-year period, and (3) the length of time that the properties remained in HUD\u2019s inventory before being sold. This information should be useful to the Congress during its debate on the future of FHA and on the possibility of developing public-private partnerships for purposes such as disposing of acquired single-family properties. The information could also serve as a baseline for evaluating the effectiveness of HUD\u2019s actions to reduce losses to the funds resulting from foreclosures.", "In summary, we found the following: \u2022 Although HUD spent nearly $14 billion to acquire, manage, and dispose of nearly 200,000 single-family properties that it sold during fiscal years 1992 through 1994, it received about $9.2 billion from the sale of these properties. The median loss per property was about $22,500. The losses for a relatively small percentage of the properties were substantially higher. However, premiums for the principal fund for single-family mortgages\u2014the MMI Fund\u2014have more than offset the losses incurred for mortgages financed by loans insured by this fund. \u2022 The largest costs that HUD incurs through the property foreclosure and disposition processes are the acquisition costs. These costs, which, under the law, HUD is required to pay as an insurance claim to the lender, represent about 89 percent of the total costs. HUD officials stated that acquisition costs are the driving factor in the losses sustained in the sale of foreclosed properties. HUD paid more than $12.4 billion to acquire the single-family properties sold during fiscal years 1992 through 1994. In addition, HUD paid about $691 million to manage these properties. These management, or holding, costs represent about 5 percent of the total costs. Finally, HUD paid about $867 million, or about 6 percent of the total costs, to sell the properties. Section 1 of this report discusses in more detail the losses to the funds and the breakdown of the costs associated with these losses. \u2022 During fiscal years 1992 through 1994, HUD acquired an average of more than 63,000 single-family properties per year and sold an average of nearly 66,000 such properties per year. Hence, the number of single-family properties in HUD\u2019s inventory declined slightly during this period. Most of the acquisitions and sales occurred in a few states. (See sec. 2 for more information.) \u2022 On a median basis, single-family properties remained in HUD\u2019s inventory about 5 months before being sold. However, 38 percent of the properties remained in inventory from 5 months to 1 year, and 8 percent remained more than 1 year before being sold. The losses for properties that remained in inventory for longer periods were usually much larger than the losses for properties that were sold within 5 months. (See sec. 3.)", "We based our analysis of (1) the costs and revenues associated with HUD\u2019s single-family property disposition program, (2) the number of properties in inventory, and (3) the length of time that properties remain in inventory on data from HUD\u2019s automated Single-Family Accounting Management System (SAMS). This system, which tracks the properties acquired and sold by HUD and contains extensive information on HUD\u2019s property disposition activities, did not become fully operational until fiscal year 1992. Therefore, we did not have relevant nationwide data for prior years and had to limit our analysis to data from fiscal year 1992 through fiscal year 1994. To analyze acquisition costs by type and program administrative expenses, we used data from HUD\u2019s single-family insurance claims system. The effects of these limitations on our analysis are discussed in appendix I.", "The data in this report were current as of September 30, 1994. We did not independently verify the accuracy of HUD\u2019s data. However, we worked with HUD officials and the SAMS database contractor to ensure that we understood which costs and revenues were and were not included in SAMS. We then developed an appropriate methodology for using the data to estimate losses, costs, and revenues to the funds for fiscal years 1992 through 1994. To determine when and how long a property was in HUD\u2019s inventory, we used the date that the property was acquired and the date when HUD reconciled the settlement statement with the funds received by the U.S. Treasury. We also excluded from analysis certain properties, such as those that HUD sold on behalf of the Department of Defense and those for which HUD\u2019s acquisition date was not recorded or was obviously incorrect. Consequently, the data on the inventory and costs reported here may not match those published by HUD. We performed our work from June 1994 through July 1995.", "We provided a draft of this report to HUD officials to obtain their comments. In a meeting with the Director of the Single-Family Property Disposition Division, the Director of the Single-Family Post-Insurance Division, and the Acting Director of HUD\u2019s Office of Evaluation, we obtained HUD\u2019s comments.

The insurance funds incurred losses on about 97 percent of the properties sold from HUD\u2019s inventory during this period.", "For a relatively small portion of the properties sold, the losses were much higher than the median and substantially increased the total loss to the funds. About 11,500 properties, or 6 percent of the properties sold, accounted for about 16 percent of the total loss to the funds\u2014about $750 million. The funds lost more than $50,000 through the acquiring and selling of each of these properties. Moreover, 482 of these properties incurred losses of more than $100,000 each, resulting in losses to the funds of more than $57 million.", "Of the properties with unusually high losses, a disproportionately large number were multiunit dwellings. For example, although less than 1 percent of the single-family properties that HUD sold during this period had three or four dwelling units, one-third of the properties with losses exceeding $100,000 had three or four dwelling units. These multiunit properties may have had higher mortgage loans and higher unpaid principal balances at the time of default than most of the properties sold by HUD. In addition, the properties with very high losses were concentrated in just a few states. Twenty percent of all properties with losses from $50,000 to $100,000 were in California; about half of all properties that lost this much were located in five states\u2014California, Connecticut, Illinois, New York, and Texas. Forty-four percent of the properties with losses exceeding $100,000 were located in five states\u2014California, Colorado, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New York. According to HUD officials, losses of this magnitude may be due to a number of reasons, such as the collapse of a local real estate market due to the closing of a locally based industry.

Over the 3-year period, maintenance and operating expenses accounted for about 58 percent of the total holding costs; repairs, about 25 percent; and property taxes, the remaining 17 percent, as shown in figure 1.5.

For example, although the median amount spent by HUD on repairs for the 3-year period was $290 per property sold, the amount spent on repairs for about 6,000 properties exceeded $5,000 each, totaling more than $45 million. Thus, 3 percent of the properties sold accounted for 26 percent of the $173 million spent by HUD on repairs during this period. Likewise, although the median amount spent on maintenance and operation for the 3-year period was $1,542 per property sold, the amount spent on these costs for about 12,150 properties exceeded $5,000 per property.

For example, during the early 1990s, one HUD field office with a very large inventory had a policy of sprucing up many properties by making minor repairs designed to improve their marketability. According to HUD, since this office\u2019s inventory has declined, the total number of properties being repaired nationwide has declined as well. HUD also told us that some minor items that were classified as repairs before fiscal year 1994 have been reclassified as part of the maintenance activities required of contractors that manage properties for HUD.
