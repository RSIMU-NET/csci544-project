Selected VA medical centers also completed required annual reviews of Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services data and conducted optional onsite reviews for community nursing homes (CNH), with which VA contracts. However, VA has opportunities to enhance its oversight. For example, VA did not conduct the quarterly monitoring of contractor performance as stipulated in its contract for CLC inspections from April 2017 to April 2018. VA officials also said they intended to regularly observe contractors conducting inspections to ensure they effectively determine compliance with standards, but have not done so due to competing demands. Officials also said they had performed these observational assessments in the past but were unable to provide documentation of them occurring.

We interviewed officials from a  nongeneralizable sample of six VA Medical Centers (VAMC) to learn  more about their use of inspections. We selected these six because they  have jurisdiction over nursing home care in all three types of settings and  by considering factors such as geographic variation, level of hospital  complexity at the VAMC, and whether the SVH associated with the VAMC  accepted Medicare or Medicaid payment and was, as a result, subjected  to additional federal oversight by Centers for Medicare & Medicaid  Services (CMS), an agency within the Department of Health and Human  Services. We also interviewed officials from a CLC, an SVH, and a CNH  under each of the six VAMCs\u2019 jurisdiction and officials from the  associated Veterans Integrated Services Network (VISN).

However, some of the nursing  homes may provide care to veterans on a short-term basis, such as  rehabilitation after a hospitalization for a period of 90 days or less (\u201cshort  stay\u201d), or on a long-term basis, which is a period of 91 days or more  (\u201clong stay\u201d). Further, officials told us that some of these homes may also  provide certain special needs care for a limited number of residents, such  as dementia or rehabilitative care, which may require additional  specialized equipment or trained staff.

According  to VA central office officials, the responsibility for helping veterans make  decisions about nursing home care is decentralized to local VAMCs. In  consultation with veterans and their families, VAMC social workers and  clinical care providers can discuss factors such as the veteran\u2019s eligibility  for care in each setting, health needs, the type of care provided at  different homes, space availability, and the veteran\u2019s geographic  preference.

CMS defines the quality standards that  approximately 15,600 nursing homes nationwide must meet in order to  participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. To monitor  compliance with these standards, CMS contracts with state survey  agencies to conduct inspections of each home not less than once every  15 months. During these inspections the state survey agency might  identify deficiencies\u2014or instances in which the nursing home does not  meet an applicable quality standard. To address identified deficiencies,  CMS generally requires nursing homes to implement corrective action  plans.

In addition, CMS collects data on  various clinical quality measures and calculates nursing home staffing  ratios. CMS assigns each nursing home ratings in three components\u2014 inspections, quality measures, and staffing ratios\u2014and an overall quality  rating. CMS places the greatest weight on inspections in its calculations  of each home\u2019s overall quality rating.

VA owns, operates, and oversees the quality of CLCs, and  conducts regular unannounced inspections to determine the extent to  which CLCs meet quality standards. VA central office contracts with  the Long Term Care Institute to conduct these inspections, and VA  central office reviews the results of all inspections. CLCs receive an  initial inspection when they open and then periodic, unannounced  inspections thereafter. The frequency of these inspections depends  on the number and severity of deficiencies identified during the prior  year\u2019s inspection, but they generally occur every 11 to 13 months.  CLCs are required to develop and implement corrective action plans  for each deficiency identified that detail how it will be addressed. VA  central office approves these plans, and the VISN and VA central  office monitor the CLC\u2019s actions until each deficiency is addressed.  Per VA\u2019s contract, VA monitors the Long Term Care Institute to  ensure that inspections are conducted within required timeframes and  to conduct quarterly assessments of the contractor\u2019s performance,  among other things. In addition, for each CLC, VA also collects  information on quality measures and staffing ratios and uses this  information, along with the inspection results, to assign a star rating  from 1 to 5 stars. In June 2018, VA central office consolidated the  ratings for all of the individual CLCs\u2014modeled after CMS\u2019s Nursing  Home Compare\u2014into its Access to Care website.", "SVHs. States own and operate SVHs and, as a result, in most cases  SVHs are inspected by state agencies to determine the extent of their  compliance with state requirements. About two-thirds of SVHs are  inspected by CMS; however, VA is the only entity that conducts  annual inspections for all SVHs. Although, VA does not exercise any  supervision or control over the administration, personnel,  maintenance, or operation of any state home, VA conducts these  annual reviews for all SVHs and is prohibited from making payments  to SVHs until it determines that they meet applicable quality  standards. VA central office contracts with Ascellon to conduct these  inspections and reviews the results of the inspections. The  inspections first occur when an SVH initially seeks to become eligible  for VA payments, and, once the SVH is eligible, unannounced  inspections occur on an annual basis to verify that an SVH is eligible  to continue to receive VA payments. For these annual inspections, the  contractor generally cites deficiencies when SVHs are not in  compliance with applicable quality standards. SVHs develop and  implement corrective action plans for each deficiency identified, and  the VAMC director approves the plan. VA should monitor the  contractor\u2019s performance annually, for example, to ensure that  inspections are conducted within certain timeframes. VA\u2019s Office of  Geriatrics and Extended Care maintains a database of all corrective  action plans, and VISN and VAMC staff monitor the SVHs\u2019 actions  until each deficiency is addressed. VA also collects VA prescribed  quality measure and staffing data from SVHs as part of its survey  process. However, VA does not currently assign a quality rating to  SVHs.", "CNHs. CNHs can be publicly or privately owned and operated, and,  CMS provides federal oversight for all CNHs that receive Medicare or  Medicaid payments. VA requires CNHs under contract to be certified  by CMS, and, unlike the other two settings, VA is not required to  conduct regular inspections of CNHs. Instead, VA requires VAMC  staff to conduct veteran care assessments on a monthly basis and  annually review information CMS collects on the homes\u2019 quality,  including CMS inspection results, to evaluate whether to initiate or  continue a contract with a CNH.  The annual reviews use seven  criteria established by VA\u2019s Office of Geriatrics and Extended Care,  including whether the CNH\u2019s total number of health deficiencies from  the most recent CMS inspection is twice the average of the state in  which it is located. According to VA officials, CNHs that fail to meet  four out of VA\u2019s seven criteria during the annual reviews of CMS data  are excluded from participation in its CNH program unless the VAMC  seeks a waiver from VA central office to allow the home to participate.

VA projects that by 2034 the number of veterans receiving  nursing care in these homes will exceed 17,000. In addition, VA projects  that demand for nursing home care in CLCs and CNHs will decrease after  2034, and VA has not projected care in SVHs beyond 2022.

Specifically, VA central office officials said  that about 600 CNHs had decided to end their contracts with VA over the  last few years for a variety of reasons. For example, officials from four of  the VAMCs we interviewed told us about CNH concerns that contract  approvals can take 2 years, homes have difficulties meeting VA staff  requirements, and VA\u2019s payment rates were very low. Officials said  provisions in the VA MISSION Act of 2018 may alleviate some of these  difficulties. Specifically, the Act consolidates various VA community care  programs into the Veterans Community Care Program and authorizes VA  to enter into veterans care agreements with certain providers, including  nursing homes. In contrast to contracts, such agreements may not  require providers to meet certain wage and benefit requirements. Officials  told us that they are in the process of replacing CNH contracts with  veterans care agreements, which may alleviate some of those  challenges.", "In addition, VA officials told us that most nursing homes\u2014including  homes in each of the three settings\u2014have limited capacity to serve  veterans with special needs, such as those needing dementia, ventilator,  or behavioral care. For example, they said that homes may not have any  of the necessary specialized equipment or trained staff, or may not have  as many of these beds as needed, to meet certain veterans\u2019 special care  needs.

Furthermore, as CMS conducts oversight of only those SVHs that receive  Medicare or Medicaid payments (about two-thirds of all SVHs), for some  SVHs, VA is the only federal agency with oversight over the quality of  those homes care. For example, VA is the only entity that conducts  regular inspections of SVHs in Missouri and New Hampshire.", "VA is missing another opportunity to enhance its oversight of SVHs by not  requiring the SVH contractor to identify all failures to meet quality  standards as deficiencies during its inspections. While CMS requires its  inspectors to cite all deficiencies, VA directed its contractor to cite low- level deficiencies\u2014deficiencies considered by the contractor to pose no  actual harm but with potential for minimal harm\u2014as \u201crecommendations\u201d  rather than deficiencies. For example, during one SVH inspection, the  contractor recommended that \u201cto ensure nutritional adequacy, the facility  should follow the menus, which are planned in advance.\u201d VA officials told  us that unlike deficiencies, they do not track or monitor the nature of the  recommendations or whether the recommendations have been  implemented. In contrast, state survey agencies under contract with  CMS are required to cite all failures to meet quality standards as  deficiencies. In addition to not citing recommendations as deficiencies,  according to the VA contractor\u2019s 2016-2017 annual summary report,  SVHs can fix issues identified by the SVH contractor while the inspectors  are still onsite to avoid being cited on the inspection. As a result, these  issues are also not documented as deficiencies. Officials at four of the six  SVHs we interviewed specifically reported being able to make on-site  corrections to avoid being cited for deficiencies\u2014for instance, officials at  one SVH told us that the SVH was able to relocate handwashing stations  before the end of the inspection in order to avoid being cited for a  deficiency by the VA inspectors.", "According to VA, VA does not require its SVH contractor to identify all  failures to meet quality standards as deficiencies in its inspections, VA  officials said this practice reflects policy and a negotiated position with  SVHs. VA officials reiterated that because SVHs are owned and operated  by the states, VA is less involved with their oversight than CLCs. Our  review of the VA contractor\u2019s annual summary report showed that almost  50 percent of SVHs inspected between August 2017 and July 2018 (the  contract year completed in 2018), zero deficiencies were identified  through inspections. VA officials cited VA\u2019s \u2018collegial approach\u2019 and  willingness to make onsite corrections as factors contributing to the  decline in recent years. Furthermore, while VA and CMS subject SVHs to  slightly different standards, our review of VA and CMS inspection reports  from a sample of five SVH inspection reports shows that VA identified a  total of seven deficiencies and made four recommendations from these  homes. In contrast, CMS identified a total of 33 deficiencies for these  homes for approximately the same time period.", "By not performing observational assessments of SVH inspections, VA  does not know whether, or to what extent, VA\u2019s contractor needs to  improve its ability to identify SVHs\u2019 compliance with quality standards,  which increases the possibility that quality concerns in some SVHs could  go overlooked, potentially placing veterans at risk. Further, by not  requiring the contractor to cite all failures to meet quality standards as  deficiencies on its inspections, VA does not have complete information on  deficiencies identified at SVHs and therefore cannot track this information  to help identify trends in quality across these homes. Further, it is  inconsistent with federal internal control standards that state that  management should establish and operate monitoring activities to monitor  the internal control system and evaluate the results."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Selected VAMCs Completed Required Annual Reviews, but Conducted Optional CNH Onsite Reviews without the Benefit of Guidance", "paragraphs": ["We found that in 2017 the six selected VAMCs annually reviewed CMS  data on the quality of all the CNHs with which they contract, which is a VA  requirement. Specifically, the VAMCs reviewed the CMS data to  determine whether the CNHs met VA criteria for contract renewal. (See  table 4.) The top three criteria from the annual reviews that VAMCs failed  to meet were 1) whether total registered nursing staff ratios per resident  day fell below the state average, 2) whether total nursing staff ratios per  resident day fell below the state average; and 3) whether six or more of  selected CMS quality measures fell above the state average.", "In addition, we found that all six of our selected VAMCs conducted their  own onsite CNH reviews\u2014which, according to VA policy, VAMC officials  have the option of performing if they have quality concerns about CNHs  with which they contract or are determining whether to seek a waiver. The  CNH onsite reviews conducted by these VAMCs focused on many of the  categories for quality standards, such as food and nutrition services,  quality of care, quality of life, and physical environment. While conducting  onsite reviews of CNHs is optional under VA policy, officials at many of  the VAMCs we interviewed told us that these onsite reviews\u2014which the  VAMCs we interviewed referred to as CNH inspections\u2014are valuable in  conducting CNH oversight as they provide important information about a  home\u2019s quality that VAMC staff would not have known otherwise. For  example, officials from one VAMC shared with us results from an onsite  review in which they found moldy and expired food in a CNH\u2019s kitchen\u2014 food storage had been identified as an issue during a previous state  survey for CMS and was purported to have been corrected 5 months  prior. Furthermore, some VAMC staff said that they would suspend  placement of veterans in certain CNHs and may not renew a CNH  contract based on their findings from these onsite reviews.", "However, VA could strengthen its support for the optional onsite reviews  by providing guidance to VAMC staff conducting these reviews. Officials  at some VAMCs expressed concerns that VA did not provide the  guidance they needed to conduct the optional onsite reviews, and that  they would like to have more information from VA\u2019s central office. As one  VAMC official said, \u201cwithout training or guidance from VA , it  is difficult for VAMC staff, especially new staff, to know how to conduct  these inspections.\u201d VAMC officials at the six selected VAMCs told us that  in the absence of guidance from VA, they had each independently  developed their own tools and processes. Furthermore, officials at these  VAMCs had differing understandings of the steps they can take if they  identify quality concerns during onsite reviews. For example, staff at  some VAMCs required CNHs to write corrective action plans and  monitored the CNHs\u2019 implementation until the deficiencies were  addressed; in contrast, staff at other VAMCs did not monitor  implementation, because they did not think they had the authority to hold  CNHs accountable to correct deficiencies they identified.", "VA central office officials who oversee the CNH program told us that they  do not provide training or guidance because CMS and the states, not VA,  are responsible for regulating the quality of care in these nursing homes.  However, in the absence of guidance from VA central office on the  optional CNH onsite reviews\u2014guidance that could be developed, for  example, by collecting and disseminating best practices\u2014VA has missed  an opportunity to leverage efficiencies across VA\u2019s network of VAMCs  and empower VAMC officials with knowledge about the steps they can  take to hold CNHs accountable for correcting problems.

Specifically, the website allows users to enter a  location\u2014such as a city and a surrounding distance\u2014to produce a map  with a list of CLCs and VA-contracted CNHs in their preferred area (see  fig. 3). For each of the homes on the list, VA reports quality information it  collects through its own inspections for CLCs and information CMS  collects for CNHs. As previously noted, veterans and their families are  responsible for making decisions about the nursing home care that will  best meet their needs. Their decision-making can be aided by  discussions with VAMC staff and information provided on VA\u2019s Access to  Care website, among other sources. The ability for veterans and their  families to access information on nursing home quality through the  Access to Care website\u2014such as the currently available quality  information on CLCs and CNHs\u2014is particularly critical as VAMC officials  do not always discuss quality information in their consultations with  veterans and their families.", "As figure 3 shows, VA\u2019s Access to Care website does not provide any  information to the public about the quality of the 148 SVHs that provide  nursing home care. Specifically, VA does not currently provide any  information on SVHs on its Access to Care website\u2014including  information on the location of SVHs or CMS information on care quality  that VA could easily provide on SVHs using information obtained from  CMS\u2019s website, Nursing Home Compare, as VA does now for CNHs.", "VA has explored activities that could provide veterans and their families  with information about SVHs. For example, as stated in VA\u2019s SVH  strategic plan for fiscal years 2017 to 2022, VA considered an initiative to  create a five-star program for SVHs. Additionally, VA has collaborated  with SVHs to produce some data on quality measures. For example,  during the course of this review, VA provided to us a quality measures  report for SVHs by state that they developed in partnership with the  National Association of State Veterans Homes. VA is able to develop this  information because it has access to information on SVH quality\u2014in fact,  as the only entity that conducts regular inspections, it is the only source  for quality information on all SVHs. Specifically, VA collects VA prescribed  inspection, quality measure, and staffing data as part of its survey  process that could be used to develop and distribute quality information  for each home. Some of this information is available to the public at the  local level, but it is not currently provided by VA. For example, SVHs are  required to make the results of the most recent VA inspection of the home  available for examination in a place accessible to residents.", "According to VA officials, there is no requirement to provide information  on SVH quality on the Access to Care website, as SVHs are owned and  operated by the states. However, the website is an important tool for  veterans and their families to help inform their decision making on nursing  home placement. VA has stated goals to provide useful and  understandable information to veterans. The VA website could be the  only readily accessible source of quality care information publicly  available to veterans and their families for certain SVHs. As the SVH  strategic plan indicates, VA sees the value in developing SVH ratings that  could be used to provide quality information to veterans and their families.  Furthermore, officials from three of the SVHs we spoke with told us that  they supported having quality information available about their homes that  would allow comparisons between SVHs or between SVHs and other  homes, such as information contained in Nursing Home Compare.", "Without information about SVHs on VA\u2019s Access to Care website,  veterans and their families are limited in their ability to effectively evaluate  all of their options when selecting a nursing home. Our prior work has  shown that effective transparency tools\u2014such as websites that allow  consumers to compare the quality of different providers\u2014provide highly relevant information to consumers. However, the limited information VA  provides on its Access to Care website is inconsistent with VA\u2019s  articulated commitment to veteran-centric care, a component of which is  ensuring that veterans are well informed about their options for care.  The website\u2019s limited information is also inconsistent with federal internal  control standards, which state that management should externally  communicate the necessary quality information to achieve an entity\u2019s  objective\u2014in this case, providing important information to veterans on the  quality of nursing homes. Action to inform veterans about the quality of  SVHs would better enable veterans and their families to compare the  quality of their nursing home care options across all three settings."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["In the coming years, VA projects an increase in the number of veterans  receiving nursing home care. This makes it particularly important that VA  ensure veterans receive quality care, regardless of the setting\u2014CLC,  SVH, or CNH\u2014in which this care is provided. Inspections are a key  oversight tool used to ensure veterans receive quality care. VA relies  primarily on annual inspections to oversee the quality of nursing home  care at CLCs and SVHs, and our review shows that VA\u2019s two contractors  conducted these required inspections during the period we reviewed.  However, our review also shows that VA has opportunities to enhance  this oversight. First, VA has not regularly monitored the contractors\u2019  performance conducting these inspections by conducting observational  assessments as intended and therefore does not know whether the  contractors need to improve their ability to determine the homes\u2019  compliance with quality standards. Second, VA does not require  inspectors of SVHs to identify all failures to meet quality standards as  deficiencies, which limits VA\u2019s ability to track all deficiencies identified at  SVHs and identify trends in quality across homes. Third, VA has not  provided guidance for VAMC staff for instances in which they may  conduct onsite reviews of CNHs directly. As a result, VA has missed an  opportunity to leverage efficiencies across VA\u2019s network of VAMCs and  empower VAMC officials with knowledge about the steps they can take to  hold CNHs accountable for correcting problems. By making  enhancements to its oversight of inspections across all three settings, VA  would have greater assurance that the inspections are effective in  ensuring the quality of care within each setting.", "VA also seeks to ensure that each veteran chooses a nursing home  placement that best meets his or her preferences and needs. To enable  veterans to evaluate their care options, VA uses its Access to Care  website. However, this website provides no information about SVHs,  which is where most veterans are currently receiving VA-funded nursing  home care. Since VA is the only entity that inspects and collects quality  information on all SVHs, VA possesses quality information that is not  available elsewhere.
