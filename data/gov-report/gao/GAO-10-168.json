UNOPS had no investigative capacity of its own and had to seek out external investigators for which it is still negotiating the scope and cost. In addition, while UNOPS's ethics office complies with most UN requirements, no one has assessed the effectiveness of the office's activities. Finally, UNOPS's Executive Board lacks full access to internal audit reports that could provide greater insights into UNOPS's operations. USAID has not consistently implemented its oversight policies when making grant awards with UNOPS and has been vulnerable to program fraud and abuse. While USAID has policies that require it to perform pre-award assessments of Public International Organizations (PIO), such as UNOPS, USAID could not provide official documentation of these assessments for 7 of its 11 awards made to UNOPS from 2004 through 2008. In the 4 assessments USAID provided, there were no statements acknowledging findings of weak internal controls from UN audits and investigations. In addition, USAID did not negotiate to include audit authority for 9 of these awards that would have allowed USAID access to UNOPS project financial records.

In September  2008, based on an MCC recommendation, the Executive Board moved to  make UNOPS completely autonomous by removing all ties to UNDP. The  MCC was renamed the Policy Advisory Committee to reflect its change  from being a part of UNOPS\u2019s governance structure to now serving in an  advisory capacity.

However, UNOPS management does not know the  extent to which data reliability is a problem because UNOPS has not  sought any systematic check on data accuracy. While UNOPS officials  periodically run reports to see if information is consistent, these reports  are run on an ad-hoc basis, particularly when issues arise on a particular  project or office.

Managers from all of the UNOPS field  offices we surveyed identified some conditions that made Atlas difficult to  use (see appendix V).

Another UNOPS official also said that UNOPS faces continued  financial risk because it had not integrated all the necessary management  controls. For example, UN WebBuy\u2014the online procurement tool used by  UNOPS\u2014is not linked to Atlas, so there is no function for electronic  approval of contract award ceilings, which leaves the organization  vulnerable to possible price manipulation.

Although UN Uniform Guidelines for Investigations require  management to ensure sufficient resources for investigations, the  remaining phases of the investigation have not begun because negotiations  between UNOPS and the OIOS over the investigation\u2019s cost and scope  have been slow. In 2007, when UNOPS management proposed the first  phase of the investigation, UNOPS had no investigative capacity of its own  and, thus, had to request and pay other investigators for their services.  UNOPS management told us they selected OIOS because it is commonly  viewed as the principal investigative authority for UN organizations.  UNOPS management officials also said that selecting OIOS over other  alternatives would be less likely to be seen as inappropriately influencing  the investigations. However, as we reported previously, OIOS is not fully  independent in investigating matters for UN funds and programs (and  other UN entities), such as UNOPS. OIOS must negotiate the terms of  work and payment for any investigations it conducts for UN funds,  programs, and other UN entities. OIOS sent UNOPS a proposal for the  second phase of the investigation about 5 months after the case was  transferred to the OIOS Investigations Division from the Procurement  Task Force (PTF), and UNOPS and OIOS management said negotiations  were still ongoing because of disagreements over the proposed scope and  cost of work. UNOPS management officials told us they found OIOS\u2019s  proposed cost too high and the proposed scope too narrow. State officials  and a former PTF investigator said they are concerned that OIOS is not  committed to pursuing the UNOPS investigations. However, OIOS officials  said they were concerned about UNOPS\u2019s willingness to pay, because  UNOPS contested the cost of the first investigation of Afghanistan after it  was completed by the PTF. Therefore, OIOS officials said they would not  agree to the investigation until UNOPS had confirmed a payment schedule.  As a result, the remaining phases of the investigation have not begun about  3 years after the activities in Afghanistan that are the proposed subject of  the investigation occurred.

Regarding investigations, UNOPS noted that only one of six  investigations performed by OIOS is incomplete. Because investigators  recommended the remaining two phases of the Afghanistan  investigation after they found alleged criminal activity and  mismanagement of funds in the first phase of the investigation, we  maintain that timely investigation of these activities is essential for  UNOPS to demonstrate that it has provided sufficient resources for  investigations. Furthermore, the remaining phases include plans to  investigate broader management responsibility for the inappropriate  activities identified in the first phase. 2.  UNOPS stated that systematic assessment of Atlas takes place on an  ongoing basis. However, according to some UNOPS officials we spo with, assessment of data reliability was not conducted in a systema manner. Moreover, based on our survey findings, data reliability  remains an ongoin g problem.  3.  Regarding ethics training, UNOPS reported that it has complied with,  or exceeded UN requirements. We modified our report to note th UNOPS\u2019s policy exceeds UN requirements, but maintain that UNOPS is  not fully meeting its own requirement to provide ethics training for all  its personnel. Additionally, we reported that a technical glitch in the  system has kept UNOPS management and Ethics Officer from verifyin who has completed the course.  4.  UNOPS said that our report does not explain the \u201csingle audit  principle\u201d as it relates to external audits of UN entities. The United  States supports the \u201csingle audit principle\u201d and we note that GAO has  successfully completed a body of work reviewing UN entities in which  we successfully gained the voluntary cooperation of UN entities to  perform our work. We had similar cooperation from UNOPS and had  access to sufficient information to complete  this review."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix XI: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the person named above, Phillip Thomas (Assistant  Director), Jeffrey Baldwin-Bott, Erin Carson, Debbie Chung, Leah DeWolf,  Etana Finkler, and McKenzie Lawyer Davies made key contributions to  this report.
