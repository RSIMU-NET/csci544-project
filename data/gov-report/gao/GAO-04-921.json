Rural areas often have less favorable employment conditions than urban areas and have fewer public transportation options to help people get to and from work. Given these conditions and the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program's emphasis on moving recipients into jobs and on the path toward self-sufficiency, some have questioned how welfare reform is working in rural areas. To inform discussions of these concerns, GAO is reporting on (1) the size and distribution of the rural TANF caseload and how the caseload's size has changed over time, (2) the challenges and strengths that rural TANF programs have in implementing welfare reform, (3) the strategies being used to address these challenges, and (4) what the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is doing to help rural areas address these challenges. To obtain this information, we used multiple methodologies, including analysis of county-level caseload data, as well as site visits, a review of studies on welfare reform in rural areas, and numerous interviews with caseworkers, government officials and other experts."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["According to our analysis of 48 states, about 293,000 families living in rural counties received TANF cash assistance during an average month in 2003. Rural TANF families are about 14 percent of all TANF families, but the rural portion of individual states' TANF caseload ranges from 0.02 percent to 77 percent. Rural TANF families are concentrated in counties with disadvantaged conditions, including high unemployment and low median income. Since 1997, when welfare reform was implemented nationally, rural and urban TANF caseloads have declined by about the same amount--44 percent--when all reporting states' counties are aggregated. The rural TANF caseworkers and service providers at sites we visited reported that transportation difficulties, job shortages, low wages, and lack of services, especially child care, challenged their efforts to help clients become employed and move toward self-sufficiency. However, they also cited strengths, including collaboration and personal attention to clients. To address the challenges they face, the rural TANF programs we visited have employed a variety of strategies including nontraditional methods of connecting clients with services and cooperative arrangements that leverage resources. Some of the strategies adopted by rural TANF agencies take a more targeted approach, working to overcome one particular challenge or set of challenges that clients face, especially in the areas of transportation, employment, and child care. The Department of Health and Human Services' Administration for Children and Families has undertaken several efforts that could assist TANF programs and recipients in rural areas. These include rural conferences, a demonstration project, technical assistance to rural programs, and a rural task force with representatives from different programs, including TANF. Plans are under way for an Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) initiative targeting rural TANF recipients."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["About 49 million people\u201417 percent of the country\u2019s total population\u2014 live in rural America, and 18 states have at least one-third of their  population in rural areas.

Appendix I provides additional  information on the scope and methodology of our TANF caseload data  analysis. To learn about the challenges and strengths of rural TANF  programs in implementing welfare reform and about the strategies being  used to address these challenges, we visited TANF caseworkers or service  providers in one or more rural counties in nine states: Arkansas, Kentucky,  Minnesota, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina,  Virginia, and West Virginia. We selected locations to visit according to a  combination of factors\u2014their implementation of interesting strategies to  address rural challenges for welfare reform, their high percentage of the  population living in rural areas, and geographic diversity considerations. In  three locations, we met with TANF clients to learn about the challenges  they face in rural areas. We augmented our site visits with a review of  studies on welfare reform in rural areas. We did not conduct site visits in  urban areas and, therefore, do not address urban areas\u2019 challenges,  strengths, or strategies for implementing welfare reform. To learn what  ACF is doing to help rural areas address challenges in implementing  welfare reform, we interviewed ACF officials and reviewed documents  they provided or that we obtained from their Web sites.

TANF has a goal of promoting work and helping  welfare recipients move toward self-sufficiency. It also established work  requirements for welfare recipients and set a limit of 60 months on the  amount of time recipients can receive cash assistance.", "Under TANF, states receive a family assistance block grant from the  federal government that they can use to provide monthly cash assistance  payments to families as well as to finance services for TANF clients or  other low-income people to support their efforts to work. States can also  combine their TANF funds with state funds and those from other federal  programs that finance services such as child care, transportation, and  training. States have flexibility to set their TANF policies, such as to define  the specific activities that count toward the TANF work requirements and  to set the number of months\u2014up to a maximum of 60\u2014for the cash  assistance time limit. Further, states have flexibility in how they  administer TANF; they can set policies at the state level or they can allow  counties to set their own policies. The U.S. Department of Health and  Human Services\u2019 Administration for Children and Families administers the  TANF block grant program and monitors states\u2019 performance, such as  whether states meet the targets for the percentage of TANF recipients who  meet the work requirements. States\u2019 federal TANF funding can be reduced  if they do not meet the federally set targets.", "Welfare caseloads declined dramatically in the years following welfare  reform. Researchers have identified various factors that may have  contributed to the caseload decline, such as welfare reform-related policy  changes and economic growth, but there is no consensus about the extent  to which the different factors contributed to the decline. Welfare caseload  changes are only one element to consider in assessing how well welfare  reform is working. Some of the other information that is needed for such  an assessment includes what happened to families who left welfare,  whether former welfare recipients are working and moving toward self- sufficiency, and whether those who continue to rely on welfare, including  hard-to-serve clients, are getting the services they need to help them leave  welfare.", "Rural areas of the nation are diverse. The economic conditions, the  characteristics of the population, and the geography differ from one rural  area to another. For example, a rural area can be a retirement location on  a coast, a coal-mining community in the mountains, or an agricultural  community on a plain. A common characteristic of rural areas is relatively  low population density. There are numerous definitions of what is meant  by \u201crural.\u201d The one used in this report was developed by the Office of  Management and Budget and is based on a classification of counties as  either metropolitan or nonmetropolitan. Metropolitan counties include  both central counties with a large urbanized area and outlying counties  that are economically tied to the central counties and display a level of  \u201cmetropolitan character\u201d based on population density, urbanization, and  population growth. Counties that do not qualify as metropolitan are  classified as nonmetropolitan.

In our site visits, caseworkers and service providers recounted different  shortages in services from county to county, but they echoed much of the  research literature:    Child care.

According to those we interviewed, the collaborations helped  leverage local resources and spawned new strategies.", "Other service providers. Many of the rural TANF officials we visited  explained that they convene regular meetings with other social service  providers in their local areas to share ideas as well as information  about community and program developments. For instance, TANF  officials from Nicollet County in south central Minnesota said their  eligibility and employment counselors participate in both monthly and  quarterly meetings where ABE staff, public health officials, child  protective services, and the local housing authority are all represented.  Caseworkers and service providers cited these gatherings as a key  component in building rapport with one another, learning about what  partner agencies are doing, and fostering collective brainstorming  sessions for solving difficult problems. The call center (Work Central)  in Rocky Mount, North Carolina, partnered with the state employment  agency and, as a result, receives advance updated job listings, which  allows Work Central\u2019s customer service representatives to call their  customers about suitable job openings the day before the listings are  made available to the general public, according to Work Central  administrators.", "TANF programs in neighboring counties. In 1998, the Departments  of Social Services in eight jurisdictions in southwest Virginia with high  unemployment joined together to create a nonprofit organization to  help TANF clients become employed. The organization, called  Occupational Enterprises, Inc. (OEI), started with a $750,000 grant of  welfare-to-work dollars from the state of Virginia and has since applied  for and received numerous grants from governmental and private  sources to finance its operations. OEI uses its grants to provide  employment services for all TANF clients in the welfare reform  program in the eight jurisdictions. By applying for grants on behalf of  the combined population of all the participating rural counties, OEI   can qualify for much larger funding amounts than it would if it were  working with only one rural county. OEI managers believe that by  covering many counties, they greatly reduce administrative expenses  and can provide far more services than could be provided if each  county were operating independently. This occurs because all locations  benefit from the development of one program, and duplication of effort  is avoided. Also, more staff people are available to collaboratively solve  problems and support one another when needed. Further, instead of  needing a staff person in each county who can provide a service or  program, one or two staff can specialize and serve all locations.  Recently, three additional jurisdictions have joined the original eight to  be part of the OEI consortium.", "Community colleges. Often, service providers named their local  community college as yet another key partner in the network of service  providers working to assist TANF clients in finding work and becoming  self-sufficient. The counties we visited in Mississippi and New Mexico,  for instance, had designated the local community college as the  contract provider of TANF workforce training services. In fact,  Mississippi\u2019s governor was so pleased with the job placement rates of  local community colleges that he proposed giving the community  college system oversight of Workforce Investment Act (WIA) programs  statewide.", "WIA collaboration. WIA and TANF programs in Logan County, West  Virginia, worked together to establish driver\u2019s education courses, using  WIA funds, for welfare and workforce clients who had never obtained a  license. New Hampshire officials took a similar approach, allocating a  portion of their WIA funding to provide specialized computer training  for TANF clients.", "A local bank. The Work Central Advancement Center in Rocky Mount,  North Carolina, partnered with a local bank to offer bank accounts to  Work Central customers in an effort to save customers the exorbitant  fees charged by independent check-cashing services. Unlike a typical  checking account, these accounts provide debit cards only and require  that sufficient funds be available in order for a withdrawal to be made,  thus eliminating the possibility of bounced checks, which Work Central  learned had been at the root of many customers\u2019 problems with banks  in the past.", "In addition to the partnerships described here, program officials also  described other collaborative arrangements, namely partnerships centered  on employment and transportation that are described in other sections of  this report."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Rural Programs Have Collaborated with Others to Provide Mentoring for TANF Clients", "paragraphs": ["A number of rural TANF programs have provided TANF clients with more  informal support from their communities in the form of mentors drawn  from work sites, church congregations, or the community at large.  According to officials we spoke with, the mentors offer advice and serve  as role models, particularly for clients with a family history of welfare who  lack experience in the workplace.", "Mentoring in New Mexico. Building on a state-level partnership  between the New Mexico Aging and Long Term Care Department and  the Department of Human Services, the state of New Mexico launched  the Golden Opportunities for Lifelong Development (GOLD) Mentoring  Program in 2000. Capitalizing on the state\u2019s sizable population of  retired residents, the GOLD Mentoring Program pairs retirees with  TANF clients in the same community, in hopes that mentors will fill  gaps in caseworker service delivery and develop a level of rapport with  clients that is not always possible for caseworkers, given the  competing demands on their time. Mentors coach clients in a variety of  contexts, including family and interpersonal relationships, pre- employment preparation and job search activities, as well as in clients\u2019  interactions with other government entities. For example, mentors told  us that it was not uncommon for mentors to accompany clients to  court appearances or for mentors to intercede on behalf of clients  trying to navigate various government benefit systems.", "Mentoring in Forrest City, Arkansas. A community development  corporation in Forrest City, Arkansas, operates a mentoring program  for TANF clients that relies on unpaid volunteers from the community.  Known as PREP, which stands for People Realizing Employment  Possibilities, this program constitutes the support component of a local  subsidized employment initiative. Specifically, the mentoring program  was created to help TANF clients facilitate workplace problem solving  and to provide a model of appropriate workplace norms and behaviors  during subsidized job training arrangements with area employers.  Mentors meet with clients about once a week to gauge progress and  help resolve issues that have arisen. Although mentors do not  necessarily work at the same location as their assigned clients,  cognizant staff told us that mentors occasionally make workplace visits  to clients\u2019 work sites.", "Employer-based mentoring in southern Minnesota. During the late  1990s, staff from a 10-county region in the southeastern part of  Minnesota partnered to develop an employer-based mentoring program  intended to help TANF clients acclimate to new work environments  and deal constructively with conflicts to avoid termination, and to help  area employers improve retention. The program trained mentors in  conflict avoidance and resolution strategies and paired them with new  hires. Although the primary goal of the program was to provide support  for TANF clients entering the workforce, the service was made  available to all new employees hired by a participating employer. By  targeting all new employees, the program avoided identifying or  possibly stigmatizing TANF clients in the workplace and also provided  more of an incentive for employers to participate. All told, the program  trained approximately 1,200 mentors in 475 organizations, some of  which experienced marked improvements in their retention rates  during that time. For example, one nursing home that employed a  considerable number of TANF clients was concerned about its high  staff attrition rates. After implementing the mentoring program, staff  turnover at the nursing home dropped from 60 percent to 4 percent and  eventually stabilized at about 20 percent, according to program staff."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Rural TANF Strategies Have Targeted Shortages in Transportation, Jobs, and Child Care", "paragraphs": ["The rural TANF programs that we visited had focused a substantial  amount of their efforts on remedying at least one of three shortages they  said prevented many TANF clients from finding or keeping employment\u2014 transportation, job options, and child care. In each area, they had tailored  services to meet particular needs and were grooming clients for the  particular opportunities that existed in their local markets. Some  placement programs sought to remedy skill deficiencies to make clients  more marketable, while others targeted the area employers, developing  industry-specific training modules, outreach initiatives, and economic  incentives in hopes of parlaying those relationships into jobs for TANF  clients. Research suggests that training programs designed to reflect the  needs of the local labor market tend to result in positive outcomes for  participating clients."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Expanded Transportation Options", "paragraphs": ["Rural TANF programs had implemented a variety of initiatives, ranging  from private vehicle programs to dedicated transport vans to helping  individuals acquire or regain their driver\u2019s licenses.", "Donated car programs. A number of the rural program officials we  spoke with advocated private vehicle ownership programs as the best  solution to the transportation problems that affect many rural TANF  clients. Specifically, supporters of private vehicle ownership contend  that mass transit options can be insufficient and unreliable in rural  areas and argue that to guarantee regular work attendance, clients  must own their own cars. The Good News Garage, a nonprofit  organization founded in Vermont but adapted in other parts of the  country, has been a pioneer in this area, soliciting donated cars,  evaluating and refurbishing them, and then placing them in the hands  of TANF clients for a nominal fee. Because this program relies on  donated, rather than purchased, cars, TANF clients in New Hampshire,  for example, are only required to pay a fixed price of $1,100, which  may be paid by TANF or another benefit program, to partially cover  the cost of refurbishing. Other variations on the Good News Garage  concept require participants to enter into a lease agreement, where the  purchaser agrees to pay a fixed monthly fee over a set period, at the  end of which clients in good standing are given the title to the car.  Most of these programs provide some type of support to client  participants in the form of car repair clinics, referrals to modestly  priced garages, even subsidies for insurance or repairs. The program  administrators we spoke with cited a number of positive outcomes  associated with private vehicle ownership: In the case of Good News  Garage, program officials asserted that 75 percent of the TANF  recipients who received vehicles subsequently left the welfare rolls.  Further, a study examining the impact of Vermont\u2019s Good News  Garage program on the earned income of participating TANF clients  found that average incomes for participating clients rose $220 per  month after they had been outfitted with a vehicle.", "Car loan programs. Other car programs seek not only to provide  clients with vehicles, but also to help them raise their credit ratings in  the process. Specifically, some programs focus on helping clients  obtain new cars or finance newer vehicles through low-cost loans with  generous repayment terms. For instance, in New Hampshire, a program  called Wheels-to-Work offers a tax credit to dealerships in return for  donations of high-quality used cars that can then be sold to low-income  families for about half the cars\u2019 appraised value. Because the average  cost to the client of these cars is around $3,300, requiring most clients  to obtain loans, Wheels-to-Work also serves as a mediator between  clients and lenders. In Minnesota, a consortium of counties in the south  central portion of the state received funding to launch a similar car  loan program for TANF clients. In this instance, the consortium used  the funding not to purchase or repair cars, but to establish a loan  guarantee fund that facilitated the development of relationships with  two area banks on the condition that the car program would guarantee  25 percent of any defaulted loan. In addition to mediating between the  bank and the loan applicant, staff affiliated with the car loan program  also counseled applicants on consumer credit issues, provided  insurance referrals, and established relationships with area car dealers.  Although staff operated as mediators between the client and the lender,  the program required clients to choose a preferred lender and act as  the primary point of contact. By requiring clients to take loans and  interact with the bank holding the loan, the program sought to improve  clients\u2019 credit ratings, financial literacy, and confidence in dealing with  financial institutions. According to officials overseeing the program,  less than 30 percent of participating car owners defaulted on their  loans.", "Van, bus, and other dedicated transportation systems. Instead of  allocating resources for private vehicle ownership programs, some of  the rural TANF programs we visited elected to subsidize clients\u2019 use of  existing transportation systems, sponsor their own van transport  service, or create reciprocal agreements with other social service  programs already providing transportation (e.g., Head Start). For  example, Logan County, West Virginia, and Coahoma County,  Mississippi, provide vouchers for clients to use the local fixed route  bus system. Other localities have chosen to sponsor their own van  services, but the distances separating relatively small numbers of  clients drives up the cost of van services. For instance, according to  one official in St. Francis County, Arkansas, the price of these services  in his area was as high as $2,000 per client per month. One West  Virginia county suffering from limited public transportation partnered  with the local Head Start program to secure the use of its van for TANF  client transport when Head Start was not in session.", "Obtaining or reinstating driver\u2019s licenses. To address the issue of  clients who had never been licensed to drive, the local TANF program  in Logan County, West Virginia, partnered with Workforce Investment  Board staff from the same locality to offer driver\u2019s education courses to  their respective service populations. To help TANF clients deal with  large unpaid traffic tickets and avoid having their driver\u2019s licenses  suspended, program officials in Coahoma County, Mississippi, are  exploring the possibility of working with local authorities to develop an  incremental payment program for TANF clients. This initiative will be  modeled after a program operated by the City Court Clerk\u2019s Office in  Memphis, Tennessee. Although the Memphis program does not  specifically target the TANF population, the goal is the same: to  provide residents in danger of facing license suspensions because of  unpaid fines an opportunity to establish an arrangement allowing them  to make incremental payments and pay down those fines over time.  According to the program\u2019s administrator, the incremental payment  program has dramatically reduced the number of outstanding or  inactive traffic fines and boosted the city\u2019s traffic fine revenue from   $4 million to approximately $14 million annually."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Job Development, Job Training, and Tailored Employment Assessments", "paragraphs": ["Rural TANF programs we visited have developed a variety of approaches  to find employment opportunities for TANF clients, to provide training  that will make TANF clients more marketable to area employers, and to  assess clients\u2019 skills and barriers to employment.", "Job development. In several counties we visited, one or more staff  had been given the responsibility of developing and maintaining  contacts with employers so that when the employers had job openings,  they would give TANF clients the opportunity to fill the openings. Also,  caseworkers in several counties said they sometimes set up subsidized  employment arrangements for clients. That is, the welfare program  would pay all or part of a client\u2019s salary for a given period of time to  encourage employers to give the clients a chance to learn the job and  prove themselves good employees. Several caseworkers said that  subsidized employment frequently turned into permanent  (unsubsidized) jobs for clients. Also, caseworkers in some areas said  they had set up unpaid job opportunities for clients to help them build  work experience. In southwest Virginia, OEI established workspaces  in two local manufacturing plants where their clients receive on-the- job training and perform unpaid work under the supervision of plant  management. Under this arrangement, plant management agrees to  forgive clients\u2019 mistakes and absences. Also, clients who turn out to be  successful workers get priority for hiring at the plants. OEI has also  established a downtown ceramics shop and store for Appalachian  crafts where TANF clients work, unpaid, to learn what is expected of  them in the workplace and to develop work experience that can help  them obtain and retain paid employment.", "Skill-based training. Some of the TANF programs we visited offered  skill- or industry-specific training programs designed to help clients  develop skills relevant to a particular local employer or industry. For  example, administrators affiliated with the local community college in  Coahoma County, Mississippi, formed a partnership with a large local  casino-hotel complex, one of the few employers in the county with a  need for low-skilled workers. Community college officials, working in  conjunction with casino personnel, developed a curriculum to teach  TANF clients relevant hospitality skills including housekeeping, valet,  security, and cashier services. The casino also funded the construction  of a mock hotel room in one of the classrooms at the college to give  students an opportunity for firsthand experience in chemical safety and  other housekeeping protocol. Instructors monitor students\u2019 progress  and refer job-ready participants to hiring personnel at the casino.  According to staff at the community college, TANF clients feel that  participants in the training program have a better chance of being hired  by the casino than do those who submit an application independent of  the program. Casino officials also said that the retention rate for those  referrals tends to be considerably higher than the industry standard.", "To encourage a local manufacturer to employ TANF clients, program  officials in northern New Hampshire\u2019s Coos County invited the  employer to assist in designing a 10-week course for TANF clients that  would impart the skills necessary for assembling prefabricated  modular homes. When the corporate catalyst for the project began to  experience financial difficulties and was forced to temporarily suspend  hiring, program officials explained that some of the clients who  participated in the training were hired by other employers who could  capitalize on their new skills. A local TANF agency in Goodhue County,  Minnesota, also emphasizes practical skills and helped the local  community college develop a short-term welding course that covered  the fundamentals and laid the groundwork for participants interested  in pursuing certification.", "Certified computer training courses. At least two of the states we  visited also sponsored computer training for TANF clients culminating  in industry-recognized certification. For instance, New Hampshire\u2019s  TANF program gives some clients the opportunity to enroll in an  intensive 14-week computer training course designed and certified by  Microsoft. Curriculum topics include word processing, spreadsheets,  and presentation software. Program officials in one New Hampshire  county told us that among its first cohort of graduates from the  computer training program, all but one had left TANF at the time of our  interview. In Coahoma County, Mississippi, TANF recipients can  participate in 4-week computer training certification courses consisting  of instruction in the basic use of computer hardware, software,  networks, and the Internet.", "Microenterprise. In some of the New Mexico communities we visited,  weak economies and job scarcity prompted program officials to pursue  microenterprise ventures (also known as self-employment) as a viable  alternative for TANF clients seeking work. Specifically, an  Albuquerque-based nonprofit specializing in training and technical  assistance for small business start-ups developed a training program  specifically for TANF clients interested in starting their own  businesses. Microenterprise staff provide TANF clients with consulting  expertise as well as financial literacy training and other instruction in  basic business principles. In addition, the group also maintains an  online marketplace for clients to sell their products. The group has  assisted TANF clients in launching a wide array of businesses, from  arts and crafts to landscaping and child care.", "Scheduling accommodations. In the state of West Virginia, TANF  officials have structured a 6-week life skills and pre-employment  training course for TANF clients such that each week constitutes a  discrete module not dependent upon other modules to be  understandable. This allows TANF clients to enroll at the beginning of  any week, rather than having to wait several weeks for the course to  begin again. In addition, the stand-alone format of West Virginia\u2019s  training makes it possible for clients to enroll and obtain credit for  individual modules as their schedules allow. In Harnett County, North  Carolina, enrollees in GED classes have the option of performing the  preparation work in a classroom environment or of engaging in more  individualized self-paced learning.", "Comprehensive screening and assessment. OEI, a nonprofit  organization that performs employment services for TANF clients from  11 counties in southwest Virginia, developed an assessment tool and  process for all new clients. The assessment, which is managed by a  licensed clinical social worker and registered nurse, screens for a  number of problems that the OEI staff believe are very common among  clients in their area, such as learning disabilities, domestic violence,  substance abuse, and physical and mental health problems. The  assessment also evaluates clients\u2019 educational attainment; legal, family,  and employment histories; transportation and child care needs; skills;  and employment goals. The results of the assessment provide the  foundation for decisions about appropriate activities for promoting  individual employment and self-sufficiency as well as client aptitudes  for various types of work.", "Screening to assist clients claiming disabilities.

The visits to clients\u2019 homes are intended to give the  caseworker an opportunity to assess clients\u2019 living situations firsthand,  learn more about the clients\u2019 claimed disabilities, and identify any  activities the clients are already doing that might be parlayed into  countable work activities. For example, program officials in Harlan  County noted that on a number of occasions, the good cause  specialist\u2019s visit to a client\u2019s home uncovered existing child or elderly  care arrangements with the potential to be expanded into small  businesses that would not only count toward the work requirements  but also could further clients\u2019 self-sufficiency goals. Staff members  related one anecdote where a TANF client had claimed a medical  exemption as a result of responsibilities stemming from the care of her  disabled mother, rather than a medical condition of her own.

To  accomplish that goal, a dedicated staff member developed lesson plans  and a curriculum that provided a foundation for certification. In the  state of Kentucky, certified providers are allowed to care for more  children than uncertified providers and also qualify for larger per child  state subsidy payments. Staff launched the program by visiting current  providers in their homes to share certification information and deliver  safety equipment such as cabinet latches, fire extinguishers, and safety  gates. In addition, the initiative\u2019s primary point person also hosted  periodic discussion groups that were conducted at a central location.", "Although the pilot program was only funded for 1 year, program  administrators told us that approximately 15 of the original 20  participants maintain their certification, and an additional 2 have gone  on to receive advanced certification allowing them to care for up to   12 children in their homes. They credited the initiative for giving rise to  Harlan County\u2019s first child care slots open to infants and toddlers. In  addition, one staff member mentioned that the training and subsequent  increase in income shifted perceptions among participating child care  providers, prompting them to view child care as a profession rather  than as a temporary measure for generating additional household  income. Program officials went on to say that in their experience,  another benefit of increasing the number of home-based child care  slots stemmed from the ability and willingness of in-home child care  providers in their community to offer after-hours care, a service that  center-based facilities had not succeeded in doing.", "Recruiting new providers. In a remote St. Francis County, Arkansas  community, human services staff coordinated with child care  specialists from Little Rock to increase the availability of child care in  the area. Staff utilized church networks and storefronts to heighten  community awareness about the need for child care providers and  followed up with an informational session for interested community  members. After attending the informational session, potential providers  were directed to enroll in licensing training.

However, these  national caseload declines do not necessarily mean that welfare reform  has been successful or that conditions are not challenging welfare reform  in rural areas. First, changes in the number of all families are likely to  affect the number of TANF families, and the number of all families in rural  areas is growing at a lower rate than that of urban areas. Therefore,  without other offsetting factors, rural areas\u2019 TANF caseloads should be  expected to decline more (or grow less), proportionately, than urban  areas\u2019 caseloads. Second, data on caseload declines do not reveal whether  those who left the caseload are employed and moving toward self- sufficiency, which are essential pieces of information for assessing the  success of welfare reform. Third, many rural areas have experienced  significant caseload declines but still have a high proportion of their  families receiving TANF. Whether TANF recipients in these communities  will be able to find jobs and become self-sufficient depends, in part, on the  conditions in the communities where they live, such as the availability of  jobs, transportation, child care, and dental and medical care.
