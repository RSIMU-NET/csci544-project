In addition, about 40 percent of the CBRN countermeasures have not been approved for any pediatric use. Furthermore, some of the countermeasures have not been approved to treat individuals for the specific indications for which they have been stockpiled. For example, ciprofloxacin is stockpiled in the SNS for the treatment of anthrax, plague, and tularemia, but is not approved for these indications. Countermeasures may be used to treat unapproved age groups or indications under an emergency use authorization (EUA) or an Investigational New Drug (IND) application submitted to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).", "HHS faces a variety of economic, regulatory, scientific, and ethical challenges in developing and acquiring pediatric CBRN medical countermeasures. High costs and the high risk of failure associated with testing and research of pharmaceutical products on children, difficulties in meeting regulatory requirements for approving CBRN countermeasures, and scientific and ethical obstacles to safely evaluating countermeasures for children all pose challenges to developing pediatric countermeasures. Despite these challenges, HHS has taken steps to focus agency efforts on the pediatric population, adapt pediatric formulations from existing medical countermeasures, and prepare and review materials for EUAs and INDs in advance of public health emergencies.", "HHS addresses dispensing of pediatric medical countermeasures in more than half of its 12 response plans and in its guidance, and seven state and seven local government plans that GAO reviewed included details about pediatric dispensing. Seven of the 12 HHS plans include information about pediatric medical countermeasures; however, HHS officials stated that these plans are intended to provide guidance for emergency response at the federal level, and not at the state or local levels, which is where dispensing would occur. CDC and FDA also provide guidance on pediatric dispensing that state and local governments can use in their planning. For example, CDC developed guidance about receiving, distributing, and dispensing contents from the SNS to help state and local emergency management and public health personnel plan for the use of countermeasures from the SNS. Response plans for all 14 of the state and local governments that GAO reviewed also included details about dispensing to the pediatric population during an emergency. For example, these seven states and seven local governments all adopted some version of a \"family member pick-up\" policy--sometimes referred to as a \"head of household\" policy--which would allow adults to pick up medicines for other family members, including children, during an event.", "In commenting on a draft of this report, HHS concurred with our findings.

Agency and industry officials told us that the risk of  failure in developing countermeasures for children is even higher than the  risk in developing them for the adult population. This risk, as well as a  lack of a commercial market for most CBRN medical countermeasures,  has made it difficult for HHS to attract companies willing to invest in such  development and has therefore impeded HHS\u2019s ability to acquire the  needed countermeasures.

The Institute of Medicine, the National  Biodefense Science Board, HHS, and FDA have stated that it is difficult to  meet FDA\u2019s requirements for data from adequate and well-controlled  clinical investigations to support the approval of pediatric medical  countermeasures because large, complex clinical trials are needed to  prove safety and efficacy. As a result of this regulatory challenge, FDA  has increasingly relied on alternative sources of data in order to approve,  license, or authorize the use of medical countermeasures by children. For  example, FDA allows researchers to submit evidence of efficacy obtained  from historical inferences and appropriate studies in animals in  accordance with FDA\u2019s Animal Rule. Another challenge to developing countermeasures for children is that manufacturers are permitted, under  certain circumstances, to avoid testing drugs for use by children. For  example, manufacturers of CBRN countermeasures often seek an orphan  drug designation for a new countermeasure, which, if granted, exempts  the manufacturer from the requirement to conduct pediatric studies under  the Pediatric Research Equity Act.", "There are scientific challenges in obtaining sufficient pediatric safety and  efficacy information to appropriately inform the use of CBRN medical  countermeasures for children. For example, FDA officials told us that  extrapolating data to support efficacy information on a medical  countermeasure from animal studies presents not only regulatory, but  also complex scientific challenges to understanding how children would  react to exposure to CBRN agents. NIH and industry officials told us that  exposure in juvenile animal models is also not well understood. For  example, extrapolating data from animal studies presents other scientific  challenges in understanding the response to the medical  countermeasures used to prevent or treat the disease or condition.  Appropriate animal models have not yet been developed for many CBRN  agents. In addition, the presentation of the disease or condition that  humans manifest following exposure to a CBRN agent may not be the  same as that for animals following exposure to the same CBRN agent,  thus complicating the task of researchers that are relying on animal  models. Further, there is an initial hurdle of extrapolating data from animal  models for adults first; only after those data have been extrapolated and  applied to the adult population can researchers extrapolate to children.  For example, in order to develop or indicate a countermeasure for use in  children, scientists generally take an existing countermeasure that has  already been developed for adults and then adjust certain variables such  as weight-based dosing and delivery mechanisms to test the safety and  efficacy of the countermeasure in children. This is not straightforward  because children may have special susceptibilities to the CBRN agent  and special age- and weight-dependent responses to the medical  countermeasures.", "Finally, HHS faces ethical challenges in its efforts to develop and acquire  pediatric medical countermeasures because, absent a CBRN event, it is  generally not ethical or feasible to obtain dosing, safety, and efficacy data  for children when there is no potential direct benefit to them in the context  of a clinical trial. FDA-regulated clinical trials that include children as  subjects must consider both the risks to which a child may be exposed in  a clinical investigation and whether the proposed intervention offers a  prospect of direct benefit to the child. Because children can be enrolled  as subjects in research only when directly necessary and when the  research is ethically sound, industry officials we met with stated that  researching CBRN medical countermeasures\u2019 effect on children is nearly  impossible.

In 2010, FDA announced its Medical  Countermeasures Initiative, which is intended to foster the development  and availability of medical countermeasures, including those intended to  be used by children. FDA officials said the initiative has improved the  regulatory pathway for advancing the development and acquisition of  medical countermeasures, for example, by clarifying and streamlining its  review process and countermeasure requirements, which may entice  manufacturers to develop new, novel medical countermeasures, including  countermeasures with pediatric applicability. In addition, in 2010, HHS  increased its focus on children\u2019s needs with the establishment of the  CHILD Working Group, which was formed to identify and integrate  activities related to the needs of children across all HHS inter- and  intragovernmental disaster planning activities and operations. The CHILD  Working Group has developed recommendations for how HHS can  improve the delivery of care to children who are affected by disasters. In  2011, in the area of medical countermeasures, the CHILD Working Group  recommended that HHS provide clarity in the regulatory pathway for  pediatric medical countermeasures; obtain the appropriate data, when  available, to provide clinical pediatric dosing and use guidance for  existing medical countermeasures; and gather safety and efficacy data  from nontraditional sources to support the use of pediatric medical  countermeasures under EUAs and for eventual FDA approval.According to HHS officials, many of the recommendations from the  CHILD Working Group are being adopted by HHS. For example, in 2011,  HHS developed the Pediatric Obstetric Integrated Program Team, which  includes pediatric and obstetric subject-matter experts who advise  PHEMCE on pediatric and obstetric medical countermeasure issues. This  integrated program team is intended to recommend that pediatric medical  countermeasure needs are consistently considered throughout the entire  medical countermeasure development process and that pediatric subject- matter experts help consider complex ethical, scientific, and legal issues  associated with studies that are necessary for the licensure and approval  of medical countermeasures for children. In 2012 the integrated program  team conducted a review of the contents of the SNS to determine the  suitability of the contents for use by children, and it subsequently used the  review to make recommendations to PHEMCE, and to petition for new  medical countermeasure development. The content of the review is a  work product of the integrated program team, and HHS has no plans to  formally issue it. According to HHS, the findings and recommendations  were considered during the 2012 SNS Annual Review. Further, in 2012,  BARDA announced that where feasible and appropriate, it would be  including development of medical countermeasures for the pediatric  population as part of all base contracts moving forward.", "HHS has taken steps to support the development of CBRN medical  countermeasure formulations for children, and has begun to base the  pediatric dosing information on other evidence, such as by extrapolating  from relevant and historical data of the countermeasure.  Countermeasures are not approved for an indication unless data on the  safety and efficacy of the countermeasure are available for a particular  population, such as children. According to FDA officials, the agency has  determined that in a smallpox emergency, the investigational smallpox  vaccine under development may be authorized for use under an EUA in  populations with compromised immune systems, including children.  Specifically, in 2007 a second-generation smallpox vaccine, developed  for persons determined to be at high risk for infection, was licensed based  on data from clinical trials and the routine vaccination of infants in the  United States through 1972. The vaccine was not studied in pediatric  populations; however, this second-generation vaccine was similar to the  vaccine that was routinely used to vaccinate infants in the United States  through 1972 and had been demonstrated to be safe and effective in  children. Therefore, FDA has determined that this vaccine could be used  in pediatric populations under its license in a smallpox emergency.  Similarly, pralidoxime chloride, prescribed as an antidote to treat nerve  agent poisoning, has also been approved for use by children based on  the extrapolation of efficacy data from both the adult and pediatric  populations. In addition, FDA has used historical data from other  countries to support EUAs or product approvals for pediatric indications  when analogous U.S. data were neither available nor obtainable. For  example, according to FDA officials, in 1987, a radiological incident in  Brazil provided the majority of the pediatric data that FDA reviewed to  assess the safety and efficacy of a radiological countermeasure. The data  included the use of the countermeasure by both adults and children. The  review allowed FDA to approve the countermeasure for children ages 2  and older in 2003.", "PHEMCE has also encouraged adapting and manufacturing of oral liquid  formulations of existing medical countermeasures in order to ease  dispensing of countermeasures in the SNS for children. For example,  BARDA is contracting with industry partners to manufacture a liquid form  of a countermeasure that removes certain radioactive particles from the  body through the intestinal tract. Additionally, PHEMCE is considering  lowering the recommended age at which children should be administered  oral liquid suspensions of doxycycline in lieu of crushed tablets. CDC  officials told us that they would like to have more oral liquid suspensions  considered for the SNS; however, PHEMCE officials have reported that  crushing tablets would be an acceptable alternative and would have  benefits for storage, dispensing, and dosing. As a result, FDA and CDC  have developed instructions for crushing certain approved medical  countermeasures for use by people who cannot swallow tablets or  capsules. The crushing instructions include instructions for mixing the  countermeasures with food or drink to make them more palatable to  children. Crushing instructions generally include weight-based dosing  instructions, the number of doses required per day, and instructions for  how to crush pills and mix them.", "Relevant component agencies within HHS collaborate to prepare and  review materials for EUAs and INDs in advance of public health  emergencies to ensure that sufficient data are available to support  authorizations for the use of certain medical countermeasures by  children. According to CDC officials, the agency assesses, on a regular  basis, the contents in the SNS and updates and assembles data and  information for those countermeasures that are not approved for use by  children so that in the event of a public health emergency, the contents  can be disseminated to states quickly. Specifically, to prepare for such an  emergency, CDC collaborates with BARDA, NIH, FDA, and  manufacturers to develop the EUA and IND submissions in advance of an  actual incident, so that all medical countermeasures in the SNS can be  used by children. In addition, they consult with the American Academy of  Pediatrics on pediatric issues."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "HHS and State and Local Governments Address Dispensing of Pediatric Medical Countermeasures in Their Response Plans", "paragraphs": ["More than half of HHS\u2019s emergency response plans that we examined  included information about pediatric medical countermeasures.

The type of information  included varied by plan. For example, two of the plans for responding to  biological threats identified preferred and alternative countermeasures,  and the appropriate dosages, that should be dispensed to children during  an event. For a chemical incident, one of the plans indicated a  premedication that should be used in pediatric patients before intubating  them.included information about medical countermeasures that could be used  by children, although one plan noted that an EUA would be required  before some of the countermeasures could be dispensed to the pediatric  population.

This all-hazards plan would include sections for responding to specific CBRN events. According to HHS  officials, these sections would address pediatric dispensing, including  EUA and IND requirements.

For example, CDC developed guidance about receiving, distributing, and  dispensing contents from the SNS to help state and local emergency  management and public health personnel plan for the use of  countermeasures from the SNS. The guidance, which could be used as  a reference document or as a checklist by local and state planners,  referred to the pediatric population in multiple sections, including an  appendix about pediatric dispensing considerations. For example, the  guidance described how the color \u201cpink\u201d is used to identify pediatric  supplies included in the SNS. Additionally, the appendix noted that the  SNS has limited amounts of oral suspensions of certain countermeasures  for use by children and offered potential solutions for state and local  governments to consider when addressing this shortage. These solutions  included assigning someone the responsibility of mixing suspensions at a  POD site or compounding tablets of medical countermeasures into oral  suspensions.", "In addition, CDC and FDA developed other guidance on dispensing  medical countermeasures, including to the pediatric population, which  could be shared with and used by state and local governments. For  example, CDC developed a website and training opportunities for state  and local governments to use when planning for dispensing medical  countermeasures. The information shared through the website and  training addresses dispensing in general, for the most part, although a  small portion of the training touches on dispensing to the pediatric  population. FDA also developed guidance on dispensing pediatric  medical countermeasures. For example, because it can be difficult for  children to swallow pills, FDA developed instructions for how to crush and  mix doxycycline with water and then add to food to mask the taste of  doxycycline. Additionally, FDA, with CDC, developed an information sheet  about using doxycycline for the prevention of anthrax that state and local  governments could share with their populations during an event.

For example, more than half of the states included information  about pediatric dosing or formulations. Additionally, all seven states  adopted some version of a \u201cfamily member pick-up\u201d policy\u2014sometimes  referred to as a \u201chead of household\u201d policy\u2014which would allow adults to  pick up medicines for other family members, including children, during an  event. This policy is intended to eliminate disruptions to the dispensing  process while simultaneously reducing patient numbers and increasing  the number of persons treated during an incident. In addition, each state\u2019s  plan provided other information about how medical countermeasures  would be dispensed to children, either under a family member pick-up  policy or through a POD.", "One state\u2019s medical countermeasure dispensing guidance noted that  a POD should have specialized items for dispensing to children, such  as scales for weighing children (if they are present and their parents  do not know their weights) and mixing equipment to make pediatric  portions.

The plan included instructions for reconstituting these medical  countermeasures.", "One state\u2019s plan provided information about dispensing  countermeasures to unaccompanied children who request treatment  at PODs. The issue of consent for emergency care to a child in a  disaster was discussed. Officials from this state told us that it works  closely with the state\u2019s health care coalitions to ensure that the  regional guidelines include pediatric-focused strategies.
