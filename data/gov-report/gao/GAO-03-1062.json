At the same time, for fiscal year 2002, 19 of the 24 CFO Act agency inspectors general or their contract auditors reported that these agencies' financial management systems did not comply with FFMIA. The nature and seriousness of the reported problems indicate that, generally, agency management does not yet have the full range of reliable information needed for accountability, performance reporting, and decision making. Audit reports highlight six recurring problems that have been consistently reported for those agencies whose auditors reported noncompliant systems. Following OMB's reporting guidance, auditors for 5 agencies provided negative assurance on agency systems' FFMIA compliance for fiscal year 2002. This means that nothing came to their attention indicating that these agencies' financial management systems did not meet FFMIA requirements. GAO does not believe that this type of reporting is sufficient for reporting under the act. FFMIA requires the auditor to state \"whether\" the agency systems are in substantial compliance, which in our view, requires the auditor to perform sufficient audit tests to be able to provide positive assurance. Agencies have recognized the seriousness of their financial systems weaknesses, and as of September 30, 2002, 17 of the 24 CFO Act agencies were planning to or were implementing a new core financial system. It is imperative that agencies adopt leading practices, such as top management commitment and business process reengineering, to ensure successful systems implementation.

Second, in a January 4, 2001, Memorandum, Revised  Implementation Guidance for the Federal Financial Management  Improvement Act, OMB provided guidance for agencies and auditors to use  in assessing substantial compliance.  The guidance describes the factors  that should be considered in determining an agency\u2019s systems compliance  with FFMIA.  In addition, examples are provided in the guidance as to the  types of indicators that should be used as a basis in assessing whether an  agency\u2019s systems are in substantial compliance with each of the three  FFMIA requirements.

This section, part of the FAM update issued in April  2003, includes detailed audit steps for testing agency systems\u2019 substantial  compliance with FFMIA.  The FAM guidance on FFMIA assessments  recognizes that while financial statement audits offer some assurances  regarding FFMIA compliance, auditors should design and implement  additional testing to satisfy FFMIA criteria.  For example, in performing  financial statement audits, auditors generally focus on the capability of the  financial management systems to process and summarize financial  information that flows into agency financial statements.  In contrast,  FFMIA requires auditors to assess whether an agency\u2019s financial  management systems comply with system requirements.  To do this,  auditors need to consider whether agency systems provide complete,  accurate, and timely information for managing day-to-day operations so  that agency managers would have the necessary information to measure  performance on an ongoing basis rather than just at year-end."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["We reviewed the fiscal year 2002 financial statement audit reports for the  24 CFO Act agencies to identify the (1) auditors\u2019 assessments of agency  financial systems\u2019 compliance, (2) problems that affect FFMIA compliance,  and (3) agency management\u2019s FFMIA assessments.  While we did not  independently verify or test the data in the agency audit reports or make  efforts to validate auditor conclusions regarding agency systems\u2019  compliance with FFMIA\u2019s requirements, our prior experience with these  auditors and our review of their reports provided the basis to determine the  sufficiency and relevancy of evidence provided in these documents.  Based  on the audit reports, we identified problems reported by the auditors that  affect agency systems\u2019 compliance with FFMIA.  The problems identified in  these reports are consistent with long-standing financial management  weaknesses that we have reported based on our work at agencies such as  DOD, NASA, and the Departments of Agriculture, Education, and Housing  and Urban Development (HUD).

Figure 3 summarizes auditors\u2019 assessments of FFMIA compliance for fiscal  years 2000 through 2002 and suggests that the instances of noncompliance  with FFMIA\u2019s three requirements remain fairly constant.  For fiscal year  2002, IGs and their contract auditors reported that the systems of 19 of the  24 CFO Act agencies did not substantially comply with at least one of  FFMIA\u2019s three requirements\u2014federal financial management systems  requirements, applicable federal accounting standards, or the SGL.

As shown in figure 3, auditors most frequently reported  instances of noncompliance with federal financial management systems  requirements.  These instances of noncompliance identified by auditors  affected not only the core financial systems, but also administrative and  programmatic systems.", "The creation of DHS will affect future FFMIA reporting by the federal  agencies and components it has absorbed.  While DHS must prepare  audited financial statements under the Accountability of Tax Dollars Act of  2002, DHS is not a CFO Act agency and therefore is not subject to FFMIA.   However, for fiscal year 2003, DHS has agreed to have its auditors report on  the FFMIA compliance of the department\u2019s systems, which we view as a  key positive action by the department.  One CFO Act agency, FEMA, was  moved in its entirety to DHS, effective March 1, 2003.  Accordingly, FEMA  is no longer a CFO Act agency and will not be required to prepare audited  stand-alone financial statements under the CFO Act and be subject to  FFMIA. DHS is also being formed from components of other CFO Act  agencies.  For example, the Immigration and Naturalization Service,  formerly part of the Department of Justice, is merging into DHS.  The U.S.  Coast Guard and the Transportation Security Administration are moving  from the Department of Transportation (DOT) to DHS.  Finally, the U.S.  Customs Service is moving from the Department of the Treasury to DHS.   As we reported, each of these components faces at least one management  problem, such as strategic human capital risks, information technology  management challenges, or financial management vulnerabilities.", "While more CFO Act agencies have obtained clean or unqualified audit  opinions on their financial statements, there is little evidence of marked  improvements in agencies\u2019 capacities to create the full range of information  needed to manage day-to-day operations.  The number of unqualified  opinions has been increasing over the past 6 years, from 11 in fiscal year  1997 to 21 for fiscal year 2002; but the number of agencies reported to have  substantially noncompliant systems has remained relatively steady.  As  stated in OMB\u2019s May 2002 report on the status of governmentwide  financial management, many agencies have worked around systems  problems for years to obtain unqualified opinions by expending significant  resources and making extensive manual adjustments after the end of the  fiscal year.  The result is a 5-month-old snapshot of an agency\u2019s financial  position as of September 30 of any given year, which is not useful for day- to-day decision making.  While the increase in unqualified opinions is  noteworthy, a more important barometer of financial systems\u2019 capability  and reliability is that the number of agencies for which auditors provided  negative assurance of FFMIA compliance has remained relatively constant  throughout this same period.  In our view, this has led to an expectation  gap. When more agencies receive clean opinions, expectations are raised  that the government has sound financial management and can produce  reliable, useful, and timely information on demand throughout the year,  whereas FFMIA assessments offer a different perspective.", "While all agencies met the February 1, 2003, deadline for fiscal year 2002  agency performance and accountability reports, the deadline for the fiscal  year 2004 reports is November 15, 2004, just 45 days after the close of the  fiscal year.  Auditors have expressed concern that agencies will have  difficulty meeting the accelerated reporting dates for audited financial  statements generated from the agencies\u2019 existing financial management  systems because of nonintegrated systems and manual processes.  In their  fiscal year 2002 reports, auditors for nine agencies\u2014Agriculture,  Commerce, Education, the Department of Health and Human Services  (HHS), Justice, FEMA, GSA, NASA, and the Small Business Administration  (SBA)\u2014reported concerns about the agencies meeting these accelerated  reporting deadlines.  For example, Agriculture\u2019s IG cautioned that unless  management implements a departmentwide quality control process, there  is a high risk that the opinion on its financial statements could deteriorate.   Auditors for Commerce reported that an integrated financial management  system for Commerce will be key to achieving the accelerated reporting  dates in future years.

The weaknesses reported by the auditors,  which we grouped into the following six categories, ranged from serious,  pervasive systems problems to less serious problems that may affect one  aspect of an agency\u2019s accounting operation:  nonintegrated financial management systems,  lack of accurate and timely recording of financial information,  noncompliance with the SGL,  lack of adherence to federal accounting standards, and  weak security controls over information systems.", "Figure 4 shows the relative frequency of these problems at the 19 agencies  reported to have noncompliant systems and the problems relevant to  FFMIA that were reported by their auditors.  The same six types of  problems were cited by auditors in their fiscal years 2000 and 2001 audit  reports, as highlighted in figure 4.  However, the auditors may not have  reported these problems as specific reasons for lack of substantial  compliance with FFMIA.  In addition, we caution that the occurrence of  problems in a particular category may be even greater than auditors\u2019  reports of FFMIA noncompliance would suggest because auditors may not  have included all problems in their reports.  As we discuss later, the FFMIA  testing may not be comprehensive and other problems may exist that were  not identified and reported.  For some agencies, the problems are so  serious and well known that the auditor can readily determine that the  systems are not substantially compliant without examining every facet of  FFMIA compliance.", "The CFO Act calls for agencies to develop and maintain an integrated  accounting and financial management system that complies with federal  systems requirements and provides for (1) complete, reliable, consistent,  and timely information that is responsive to the financial information needs  of the agency and facilitates the systematic measurement of performance,  (2) the development and reporting of cost management information, and  (3) the integration of accounting, budgeting, and program information.  In  this regard, OMB Circular A-127, Financial Management Systems, requires  agencies to establish and maintain a single integrated financial  management system that conforms with functional requirements published  by JFMIP.", "An integrated financial system coordinates a number of functions to  improve overall efficiency and control.  For example, integrated financial  management systems are designed to avoid unnecessary duplication of  transaction entry and greatly lessen reconciliation issues.  With integrated  systems, transactions are entered only once and are available for multiple  purposes or functions.  Moreover, with an integrated financial management  system, an agency is more likely to have reliable, useful, and timely  financial information for day-to-day decision making as well as external  reporting.", "Agencies that do not have integrated financial management systems  typically must expend major effort and resources, including in some cases  hiring external consultants, to develop information that their systems  should be able to provide on a daily or recurring basis.  In addition,  opportunities for errors are increased when agencies\u2019 systems are not  integrated.  Agencies with nonintegrated financial systems are more likely  to be required to devote more resources to collecting information than  those with integrated systems.", "Auditors frequently mentioned the lack of modern, integrated financial  management systems in their fiscal year 2002 audit reports.  As shown in  figure 4, auditors for 12 of the 19 agencies with noncompliant systems  reported this as a problem.  For example, auditors for DOT reported that its  major agencies still use the Departmental Accounting and Financial  Information System (DAFIS), the existing departmentwide accounting  system and cannot produce auditable financial statements based on the  information in DAFIS.  For example, DOT\u2019s IG reported that DOT made  about 860 adjustments outside of DAFIS totaling $51 billion in order to  prepare the financial statements.  DOT\u2019s IG also reported that there were  problems linking some information between DAFIS and the Federal  Highway Administration\u2019s Fiscal Management Information System (FMIS).   DOT uses FMIS to record initial obligations for federal aid grants to states.   However, due to problems resulting from upgrades and changes made to  the FMIS system, all obligations are not electronically transferred from  FMIS to DAFIS.  As of September 30, 2002, valid obligations of about   $388 million were understated.  Moreover, problems linking information  also existed between Delphi, DOT\u2019s new financial management system, and  the Federal Transit Administration\u2019s (FTA) financial feeder systems that  prevented FTA from electronically processing about $350 million in  payments related to its Electronic Clearing House Operation.  These  transactions had to be manually processed into Delphi.  What is important  here is that the information developed to prepare auditable annual financial  statements is not available on an ongoing basis for day-to-day management  of DOT\u2019s programs and operations.", "As we have reported, cultural resistance to change, military service  parochialism, and stovepiped operations have played a significant role in  impeding previous attempts to implement broad-based reforms at DOD.   The department\u2019s stovepiped approach is most evident in its current  financial management systems environment, which DOD recently  estimated to include approximately 2,300 systems and systems  development projects\u2014many of which were developed in piecemeal  fashion and evolved to accommodate different organizations, each with its  own policies and procedures.

For  example, the HHS IG reported that the department\u2019s lack of an integrated  financial management system continues to impair the ability of certain  operating divisions to prepare timely information.  Moreover, certain  reconciliation processes were not adequately performed to ensure that  differences are properly identified, researched, and resolved in a timely  manner and that account balances were complete and accurate.   Reconciliations are needed to ensure that data has been recorded properly  between the various systems and manual records.

Treasury policy requires agencies to reconcile their  accounting records with Treasury records monthly, which is comparable to  individuals reconciling their checkbooks to their monthly bank statements.   As we recently testified, DOD had at least $7.5 billion in unexplained  differences between Treasury and DOD fund activity records.  Many of  these differences represent disbursements made and reported to Treasury  that had not yet been properly matched to obligations and recorded in DOD  accounting records.  In addition to these unreconciled amounts, DOD  identified and reported an additional $3.6 billion in payment recording  errors.  These include disbursements that DOD has specifically identified  as containing erroneous or missing information and that cannot be  properly recorded and charged against the correct, valid fund account.

For several years, OMB and Treasury have required CFO Act  agencies to reconcile selected intragovernmental activity and balances  with their trading partners.  However, a substantial number of CFO Act  agencies did not perform such reconciliations for fiscal years 2002 and  2001, citing such reasons as (1) trading partners not providing needed data,  (2) limitations and incompatibility of agency and trading partner systems,  and (3) human resource issues.

Any framework should  support an understanding of the links between performance, budgeting,  and accounting information measured and reported for different purposes.   However, even the most meaningful links between performance results and  resources consumed are only as good as the underlying data.  Moreover,  this link between resources consumed and performance results is  necessary to make public-private competition decisions as part of  competitive sourcing.

As shown by our work and work performed by the IGs,  security program management continues to be a widespread problem.   Concerned with reports of significant weaknesses in federal computer  systems that make them vulnerable to attack, the Congress enacted  Government Information Security Reform provisions (commonly known  as GISRA) to reduce these risks and provide more effective oversight of  federal information security.  GISRA required agencies to implement an  information security program that is founded on a continuing risk  management cycle and largely incorporates existing security policies found  in OMB Circular A-130, Management of Federal Information Resources,  Appendix III.  GISRA provided an overall framework for managing  information security and established new annual review, independent  evaluation, and reporting requirements to help ensure agency  implementation and both OMB and congressional oversight.", "In its required fiscal year 2002 GISRA report to the Congress, OMB stated  that the federal government had made significant strides in addressing  serious and pervasive information technology security problems, but that  more needed to be done, particularly to address both the governmentwide  weaknesses identified in its fiscal year 2001 report to the Congress and new  challenges.  Also, OMB reported significant progress in agencies\u2019  information technology security performance, primarily as indicated by  quantitative governmentwide performance measures that OMB required  agencies to disclose beginning with their fiscal year 2002 reports. These  include measures such as the number of systems that have been assessed  for risk, have an up-to-date security plan, and for which security controls  have been tested.", "As discussed in our June 2003 testimony, the governmentwide  weaknesses identified by OMB, as well as the limited progress in  implementing key information security requirements, continue to  emphasize that, overall, agencies are not effectively implementing and  managing their information security programs.

This is an  important distinction because the term \u201cdisclosed no instances\u201d carries a  commonly accepted and well-known interpretation across the audit  community that providing negative assurance requires only limited testing  because the auditor is not giving an opinion on whether the systems are  substantially compliant.", "While work performed in auditing financial statements would naturally  offer some perspective regarding FFMIA compliance, the work needed to  assess substantial compliance of systems with FFMIA would have to be  more comprehensive than that performed for purposes of rendering an  opinion on the financial statements.  In performing financial statement  audits, auditors generally focus on the capability of the financial  management systems to process and summarize financial information that  flows into the financial statements.  In contrast, FFMIA is much broader,  and auditors need to consider many other aspects of the financial  management system including whether an agency\u2019s systems comply with  systems requirements and provide reliable, useful, and timely financial- related information for managing day-to-day operations.  FFMIA was  designed to identify weaknesses and lead to system improvements that  would result in agency managers being routinely provided with reliable,  useful, and timely financial-related information to measure performance  and increase accountability throughout the year, rather than just at year- end.  One important consideration is that the law does not specify when  FFMIA compliance testing must be done.  Thus, auditors can perform  FFMIA assessments at any time throughout the fiscal year, as long as the  assessment is updated to the end of the reporting period.  FFMIA  assessments can be a separate review that could be staggered throughout  the year when the auditors\u2019 workloads are not as burdensome or to spread  out the work.", "Today, for some agencies, the auditor may have sufficient knowledge to  conclude that an agency is not in substantial compliance with FFMIA  without performing additional testing beyond that needed for the financial  statement audit opinion, because systems deficiencies are well known and  well documented.  Because not all areas were tested, additional  weaknesses might exist that were not identified and reported.  However, as  agencies\u2019 systems move toward substantial compliance with FFMIA,  auditors will need to perform more comprehensive testing to assess  agencies\u2019 systems compliance with FFMIA.", "In addition to recommending that OMB require agency auditors to provide  a statement of positive assurance when reporting substantial compliance,  we also previously recommended that OMB (1) explore further  clarifications of the definition of \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d to help ensure  consistent application of the term, (2) reiterate that the indicators of  compliance in its January 4, 2001, guidance are not meant to be all  inclusive, (3) develop additional guidance, in accordance with the  GAO/PCIE FAM, to specify procedures that auditors should perform  when assessing FFMIA compliance, and (4) emphasize the importance of  cost accounting to managers by requesting that auditors pay special  attention to agencies\u2019 ability to meet the requirements of SFFAS No. 4,  Managerial Cost Accounting Concepts and Standards.", "As mentioned previously, PCIE, working with GAO, has issued a new  section of its joint GAO/PCIE FAM that provided detailed audit steps for  testing agency systems\u2019 substantial compliance with FFMIA.  The new FAM  guidance also emphasized the importance of assessing cost management  and reiterated that OMB\u2019s indicators of compliance were examples and  therefore are not all-inclusive.

As stated in its comments on a draft of  this report, OMB disagreed with our recommendation that it require agency  auditors to provide a statement of positive assurance when reporting that  agency systems substantially comply with FFMIA.  OMB stated that, in its  view, positive assurance does not measure the quality or usefulness of the  financial information.  To the contrary, in our view, positive assurance can  lead to improvements in both the quality and usefulness of the financial  information by providing a higher standard for the auditors\u2019 FFMIA  assessment.  In response to our reaffirmation of our recommendation to  clarify the meaning of substantial compliance so that agency auditors and  management can consistently interpret the term, OMB commented that  clear performance and results standards are better at promoting such  consistency.

According to OMB\u2019s former Associate Director for Information Technology  and e-Government, agencies have experienced lengthy or delayed  deployment schedules and implementation cost overruns.  These delays  were caused by various factors, including a lack of executive level  involvement, poor communication between managers and users, and  inadequate project planning.  Our work at NASA and DOD, for example,  has also shown the need for consistent executive support, communication  with all stakeholders, full identification of user requirements, and adequate  planning.", "Federal agencies, such as NASA and DOD, have experienced many of these  challenges in attempting to implement new financial management systems.

However, earlier  this year we reported that NASA\u2019s core financial module was not being  implemented to accommodate the information needed by program  managers, cost estimators, and the Congress.  The need for ongoing  communication between project managers and systems users is crucial to  any successful systems implementation project.   Project managers need to  understand the basic requirements of users while users should be involved  in the project\u2019s planning process.  NASA\u2019s program officials chose to defer  the development of some functions and related user requirements in order  to expedite the systems implementation process.

Performance-based budgeting  can help shift the focus of debate from inputs to outcomes and results,  enhancing the government\u2019s ability to gauge performance and assess  competing claims for scarce resources.  While budget reviews have always  involved discussions of program performance, such discussions have not  always been conducted in a common language or with transparency.  Last  year, the administration introduced a formal assessment tool into its  deliberations, PART, that is the central element of the PMA\u2019s performance  budgeting initiative.  PART represents a step toward more structured  involvement of program and performance analysis in the budget and  includes general questions on (1) program purpose and design, (2) strategic  planning, (3) program management, and (4) program results.  It also  includes a set of more specific questions that vary according to the type of  delivery mechanism or approach the program uses, and calls for timely,  reliable data to perform those assessments.", "PART was applied during the fiscal year 2004 budget cycle to 234  \u201cprograms.\u201d  OMB\u2019s four-point scale rated programs as \u201ceffective,\u201d  \u201cmoderately effective,\u201d \u201cadequate,\u201d or \u201cineffective\u201d based on program  design, strategic planning, management, and results.

The  administration plans to review approximately one-fifth of all federal  programs every year, so that every program will have been evaluated using  PART by the fiscal year 2008 budget submission.", "PART could be useful in focusing discussions about progress toward  planned performance; about what progress has been made toward  achieving specific program goals and objectives; and about what tools and  strategies may be used to bring about improvements.  Furthermore,  performance budgeting should not be expected to provide the answers to  resource allocation questions in some automatic or formula-driven  process.  Because budgeting is the allocation of resources, it involves  setting priorities\u2014making choices among competing claims.  Performance  information is an important factor, but it cannot substitute for difficult  political choices.  It can, however, help move the debate to a more  informed plane\u2014one in which the focus is on competing claims and  priorities.

Due to these  difficulties, the Congress enacted legislation mandating a study of the  government\u2019s competitive sourcing process.  In April 2002, following a  yearlong study, the Commercial Activities Panel (CAP), chaired by the  Comptroller General, reported its findings on competitive sourcing in the  federal government.  The report lays out 10 sourcing principles and several  recommendations, which provide a road map for improving sourcing  decisions across the federal government.  On May 29, 2003, OMB issued a  revised Circular A-76 to simplify and improve the procedures for evaluating  public and private sources.  Overall, the revised circular is generally  consistent with the CAP principles and recommendations.", "Implementing the revised circular, however, will likely be challenging.   Agencies will need to consider how competitive sourcing relates to the  other four PMA crosscutting initiatives.  For example, accurate cost  information from financial management systems and other sources clearly  will be needed to make reliable cost calculations in conducting public- private competitions.", "DOD has been at the forefront of federal agencies in using the A-76 process  and, since the mid-to-late 1990s, we have tracked DOD\u2019s progress in  implementing its A-76 program. While the revised circular includes a major  section on calculating public-private competition costs, DOD\u2019s experiences  with public-private competitions suggest important lessons on financial  calculations that agencies should consider as they implement their  competitive sourcing initiatives.  Notably, we have found that costs and  resources required for the competitions were underestimated, and  determining and maintaining reliable estimates of savings were difficult.", "In addition, DOD\u2019s IG recently issued a report regarding errors in a  public/private competition for the department\u2019s military retired and  annuitant pay functions.  Although DOD awarded the contract to a private  contractor, more accurate cost estimates may have led to a different  decision.  The cost estimate for performing this function in-house included  $33.7 million of overhead costs.  In calculating this estimate, DOD followed  OMB Circular A-76 guidance that required the department to use the  standard 12 percent cost factor for overhead costs.  This was because DOD  had not developed and submitted for OMB approval a reliable overhead  factor for the department.  The DOD IG stated that using the mandatory  overhead factor affected the results of the competition because a reduced  overhead cost factor would have lowered the in-house cost estimate.   According to the IG, two of the main premises of OMB Circular A-76 cost  comparison studies are fairness of the competitions and achieving realistic  cost savings.

To achieve the financial management  improvements envisioned by the CFO Act, FFMIA, and more recently, the  PMA, agencies need to modernize their financial management systems to  generate reliable, useful, and timely financial information throughout the  year and at year-end.  Meeting the requirements of FFMIA presents long- standing, significant challenges that will be attained only through time,  investment, and sustained emphasis on correcting deficiencies in federal  financial management systems.", "To provide positive assurance when reporting on compliance with FFMIA,  auditors need to perform detailed audit procedures that are more  comprehensive than those necessary to render an opinion in a financial  statement audit.  Such an assessment of an agency\u2019s financial management  system is essential to improving the performance, productivity, and  efficiency of federal financial management and achieving the PMA.  If  auditors do more comprehensive testing for FFMIA compliance, as  described in the GAO/PCIE FAM, they will be able to provide positive  assurance when reporting on substantial compliance with FFMIA, which is  what we believe the law requires.  Therefore, we reaffirm our prior  recommendation that OMB require agency auditors to provide a statement  of positive assurance when reporting an agency\u2019s systems to be in  substantial compliance with FFMIA.  While the current language that  auditors are using to report substantial compliance with FFMIA may have  useful applications, it is not relevant or appropriate given the requirements  of FFMIA.  The term \u201cdisclosed no instances\u201d carries a commonly accepted  and well-known interpretation among the audit community that only  limited testing is required because the auditor is not giving an opinion on  whether the systems are substantially compliant.    However, our concern is  that this type of reporting may give the general public the false impression  that the systems have been found to be substantially compliant.  We also  reaffirm our other prior recommendation for OMB to explore further  clarification of the definition of \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d in its FFMIA  guidance to encourage consistent reporting among agency auditors.  As we  stated last year, auditors we interviewed had concerns about providing  positive assurance in reporting on agency systems\u2019 FFMIA compliance  because of a need for clarification regarding the meaning of substantial  compliance.", "Agencies that do not have integrated financial systems typically must  expend major efforts and resources to develop information that their  systems should be able to provide on a daily and recurring basis.  Across  government, agencies have many efforts underway to implement or  upgrade financial systems to alleviate long-standing weaknesses in  financial management.  However, the size and complexity of many federal  agencies and the discipline needed to upgrade or replace their financial  management systems present a significant challenge.  While progress  continues to be made to improve financial management systems, for some  agencies there is a long way to go.  To be successful, agencies need to  identify the root causes as to why systems have these continuing financial  management weaknesses.", "The widespread systems problems facing the federal government need  sustained management commitment at the highest levels of government.  Today, we are seeing a strong commitment from the President, the JFMIP  Principals, and the secretaries of major departments, such as DOD\u2014which  has taken positive steps to transform its business operations and systems\u2014 to ensuring that needed modernization efforts come to fruition.  This  commitment is critical to the success of these efforts underway, as well as  those still in a formative stage, to achieve the goals of the CFO Act and  FFMIA."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In written comments (reprinted in app. VI) on a draft of this report, OMB  agreed with our view that financial management success encompasses  more than agencies receiving unqualified opinions on their financial  statements.  However, as indicated by its comments, OMB and GAO  continue to have a philosophical difference as to the breadth and nature of  activities related to FFMIA compliance.  In discussing FFMIA compliance,  OMB focuses on the compliance requirements of FFMIA.  We have a  broader view when considering agency systems\u2019 FFMIA compliance.  From  our viewpoint, the primary purpose of FFMIA is to ensure that agency  financial management systems routinely provide reliable, useful, and timely  financial information for managerial decision making on a day-to-day basis.   With such information, government leaders will be better positioned to  invest resources, reduce costs, oversee programs, and hold agency  managers accountable for the way they run government programs.  By  enacting FFMIA, Congress envisioned that agency managers would have  necessary financial information to measure performance on an ongoing  basis rather than just at year-end.  Financial management systems\u2019  compliance with federal financial management systems requirements,  applicable accounting standards, and the SGL at the transaction level are  the building blocks to help achieve these goals.", "Specifically, OMB disagreed with our recommendation that OMB require  agency auditors to provide a statement of positive assurance when  reporting that agency systems substantially comply with FFMIA.  OMB  stated that, in its view, positive assurance does not measure the quality or  usefulness of the financial information.  To the contrary, positive assurance  does provide a more meaningful measure of the quality and usefulness of  the financial information by providing a higher standard for the auditors\u2019  FFMIA assessment.  When providing negative assurance with FFMIA,  auditors state that nothing came to their attention indicating that these  agencies\u2019 financial management systems did not substantially meet FFMIA  requirements.  Providing positive assurance, as we believe the law requires,  means that the auditors must report unequivocally whether the agency  financial management systems substantially comply with the act\u2019s  requirements.  OMB also pointed out that preliminary data suggest such an  additional reporting burden would raise audit costs without a  commensurate improvement in financial information.  As discussed in the  FAM, there are a number of techniques auditors could use to minimize the  burden and associated cost of providing positive assurance.  For example,  under 31 U.S.C. 3512(c),(d) (commonly referred to as the Federal  Managers\u2019 Financial Integrity Act of 1982 (FIA)), agency management is  responsible for systematically developing, assessing, and reporting on  internal controls and financial management systems.  Auditors can review  the related FIA documentation to determine the degree of reliance that can  be placed on management\u2019s FIA process.  Depending on the thoroughness  and completeness of the annual FIA assessment of agency financial  management systems done by management, auditors may not need to  significantly increase their workload to provide positive assurance.", "In its comments, OMB also stated that FFMIA compliance is determined by  the agency head, after considering all relevant information, including the  results of the independent audit.  While we agree that the law requires  agency heads to make an FFMIA determination, the auditor\u2019s FFMIA  assessment is a key element of this FFMIA determination due to auditor  independence.  The act specifically states that the determination should be  based on a review of the auditor\u2019s report on the applicable agencywide  audited financial statements as well as other information the agency head  considers relevant and appropriate.  Moreover, as the legislative history  shows, Congress intended to use the financial statement audit process to  assure that FFMIA\u2019s requirements are implemented and maintained in  agency financial management systems.  As with financial statement audits,  an auditor\u2019s FFMIA assessment provides an objective and independent  view of an agency systems\u2019 compliance with FFMIA.", "OMB, in reference to our recommendation that it explore further  clarifications of the definition of \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d to help ensure  the consistent application of this term, suggested that clear performance  and results standards are better at promoting such consistency.  OMB  added that it will consider our recommendation in that context in any  future policy and guidance updates.  As we previously reported, auditors  we interviewed that performed FFMIA assessments saw a need for  clarification of the meaning of substantial compliance to help them  perform the assessments.", "OMB also stated that the report overlooks progress agencies have made  across all areas of IT security performance measures.  Similarly, in its fiscal  year 2002 report to the Congress, OMB reported that the federal  government had made significant strides in addressing serious and  pervasive IT security problems, but that much work remained.  However,  our analyses of governmentwide performance measures showed more  limited progress.  Further, our analyses of individual agency reports  showed that significant challenges remained in implementing information  security requirements.  OMB also commented that this progress has been  demonstrated in the federal government\u2019s general success in withstanding  malicious code activity.  As we recently testified, the federal government  has taken several steps to address security vulnerabilities that affect  federal agency systems, but we identified additional steps that can be taken  to address software vulnerabilities.", "In its comments, OMB stated that we should limit the scope of this report  to agencies\u2019 efforts to implement and maintain financial systems that  comply with the act in fulfilling our statutory requirement to report  annually on FFMIA compliance.  We disagree with OMB\u2019s view that this  report includes considerable information that is not germane to our  statutory reporting requirements.  To the contrary, the governmentwide  financial management improvement efforts, discussed in our report, have a  direct impact on agency systems\u2019 compliance with FFMIA and provide  additional context on the importance of financial management systems in  achieving certain initiatives.  For example, the e-payroll effort, part of the e- gov initiative, if successful, should substantially reduce the number of  individual agency payroll systems, which affects agencies\u2019 financial  systems architecture and the flow of information through their financial  management systems.  Similarly, as we discuss in the report, PART  represents a step toward more structured involvement of program and  performance analysis in the budget.  This initiative is dependent upon  meaningful links between performance results and resources consumed  that are supported by reliable, useful, and timely underlying information,  including financial data.  In our view, it will be difficult, if not impossible, to  achieve success with these governmentwide financial management  improvement efforts without the modernization of agency financial  systems envisioned by the CFO Act and FFMIA.", "OMB and several agencies also provided other technical comments that we  incorporated as appropriate.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Chairman and Ranking Minority  Member, Subcommittee on Financial Management, the Budget, and  International Security, Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs; and to  the Chairman and Ranking Minority Member, Subcommittee on  Government Efficiency and Financial Management, House Committee on  Government Reform.
