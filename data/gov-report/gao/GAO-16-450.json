Specifically, Air Force Air Logistics Complexes (ALC) and Navy Fleet Readiness Centers (FRC) transferred all retail supply, storage, and distribution functions to DLA over the course of several years. For example, according to officials and GAO's assessment, these changes have led to a number of benefits, including a 20 percent reduction in on-hand inventory and a 10 percent reduction in backorders at the Air Force ALCs over a 5-year period (see figure for examples of benefits).", "By contrast, the Army and Marine Corps have retained most supply functions at their depots and DLA manages inventory at the Navy shipyards while still using Navy systems and processes, rather than those of DLA. The Navy and DLA began to transition to DLA business processes and systems at Norfolk Naval Shipyard in 2012, but the Navy reversed course after 7 months when it resulted in increased waits for inventory and work stoppages. Meanwhile, DLA is pursuing limited steps to improve retail supply, storage, and distribution functions at the industrial sites to improve supply support and overcome service concerns. However, the Department of Defense (DOD), DLA, Army, Navy shipyards, and the Marine Corps have not conducted business case analyses on the benefit of additional transfers of retail functions, though the Army is planning to conduct one. Without such analyses, decision makers will not be positioned to ensure that further transfers of retail functions, if warranted, are efficient and effective.", "DOD, DLA and the services have some internal efficiency measures, but they generally do not have metrics that would allow for more effective and efficient management of supply and maintenance operations.

Inventory management, a key component of the DOD supply chain, is the  process of determining requirements and procuring, managing,  cataloging, distributing, overhauling, and disposing of materiel.  Management and oversight of DOD inventory is a responsibility shared  among the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and  Logistics, DLA, and the services.

These actions were intended to improve the efficiency of the supply chain  by reducing the number of supply distribution warehouses and related  excess capacity while enhancing the effectiveness of logistics support by  reconfiguring DOD\u2019s wholesale supply, storage, and distribution network  and consolidating functions at several service maintenance sites.  Traditionally, DLA had been DOD\u2019s wholesale inventory manager for  consumable items; however, the transfer of supply, storage, and  distribution functions at the depot maintenance industrial sites, as  recommended by BRAC, placed DLA in the role of managing consumable  items at the retail level. As a wholesale inventory manager, DLA procures  consumable items from commercial vendors and stores them in  distribution warehouses to be requisitioned by the retail supply system,  which is typically managed by the services. As a retail inventory manager  at industrial sites, DLA manages the supply, storage, and distribution of  consumable items at the industrial site and provides the items directly to  the user (e.g., the depot artisan working to repair a weapon system).  While sharing some similarities, the management of inventory at the  wholesale and retail levels has a different focus\u2014namely placing DLA in  a direct, prominent role supporting service depot-level maintenance.  Specifically, DLA, as a wholesale inventory manager, is typically  replenishing retail inventory stocks, but as a retail inventory manager at  the industrial sites DLA must have the part when it is needed; otherwise,  there are operational effects to the depot maintenance being conducted  on the end item being repaired.", "In 2007, 2008, and 2009, we reviewed the implementation of the supply,  storage, and distribution BRAC recommendation and reported that a  number of the assumptions used by the BRAC commission to calculate  the potential cost savings of this recommendation were not validated and  relied on flawed data, and that DLA faced numerous challenges in  implementing the recommendation. For example, service officials  expressed concerns that inserting DLA into depot operations may hinder  their ability to meet depot production schedules and maintain equipment  readiness. However, we did not make any recommendations pertaining to  the transfer of supply, storage, and distribution functions at the industrial  sites in those reports given that DLA\u2019s planning process incorporated  several key elements that were intended to provide a smooth transition  and mitigate the risk of disrupting depot operations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Depot Maintenance Process", "paragraphs": ["The depot maintenance process across the services generally involves  three primary steps\u2013planning, disassembly, and rebuilding\u2013as shown in  figure 2 below.", "Step 1: The depot maintenance process begins by planning the  maintenance to be conducted on a particular end item, which could be  a weapon system (e.g., C-5 Galaxy cargo plane, M1A2 Abrams tank)  or depot-level reparable (e.g., a ship blade propeller, brake  assembly). Initially, a detailed statement of the specific work to be  performed is developed for the end item. Once this scope of work is  decided upon, a number of key planning factors are necessary to  identify the materials and spare parts needed for the maintenance: (1)  the number of end items to go through maintenance, (2) the schedule  for inducting the end items into maintenance, (3) the bill of materials  (i.e., the list and quantity of parts needed to conduct the maintenance  on the end item), and (4) the replacement factors (i.e., the estimated  frequency of replacement based on historical trends and engineering  estimates) for the parts on the bill of materials. These planning  factors are used to forecast the spare parts needed to conduct the  maintenance on the end item, as shown in figure 3 below. Proactive  and accurate planning is necessary to ensure the timely availability of  spare parts for the maintenance process, especially since the  acquisition lead time for spare parts can range from days to years  depending upon the specific part. However, in 2011, 2013, and  2015, we found that part shortages was one of several factors  negatively affecting the industrial sites\u2019 ability to complete  maintenance timely and efficiently. Accurate planning is also  important in preventing the accumulation of excess inventory.", "Step 2: Once the end item is inducted into the maintenance process it  is disassembled. During this step, the end item and its components  are inspected to determine the type and degree of repair required or  whether the parts need to be replaced. While some parts are always  replaced, other parts are assessed for repair. Repairs vary by the time  and type of use since the last overhaul. Because usage differs from  end item to end item, demands on the supply chain for new and  repaired items varies.", "Step 3: Following disassembly, the end item is then rebuilt with new  and repaired parts. In general, the rebuilding of the end item follows a  sequential process, necessitating the timely availability of new and  repaired parts to ensure the efficient reassembly of the end item. Part  shortages (i.e., backorders) require workarounds\u2013additional efforts to  obtain a part (e.g., local manufacturing or obtaining parts from another  end item)\u2013that can delay maintenance and negatively affect  productivity and costs of depot maintenance. Once the end item is  rebuilt, then it is tested and validated for sale to and use by the  customer (e.g., a military unit).", "Navy F/A-18 Hornet Maintenance  One of the primary end items repaired at  Fleet Readiness Center (FRC) Southwest  and FRC Southeast is the F/A-18 Hornet.  The first aircraft was manufactured in the late  1970s and became operational in the early  1980s. As an aircraft ages, it incurs additional  inspections and structural repairs. One of  those additional inspections occurs when an  aircraft reaches 8,000 flying hours.", "DOD\u2019s aging weapon systems pose sustainment challenges that affect  depot maintenance as well as supply support, especially for aircraft.  Depot maintenance on aging weapon systems becomes less predictable  as structural fatigue occurs and parts that were not expected to need  replacement begin to wear out. Cracking, corrosion, or other  unanticipated issues\u2013identified through detailed inspections\u2013must be  remedied through the repair or the manufacture of new parts, often  requiring engineering support and estimates that can take considerable  time to develop. For example, the Navy F/A-18 Hornet jet and Air Force  B-52 Stratofortress bomber\u2013both aging weapon systems\u2013have recently  experienced unanticipated structural and part replacement issues (see  sidebar for information on the F/A-18 Hornet). Additionally, diminishing  manufacturing sources and material shortages, and part obsolescence  issues increase as weapon systems age, complicating supply support  for the depot maintenance process and potentially resulting in a less  efficient process if not properly mitigated or resolved. Manufacturers  discontinue production and support of needed items because it is no  longer profitable to produce the part given low or sporadic demand.  DOD\u2019s diminishing manufacturing sources and material shortages  guidebook provides guidance on mitigating and managing these issues  as well as examples in which the department successfully managed and  resolved these issues, such as parts obsolescence for the B-1 Lancer  bomber and the Virginia class submarine. of the aircraft to identify structural  weaknesses, such as metal fatigue and  cracks in the aircraft, and determine what  needs to be repaired.    engineering support to develop repair  solutions for the damaged areas of the  aircraft.

According to DLA and service officials,  this arrangement has allowed DLA to see real-time demand signals rather  than waiting for the demand signal to occur when the retail level  requisitions inventory from DLA\u2019s wholesale inventory stocks. This means  that DLA can make adjustments to its forecast for parts as soon as  changes are known, which can reduce the wait times for parts and help  prevent the accumulation of excess inventory. Navy, Air Force, and DLA  officials stated that the transfer of retail supply, storage, and distribution  functions to DLA at the FRCs and ALCs has allowed them to reduce the  amount of on-hand inventory, increase warehouse efficiencies, enhance  information-sharing and coordination between maintenance and supply,  and improve supply performance outcomes such as decreased  backorders or increased throughput.", "A 2014 study sponsored by the Assistant Secretary of Defense for  Logistics and Materiel Readiness also identified specific benefits from  transferring retail supply, storage, and distribution functions at ALCs and  FRCs as well, such as reduced inventory levels and lower storage  costs. These have been evidenced in aggregate performance  measures, as noted in figure 5. Specifically, over a five-year period  between January 2010 and April 2015, DLA data shows that the ALCs  experienced a 20 percent reduction in on-hand inventory while also  reducing backorders by 10 percent, and reducing the number of end  items awaiting parts by 20 percent. FRCs saw a 6 percent reduction in  on-hand inventory during 2014 without overall degradation to other  performance measures such as order fill rates and material availability. In  addition, the number of backorders decreased across all Navy FRCs by  about 28 percent during fiscal year 2015. Officials we spoke with at the  FRCs also stated that DLA participation in retail supply management has  resulted in more efficient replenishment of consumable items used on the  shop floor and less time awaiting parts. Site-specific improvements have  also been realized. For example, Warner Robins ALC officials attributed a  decrease in unused spare parts stored on the production line, which  increase costs, create excess stock, and take up production floor space,  to DLA management of retail supply, storage, and distribution functions.", "While many of the benefits realized are quantifiable, officials also stated  that there are qualitative benefits from transferring retail supply, storage,  and distribution functions to DLA. For example, Air Force and DLA  officials we spoke with at Warner Robins ALC stated that having DLA  personnel and Air Force personnel integrated and co-located at the shop  floor results in a great deal of information sharing. This allows supply  planners to identify potential changes to inventory demand patterns  before aggregate data may exist to indicate changes affecting  procurement actions. This is especially important for items that have long  lead times for production, or are relatively expensive to procure.  Specifically, identifying an upward tick in demand as early as possible  may allow backorders for items with long lead times to be prevented, and  identifying downward ticks in demand may allow the purchase of  expensive items to be avoided.", "According to officials we spoke with, initial transfer efforts at ALCs and  FRCs encountered some difficulties related to the adoption of DLA  systems and processes, and some personnel were reluctant to trust DLA  at first. However, they noted that collaborative efforts were made to  overcome challenges and foster an atmosphere of trust. Additionally, DLA  tailored its processes and approach for retail supply support to align with  the maintenance processes that are unique at the FRCs and ALCs. For  example, the metrics used to monitor DLA\u2019s performance at the ALCs and  FRCs are different given some differences in the maintenance processes  and approaches. Furthermore, based on the lessons learned from these  implementations, DLA developed a DLA Retail Supply Chain Materiel  Management Policy to establish policies, assign responsibilities, and  implement high-level procedures for DLA\u2019s management of retail supply,  storage, and distribution functions at applicable industrial sites to  incorporate lessons learned from DLA\u2019s management of the retail supply,  storage, and distribution functions at the ALCs and FRCs.

The small number of DLA personnel on site makes it  difficult to engage in the constant information sharing seen at the Air  Force ALCs and Navy FRCs given the volume of parts used by the  depots. For example, there are only four DLA personnel on site to  perform customer service functions at Anniston Army Depot and three  DLA personnel on site to perform similar functions at the Marine Corps  industrial site in Albany, Georgia. About 30 DLA personnel perform  storage functions at the retail inventory warehouses at each of these  locations, but decisions affecting supply functions are made by Army and  Marine Corps officials. In contrast, there are about 200 DLA personnel at  Warner Robins ALC, and about 120 DLA personnel at Cherry Point FRC  participating in all aspects of supply, storage, and distribution.", "The Navy nominally transferred its retail supply, storage, and distribution  functions at the Navy shipyards to DLA resulting in DLA detachments with  hundreds of previously Navy personnel that are largely co-located with  the actual maintenance activities at the shipyards. However, the  shipyards continue to use the same retail supply, storage, and distribution  processes and Navy information systems that existed prior to the transfer.  In January 2012, the Navy attempted to fully transfer its retail supply,  storage, and distribution functions to DLA at Norfolk Naval Shipyard by  implementing DLA information technology systems and transferring  ownership of all inventory to DLA. However, after 7 months, the Navy and  DLA agreed to revert back to the previous processes, systems, and Navy  ownership of the inventory after seeing increases in the time to issue  retail inventory to the maintenance area which resulted in some work  stoppages.", "Ineffective Leadership and Program  Management: Inconsistent leadership  engagement, insufficient training and  communication, and lack of clear  responsibilities and accountability for the  outcome. For example, DLA had no clear  operational control during implementation.   Insufficient Preparation: End-to-end  testing was insufficient and not focused  on end-user functionality, a complete  inventory was not conducted prior to  conversion of inventory to DLA, and  simultaneous testing, training, and  modifications to the system led to an  unstable data environment.", "Cultural Resistance: A shared vision of  end-state operations was not established  among stakeholders, a perception existed  among shipyard personnel that their  business processes were not supposed to  change, and personnel interviewed stated  that there was an atmosphere of distrust  between the shipyard and DLA.", "According to a Naval Sea Systems Command investigation, the attempt  to transfer functions failed for a variety of reasons (see sidebar). In  addition, Navy and DLA officials stated that implementation encountered  cultural resistance to change at Norfolk Naval Shipyard that hindered  successful implementation. Furthermore, the Navy and DLA agreed that  any further transfer of functions at the four shipyards would be halted  indefinitely as of 2012. As a result, the Navy continues to rely on retail  supply, storage and distribution processes in place prior to BRAC 2005.  Officials at Norfolk Naval Shipyard confirmed that although personnel  transfers did occur to shift retail functions from the Navy to DLA,  personnel participating in retail supply, storage, and distribution functions  continue to use legacy Navy processes rather than DLA processes.", "The investigation concluded that the decision  to reverse the transition to DLA means  shipyards are foregoing the benefits of  automated inventory technology and proven  standard distribution processes (storage and  job aids, standard training) that are built into  DLA processes and systems.", "Throughout the effort to implement the 2005 BRAC supply, storage, and  distribution recommendation, the Army and Marine Corps maintained that  the retail supply functions at the depots are integral to the maintenance  process and therefore should not be transferred to DLA. The Army and  Marine Corps only transferred responsibility for managing some storage  and distribution functions to DLA. As a result, DLA does not make supply  decisions such as determining the items to be stocked and the levels for  those items. This means that decisions between the wholesale and retail  inventory levels are handled by two separate organizations and therefore  produce a delay in demand signals and may not be as easily coordinated.  The Army and Marine Corps officials stated that they are not certain  performance would improve if they transferred additional functions to  DLA, though they are exploring further efforts.", "Army officials expressed concerns about transferring retail supply  functions at the depots to DLA. First, officials stated they were concerned  that some of the efficiencies and effectiveness that are provided by its  information technology system (i.e., the Logistics Modernization Program)  could be lost if it transfers further retail management functions to DLA.  However, the Air Force and Navy successfully integrated their information  technology systems with DLA\u2019s systems at the ALCs and FRCs, and  Army officials told us that the Army has not explored whether this could  be done with the Army\u2019s system as well. In addition, officials we  interviewed at Anniston Army Depot also expressed concern with DLA\u2019s  ability to provide parts to support depot operations, though these  concerns were not based on a comprehensive business case analysis.", "Marine Corps officials also expressed concern about not having control  over supply functions and noted that it plans to take a gradual approach  with respect to further transfer of functions to DLA to ensure that DLA  performs sufficiently. For example, the Marine Corps and DLA are  working together to improve demand planning by establishing a new  organization within Marine Corps Logistics Command that interacts  directly with DLA to improve supply chain performance, such as the  quality of planning information and the availability of spare parts.  However, the Marine Corps depot continues to purchase items from DLA  wholesale and have them store the inventory until it is needed for  maintenance. According to DLA officials this requires the service to invest  in additional inventory, incur storage costs, and experience longer waits  for parts. While the Marine Corps has been able to reduce its amount of  retail inventory since January 2014, the retail inventory warehouse  supporting the Albany Production Plant at the end of fiscal year 2015  contained about 67,000 separate inventory items valued at about $126  million, according to DLA. DLA officials stated that this represents a much  larger amount of retail inventory than is likely needed. While Marine  Corps officials credited this inventory with preventing some backorders,  56 percent of the serviceable retail inventory items at that site had no  demand between March 2015 and March 2016, a potential indicator of  unneeded inventory, although officials noted that some of this materiel  was likely purchased and kept as a result of unexpected schedule  changes.", "Army and Marine Corps depot and Navy shipyard officials state that their  maintenance processes differ from those at the Navy FRCs and Air Force  ALCs. However, while maintenance processes may be tailored from one  industrial site to another depending on the type of end items being  maintained, the basic elements that determine retail inventory needs are  the same. These include determining the number and schedule of end  items to go through maintenance, the bill of materials (i.e., part lists), and  the replacement factors for those parts. Officials also expressed concern  over losing visibility of retail inventory if DLA is allowed to manage retail  warehouses. However, similar concerns were addressed by DLA and  service officials at Warner Robins ALC by allowing officials from both  entities to access each other\u2019s information systems. This has allowed the  Air Force to benefit from tools and expertise available to DLA while  increasing transparency and information-sharing.

Congress, in the  House Report accompanying a bill for the National Defense Authorization  Act for Fiscal Year 2014, mandated the Secretary of Defense conduct an  assessment of the roles and missions of DLA. The assessment made  several recommendations, one of which was for the Office of the  Secretary of Defense and DLA to work with the Army and Marine Corps  to prepare business case analyses on the transfer of retail supply,  storage, and distribution responsibilities to DLA.", "DLA began exploring further transfer of retail management functions at  the Army and Marine Corps depots and Navy shipyards in the spring of  2015. DLA and the Marine Corps have agreed to an inventory  consolidation and optimization effort in support of the Marine Corps\u2019  Albany and Barstow production plants. As a result, DLA has begun to  make adjustments in its approach to supporting these Marine Corps sites,  but the Marine Corps will continue to manage their retail supply function.  According to DOD officials, DLA has also initiated discussions with Army  depot and Navy shipyard officials about the management of retail supply,  storage, and distribution functions.

Officials state this effort  will ultimately include the development of a cost-benefit analysis on  shifting DLA\u2019s point-of-sale to the Army forward to the production line  while retaining the capabilities provided by Army information systems.  However, DLA is taking these preliminary steps without official decisions  by the Army, Marine Corps, and Navy on the optimal level of  management by DLA at the depots and shipyards, respectively. DLA  officials stated that these steps were being taken in an effort to overcome  service reluctance to transferring retail functions to DLA at the depots and  shipyards and achieve further inventory efficiencies across the  department. However, neither the Assistant Secretary of Defense for  Logistics and Materiel Readiness nor the services have prepared a  comprehensive business case analysis\u2013drawing on lessons learned from  previous implementations\u2013that systematically examined the costs,  benefits, risks, and challenges associated with fully transferring supply,  storage, and distribution functions at the Army and Marine Corps depots  and Navy shipyards to DLA.", "DOD guidance states that DOD materiel management shall operate as a  high-performing and agile supply chain responsive to customer  requirements during peacetime and war while balancing risk and total  cost and that the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Logistics and  Materiel Readiness should monitor the overall effectiveness and  efficiency of the DOD materiel management systems and continually  develop improvements. The guidance further states that all costs  associated with materiel management, including acquiring, distributing,  transporting, storing, maintaining, and disposing, shall be considered in  making best value decisions throughout the DOD supply chain. Past GAO  work indicates a standard way to assist in making best value decisions is  the development and use of a comprehensive business case analysis.

For example, FRC Southwest tracks the parts that are cannibalized from  one end item to satisfy a part need on another end item that is further  along in the maintenance process. Warner Robins ALC also tracks similar  information for the weapon systems (e.g., F-15, C-130, and C-5 aircraft)  on which it conducts depot maintenance and reviews this information as  part of supportability analyses that it conducts to improve parts support  for future maintenance on the weapon systems. The Marine Corps  depot maintenance and DLA officials told us that they use an \u201curgent and  emergency requirements impact statement\u201d to request an expedited  purchase for a spare part from DLA. This statement includes the effects  of the part not being available to depot maintenance operations, such as  a line stoppage (i.e., maintenance not being able to continue) and a  reduction in the workforce.

Depot maintenance and DLA officials told us  that there is a general tendency to focus resources and attention on  reacting to backorders (i.e., backorder resolution through workarounds)  as opposed to preventing backorders. In our visits to the Anniston Army  Depot and Oklahoma City ALC we observed depot maintenance  production reviews conducted by senior service officials that  demonstrated this heightened attention to backorder resolution.  According to service and DLA officials, while these workarounds are  needed at times so that work on an end item can be completed in a timely  manner without halting or slowing the maintenance production process,  DLA and the services generally do not fully track the necessary data\u2013 direct costs of the workaround as well as indirect costs such as personnel  dedicated to backorder resolution\u2013that would allow them to calculate,  report, and assess the financial cost or benefit of the workaround.", "In some instances, a backorder cannot be mitigated by a workaround and  changes are required in the depot maintenance process, which is another  type of disruption cost. In other words, depot maintenance and DLA  officials have exhausted all options to obtain a suitable part for  maintenance to continue its work and it must wait for the part to arrive. In  these cases, depot maintenance officials report that they have several  general options for mitigating the effect of an unavailable part.", "Effect of Parts Shortages on High-Mobility  Multi-purpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV)  Depot Maintenance   In June 2013, we found that the depot  maintenance work at Letterkenny and Red  River Army Depots in fiscal years 2011 and  2012 could not be completed when  anticipated due to parts shortages.", "First, the sequence of maintenance can be adjusted so that  maintenance can be continued on the end item. Once the part is  received, then the depot artisan will move forward with the work that  was stalled due to the lack of part.", "Second, depot maintenance officials do as much work as possible,  remove the end item from the maintenance production area once no  more work can be conducted given the lack of parts, and begin work  on another end item up until the same point (see sidebar). Once the  parts are received, then the end items are brought back into the  maintenance production area to finish the maintenance on the end  items.", "Third, depot maintenance officials may decide to stop maintenance on  the end item(s) entirely, redistributing depot artisans to other  maintenance efforts and clearing the production area for new work.", "In order to perform the work on these vehicles,  Letterkenny had to reestablish its production  line which was previously shut down due to  the lack of HMMWV work. Further, both  depots had to hire contractor personnel to  staff the production line and establish a supply  chain so that the depots could obtain the parts  to perform the work.   Both depots encountered problems with  obtaining sufficient quantities of parts, such as  doors, gunner protection kits, windshields,  turret bearings, and half shafts, to perform the  work. This parts problem was exacerbated at  Red River when the depot went to a double  shift on disassembling and assembling the  vehicles in April 2012. As a result of the parts  shortage, the depots assembled 4,254  vehicles but the vehicles were missing parts  and the work had to be carried over into fiscal  year 2013 for completion once the parts were  available.

Furthermore, during our visit to FRC East these officials provided a basic  example of how a depot maintenance operation could articulate the  disruption costs and the effect of those costs. Based on FRC East and  DLA data, FRC East had $26 million in backorders accumulated across  fiscal years 2010\u20132015 that resulted in $131 million in depot-level  reparables being unable to complete repair and be provided back to the  warfighter. This approximate 1 to 5 ratio of backorders to sales revenue  (i.e., the completion of the repair and the sale of the end item to the  warfighter) provides an estimate of the disruption cost of backorders to  the efficiency and effectiveness of depot operations.", "Furthermore, through the process of  establishing these metrics, DOD developed  additional areas for exploration and  improvement, such as improving its guidance  on demand forecasting.", "However, the officials also stated that this estimate of or proxy for the  disruption cost is likely a conservative one because it does not factor in  many of the disruption costs discussed above. For example, the estimate  does not include the costs associated with (1) the time and efforts to  resolve those backorders through workarounds by personnel, (2)  packaging up the dissembled pieces of the end item since maintenance  could not be completed, (3) moving the end item away from the  maintenance area to a storage warehouse, (4) storing the end item until  the necessary part(s) arrive, (5) bringing the end item back to the  production area once the parts arrive, and, lastly, (6) preparing the end  item for the maintenance process to continue.", "A 2014 study sponsored by the Assistant Secretary of Defense for  Logistics and Materiel Readiness found that the costs of not having parts  when they are needed can be considerable and that the department, if  they could measure such costs, might find that the disruption costs of not  having parts are high relative to the costs of steps that would improve  material availability. Based on our work in the area and our visits to 7 of  17 depot maintenance industrial sites, the lack of metrics to track and  assess disruption costs prevents decision makers from understanding the  financial effect of backorders and taking any necessary actions to  systemically mitigate disruption costs. Additionally, service depot  maintenance and DLA officials are unable to make tradeoffs with respect  to investing in stocking additional retail inventory or making improvements  to supply support rather than relying on workarounds that can be costly in  terms of financial and personnel resources, as described in figure 8.", "As a result the services and DLA lack the information necessary to make  decisions about the cost-effective use of limited resources. For example,  the total disruption costs to a depot maintenance industrial site created by  85 percent material availability by DLA may be more costly than the  investments needed to improve the material availability to 90 percent.  However, the department does not track this type of performance  information to guide its decisions in optimizing the cost-effectiveness of  supply and depot maintenance operations.

DOD actions in response to the 2005 BRAC recommendation to  transfer supply, storage, and distribution functions at these sites from the  services to DLA have had some positive effects at the Air Force ALCs  and the Navy FRCs, but the services could take additional steps to  ensure they realize the possible benefits of further transfers of retail  functions. For instance, the Army and Marine Corps depots and Navy  shipyards may benefit from transferring more of their retail supply  functions to DLA. While officials relayed to us the concerns they had  about transferring functions to DLA, they have not fully assessed the  costs and benefits of doing so. Without conducting business case  analyses that, among other things, draw on lessons learned from the  experiences at the ALCs and FRCs\u2014as well as the failed implementation  at Norfolk Naval Shipyard\u2014the Army and Marine Corps depots and Navy  shipyards are not positioned to know what could be gained by further  transferring retail functions to DLA and the department is unable to  determine the degree to which the retail supply functions should be  transferred to DLA.", "Another key step to promoting cost effective and efficient supply support  at the industrial sites is accurate measurement and monitoring of  performance, which can provide insight into an organization\u2019s successful,  and less than successful, strategies.

Similarly,  there may be metrics to more accurately determine the disruption costs of  backorders than the services and DLA are currently using. As we discuss,  disruptions to the orderly flow of work through the maintenance process  may sometimes cost more than taking other steps to avoid such  disruptions\u2014as well as leading to lost productivity and delayed delivery to  the warfighter. Developing metrics to determine the full costs of such  disruptions may be difficult given differences across the services and  involve considerable effort, but the department has demonstrated the  ability to develop and implement metrics that assess complex concepts,  such as demand forecasting accuracy, through establishing a team of  experts to evaluate available data sources and approaches.

The Department of Defense (DOD) uses a coding system\u2013 known as \u201cacquisition advice codes\u201d\u2013to categorize parts according to its  approach for acquiring and stocking them. This includes parts that are  regularly stocked (code \u201cD\u201d), not stocked and must be procured (code  \u201cJ\u201d), directly delivered from vendors (code \u201cH\u201d), or kept on hand in small  quantities, referred to as \u201cinsurance items\u201d (code \u201cZ\u201d), among others.", "As seen in figure 11 above, the majority of DLA\u2019s backorders for spare  parts at service industrial sites are actually for parts coded \u201cD,\u201d which  represent parts that are described by DLA as \u201cstocked.\u201d These are the  parts that, due to their regular demands, are intended to be \u201con the  shelves\u201d on a regular basis. Parts that are supposed to be stocked can  experience backorders if there is a sudden spike in demand or difficulties  with the supply of inventory. These are parts where an increased  investment in inventory may prevent work-disrupting backorders with  minimal risk, since they are parts that DLA expects to sell over time, and  therefore carry less risk to DLA to purchase. DLA officials attributed the  fluctuation in stocked parts and insurance parts in late 2012 and early  2013 to the implementation of new methods for setting inventory levels for  certain parts.", "The second largest category of backorders is comprised of items coded  \u201cZ,\u201d which represent what are called \u201cinsurance items.\u201d These are parts  that are only needed intermittently, and so DLA keeps a nominal quantity  on hand in order to mitigate the effects of long lead times. The relatively  low demand for \u201cZ\u201d coded parts suggests that the backorders could be a  result of the tradeoffs that DOD has to make with respect to inventory  investment and customer service. On the one hand, stocking more of  these inventory parts could conceivably lower these types of backorders.  However, this would entail a larger investment in inventory and would  also increase DLA\u2019s risk of purchasing and paying to store excess  inventory. DLA has to make decisions on which parts are most likely to  be needed by its customers in order to strike a balance between inventory  investment and customer service.", "The remaining parts we analyzed were coded either \u201cJ\u201d or \u201cH.\u201d Code \u201cJ\u201d  parts are considered \u201cnon-stocked\u201d items, which are not generally on the  shelf and are procured only when DLA receives a funded requisition for  the part. In other words, DLA generally does not purchase these parts  based only on a forecast. Code \u201cH\u201d parts are those that are delivered  directly to the customer by a third-party vendor.

With the exception of Red River Army Depot,  which saw an increase of about 7 percent, each of the Army industrial  sites saw backorders for DLA-managed parts fall by at least 35 percent,  while two sites\u2013Corpus Christi and Anniston\u2013saw their backorders fall by  more than 70 percent and 49 percent, respectively. DLA officials  attributed the reductions to a concerted effort at backorder reduction  undertaken within the Land and Maritime supply chains. DLA officials also  noted that while backorders at Red River have increased between fiscal  years 2013 and 2015, backorders there had decreased in fiscal year  2015, which they attributed partially to the implementation of the Army  Supply Plan.", "With respect to the Navy shipyards, changes in the backorders for DLA- managed parts varied at every location from October 2012 through  September 2015, as shown in figure 13 below. For example, Norfolk  Naval Shipyard saw a decrease in backorders of over 60 percent, while  Portsmouth saw a decrease of around 20 percent. Meanwhile, Puget  Sound held relatively steady with an increase in backorders of less than 2  percent, while Pearl Harbor saw its backorders increase by over 40  percent. DLA officials stated that they were not entirely certain why  backorders increased at Pearl Harbor, but speculated that it might be due  to the extended repairs of two Virginia-class submarines during this time  period. DLA officials noted that the high number of backorders for Norfolk  Naval Shipyard in late 2012 were due to the attempted transfer of the  supply function at Norfolk Naval Shipyard to DLA\u2019s information systems  and processes. As previously discussed in this report, DLA and the  Norfolk Naval Shipyard attempted the full transfer of the supply function to  DLA\u2019s information systems and processes, but after 7 months decided to  revert back to Norfolk Naval Shipyard\u2019s information systems and  processes. DLA officials also attributed the spike at Norfolk in September  2014 to increased end-of-year spending by the Navy.", "With respect to the Navy Fleet Readiness Centers (FRCs), backorders for  DLA-managed parts generally increased from October 2012 through  September 2014, as shown in figure 14 below. The Navy FRCs  implemented DLA\u2019s Inventory Management and Stock Positioning (IMSP)  system during this time frame. However, the FRCs made the transition at  different times. San Diego was the first to implement IMSP, in June 2013,  while Jacksonville made the transition to IMSP in late October 2013. By  contrast, Cherry Point did not move to IMSP until March 2014, which  corresponded with a significant increase in backorders. FRC officials at  Cherry Point told us that there was a significant increase in unplanned  workload during that time due to the transition of the AV-88 program from  the commercial sector to Cherry Point. However, the overall trend for all  FRCs has been a steady increase of at least around 40 percent during  the transition, peaking generally in September 2014. This could reflect the  \u201cgrowing pains\u201d of transitioning to IMSP, as Air Force Air Logistics  Complex (ALC) officials noted that it took them more than 2 years to work  through the initial implementation challenges of fully transferring the retail  supply function to DLA\u2019s information systems and processes. As such, it  is not yet clear if the FRCs will experience the same backorder reduction  noted by the ALCs over the 5-year period after they transferred retail  inventory functions to DLA.", "With respect to the Air Force ALCs, backorders for DLA-managed parts  decreased, and in some cases significantly, from October 2012 through  September 2015, as shown in figure 15 below. For example, DLA- managed backorders at Ogden have dropped by more than 40 percent  over the past 3 years. Though not as large, the reductions seen at  Oklahoma City and Warner Robins have also been meaningful, at about  13 percent and 38 percent, respectively. As noted in the report, Air Force  officials attribute their reduced backorders over the past 5 years to the  decision to transfer retail supply, storage, and distribution functions to  DLA.", "With respect to the Marine Corps Production Plants, backorders for DLA- managed parts increased from October 2012 through September 2015,  as shown in figure 16 below. While Albany saw its backorders for DLA- managed items increase by 9 percent over the 3-year period, Barstow\u2019s  backorders increased by over 40 percent during that same time.

Through collaborative forecasting, DLA and  the customer (i.e., the industrial site) work together to evaluate historical  demand data for spare parts and tailor forecast plans for those spare  parts based on projected future usage. Collaborative forecasting is  prospective, in that it uses various planning factors\u2013the repair schedule,  the list of parts required for the repair, and the rates at which those parts  are replaced\u2013to guide inventory management decisions, rather than  DLA\u2019s historical sales data. As part of the 2010 Comprehensive Inventory  Management Improvement Plan, the Department of Defense (DOD)  created a sub-plan to improve inventory forecasting that included  expanding the use of collaborative forecasting. In addition, DOD Manual  4140.01, Vol. 2 requires the use of collaboration to improve the accuracy  of forecasts. In June 2014, we found that DLA\u2019s collaborative forecasting  program had not improved the aggregate forecasting accuracy or used a  comprehensive approach to manage the program and recommended that  the department take steps, such as developing additional performance  metrics and using those metrics to measure and monitor performance  through regular performance management meetings. To address the  recommendation, DLA officials stated that they have begun to consider  additional metrics to assess the performance of the effort, and senior  management has begun to monitor demand forecasting accuracy across  DLA.", "As noted earlier, service industrial sites rely on several key factors when  planning workload, and similar factors\u2013the number of end items that need  repair, parts lists (i.e., bills of materials), and replacement rates\u2013are just  as important when the services develop a collaborative forecast. Each of  the services\u2019 collaborative forecast methods uses these three factors as  the basis to develop their submission to DLA. Some service methods also  have other similarities, as noted in table 1.", "However, while these methods share similar characteristics, they also  differ in some key respects. For example, the methods focus on different  timeframes. The Army Supply Plan looks out 5 years, as does the Air  Force\u2019s method, while Navy Aviation provides data for 2 years. The  services also have different levels of experience using the methods.  Officials noted that the Air Force has been using Demand Data Exchange  since 2009, Navy Aviation has been using its Gross Demand Plan since  2013, and the Army started the Army Supply Plan in late 2014.", "Further, the services do not send the same amount of data to DLA. The  Navy and Army submit all required parts and quantities for all planned  maintenance at the industrial sites to DLA and DLA and the services have  automated and manual processes in place to review these submissions.  Once reviewed, the collaborative forecast submission is used by DLA in  establishing its demand plans. The Air Force and Marine Corps, in  collaboration with DLA, identify items through a manual process and  establish projected forecasts that are used by DLA in establishing its  demand plans. Officials noted that these items are identified based on  anticipated changes in demand or the fact that the item has been  problematic in some fashion.", "Finally, the service forecasting methods are supported in different ways  by DLA. For example, the Army and Navy Aviation both submit a full list  of depot requirements to DLA. However, DLA uses different methods to  support both sets of data; the Army is supported heavily by DLA\u2019s Peak  and Next-Gen level-setting methods, which are designed for items that  are inherently difficult to forecast. However, these methods initially  excluded retail inventory, and so are not as regularly used to support  Navy Aviation.", "As noted in the above table, the services and DLA have developed a  number of different ways of assessing the effectiveness of collaborative  forecasting. The collaborative forecasting mechanisms\u2013specifically the  inputs, outputs, and performance metrics\u2013are all regularly reviewed by  DLA and service personnel. In addition, Office of the Secretary of  Defense officials noted that their future plans for inventory management  involve monitoring and assessing the effectiveness of these different  collaborative forecasting mechanisms.", "Background  We reviewed a number of depot  improvement efforts the services  have underway.  While some  officials described these as  \u201cleading\u201d or \u201cbest\u201d practices, we did  not assess the extent to which  these efforts made concrete  improvements to inventory  outcomes, in part due to the  difficulty of separating causal  factors from the large number of  variables involved.
