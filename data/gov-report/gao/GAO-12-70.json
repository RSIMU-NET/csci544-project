However, concerns remain about the radioactive spent fuel that nuclear reactors generate. The Department of Energy (DOE) issued a research and development (R&D) plan to select nuclear fuel cycles and technologies, some of which reprocess spent fuel and recycle some nuclear material, such as plutonium. These fuel cycles may help reduce the generation of spent fuel and risks of nuclear proliferation and terrorism. GAO was asked to review (1) DOE's approach to selecting nuclear fuel cycles and technologies, (2) DOE's efforts to reduce proliferation and terrorism risks, and (3) selected countries' experiences in reprocessing and recycling spent fuel. GAO reviewed DOE's plan and met with officials from DOE, the nuclear industry, and France and the United Kingdom."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["DOE's R&D plan relies on a systematic approach--that is, the use of scientific methods and engineering principles--to select and demonstrate nuclear fuel cycles and associated technologies. However, it does not explain the current readiness levels of the technologies associated with the fuel cycles and the estimated time and cost of further development; it also does not explain how DOE will collaborate with the nuclear industry and other countries experienced in nuclear R&D in achieving its goals. In particular: (1) In 2010, DOE screened 863 previously identified nuclear fuel cycles and technologies and grouped them into 266 fuel cycles for further exploration. Independent reviewers found this screening process useful and recommended changes that DOE officials stated they would act on. (2) DOE's R&D plan states that it is necessary to assess the readiness levels of technologies associated with nuclear fuel cycles. However, neither the plan nor the screening process describe the current readiness levels of all critical technologies or the time or estimated costs for further development. As GAO has reported, assessing the readiness of technology is a best practice to help control schedule and costs. (3) DOE's R&D plan states the importance of collaborating with the nuclear industry--the ultimate user of any fuel cycle and technologies that are developed--and DOE continues to get industry advice. However, the plan does not include a strategy for long-term collaboration with industry, without which DOE cannot be assured that the nuclear industry will accept and use the fuel cycles and technologies that the department may develop. (4) DOE has agreements with other countries that provide collaborative opportunities to share research results and leverage DOE's R&D efforts, such as using the countries' research facilities. However, the plan does not explain how DOE will use these agreements to advance its R&D goals. As stated in DOE's R&D plan, the Office of Nuclear Energy has efforts under way to minimize proliferation and terrorism risks associated with nuclear power, but faces challenges. These challenges include developing reliable and cost-effective fuel cycles while minimizing the attractiveness to potential adversaries of radioactive materials resulting from these cycles. NNSA is also working on these issues, and the two agencies have worked together informally to avoid duplication and overlap but do not have a formal mechanism to collaborate on future efforts, which can help agencies strengthen their commitment to work collaboratively by clarifying who will lead or participate in which activities and how decisions will be made. GAO reviewed France's and the United Kingdom's decades of experiences in developing and operating reprocessing and recycling infrastructures. These experiences can provide some insights into the decisions DOE may need to make in selecting nuclear fuel cycles and technologies. For example, reprocessing and recycling is likely to reduce the amount of space needed for a nuclear waste repository because some of the radioactive materials are reused, but the amount of this reduction would depend on how much of the radioactive materials that are reused might ultimately require disposal in such a repository."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DOE revise its plan to include the current readiness levels of fuel cycle technologies and the estimated time and cost to develop them, include a strategy for long-term collaboration with the nuclear industry, and specify how DOE will use international agreements to advance its efforts. GAO also recommends that DOE's Office of Nuclear Energy and its National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) complete a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to avoid duplication and overlap of efforts. DOE agreed with the first three recommendations and did not rule out the future use of a MOU. GAO continues to believe that this formal collaboration mechanism is needed."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In recent years, there has been a worldwide push to develop commercial  nuclear power, propelled in part by the need to keep pace with higher  demands for electricity and by concerns about greenhouse gas  emissions, which result primarily from the burning of fossil fuels. As of  July 2011, the United States had 104 operating nuclear power reactors, 1  under construction, and 34 planned or proposed for construction by 2030.  In addition, other countries have a combined total of 336 operating  reactors, 60 nuclear reactors under construction, and 463 planned or  proposed for construction over the next two decades. Nuclear energy,  which supplied about 20 percent of the nation\u2019s electric power in 2010,  offers a domestic source of electricity with low emissions but also  presents difficulties\u2014including what to do with nuclear fuel after it has  been used and removed from commercial power reactors. This material,  known as spent nuclear fuel, is highly radioactive and considered one of  the most hazardous materials on earth. The accident involving the  nuclear reactors in Fukushima, Japan, which were damaged by the  March 2011 earthquake and tsunami, once again brought to the fore  concerns about the potential for nuclear reactors to fail and problems in  dealing with the spent nuclear fuel generated by these reactors.", "Nuclear power generation depends on the nuclear fuel cycle\u2014that is, the  process of mining uranium, enriching it, fabricating it into nuclear fuel,  fissioning the fuel in a nuclear reactor, and managing the spent fuel once it  is removed from the reactor. Once the spent nuclear fuel, which contains  plutonium from the fissioning process, is removed, it may be stored for  eventual disposal in a geologic repository. This approach to generating  nuclear energy is referred to as a once-through or open fuel cycle and is  the approach U.S. nuclear utilities use. By contrast, in a closed fuel cycle,  the spent nuclear fuel is reprocessed to separate the plutonium from the  uranium and other radioactive materials for reuse. It may then be recycled  either by mixing the plutonium with uranium from another source to make  mixed oxide fuel, or MOX fuel, or by fabricating new nuclear fuel, known as  reprocessed uranium fuel, by using the uranium resulting from  reprocessing. Other countries, such as France, rely on a closed fuel cycle  to manage their spent nuclear fuel. According to the Department of Energy  (DOE), an advantage of reprocessing and recycling includes the greater  use of the energy content of the original fuel and a reduction in the amount  of radioactive waste requiring disposal in a geologic repository. According  to a report from the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA)\u2014a  semi-autonomous agency within DOE with a lead role in addressing  proliferation and terrorism risks\u2014a key disadvantage of reprocessing is that  it separates out plutonium in the spent nuclear fuel, which can be used in a  nuclear weapon. According to the same NNSA report, other nations might  use this process to divert plutonium for a nuclear weapon, and terrorists  might seek to steal plutonium or other material that could be used in a  nuclear explosive device.", "Until the mid-1970s, the United States reprocessed spent nuclear fuel but  reverted to the once-through fuel cycle, primarily to discourage other  countries from pursuing reprocessing because of concerns over nuclear  proliferation. In 2006, DOE announced its intention to reconsider  reprocessing spent nuclear fuel, as part of an effort known as the Global  Nuclear Energy Partnership (GNEP). Under GNEP, DOE proposed,  among other things, building multibillion-dollar nuclear facilities to  demonstrate advanced reprocessing and recycling technologies that  could significantly reduce waste, as well as reduce proliferation and  terrorism risks by making nuclear fuel in a manner that is less useful to  adversaries. However, in April 2008, we reported that the technologies  that DOE proposed for demonstration were not sufficiently developed to  warrant the building of commercial-scale facilities and that DOE\u2019s backup  plan to rely on commercially available technology would not meet GNEP\u2019s  goals of significantly reducing waste and minimizing proliferation risk.", "Congress eliminated funding for GNEP in fiscal year 2009. The House  Committee on Appropriations encouraged the next administration to take  a more comprehensive and responsible approach to the management of  spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste. The Committee  supported DOE\u2019s research on nuclear fuel cycles but provided no funding  for the design and construction of facilities for recycling spent nuclear fuel  and for associated research facilities. Instead, the Committee directed  DOE to focus on reducing the waste generated by reprocessing spent  nuclear fuel, designing safeguard measures for reprocessing facilities,  and researching ways to reduce the proliferation risks of reprocessing  spent nuclear fuel. Moreover, the Committee directed the department to  continue to coordinate this research effort with other countries having  advanced fuel cycle capabilities, such as France and the United Kingdom.  In January 2010, in a memorandum to the Secretary of Energy, the  President directed DOE to establish the Blue Ribbon Commission on  America\u2019s Nuclear Future to conduct a comprehensive review of policies  for managing the back end of the nuclear fuel cycle, including all  alternatives for the storage, processing, and disposal of civilian and  defense spent nuclear fuel and nuclear waste. The Commission issued a  draft report on July 29, 2011, and plans to issue a final report in January  2012, after considering public comments. The draft report discussed,  among other things, the current status of nuclear fuel cycles and  associated technologies and the extent to which DOE contributes to  efforts to further develop them, as well as other countries\u2019 experiences in  waste management programs and their potential usefulness for the  United States.", "In April 2010, DOE\u2019s Office of Nuclear Energy issued a new research and  development (R&D) \u201croadmap\u201d for nuclear energy with four objectives,  followed by separate implementation plans for each of these objectives.  In this report, we refer to the roadmap and the implementation plans  collectively as DOE\u2019s R&D plan. This report focuses on two of these  objectives. Under the first objective, DOE seeks to select and  demonstrate sustainable nuclear fuel cycles. According to DOE,  sustainable nuclear fuel cycles are those that would better utilize uranium  resources, maximize energy generation, minimize waste generation,  improve safety, and limit proliferation and terrorism risks. DOE  acknowledges that its key challenge in this objective is to develop a suite  of options that will enable future decision-makers to make informed  choices about how best to manage the spent fuel from reactors. Under  the second objective, DOE seeks to understand and minimize the  potential risks of proliferation and terrorism associated with the  technologies for reprocessing and recycling.", "In this context, you asked us to review DOE\u2019s plans to assess nuclear fuel  cycles and associated technologies and other countries\u2019 experiences with  these technologies. Our objectives were to review the (1) approach DOE  is taking to select and demonstrate nuclear fuel cycles and associated  technologies, (2) efforts DOE is making to understand and minimize  nuclear proliferation and terrorism risks associated with these nuclear fuel  cycles and technologies, and (3) experiences of France and the United  Kingdom in reprocessing and recycling spent nuclear fuel that may be  useful to the United States in selecting fuel cycles and technologies.", "To address these objectives, we reviewed DOE\u2019s approach to implement  its new R&D plan for selecting and demonstrating nuclear fuel cycles and  understanding and minimizing the risks of proliferation and terrorism. We  obtained and reviewed pertinent documents and interviewed cognizant  Office of Nuclear Energy officials, as well as officials from the NNSA and  the Department of State, which are two of the federal government\u2019s lead  agencies for proliferation and terrorism risks. We visited experts at the  Idaho National Laboratory, which is the Office of Nuclear Energy\u2019s lead  laboratory; and interviewed a nonprobability sample of experts at other  national laboratories, such as the Oak Ridge National Laboratory,  Brookhaven National Laboratory, and the Los Alamos National  Laboratory, about nuclear fuel options, waste management, proliferation  and terrorism risks, and related issues. Because we used a nonprobability  sample of experts at national laboratories to speak with, the information  we obtained from these experts cannot be generalized to all experts at all  national laboratories, but the interviews provided us with information on  the perspectives of various experts from the national laboratories. We  also conducted semi-structured interviews with five subject matter experts  who could provide a range of views on reprocessing and recycling spent  nuclear fuel and on DOE\u2019s R&D plan. To select these experts for  interviews, we reviewed presentations given by them before the Blue  Ribbon Commission, reviewed literature by experts who had conducted  extensive research on relevant issues, and sought recommendations  from other subject matter experts and government officials. We also  attended an international conference and DOE workshops on recycling  technologies and reviewed pertinent documents delivered by witnesses to  and issued by the Blue Ribbon Commission. In addition, we interviewed  representatives from the six nuclear industry groups that signed contracts  with DOE in 2010 to provide advice and information on its ongoing and  planned R&D. We also spoke with representatives from a nonprobability  sample of two nuclear utility companies out of the 26 operating in the  United States; the Nuclear Energy Institute, a policy organization for the  nuclear energy and technologies industry; and the Electric Power  Research Institute, an independent, nonprofit organization that provides  R&D relating to the generation, delivery, and use of electricity. Because  we used a nonprobability sample of nuclear utility companies to speak  with, the information we obtained from them cannot be generalized to all  nuclear utility companies, but the interviews we had with utility company  representatives provided us with information on the perspectives of  nuclear utility companies.", "To obtain information on the operating experiences of reprocessing and  recycling spent nuclear fuel in France and the United Kingdom, we  reviewed relevant documents about their nuclear power systems and  visited these countries to obtain additional documents and interview  government, nuclear industry, and utility representatives who oversee and  manage the reprocessing and recycling infrastructures. We selected  France and the United Kingdom because they are among the few  countries that have decades of experience in reprocessing and recycling  spent nuclear fuel. We observed the operations of facilities in these  countries that reprocess spent nuclear fuel and that fabricate MOX fuel. In  addition, we spoke with officials from selected international nuclear  organizations: the Nuclear Energy Agency of the Organization for  Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD-NEA), the International  Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and the World Nuclear Association, to  obtain an international perspective on reprocessing and recycling spent  nuclear fuel.

International safeguards under the auspices of the  IAEA are used to guard against these risks. Generally, because of the  technology involved, NNSA considers that proliferation risks will occur  over an extended period of time.

Research to better understand the availability of  uranium and other nuclear fuel materials to help inform decisions on  choosing nuclear fuel cycles.  \uf0b7  Fuel development. Research to examine a wide variety of nuclear fuel  to support multiple nuclear fuel cycle options.  \uf0b7  Separations. Development of new separations methods (i.e.,  reprocessing) that enable the recycling and/or transmutation of key  nuclear fuel constituents. These methods must be economical (i.e.,  involve minimal processing), minimize waste streams and volumes,  and enable effective safeguarding of fissile material.  \uf0b7  Waste forms. Development of new technologies for mixing high-level  radioactive waste with different materials, such as ceramics, glasses,  glass-ceramics, and metals to derive a waste form that can maintain  stability and durability under long-term exposure to high levels of  radiation, among other things, and to understand the performance of  these waste forms in complex geologic settings.  \uf0b7  Storage and disposal. Research to identify alternatives to current  practices and the development of technologies to enable the storage,  transportation, and disposal of spent nuclear fuel and wastes  generated by existing and future nuclear fuel cycles.  \uf0b7  Transmutation technology. Development of systems, including nuclear  reactors, that would transmute radioactive materials recovered from  spent fuel to improve the use of the nuclear fuel and significantly  reduce the radioactivity associated with these materials.  \uf0b7  Materials, protection, control, and accountability technology.

The weight and volume of the hazardous  material generated from a nuclear fuel cycle and the implications of  these factors on disposition of the waste.  \uf0b7  Resources. The effect of a nuclear fuel cycle on the availability of  nuclear fuel resources over the long term, and the disposal needs  associated with the fuel cycle approach that must be considered in  light of the expected availability of disposal sites.  \uf0b7  Proliferation risks. How the following three factors associated with a  nuclear fuel cycle could determine the overall proliferation and  terrorism risks of that cycle: the extent to which (1) the cycle  generates material that could be easily handled, (2) technologies are  used that could produce weapons-usable material, such as uranium  enrichment and reprocessing technologies, and (3) enrichment and  reprocessing could be protected from misuse.  \uf0b7  Safety. Difficulty of developing fuel cycles that are capable of  obtaining approval from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for safe  operations and for the disposal of radioactive waste from a nuclear  fuel cycle.  \uf0b7  Security. Whether physical security for a nuclear fuel cycle can be  provided that could prevent terrorists or others from gaining access to  the material.  \uf0b7  Economics. The life-cycle costs of a nuclear fuel cycle, including costs  for designing, constructing, operating, dismantling, and disposing of  nuclear facilities and associated wastes.  \uf0b7  Environmental impact. The environmental impacts of a nuclear fuel  cycle, including the impacts from constructing, operating, dismantling,  and disposing of nuclear facilities and associated wastes.  \uf0b7  Technology readiness. The time needed and the cost of developing  the technologies associated with a nuclear fuel cycle.", "In 2010, DOE initiated a pilot screening process to systematically  evaluate nuclear fuel cycle options and associated technologies for each  of the three categories of fuel cycles to help guide long-term R&D. This  process used systems engineering principles to develop and demonstrate  a methodology for comparing alternative nuclear fuel cycles with the  once-through cycle using the eight criteria above. In August 2010, DOE  held two workshops to seek input from representatives of the nuclear  industry and subject matter experts on this methodology.", "After reaching consensus from workshop participants on a revised set of  evaluation criteria and metrics for the proposed methodology, DOE  convened a panel of national laboratory experts to apply it, starting with a  list of 863 nuclear fuel cycle options and their associated technologies  resulting from prior DOE R&D efforts. As reported to DOE, the laboratory  experts revised this list by categorizing options according to key  characteristics\u2014such as the number and type of reactors used, the fuel  type, and the need for reprocessing. By consolidating options that were  similar, the experts ultimately produced a list of 266 nuclear fuel cycle  options and associated technologies: 100 were associated with the once- through cycle, 60 with the modified open cycle, and 106 with the full  recycling fuel cycle category. The laboratory experts then weighted a  subset of DOE\u2019s evaluation criteria to determine which options were the  most promising for developing sustainable nuclear fuel cycles, which had  modest potential, and which would provide only minor benefit and thus  would be considered not worth long-term R&D investments. Table 1  shows the results of this analysis. As the table shows, 83 of 103, or 81  percent, of the most promising options fell under the full recycle category  and 24 of 50, or 48 percent, of the options with only a minor benefit fell  under the modified open fuel cycle category. The experts noted that these  findings can be helpful in focusing DOE\u2019s R&D efforts.", "In January 2011, the screening process methodology and results were  peer reviewed by an independent panel of four national laboratory experts  and two consultants. According to the panel, the screening process and  its conclusions were \u201creasonable and useful for a pilot project\u201d and the  results will help inform DOE on what R&D efforts should be dropped and  others that should continue irrespective of shifts in policy. However, this  panel also found that the proposed methodology had many inherent  limitations, such as a lack of nonproliferation criteria and performance  metrics, and suggested specific areas for improvement. Suggested  improvements included using experts independent of the national  laboratories to determine if the results can be replicated; developing  metrics that consider the effects of the entire fuel cycle, such as mining,  uranium enrichment, and nuclear waste disposal; and further developing  metrics for technology readiness and proliferation and terrorism risks.", "In June 2011, the Nuclear Energy Advisory Committee, a group of  experts established to provide independent advice to DOE, provided  comments on its review of the pilot screening process. The committee  noted that some of the evaluation criteria, such as proliferation risk, are  not appropriate for advanced systems and innovative technologies that  are not close to deployment and not well understood. As such, the  committee suggested caution in applying the evaluation criteria at the  early stages of development to avoid prematurely ruling out some fuel  cycle options and their associated technologies for further R&D. The  committee also stated that because the pilot screening process results  are affected by the weights given to the evaluation criteria, and the  determination of these weights is more a policy issue than a technical  issue, DOE needs to be involved in setting the relative weights for each  evaluation criteria. In addition, the committee suggested that DOE obtain  the comments from the nuclear industry on the process. According to  DOE officials, the office has begun to take actions to follow up on the  suggestions of the peer review panel, the Nuclear Energy Advisory  Committee, and other sources in planning to conduct a formal nuclear  fuel cycle screening process during fiscal year 2013.", "DOE\u2019s R&D plan acknowledged that the recommendations of the Blue  Ribbon Commission might affect DOE\u2019s R&D direction. In its July 2011  draft report to the Secretary of Energy, the commission found that no  currently available or reasonably foreseeable reactors and fuel cycle  technologies\u2014including advances in reprocessing and recycling\u2014have  the potential to fundamentally alter the waste management challenge the  United States faces over at least the next several decades. As a result,  the commission concluded, it is \u201cpremature\u201d for the United States to now  commit irreversibly to a closed fuel cycle because of the large  uncertainties about the merits and commercial viability of different fuel  cycles and technologies. Nevertheless, the commission also concluded  that the United States should continue to pursue a program of nuclear  energy R&D, both to improve the safety and performance of existing  nuclear energy technologies and to develop new technologies that could  offer significant advantages in, among other things, safety, cost, waste  management, and nonproliferation and counterterrorism.", "In discussing DOE\u2019s R&D plan, the commission stated that it provides a  good science-based step toward the development of an effective, long- term R&D program. It recommended that DOE update its nuclear energy  R&D roadmap once every 4 years and that in doing so this process  should be informed by broader strategic planning efforts, such as DOE\u2019s  recently launched quadrennial technology and energy review processes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOE Plans to Assess Technology Readiness, but It Has Not Explained the Current Readiness of Fuel Cycle Technologies or the Estimated Time and Cost Associated with Their Development", "paragraphs": ["DOE\u2019s R&D plan states that it is necessary to assess the readiness of  technologies associated with the nuclear fuel cycles in selecting fuel cycle  options for further review.

According to  the R&D plan, the federal government is responsible for managing  disposal of spent nuclear fuel, but the nuclear industry will be the likely  user of any technologies developed by the government to better manage  this fuel. Hence, the plan states that the nuclear industry is a necessary  partner in DOE\u2019s R&D effort, both to suggest specific challenges to solve  and to offer perspective on proposed nuclear fuel cycle options.", "As of June 2011, DOE had obtained industry views by contracting with six  consortia of nuclear industry companies. In December 2009, DOE issued  a request for advice and assistance from companies with experience in  advancing nuclear energy concepts through the licensing and deployment  of full-scale production facilities. The request also stated that DOE was  seeking studies, analyses, evaluations, and engineering and technical  services from the nuclear industry. DOE received proposals from 14  nuclear industry groups and contracted with 6 of them in June 2010  through a 5-year, $30 million contract\u2014known as an Indefinite Delivery  and Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) agreement. Through the ID/IQ agreement,  DOE can issue a request for information, known as a task order, from one  or more of the industry groups, and each group may choose to participate  or not in each task order. As of June 2011, DOE had issued five task  orders, for a total of $5 million paid to the industry groups. Four of the  industry groups participated in the first task order by, among other things,  providing input through conference calls, face-to-face meetings, attending  an annual meeting, and submitting reports that identified technical areas  for nuclear fuel cycle R&D efforts. The face-to-face meetings have  included workshops DOE held from July 2010 through January 2011,  according to DOE documents we reviewed. These workshops focused on  different aspects of DOE\u2019s eight technical R&D areas. Representatives  from industry groups told us that the ID/IQ agreements are an effective  mechanism to solicit their input on these R&D areas in the short-term.  However, some of these representatives told us that it was unclear how  DOE is using the information the industry provided during workshops and  in response to task orders. Moreover, DOE officials did not provide  information to us on how it was using industry input.", "Nevertheless, DOE\u2019s R&D plan does not include a long-term strategy for  working with the nuclear industry to ensure acceptance and use the  technologies DOE develops. The plan has established milestones  through 2050, but its current contracts with nuclear industry partners end  in May 2012, with an option to extend the contracts until May 2015. The  R&D plan provides no detail on how DOE might collaborate with the  nuclear industry beyond these dates. According to our analysis of the  report on the pilot screening process, DOE stated that, as it continues to  develop its methodology for selecting nuclear fuel cycles, it will need to  consider evaluation criteria not addressed in the initial screening study  that will be important in selecting a nuclear fuel cycle or cycles that  industry finds acceptable. Specifically, the report identified the need for  broader stakeholder participation, including the nuclear industry, in  refining the evaluation criteria, particularly those associated with  economics, such as the life-cycle costs of a nuclear fuel cycle.", "According to the peer review panel for the initial screening process study,  the evaluation criteria did not include any incentives for industry to buy or  operate facilities that incorporate any of the fuel cycles that DOE may  select and demonstrate. The peer review panel also noted that such  incentives for industry are essential. In January 2011, two of the industry  groups that participated in the first task order suggested a number of  improvements to the collaborative process, including involving industry in  periodic peer reviews of DOE\u2019s R&D efforts and having industry work with  the department to determine the point where DOE funding for technology  development should stop and industry funding should begin. DOE officials  explained to us that they issued operating procedures in May 2011 that  more specifically identified how DOE will collaborate with the nuclear  industry under the ID/IQ agreement. These officials explained that the  operating procedures are intended to ensure that any new task orders  issued under the current ID/IQ agreement will indicate how industry input  will help DOE achieve the milestones in its R&D plan. Nevertheless, DOE  R&D plan does not provide a strategy for how it will collaborate with the  nuclear industry that addresses industry concerns for its involvement over  the long term. Without a collaboration strategy to sustain the nuclear  industry as a partner in its R&D, DOE may be at risk of developing fuel  cycle options that industry does not use. As we have previously reported,  collaborative efforts can be enhanced and sustained by engaging in key  practices, including (1) defining and articulating a common outcome;   (2) establishing mutually reinforcing or joint strategies; (3) identifying and  addressing needs by leveraging resources; (4) agreeing on roles and  responsibilities; (5) establishing compatible policies, procedures, and  other means to operate across agency boundaries; (6) developing  mechanisms to monitor, evaluate, and report on results; and   (7) reinforcing accountability for collaborative efforts through performance  management systems. While our previous report focused on collaboration  among federal agencies, we believe that the key practices identified are  relevant to the need for improved collaboration between DOE and the  nuclear industry in developing nuclear fuel cycles and associated  technologies.

While the plan does not discuss in detail any mechanisms for fostering  international collaborative R&D efforts to develop sustainable nuclear fuel  cycles, DOE officials told us about the collaborative agreements they  currently have with other countries. The principal forums that DOE uses  for its international R&D collaboration are the following:  \uf0b7  Multilateral agreements. DOE, along with other agencies, represents  the United States as a member country in several multilateral nuclear  energy forums, including IAEA, International Framework for Nuclear  Energy Cooperation (IFNEC), Generation IV International Forum, and  the Nuclear Energy Agency. For example, the Generation IV  International Forum\u2014chartered in 2000 with nine member countries  and supported by the Nuclear Energy Agency\u2014allows countries to  collaborate on testing the feasibility and performance of advanced  nuclear systems in order to make them available for industrial  deployment by 2030. In this forum, France, Japan, and the United  States, are collaborating on two of six prototype nuclear reactor  designs, the very-high temperature reactor and the sodium-cooled  fast reactor.  \uf0b7  Trilateral agreement. France, Japan, and the United States are in the  process of establishing a trilateral agreement to develop reprocessing  technologies for spent nuclear fuel. Under this agreement, DOE will  be allowed access to a French facility to fabricate new forms of  nuclear fuel and a Japanese nuclear reactor test facility to recycle  spent nuclear fuel. One objective of the agreement is to demonstrate  full recycling of nuclear fuel in a fast reactor in Japan. According to a  DOE official, this trilateral agreement has been under negotiation for  more than 2 years.  \uf0b7  Bilateral agreements. DOE\u2019s International Nuclear Energy Research  Initiative, established in 2001, is a mechanism for entering into  bilateral agreements on nuclear energy R&D. DOE enters into these  bilateral agreements to (1) develop advanced concepts and scientific  breakthroughs in nuclear energy technology, (2) promote  collaboration with international agencies and research organizations  to improve the development of nuclear energy, and (3) promote and  maintain a nuclear science and engineering infrastructure in order to  resolve future technical challenges. The goal is to achieve a 50-50  matching contribution from each partner country. DOE currently has  active agreements with Canada, France, and the Republic of Korea,  as well as with the European Union.  \uf0b7  Action plans. DOE has begun to develop action plans to jointly  conduct R&D on and share knowledge about key nuclear facilities and  technologies. DOE currently has action plans with China, India,  Japan, and Russia. These plans identify mutually agreed areas of  cooperation and lay out a schedule of events, such as workshops,  milestones, and deliverables. For example, the United States has  agreed to work with each of these countries separately on developing  fast reactors.", "These forums that DOE uses for international R&D collaboration indicate  that DOE has many opportunities to cooperate with other countries to  develop sustainable nuclear fuel cycles. For example, DOE\u2019s R&D plan  states that it will share research results and leverage U.S. R&D  investments with France, Japan, and Russia that are also conducting  work on transmutation technologies, which involve using fast reactors to  transform highly radioactive material into a less radioactive material. The  R&D plan further states that DOE has modeling and simulation  capabilities that could be shared with other countries, and that it envisions  restarting a nuclear reactor test facility at the Idaho National Laboratory in  5 to 6 years, which could also be shared with other countries.", "However, DOE\u2019s R&D plan does not fully explain how it will take  advantage of these collaborative agreements to advance its efforts to  select and demonstrate sustainable nuclear fuel cycles. This is  particularly important because these collaborations could help the United  States use research facilities in other countries, such as reprocessing and  fuel fabrication facilities, as well as advanced reactors. According to  DOE\u2019s R&D plan, DOE does not currently have adequate nuclear  research facilities for developing advanced fuel cycle technologies, and  DOE officials estimated that it would take 10 to 15 years to design and  construct them. As a result, DOE envisions building two major research  facilities\u2014a fast test reactor and a fuel cycle laboratory to test advanced  reprocessing and nuclear fuel technologies. DOE has already requested  through its ID/IQ agreement preliminary conceptual planning for a nuclear  fuel cycle research laboratory. However, as table 2 shows, some of these  facilities are already available or are being constructed in other countries,  and DOE\u2019s plan does not indicate how it might use any of these facilities  to further its R&D effort. DOE officials agreed that using the resources of  some of these facilities in other countries would help DOE in meeting its  R&D objectives, but these officials also explained that obtaining access to  these facilities is limited and could constrain ability to conduct R&D in a  timely manner.", "DOE\u2019s R&D plan also does not address how the department will decide  between building nuclear research facilities, such as a fast test reactor,  and using its existing international collaborative agreements to gain  access to planned or existing facilities in other countries. International  R&D collaboration has broad support from the Electric Power Research  Institute, the Nuclear Energy Agency, and the Blue Ribbon Commission  as a way to share the cost of designing and building these facilities.

First, it faces the challenge of  developing new concepts for nuclear fuels and nuclear reactors that are  cost effective and reliable while producing radioactive materials that are  less attractive for proliferation and terrorism. To address this challenge,  DOE plans to integrate safety, safeguards, and security features into the  design of the nuclear fuel cycle technologies, starting from the earliest  conceptual design stages. Second, DOE faces the challenge of  designing equipment that can measure and monitor nuclear materials as  they move through the different stages of the nuclear fuel cycle. Current  technology relies on a time-consuming approach of taking samples of  nuclear materials, including lab analysis, which does not allow real-time  tracking of the material to prevent diversion, theft or loss of nuclear  material.

According to French government officials, reprocessing and recycling  plutonium and uranium reduces the need to mine uranium. The amount of  uranium needed for nuclear fuel in a reactor depends on how much MOX  fuel and reprocessed uranium fuel is used in the nuclear reactors that are  licensed for these fuels. According to a 2010 French government report,  the current reprocessing and recycling approach in France reduces the  amount of uranium needed for nuclear fuel by up to about 17 percent.  This report included input from AREVA\u2014the French company responsible  for managing all stages of the nuclear fuel cycle, including constructing  and operating reprocessing and recycling facilities\u2014and Electricit\u00e9 de  France (EdF)\u2014the utility responsible for operating most of the country\u2019s  commercial nuclear power reactors. The estimate in the report assumes  that the 22 French reactors that can use MOX fuel and the 4 French  reactors that can use reprocessed uranium fuel use the maximum amount  of these fuels\u2014up to 30 percent MOX fuel and 100 percent reprocessed  uranium fuel in these reactors. According to French government  officials, if France were to recycle all of the reprocessed uranium and  plutonium it generates from reprocessing, it would further reduce the  amount of uranium needed for nuclear fuel by up to almost 25 percent.  According to United Kingdom officials, because the country has had  limited experience with using recycled nuclear fuels, it has achieved only  minimal savings of uranium from its reprocessing and recycling activities.", "Recycling consumes some of the plutonium contained in spent nuclear  fuel. According to French government officials, recycling results in a net  reduction of plutonium. MOX fuel contains about 8.5 percent plutonium,  and spent MOX fuel contains about 6 percent plutonium, according to  these officials. These officials estimated that, in their current use of MOX  fuel, the annual overall quantity of plutonium generated is at least 2.5  metric tons lower than if the same reactors had used conventional  enriched uranium fuel. However, reactors that have been licensed to use  MOX fuel can only use up to 30 percent of this fuel in a reactor per  refueling; the remaining 70 percent or more of the fuel is conventional  enriched uranium fuel, which generates plutonium. According to AREVA  officials, the decrease of plutonium in MOX fuel is offset by the increase  in plutonium resulting from the use of conventional enriched uranium fuel  in the reactor. In addition, because France only uses as much plutonium  as it creates each year, recycling of plutonium in France does not reduce  its current inventory of 35 metric tons of nondefense plutonium. According  to AREVA officials, the new generation of nuclear reactors they are  developing are designed to use a higher percentage of MOX fuel and  thus more plutonium would be consumed and, in turn, less would be  generated.", "The conditions for plutonium use are different in the United Kingdom  because it does not recycle plutonium. As a result, the United Kingdom\u2019s  reprocessing of domestic spent nuclear fuel has resulted in an inventory  of 84 metric tons of nondefense plutonium. The United Kingdom plans to  store most of this plutonium until 2120, and it currently considers this  plutonium as having no value as an asset. However, the disposition of the  United Kingdom\u2019s inventory is under review. As part of this ongoing  review, the United Kingdom government reported that the review is to  include an assessment of whether the plutonium should be reused as  MOX fuel in a new generation of nuclear reactors. The United Kingdom  government also reported that recycling plutonium as MOX fuel  consumes roughly one-third of the plutonium and significantly degrades  the remaining plutonium, making it less attractive for use in a nuclear  weapon but more expensive to reprocess a second time. In addition,  according to an official from the United Kingdom\u2019s Royal Society, the  amount of time during which plutonium is maintained in a separated form  should be minimized by converting it to MOX fuel as soon as it is feasible  to do so, and nuclear reactors should be identified in advance to ensure  the use of this MOX fuel.", "Reprocessing and recycling spent nuclear fuel is likely to reduce the  space needed for a geologic repository, but the size of the reduction is  uncertain. Reprocessing and recycling is likely to reduce the space  needed for a repository compared with the once-through nuclear fuel  cycle because uranium and plutonium are reused rather than disposed of,  according to French government officials. On the other hand, subject  matter experts we spoke with said that the reduction in the amount of  repository space stemming from reprocessing and recycling would  depend on how much of the radioactive materials that France considers  reusable might ultimately require disposal in a geologic repository. The  materials considered reusable are primarily spent MOX fuel, spent  reprocessed uranium fuel, and plutonium. Because the disposition of  radioactive materials considered reusable is uncertain, a 2006 French law  requires, among other things, that the owners of this material, primarily  AREVA and EdF, study how they would manage it if it were later defined  as waste. According to the law, this may occur if the technologies  envisioned for reusing these materials, primarily fast reactors, do not  perform as anticipated or if the current reprocessing and recycling  processes are abandoned. In discussions leading up to this law, in 2005,  the French National Radioactive Waste Management Agency (ANDRA)  prepared three scenarios for determining the size of the planned geologic  repository. In the first scenario, ANDRA estimated that the planned  repository would need about 2 square miles under current plans to  dispose of the reprocessing waste that requires geological disposal. In  the second scenario, ANDRA estimated that the repository would need  about 3.5 square miles if spent MOX fuel and spent reprocessed uranium  fuel were also disposed of. In the third scenario, ANDRA estimated that  the repository would have needed about 5.4 square miles if France had  never reprocessed spent fuel and instead had always relied on a once- through nuclear fuel cycle. However, these calculations do not include  waste stemming from the reprocessing and recycling of spent MOX fuel  and spent reprocessed uranium fuel. A figure showing the radioactive  materials generated by reprocessing and recycling of 1000 metric tons of  spent nuclear fuel in France is provided in appendix IV.", "The United Kingdom\u2019s Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) is  planning to develop a geologic repository for the 470,000 cubic meters of  high- and intermediate-level wastes resulting from the operation of its  current nuclear reactors. However, the effect of reprocessing and  recycling spent nuclear fuel on the amount of space needed for a  geologic repository is under review, including whether to dispose of  radioactive materials that are being stored but that are potentially  reusable, primarily plutonium. In addition, NDA has estimated that it  would need to increase the geologic repository currently being planned by  about 50 percent to accommodate the spent nuclear fuel generated from  nine planned nuclear reactors, if this spent fuel is not reprocessed and  recycled into MOX fuel. In contrast, if the spent nuclear fuel from the  planned reactors is reprocessed and MOX fuel is fabricated and used in  these reactors, NDA anticipates that the geologic repository would only  need to increase by 15 percent. However, this latter estimate does not  consider the need to dispose of the spent MOX fuel from these proposed  new reactors.", "Collocating reprocessing and fuel fabrication facilities would better  minimize proliferation and terrorism risks. French government and  AREVA officials point to decades of safe and secure operations, but they  said that they recognize that, if they were to develop the recycling  infrastructure today, they would, among other things, collocate the  reprocessing and fuel fabrication facilities to avoid transporting plutonium  for a distance of about 600 miles, as they do now. They also noted that  they would rely on reprocessing technology designed to keep plutonium  in a mixture with uranium that could be used for nuclear fuel, rather than  their current process of separating the plutonium from the uranium and  other radioactive materials.", "According to United Kingdom officials, their current security arrangements  provide sufficient protection against the diversion of materials and against  terrorism. These arrangements include collocating reprocessing and  recycling facilities, as well as subjecting these facilities to stringent  security requirements using a multibarrier approach, such as robust  storage facilities and armed guards.

We are concerned, however, that  DOE\u2019s initial steps will not be followed by actions needed to sustain its  plans over this long period to achieve this goal. In particular, DOE\u2019s R&D  plan states that the department will continue to evaluate the technological  readiness of nuclear fuel cycle options to differentiate among them and to  focus development on those that will help meet the R&D plan\u2019s schedules  and goals. However, neither the R&D plan nor the pilot screening process  describe the current readiness of all critical technologies associated with  the nuclear fuel cycles or the estimated time and costs for further  developing them, or relate technology readiness to R&D schedules and  goals. Such estimates are critical to understanding the magnitude of the  R&D effort and to measuring progress in developing these technologies.  In addition, DOE does not have a long-term strategy for collaborating with  the nuclear industry that clarifies the government\u2019s and industry\u2019s roles  and responsibilities. Without such a strategy, DOE cannot be assured that  the nuclear industry will accept and use the technologies that it develops.", "Furthermore, DOE has not specified in its R&D plan how it will use its  collaborative agreements with other countries to advance its R&D efforts  to develop sustainable nuclear fuel cycles over the longer term. As a  result, DOE may miss opportunities to use facilities and expertise in other  countries to more efficiently and effectively meet its R&D goals. Finally,  DOE has not developed a formal mechanism for coordinating its efforts to  develop sustainable nuclear fuel cycles with NNSA, which has lead  responsibility in DOE for minimizing proliferation and terrorism risks\u2014a  critical factor in selecting new fuel cycles. DOE officials said they  recognize the need for coordination with NNSA and have done so  informally. They also said they have begun to discuss developing a  memorandum of understanding with NNSA. As we have reported,  defining organizational roles and responsibilities in formal mechanisms  can help agencies strengthen their commitments to work collaboratively  by clarifying who will lead or participate in which activities and how  decisions will be made.

DOE stated that it would then incorporate  technology readiness information developed and evaluated from the fiscal  year 2013 screening into revisions to its R&D plan. Furthermore, DOE  also stated that it will pay greater attention to defining technology  readiness and the costs and time needed to improve that readiness for  specific candidate technologies.

In 1953, CEA built its first reprocessing plant at one of its  research sites\u2014Marcoule\u2014in southeastern France. This facility, the  Usine de Plutonium (UP) 1, used for military purposes, was shut down in  1997. In 1967, CEA built its first reprocessing facility for commercial spent  nuclear fuel\u2014UP2-400, which was capable of processing up to 400  metric tons annually of spent nuclear fuel\u2014at La Hague, a site along the  Normandy coast. This reprocessing facility was shut down in 2004 after it  had reprocessed about 28,000 metric tons of spent nuclear fuel. The  UP2-400 had contracts with neighboring European countries and Japan  for reprocessing services for the spent fuel produced from their  commercial nuclear reactors. In addition, in 1981, to meet the growing  demand for reprocessing from nuclear utilities in other countries, primarily  Germany and Japan, AREVA was authorized to construct other  reprocessing plants at La Hague. It began operations in 1990, at the  UP3, which can reprocess up to 900 metric tons of spent nuclear fuel  annually, and in 1994, at the UP2-800, which can reprocess up to 800  metric tons annually. Nuclear utilities in other countries substantially paid  for the construction of the UP3 facility, and EdF paid for the construction  of UP2-800 facility.", "In the past few years, the UP3 and UP2-800 facilities have been  reprocessing spent nuclear fuel from EdF and from utilities in other  countries at an average of about 1,050 metric tons annually, or about 65  percent of the combined capability of these facilities, according to AREVA  officials. Until 2009, EdF shipped about 850 metric tons of its spent  nuclear fuel to La Hague each year for reprocessing\u2014more than half of  the about 1,250 metric tons that EdF reactors produce annually. AREVA  officials told us that it is their policy to limit the amount of spent nuclear  fuel that they reprocess annually to the amount of plutonium needed to  fabricate enough MOX fuel to meet the needs of their utility customers,  including EdF and nuclear utilities in other countries. These officials  explained that this reprocessing strategy prevents creation of surplus  plutonium. Importantly, this strategy does not allow France to reduce its  inventory of plutonium, which is about 35 metric tons of domestic,  nondefense plutonium. In 2010, EdF increased shipments of spent  nuclear fuel to AREVA for reprocessing from 850 metric tons to 1,050  metric tons because it needed more MOX fuel for an expanded number of  reactors that are capable of using this fuel. AREVA officials told us they  expect to reprocess 1,500 metric tons of spent nuclear fuel per year by  2015, given anticipated demands from EdF and nuclear utilities in other  countries.", "France reenriches some of the uranium that is obtained through  reprocessing (reprocessed uranium) to fabricate reprocessed uranium  fuel. This fuel is used by EdF and by nuclear utilities in other countries  that send their spent nuclear fuel to France for reprocessing. Before  2004, most of the reenrichment was carried out by the Urenco Company  in the Netherlands. Between 2004 and 2010, the reenrichment was  conducted at the JSC Siberian Chemical Combine in Seversk, Russia:  EdF sent about 500 metric tons of reprocessed uranium to this facility.  French government officials explained that it was necessary to send its  reprocessed uranium to these facilities in other countries because the  reenrichment process requires a technology that does not currently exist  in France. However, these officials explained that AREVA is currently  constructing a reenrichment line at its newly started George Besse II  enrichment facility, located at its Tricastin site in southeastern France,  which will use a technology that will allow AREVA to reenrich reprocessed  uranium. AREVA plans to begin operating this line in 2012.", "France has operated two MOX fuel fabrication facilities and one  reprocessed uranium fuel fabrication facility. In 1989, CEA started  fabricating MOX fuel for light-water reactors at its facility in Cadarache,  located in southeastern France, for EdF and then for nuclear utilities in  Germany and Switzerland. According to French government officials, this  facility was shut down in 2003 because the cost of upgrading the facility  to meet new safety standards, especially seismic safety standards, could  not be justified. In 1995, AREVA constructed a new MOX fuel fabrication  facility, Melox, at the Marcoule site. Initially, in 1997, the Melox facility  was licensed for a capacity to fabricate 100 metric tons of MOX per year;  in 2003, the capacity was increased to 145 metric tons per year; and in  2007, it was increased to 195 metric tons per year, although it is not yet  operating at this level. According to AREVA officials, the capacity was first  increased to 145 metric tons because of the increased demand for MOX  fuel from nuclear utilities in other countries, primarily Germany and Japan,  and increased again to 195 metric tons to meet the anticipated demand  for MOX fuel, primarily from EdF.", "To fabricate reprocessed uranium fuel, AREVA operates the Franco- Belgian Fuel Fabrication facility in southeastern France. The production  line devoted to fabricating this fuel began operations in 1993; it has the  capacity to fabricate about 150 metric tons annually and has been  producing about 80 metric tons annually.", "According to French government officials we spoke with, the government,  through CEA, AREVA, and EdF, initially intended to use the uranium and  plutonium resulting from reprocessing as fuel for a fast reactor program.  Development of fast reactors began in the early 1960s, and two such  reactors were built and operated. The 233 megawatt (MW) Ph\u00e9nix fast  reactor operated between 1974 and 2009 and the 1,200 MW Super- Ph\u00e9nix operated between 1986 and 1998. These reactors were used to  test nuclear fuels, including fuel fabricated from the uranium and  plutonium that resulted from reprocessing. However, according to subject  matter experts in France, by the late 1980s, financial, technical, and  administrative barriers halted the deployment of fast reactors. Without the  fast reactor option, EdF decided to modify some of its 900 MW nuclear  reactors to accept MOX fuel, and the first reactor licensed to use this fuel  began operating in 1987. Currently, 21 of EdF\u2019s 58 nuclear reactors have  been licensed to use MOX fuel, another reactor has been licensed to use  MOX fuel but has not yet used it, and EdF is seeking approval to use  MOX fuel in two more reactors. With respect to reprocessed uranium  fuel, 4 of EdF\u2019s 58 reactors\u2014each generating 900 MW\u2014are licensed to  use this fuel. EdF began testing the use of this fuel in 1987 and started  using it full time in 1994.

It built its first industrial-scale reprocessing facility after World War II  to obtain plutonium for its weapons program, and this facility was  decommissioned in the 1970s. It built its second\u2014the Magnox  reprocessing facility\u2014in 1964 to reprocess spent nuclear fuel from its  Magnox nuclear reactors. Reprocessing this fuel was necessary because  its magnesium alloy cladding proved chemically unstable in storage. The  Magnox facility has a licensed capacity to process up to 1,500 metric tons  of spent Magnox fuel annually. Over its lifetime, the Magnox facility has  reprocessed more than 44,000 metric tons of spent Magnox fuel and  returned over 15,000 metric tons of uranium to the fuel cycle. The facility  is expected to operate until 2016 to complete reprocessing the spent fuel  generated by the four remaining Magnox reactors. NDA expects to shut  down these reactors in 2012.", "The third reprocessing facility\u2014the Thermal Oxide Reprocessing Plant  (THORP)\u2014was approved for construction in 1978 and began operations  in 1994. This facility was initially intended to (1) capitalize on the  projected worldwide expansion of nuclear power and the expected  demand for reprocessing spent fuel services from nuclear utilities in other  countries and (2) reprocess spent nuclear fuel from the country\u2019s 14  AGRs to provide plutonium for the fleet of fast reactors that was expected  to be constructed in the United Kingdom. It initially had a licensed  capacity to process up to 1,200 metric tons of spent nuclear fuel annually.  According to NDA documents, the construction costs for THORP were  paid for by domestic utility companies, as well as nuclear utilities in other  countries that needed to reprocess their spent nuclear fuel but did not  have the facilities to do so. Also according to NDA documents, as of  2010, THORP had reprocessed about 6,000 metric tons of spent nuclear  fuel\u2014about 60 percent, or about 3,700 tons, from nuclear utilities in other  countries, primarily Germany and Japan. THORP is expected to operate  until 2018, when it plans to complete its current reprocessing contracts for  the remaining approximately 500 metric tons of spent nuclear fuel that still  needs reprocessing for nuclear utilities in other countries and about 2,500  metric tons of spent fuel from the United Kingdom\u2019s AGRs. The last AGR  is expected to shut down in 2023, but its utility owner, EdF, may decide to  seek a license extension to continue operating some AGRs beyond this  date. NDA officials explained that any AGR spent nuclear fuel that is not  reprocessed after THORP closes will be put into long-term storage  pending a decision on its disposal.", "THORP has never achieved its licensed capacity because of changes in  market demand for reprocessing services and technical problems.  According to a subject matter expert in the United Kingdom, about the  time that THORP began operations, the original rationale for the facility\u2014 providing reprocessing services and using plutonium for fast reactor  programs\u2014had diminished. For example, Germany had contracted to  reprocess a total of 1,500 metric tons of spent nuclear fuel but reduced  this amount by 550 metric tons within months of THORP\u2019s opening.  Furthermore, according to subject matter experts, THORP\u2019s technical  problems\u2014including equipment failures and accidents involving acid  spills, pipe leaks, and blockages\u2014reduced its capacity for reprocessing.  Most significantly, THORP was shut down for 3 years beginning in 2005  because of a pipe fracture in a critical portion of the facility. When THORP  restarted operations in 2008, it could no longer operate at capacity  because of the technical problems, and its capacity was downgraded to  600 metric tons per year. According to NDA officials, NDA has decided  not to invest in THORP to restore operating capacity to its licensed  capacity because of the high cost involved.", "The United Kingdom reenriched the uranium generated from the  reprocessing of spent fuel from its Magnox reactors and used the  resulting fuel (reenriched reprocessed uranium fuel) in its AGR reactors  up until about 2004. Reenrichment was conducted by Urenco, at its  facilities in Capenhurst, in the northwestern part of England. According to  an NDA official, this facility reenriched about 16,000 to 20,000 metric tons  of reprocessed uranium. This official explained that this reenrichment  began in the 1980s and ended in 2004 because the low price of uranium  made reenriching reprocessed uranium uneconomic.", "The United Kingdom operates or has operated four facilities for  fabricating fuel out of the uranium and plutonium produced by  reprocessing. The following describes their operations:  \uf0b7  The Springfields Works facility, owned and operated by  Westinghouse, located in Preston, England, fabricated reprocessed  uranium fuel for AGR reactors until 2004. According to an NDA  official, this facility produced about 1,000 to 1,650 metric tons of  reprocessed uranium fuel.  \uf0b7  Between 1963 and 1988, British Nuclear Fuels operated a MOX fuel  fabrication facility at Sellafield that produced about 20 metric tons of  MOX fuel from plutonium and depleted uranium. According to an NDA  official, this MOX fuel was used in the United Kingdom\u2019s fast reactors.  \uf0b7  Between 1993 and 1999, the MOX Demonstration Facility\u2014a small- scale plant to prove the technology to produce MOX fuel\u2014operated at  Sellafield. This facility had a licensed capacity to produce up to 8  metric tons of MOX fuel annually for nuclear utilities in Germany,  Japan, and Switzerland; however, it produced only 16 metric tons of  MOX fuel during its 6 years of operations. NDA officials attributed this  low output to significant operational delays. For example, operations  were shut down because quality assurance data that accompanied a  MOX fuel shipment to Japanese nuclear utilities were found to be  falsified, making the fuel unacceptable, and the shipment was  returned to the United Kingdom.", "In 2001, the Sellafield MOX Facility began operations to fabricate  MOX fuel for nuclear utilities in other countries, primarily Japan. The  Sellafield MOX Facility is licensed to produce up to 120 metric tons of  MOX fuel annually; it first exported MOX fuel in 2005. However,  according to subject matter experts, this facility encountered technical  problems when it first began operations, including equipment  breakdowns that reduced its output. In 2005, the facility\u2019s capacity  was downgraded to up to 40 metric tons per year. According to a  United Kingdom report, in 9 years of operation, this facility produced  15 metric tons of MOX fuel\u2014a small fraction of its original target of  560 metric tons over an expected 10 years of operating life. Starting  in 2008, NDA subcontracted fabrication of some MOX fuel to  AREVA\u2019s Melox facility to complete its current contracts with nuclear  utilities in Japan. In August 2011, NDA announced that it would close  the facility as a result of the potential delays in orders for MOX fuel  from utilities in Japan following the earthquake in Japan and  subsequent events.", "The United Kingdom has made only limited use of reactors using nuclear  fuels that rely on the uranium and plutonium resulting from reprocessing,  as the following describes:  \uf0b7  The United Kingdom had initially intended to recycle the plutonium  derived from reprocessing Magnox and AGR spent nuclear fuel in its  fast reactor program. The United Kingdom operated two fast reactors:  the 14 megawatt (MW) Dounreay fast reactor operated between 1959  and 1977, and the 250 MW prototype fast reactor operated from 1974  through 1994. These reactors were used to test various materials and  nuclear fuels, including fuels fabricated from uranium and plutonium  from reprocessing. However, the United Kingdom decided to abandon  its fast reactor program in 1994. There were a number of factors  behind this decision, according to an NDA official. These factors  included low uranium and natural gas prices for power generation and  reduced interest in nuclear energy following the 1986 Chernobyl  accident. In addition, fast reactor technology proved more difficult to  commercialize than at first anticipated.  \uf0b7  The United Kingdom had used reenriched reprocessed uranium fuel  in its AGRs until 2004 when the low price of uranium made  reenriching reprocessed uranium fuel uneconomic.  \uf0b7  According to NDA officials, aside from the use of MOX fuel in fast  reactors, the United Kingdom has never used MOX fuel in any of its  other reactors. According to these officials, the government has not  ruled out the use of MOX fuel in planned nuclear reactors. In 2008,  the United Kingdom decided to support the building of new nuclear  power reactors, and nuclear utility companies, including EdF, have  come forward with plans to build at least nine new reactors. According  to EdF officials we spoke to in France, these reactors will be designed  to use up to 50 percent MOX fuel.
