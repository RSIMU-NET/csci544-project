GAO was asked to assess the extent to which (1) local and tribal officials in border communities received useful information from their federal partners, (2) federal agencies supported state fusion centers'--where states collaborate with federal agencies to improve information sharing--efforts to develop border intelligence products, and (3) local and tribal agencies were aware of the suspicious activities they are to report. To conduct this work, GAO analyzed relevant laws, directives, policies, and procedures; contacted a nongeneralizable sample of 20 agencies in border communities and five fusion centers (based on geographic location and size); and interviewed DHS and FBI officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Officials from 15 of the 20 local and tribal law enforcement agencies in the border communities GAO contacted said they received information directly from at least one federal agency in the vicinity (Border Patrol, ICE, or the FBI) that was useful in enhancing their situational awareness of border crimes and potential terrorist threats. Nine of the 20 agencies reported receiving information from all three federal agencies. Overall, where federal officials had discussed local and tribal officials' information needs and had established information sharing partnerships and related mechanisms to share information with them--consistent with the National Strategy for Information Sharing and best practices--the majority of the local and tribal officials reported receiving useful information. However, most local and tribal officials that reported federal agencies had not discussed information needs and had not established partnerships with them also said they had not received useful information. By more fully identifying the information needs of local and tribal agencies along the borders and establishing information sharing partnerships, federal agencies could be better positioned to provide local and tribal agencies with information that enhances their situational awareness of border crimes and potential terrorist threats. Federal officials at two of the five state fusion centers we visited were supporting fusion center efforts to develop border intelligence products or reports that contained information on border crimes and potential terrorist threats, as discussed in the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007. DHS recognizes that it needs to add personnel to other fusion centers in border states to, among other things, support the creation of such products, and is developing plans to do so, but cited funding issues and competing priorities as barriers. The creation of border intelligence products--such as those developed by two of the fusion centers we visited--represent potential approaches that DHS and the FBI could use to identify promising practices that other fusion centers could adopt. Identifying such practices is important because of the central role the federal government places on fusion centers to facilitate the sharing of information. Also, DHS had not obtained feedback from local and tribal officials on the utility and quality of the border intelligence products that its analysts in fusion centers have helped to develop. Additional efforts to obtain such feedback would support DHS and FBI efforts to improve the utility and quality of future products. Officials from 13 of the 20 local and tribal agencies in the border communities we contacted said that federal agencies had not defined what suspicious activities or indicators rise to the level of potential terrorist threats and should be reported to federal agencies or fusion centers. Recognizing this problem, federal agencies are participating in national efforts to standardize suspicious activity reporting. Until such efforts are implemented, defining suspicious activity indicators and current reporting processes would help better position local and tribal officials along the borders to identify and report incidents indicative of criminal activity associated with terrorist threats."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has identified terrorism as  one of the primary threats the United States faces on the northern and  southwest international land borders, along with illegal immigration and  drug trafficking, among others. In many border communities, the  individuals who are best positioned to observe suspicious activities that  may be related to these threats and report the activities to the federal  government are local and tribal law enforcement officers, particularly in  communities with a minimal federal presence. Therefore, it is critical that  federal agencies with key responsibilities for securing the nation\u2019s  borders\u2014including DHS\u2019s U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and  U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and the Department of  Justice\u2019s (DOJ) Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)\u2014share information  with local and tribal officials in border communities that enhances their  situational awareness of border crimes and potential terrorist threats.", "Since information sharing weaknesses were a major contributing factor to  the nation\u2019s lack of preparedness for the terrorist attacks of September 11,  2001, the federal government has called for a number of information  sharing initiatives. One theme common to many of these efforts is for  federal agencies to share information on terrorism-related matters with  local and tribal law enforcement agencies\u2014including those in border  communities\u2014to enhance their situational awareness of potential terrorist  threats. The initiatives also recognize that an improved information  sharing environment is to be constructed on a foundation of trusted  partnerships at all levels of government based on a shared commitment to  detect, prevent, disrupt, preempt, and mitigate the effects of terrorism.  Further, most states and some local governments have established fusion  centers that address gaps in terrorism-related information sharing that the  federal government cannot address alone and provide a conduit for  information sharing within the state. Finally, since late 2007, the federal  government has been working with state and local law enforcement  agencies to establish a nationwide process for reporting suspicious  activities that may be related to terrorism.", "Our prior work on the importance of including state, local, and tribal  entities in information sharing has shown that this sharing continues to be  a significant challenge for the federal government. In January 2005, we  designated information sharing for homeland security a high-risk area  because the government had continued to face formidable challenges in  analyzing and disseminating this information in a timely, accurate, and  useful manner. We reported that information is a crucial tool in fighting  terrorism and that its timely dissemination is critical to maintaining the  security of our nation. This area remained on the high-risk list for our  January 2009 update. As a result of this designation, we continuously  monitor federal information sharing efforts.", "Recognizing that local and tribal law enforcement agencies in border  communities are important partners in our first line of defense against  criminals and terrorists entering the United States, you asked us to assess  information sharing between federal agencies and local and tribal law  enforcement agencies in border communities. Specifically, our work  addressed to what extent  local and tribal law enforcement agencies in border communities are  receiving information from their federal partners that enhances the  agencies\u2019 situational awareness of border crimes and potential terrorist  threats; federal agencies are assisting fusion centers\u2019 efforts to develop border  intelligence products that enhance local and tribal agencies\u2019 situational  awareness of border crimes and potential terrorist threats; and  local and tribal law enforcement agencies in border communities are  aware of the specific types of suspicious activities related to terrorism  they are to report and to whom, and the process through which they  should report this information.", "To identify criteria for answering these questions, we analyzed relevant  laws, directives, policies, and procedures related to information sharing,  such as the October 2007 National Strategy for Information Sharing and  the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007  (9/11 Commission Act). The 9/11 Commission Act provides for the  establishment of a State, Local, and Regional Fusion Center Initiative at  DHS and contains numerous provisions that address the federal  government\u2019s information sharing responsibilities to state and local fusion  centers, including those that serve border communities.", "To examine the information sharing that occurs between local and tribal  law enforcement agencies in border communities and federal agencies  that have a local presence in these communities (CBP\u2019s Border Patrol,  ICE, and the FBI), we conducted site visits to five states that are  geographically dispersed along the northern and southwest borders  (Arizona, Montana, New York, Texas, and Washington). Within these  states, we met with county sheriffs, local police chiefs, and tribal police  chiefs from a total of 23 law enforcement agencies and asked them about  the information they received from federal agencies in their localities. We  also asked them about whether federal officials had discussed local and  tribal officials\u2019 information needs and had established information sharing  partnerships and related mechanisms to share information with them\u2014 consistent with the National Strategy for Information Sharing and best  practices described in GAO reports. After our visits, we sent follow-up  questions to all 23 local and tribal agencies we visited in order to obtain  consistency in how we requested and obtained information for reporting  purposes. Three agencies did not respond to our follow-up efforts and  were excluded from our analysis. Thus, our analysis and reporting is based  on our visits and subsequent activities with the 20 local and tribal agencies  that responded to our follow-up questions. We also met with local  representatives of Border Patrol, ICE, and the FBI to discuss their  perspectives on the information sharing that occurred, and compared this  information to that provided by local and tribal agencies in order to  identify barriers to sharing.", "To assess the extent to which federal agencies assisted fusion centers in  developing border intelligence products, as discussed in the 9/11  Commission Act, we reviewed products developed by fusion centers to  determine the extent to which they provided border security\u2013relevant  information. We also met with and conducted subsequent follow-up  conversations with fusion center directors and other senior fusion center  officials in the five states we visited to obtain their views on the  importance of developing such products and about the level of support  federal agencies were providing in developing these products. We asked  each of the 20 local and tribal law enforcement agencies we contacted  whether they received border intelligence products from their state\u2019s  primary fusion center and, if so, we discussed their views on the  usefulness of such products. We also interviewed senior officials from  DHS\u2019s Office of Intelligence and Analysis (I&A)\u2014the office responsible for  coordinating the federal government\u2019s support to fusion centers\u2014and  headquarters components of Border Patrol, ICE, and the FBI to discuss  their efforts to support fusion centers\u2019 development of border intelligence  products, identify promising practices for developing such products, and  obtain feedback from local and tribal officials on the usefulness of the  products.", "Finally, to determine the extent to which local and tribal agencies in  border communities were aware of the suspicious activities they are to  report, we asked officials from the 20 agencies what, if any, information  federal agencies or fusion centers had provided them on the kinds of  suspicious activities that could be indicators of or precursors to terrorism  and what processes they had in place for reporting information on these  activities. We also reviewed the Findings and Recommendations of the  Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) Support and Implementation Project  to determine the extent to which the federal government recognizes the  role of suspicious activity reporting for detecting and mitigating potential  terrorist threats. We also examined indicators of various suspicious  activities the FBI and fusion centers developed to determine if they  contained border-specific content. We interviewed DOJ officials who were  leading the national initiative to standardize suspicious activity  reporting\u2014as well as those from headquarters components of DHS and  the FBI\u2014to discuss the status of the national initiative and whether  border-specific indicators were needed and are being considered as part of  this initiative.", "Because we selected a nonprobability sample of agencies in border  communities to contact, the information we obtained at these locations  may not be generalized across the wider population of law enforcement  agencies in border communities. However, because we selected these  border communities based on the variety of their geographic location,  proximity to federal agencies, and other factors, the information we  gathered from these locations provided us with a general understanding of  information sharing between federal agencies and state, local, and tribal  law enforcement agencies along the border. Appendix I provides more  details about our objectives, scope, and methodology.", "We conducted this performance audit from October 2007 through  December 2009 in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards.

DHS designated I&A as having  responsibility for coordinating efforts to share information that pertains to  the safety and security of the U.S. homeland across all levels of  government, including federal, state, local, and tribal government  agencies. In June 2006, DHS tasked I&A with the responsibility for  managing DHS\u2019s support to fusion centers. I&A established a State and  Local Fusion Center Joint Program Management Office as the focal point  for supporting fusion center operations and to maximize state and local  capabilities to detect, prevent, and respond to terrorist and homeland  security threats.

In March 2006, DHS released its Support  and Implementation Plan for State and Local Fusion Centers. In this plan,  DHS describes its responsibility to effectively collaborate with its federal,  state, and local partners to share information regarding these threats. To  facilitate the effective flow of information among fusion centers, DHS,  other federal partners, and the national intelligence community, the plan  calls for DHS to assign trained and experienced operational and  intelligence personnel to fusion centers and includes the department\u2019s  methodology for prioritizing the assignments. The plan also notes that  identifying, reviewing, and sharing fusion center best practices and lessons  learned is vital to the success of DHS\u2019s overall efforts. Accordingly, it  recommends that DHS develop rigorous processes to identify, review, and  share these best practices and lessons learned. In December 2008, DHS  issued a document entitled Interaction with State and Local Fusion  Centers Concept of Operations.

Regarding border threats, the 9/11 Commission Act contains  several provisions that address the federal government\u2019s efforts to share  information with state and local fusion centers that serve border  communities.

The act provides that federal officers and  analysts assigned to fusion centers in general are to assist law  enforcement agencies in developing a comprehensive and accurate threat  picture, and to create intelligence and other information products for  dissemination to law enforcement agencies. In addition, federal officers  and analysts assigned to fusion centers along the borders are to have, as a  primary responsibility, the creation of border intelligence products that   (1) assist state, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies in efficiently  helping to detect terrorists and related contraband at U.S. borders;   (2) promote consistent and timely sharing of border security-relevant  information among jurisdictions along the nation\u2019s borders; and   (3) enhance DHS\u2019s situational awareness of terrorist threats in border  areas.

Specifically, Border Patrol and ICE officials said that the information  needs of these agencies were generally identified through outreach  meetings or through working relationships with local and tribal law  enforcement officers. Where these interactions did not exist, the federal  agencies generally had not identified the information needs of local and  tribal agencies. Also, according to a local police chief, while information  needs may be discussed between local officers and federal agents on an ad  hoc basis, his department cannot rely on these interactions to ensure that  federal agencies have identified the overall information needs of the  department.", "According to FBI headquarters officials, in developing field office area  assessments, Field Intelligence Group personnel are required to gather  information on terrorism and criminal threats and risks from local and  tribal law enforcement agency officials, wherein the information needs of  these agencies would be identified. FBI headquarters also noted that  through outreach meetings and participation in task forces and working  groups, FBI field offices continually evaluate the information needs of  their local and tribal partners, as well as their own, and take actions to  identify and fill any information gaps.

Specifically:    Officials from 13 of the 14 localities that had or were developing an  information sharing partnership with Border Patrol officials in the vicinity  also reported receiving information from them.", "Officials from 10 of 13 localities that had an information sharing  partnership with ICE officials in the vicinity also reported receiving  information from them, while the other 3 were not receiving information  from ICE.", "Officials from each of the 11 localities that had an information sharing  partnership with FBI officials in the vicinity also reported receiving  information from them.", "The local and tribal agencies that had developed partnerships with federal  agencies in the vicinity had established a variety of mechanisms to share  information, including regularly scheduled meetings, periodic outreach  performed by federal agencies, ad hoc meetings, task forces and working  groups, established working relationships, phone calls, e-mails, and issued  alerts and bulletins. In some locations, Border Patrol and local law  enforcement officials worked together in operational efforts that provided  opportunities for federal and local officials to develop information sharing  partnerships. For example, Operation Border Star in Texas\u2014a state-led,  multiagency effort focused on reducing crime, such as illegal immigration  and drug trafficking, in targeted regions along the Texas\u2013Mexico border\u2014 draws resources from local law enforcement agencies, the Texas  Department of Public Safety, and others to support Border Patrol. Also, in  upstate New York, a county sheriff\u2019s department conducted joint patrols  with Border Patrol, which extended into Canada. The patrols are designed  to prevent the illegal entry of individuals into the United States and the  smuggling of contraband. These operations provide an opportunity for  officers from all of the agencies to work together and facilitate  information sharing.", "Most of the local and tribal officials that had developed information  sharing partnerships with ICE officials reported establishing them through  personal contacts made either while working on various task forces  alongside ICE personnel or between agents and officers in both agencies.  For example, one tribal police chief said that his department has a  memorandum of understanding with ICE, which allows the tribal police to  perform certain ICE duties in the enforcement of customs laws and  facilitates information sharing between the agencies.", "Nevertheless, as shown in figure 3 above, officials from several local and  tribal agencies in the border communities we contacted reported that they  had not established information sharing partnerships with Border Patrol,  ICE, or FBI officials in the vicinity. Where partnerships were not  established, local and tribal agencies also were less likely to have received  information from federal agencies than in the localities where partnerships  were established.

One reason why the officials said established mechanisms were not  effective was because they did not have enough resources or funding to  participate in the regular meetings or forums that Border Patrol, ICE, and  FBI officials in the vicinity used to share information, establish face-to- face contact, and build trusting relationships. For example, an official  from one local police department said he was aware of Border Patrol\u2019s  efforts to share information through such meetings, but the department  did not have the resources needed to participate, since doing so would  leave the office short one out of eight patrol officers. Officials at another  location said they no longer received invitations to Border Patrol  meetings.", "Similarly, local and tribal officials in other localities said they did not have  enough resources to send individuals to participate in outreach meetings  that FBI officials said were used to share information, because in some  cases the meetings were held more than 100 miles away. A local county  sheriff also said that the FBI\u2019s meetings were initially productive but  interest faded because of the lack of useful information that was shared  during the meetings. An FBI official from another locality noted that FBI  officials are sometimes limited in what they can discuss during these  meetings if the local and tribal representatives in attendance do not have  the appropriate security clearances or do not have a need to know about  the information. These examples illustrate the importance of establishing  partnerships to facilitate discussions between the parties and minimize  expectation gaps regarding the availability of and limits in sharing  information.", "Border Patrol, ICE, and FBI officials also said that information is shared  with local and tribal agencies through multiagency task forces, such as  ICE Border Enforcement Security Task Forces and FBI Joint Terrorism  Task Forces. However, local and tribal officials\u2014especially those in small  departments in rural border communities\u2014said these mechanisms to  share information were not effective for them, because they did not have  enough resources to dedicate personnel to the task forces.", "Police chiefs and other senior local and tribal officials recognized that ad  hoc discussions between officers and investigators are also mechanisms  federal agencies in the vicinity use to share information with local and  tribal agencies. The officials noted, however, that limiting information  sharing to the officer and investigator level is not sufficient to ensure that  senior-level department officials are aware of the information, which in  turn could be disseminated to other personnel within the department. For  example, a police chief in a local community along the southwest border  said that he does not need the FBI to brief his entire department, but the  FBI should at least brief the police chief. Best practices in building  information sharing partnerships call for institutionalizing information  sharing through discussions at senior levels to ensure continuity in sharing  and diminishing the reliance on single individuals.", "We recognize that developing and maintaining information sharing  partnerships with the numerous local and tribal law enforcement agencies  along the borders is a significant challenge, and that Border Patrol, ICE,  and the FBI have made progress in this area. However, additional efforts  by these federal agencies to periodically assess the extent to which  partnerships and related mechanisms to share information exist, fill gaps,  and address barriers to establishing such partnerships and mechanisms,  could help ensure that information is shared with local and tribal law  enforcement agencies that enhances their situational awareness of border  crimes and potential terrorist threats."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Federal Agencies Are Supporting Some Fusion Center Efforts to Develop Border Intelligence Products, but Additional DHS Personnel and Other Measures Could Strengthen Future Efforts", "paragraphs": ["Federal agencies at two of the five fusion centers we visited were  supporting fusion center efforts to develop border intelligence products  that enhanced local and tribal agencies\u2019 situational awareness of border  crimes and potential terrorist threats.

Fusion center officials in these states emphasized that the physical  presence of federal personnel at the fusion center\u2014including intelligence  analysts from I&A, Border Patrol, ICE, and the FBI\u2014was critical to  developing the border products, in part because their presence facilitated  regular meetings with center personnel and access to federal information  systems.", "According to local and tribal officials in the border communities we  contacted in Arizona and New York, the border intelligence products they  received generally enhanced their situational awareness of border-related  crimes that could have a nexus to terrorism, such as drug trafficking and  illegal immigration. However, the border products usually did not contain  terrorism-related information that was specific to the border because such  information did not exist or a link between a border crime and terrorism  had not been established, according to fusion center officials. The two  fusion centers also routinely generated terrorism information products  that were provided to local and tribal agencies throughout the state to  enhance their situational awareness of terrorist threats. Officials from the  two fusion centers said that any terrorism-related information that is  specific to the border would be included in both the border product and  terrorism product. Below is additional information about the border  intelligence products developed by the two fusion centers:   Arizona Counterterrorism Information Center: The center issues a border- specific product (the \u201cSituational Awareness Bulletin\u201d) twice a week with  input from the state\u2019s Department of Public Safety and numerous federal  agencies, including DHS\u2019s I&A, Border Patrol, and ICE, and the FBI. The  center initiated the bulletin in 2008 to enhance the situational awareness  of local law enforcement officials along the Arizona border as drug-related  violence on the Mexican side of the border increased. The bulletin now  provides information about all types of crimes occurring in the vicinity of  the border, as well as incidents from around the country and around the  world. Topics have included immigration issues, burglaries at public safety  offices, suspicious activities around critical infrastructure, stolen military  uniforms, and stolen blank vehicle certificates of title.", "New York State Intelligence Center: The center\u2019s Border Intelligence Unit  issues a border-specific report quarterly with input from the New York  State Police and numerous federal agencies, including DHS\u2019s I&A, Border  Patrol, and ICE, and the FBI. The report is intended to compile  information on all types of crimes along the entire border between New  York and Canada into one product for the convenience of local and tribal  law enforcement agencies. This report covers crimes\u2014such as illegal  immigration and drug trafficking\u2014and includes the results of joint federal  and state operations conducted along the border. The report also contains  news and updates on policies related to border security. According to  center officials, the report grew out of recognition that various federal  component agencies have offices that cover the border territory and could,  therefore, collectively provide consistent intelligence information that  would be helpful in enhancing the situational awareness of law  enforcement agencies in border communities throughout the state. The  Border Intelligence Unit also issues bulletins with actionable information  on border-related crimes on an as-needed basis.", "In addition to the benefits that officials from the two fusion centers cited  from having on-site input and collaboration from representatives of three  DHS components, the FBI, and other agencies, the majority of local and  tribal agencies in the border communities we contacted found the border  intelligence products to be useful. Specifically, six of the seven local and  tribal law enforcement agencies we contacted in Arizona and New York  were receiving border intelligence products from the fusion center in their  state and all six found that the products were useful or met their  information needs. For example, one local law enforcement official said  that his agency receives the quarterly border report developed by the New  York fusion center and that he finds it useful as it sometimes contains  issues directly related to his jurisdiction. The remaining locality did not  comment on why the products were not received.", "According to officials from the other three fusion centers we visited, the  presence of additional federal personnel would support their efforts to  develop border intelligence products that help to provide local and tribal  law enforcement agencies along the borders with situational awareness of  potential terrorist threats. For example:    Washington Fusion Center: The Washington state fusion center is  colocated with the local Joint Terrorism Task Force, which facilitates  access to FBI information, and has representatives from DHS\u2019s I&A and  ICE. According to Border Patrol headquarters officials, as of August 2009,  the agency was in the process of assigning a full-time representative to the  fusion center.

According to the director of I&A\u2019s State and Local  Fusion Center Program Management Office, in part because of limited  resources, the department is taking a risk-based approach to determining  where to deploy officers and analysts. As such, the department considers  several factors in addition to available funding, including population  density, the number of critical infrastructure facilities, and the results of  fusion center assessments the office conducts to determine the readiness  of the center to use the department\u2019s resources. Senior I&A officials noted  that the department places some priority on deploying DHS personnel to  state and local fusion centers located in border states, but that other  factors also have to be considered under the department\u2019s risk-based  approach.", "According to DHS, as of September 2009, I&A had deployed 41 intelligence  analysts to state, local, and regional fusion centers. DHS plans to have a  total of about 70 I&A analysts at fusion centers by the end of fiscal year  2010 and an equal number of officers and analysts from DHS component  agencies (e.g., Border Patrol and ICE).

Specifically, the implementation plan for fusion centers  recommended that rigorous processes be used to identify, review, and  share information regarding promising practices and lessons learned.  Consistent with that recommendation, the concept of operations identifies  leveraging promising practices for information sharing and revising  existing processes when necessary and advisable as one of the guiding  principles of interaction with fusion centers.", "However, as of July 2009, I&A had not yet identified or explored promising  practices related to fusion center efforts to develop border intelligence  products. According to the director of I&A\u2019s Border Security Division,  such analysis has potential value but has not yet occurred because the  division has been focusing on developing its own products and providing  other support to fusion centers. While it is understandable that I&A  would focus on its own activities, DHS could benefit from identifying  promising practices related to fusion center border intelligence products  because of the importance the federal government places on fusion  centers to facilitate the sharing of information. By identifying such  practices, DHS would be better positioned to leverage existing resources  and help ensure that local and tribal agencies in border communities  receive information that enhances their situational awareness of potential  terrorist threats.", "Also, DHS had not obtained feedback on the utility and quality of the  border intelligence products that its analysts in fusion centers have helped  to develop. The 9/11 Commission Act requires DHS to (1) create a  voluntary feedback mechanism for state, local, and tribal law enforcement  officers and other consumers of the intelligence and information products  developed by DHS personnel assigned to fusion centers under the act and  (2) provide annual reports to committees of Congress describing the  consumer feedback obtained and, if applicable, how the department has  adjusted its own production of intelligence products in response to that  consumer feedback.

For example, in mid-2009, I&A  hired a contractor to initiate feedback pilot projects, including one  currently underway to evaluate and implement processes for gathering  and evaluating feedback responses. However, these projects are designed  to solicit feedback on products developed by I&A and do not specifically  include products that DHS personnel in fusion centers help to develop,  including border intelligence products. Therefore, these projects may not  support I&A efforts to obtain feedback under the 9/11 Commission Act on  products that DHS personnel in fusion centers help to develop.", "DHS\u2019s August 2009 report to Congress generally illustrates the value in  obtaining feedback on intelligence products. For example, in one instance,  the report notes that a state fusion center expressed concerns that the  perspectives of three southwest border state fusion centers were not  included in an assessment that I&A headquarters produced on border  violence. The feedback resulted in teleconferences and other I&A actions  to ensure that state and local perspectives are included in future  assessments of border violence. Similarly, obtaining feedback on the  border intelligence products that DHS analysts in fusion centers help to  produce would support other fusion center efforts to develop such  products and the department\u2019s efforts to adjust its own production of  intelligence products in response to that consumer feedback.", "The two fusion centers we contacted that were creating border  intelligence products with the support of DHS personnel (Arizona and  New York) had established their own mechanisms for obtaining feedback  from local and tribal consumers of the products. Specifically, the fusion  centers attached feedback forms to the border products, but have received  low response rates, according to center officials. As a result, the fusion  centers took other actions to solicit feedback on the border products, such  as through direct outreach with local and tribal consumers of the  information. Officials from both fusion centers said that the feedback has  generally been positive and that the border products have been modified  in response to this feedback. According to the officials, since these  products are developed by the fusion centers, the centers do not routinely  provide related feedback to DHS on the value of the contributions of its  staff and intelligence input. However, the fusion centers\u2019 efforts to obtain  feedback on the border intelligence products\u2014in addition to using  feedback forms\u2014demonstrate the feasibility of DHS taking additional  actions to collect feedback on the products and report its findings to  congressional committees under the 9/11 Commission Act. DHS agrees  that it could take additional actions to collect this feedback, which could  be done as part of the department\u2019s ongoing feedback pilot projects.", "By working with fusion centers to obtain feedback on the border  intelligence products developed, DHS could better support fusion center  efforts to maintain and improve the utility and quality of information  provided to local and tribal law enforcement agencies along the borders.

However, officials  from 13 of the 20 local and tribal agencies we contacted said they did not  recall being provided with a list of the suspicious activities or indicators  that rise to the level of potential terrorist threats and should be reported,  while officials from 7 of the 20 agencies said they had received such  indicators from either the FBI, the state fusion center, or another entity.  According to the October 2008 intergovernmental report on suspicious  activities, local law enforcement agencies are critical to efforts to protect  local communities from another terrorist attack. The report also notes that  to effectively conduct these duties, it is critical that the federal  government ensure that local law enforcement personnel can recognize  and have the ability to document behaviors and incidents indicative of  criminal activity associated with domestic and international terrorism.", "While federal agencies and fusion centers had taken steps to disseminate  or discuss terrorism-related indicators with local and tribal officials\u2014such  as through mass mailings and during outreach meetings and law  enforcement conferences\u2014these actions did not ensure that local and  tribal agencies were aware of them, in part because the mechanisms used  to share information were not always effective, as discussed earlier in this  report. As a result of not being aware of the suspicious activity indicators,  local officials in three border communities we contacted said they did not  clearly know what information federal agencies and fusion centers wanted  them to collect and report. Increased awareness of these indicators would  better position local and tribal agencies along the border to identify and  report behaviors and incidents indicative of criminal activity associated  with terrorism.", "Also, in about half of the border communities we contacted, local and  tribal agency officials were not aware of the specific processes they were  to use to report terrorism-related suspicious activities or to whom this  information should be reported because federal agencies had not yet  defined such processes. Absent defined processes, the local and tribal  officials had independently developed policies and procedures for  gathering and reporting suspicious activities and they provided varying  responses regarding how and to whom they would submit suspicious  activities that may have a nexus to terrorism. Responses included  reporting suspicious activities to a fusion center, the FBI, or another  federal agency. Several local and tribal officials we contacted said they  would report this information to the local federal official\u2014e.g., Border  Patrol, ICE, or the FBI\u2014with whom they had developed a relationship. By  defining reporting processes, federal, local, and tribal agencies would be in  a better position to conduct more efficient collection and analysis of  suspicious activities and share the results on a regional or national basis.  Also, internal control standards call for management to ensure that there  are adequate processes for communicating with and obtaining information  from external stakeholders that may have a significant effect on the  agency achieving its goals and that information should be recorded and  communicated to the entities who need it in a form and within a time  frame that enables them to carry out their responsibilities.", "At the national level, the federal government is working with state and  local law enforcement entities on the National Suspicious Activity  Reporting Initiative to standardize the reporting of suspicious activities  that may be related to terrorism. The long-term goal of the initiative is to  develop and implement consistent national policies, processes, and best  practices by employing a standardized, integrated approach to gathering,  documenting, processing, analyzing, and sharing information about  suspicious activity that is potentially related to terrorism. One of the  immediate goals of the initiative is to help ensure that suspicious activity  reports with a potential connection to terrorism are expeditiously  provided by local and tribal law enforcement agencies to the FBI. As of  September 2009, related pilot projects were ongoing at fusion centers in 12  major cities.

Officials from three of the local law enforcement agencies we contacted  also suggested that border-specific indicators would help them link  potential terrorism-related activities to crimes they are more likely to  encounter along the border, such as illegal immigration and currency  smuggling. However, our review of the suspicious activity indicators being  utilized by the National Suspicious Activity Reporting Initiative and those  that were developed by the FBI and fusion centers generally did not  include indicators that were specific to the border.", "According to the DOJ official who was overseeing the implementation of  the national initiative, the primary suspicious activity indicators that were  validated by the law enforcement and intelligence community for use in  the major city pilot projects were designed to be general and applicable to  local and tribal officials located anywhere in the country. The official  noted that the automated system that is being used by law enforcement  agencies to record the suspicious activities during the pilot projects was  designed to accommodate \u201csub-lists\u201d that contain indicators that are  applicable to specific sectors, such as the critical infrastructure sector.  The official said that there was not a sub-list for border-specific indicators,  but that he saw the potential for developing such a list. The official said  that I&A would be the entity with the requisite expertise for developing  such a list.", "In April 2009, I&A deployed an intelligence analyst from its Border  Security Division to DHS\u2019s Homeland Security Intelligence Support Team  to develop terrorism indicators that are specific to the southwest border.", "According to the director of the Border Security Division, the analyst is  looking for trends and patterns in terrorism-related incident reports that  are generated by local and tribal law enforcement officials along the  southwest border. The director said that I&A has not yet determined a  final date for developing the suspicious activity indicators since there is a  lot of information that has to be analyzed.

Because these officials are often in the  best position to identify potential threats that exist within their  jurisdictions, they must be partners in information sharing that enhances  situational awareness of border crimes and potential terrorist threats. In  border communities, this partnership is particularly important because of  the vulnerability to a range of criminal activity that exists along our  nation\u2019s borders. Therefore, a more robust effort by federal agencies to  identify the information needs of local and tribal law enforcement  agencies along the borders and periodically assess the extent to which  partnerships exist and related mechanisms to share information are  working\u2014and fill gaps and address barriers where needed\u2014could better  enable federal agencies to provide useful information to their local and  tribal partners that enhances situational awareness.", "The work of state-run fusion centers is also critical to the nation\u2019s efforts  to prevent terrorist attacks. Fusion centers in the border states we visited  demonstrated a range of practices related to developing border  intelligence products that could serve as a model for other fusion centers.  By identifying and sharing these promising practices, DHS and the FBI  could help strengthen the work of fusion centers nationally in addition to  enhancing situational awareness of local and tribal law enforcement. Also,  by working with the centers to obtain feedback on border intelligence  products, DHS and the FBI could enhance the utility of those products that  fusion centers share with local and tribal law enforcement agencies.", "Finally, until a national suspicious activity reporting process is in place,  more consistently providing local and tribal officials in border  communities with information on the suspicious terrorism-related  activities they should report\u2014including those related to border threats\u2014 and establishing processes for reporting this information could help  ensure that critical information is reported and reaches the most  appropriate agency to take action."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To help ensure that local and tribal law enforcement agencies in border  communities receive information from local federal agencies that  enhances their situational awareness of border crimes and potential  terrorist threats, we recommend that the Secretary of Homeland Security  and Director of the FBI, as applicable, require Border Patrol, ICE, and FBI  offices in border communities to take the following two actions: (1) more  consistently and fully identify the local and tribal agencies\u2019 information  needs and (2) periodically assess the extent to which partnerships and  related mechanisms to share information exist, fill gaps as appropriate,  and address barriers to establishing such partnerships and mechanisms.", "To promote future efforts to develop border intelligence products within  fusion centers, we recommend that the Secretary of Homeland Security  and the Director of the FBI collaborate with fusion centers to take the  following two actions: (1) identify and market promising practices used to  prepare these products and (2) take additional actions to solicit feedback  from local and tribal officials in border communities on the utility and  quality of the products generated.", "To maximize the utility of suspicious activity indicators as a  counterterrorism tool, we recommend that the Secretary of Homeland  Security and the Director of the FBI collaborate with fusion centers to  take the following two actions: (1) take steps to ensure that local and  tribal law enforcement agencies in border communities are aware of the  specific types of suspicious activities related to terrorism that they are to  report and the process through which they should report this information  and (2) consider developing, periodically updating, and consistently  disseminating indicators of terrorism-related activities that focus on  border threats."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["On November 10, 2009, we provided a draft of this report to DHS and DOJ  for comment.

For example, CBP agreed that a systematic and standardized  process to disseminate information and receive feedback is vital to  situational awareness for local and tribal law enforcement partners who  are within the immediate areas adjacent to the border. CBP noted that  Border Patrol plans to develop a list of individuals who will serve as  liaisons to local and tribal agencies and also develop a list of local and  tribal contacts. According to CBP, the Border Patrol liaisons will then  make initial efforts to assess the information needs of the law enforcement  partners and take other actions to determine and publish guidance on  information sharing.  To ensure that information shared is useful, Border  Patrol plans to conduct annual surveys of its partners. Border Patrol  envisions that this standardized process will be in place by the end of  fiscal year 2010.  When implemented, the Border Patrol\u2019s actions should  meet the intent of our recommendation. ICE also agreed with the  recommendation and plans to work with CBP and the FBI to enhance  local and tribal law enforcement agencies\u2019 situational awareness, but ICE  did not provide details on the specific actions it will take.

According to I&A\u2014the  DHS component that has the lead in addressing this recommendation\u2014the  department has initiated the creation of a broad Joint Fusion Center  Program Management Office, which represents a departmentwide effort  that seeks to more closely coordinate support to fusion centers with  department component agencies, including CBP and ICE.  I&A also noted  that its intelligence specialists that are in fusion centers also act as  conveyers of information about promising practices to develop border  information products.  Finally, I&A noted that the department hosts the  Lessons Learned and Best Practices Web site that can be utilized to  promote future efforts to develop border intelligence products within  fusion centers. While these actions could potentially support DHS efforts  to identify and market promising practices used to prepare border  intelligence products within fusion centers, I&A did not provide any  specific information on the extent to which such practices have been  identified and marketed. I&A\u2019s comments also did not address what  actions, if any, are ongoing or planned to solicit feedback from local and  tribal officials on the utility and quality of the products generated.

The 9/11 Commission Act provides for the  establishment of a State, Local, and Regional Fusion Center Initiative at  the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and contains numerous  provisions that address the federal government\u2019s information sharing  responsibilities to state and local fusion centers, including those that serve  border communities.", "To examine the information sharing that occurs between local and tribal  law enforcement agencies in border communities and federal agencies  that have a local presence in these communities\u2014U.S. Customs and  Border Protection\u2019s Border Patrol and U.S. Immigration and Customs  Enforcement (ICE), and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)\u2014we  conducted site visits to five states that are geographically dispersed along  the northern and southwest borders (Arizona, Montana, New York, Texas,  and Washington). Within these states, we selected a nonprobability sample  of 23 local and tribal law enforcement agencies to visit based on one or  more of the following characteristics:  locations known to be or suspected of being particularly vulnerable to  illegal entry or criminal activity;  land ports of entry with heavy inbound passenger traffic;  locations in proximity to areas at the border where there is little or no  continuous federal border enforcement presence;  locations that include Native American tribal communities with lands that  abut the border;  locations where federal, state, and local communities have in the past, or  are currently working with federal agencies to support border security  either informally or through pilot programs for sharing information;  locations in proximity to federal agencies at the border; and    geographically dispersed locations along the northern and southwest land  borders.", "We met with county sheriffs, local police chiefs, and tribal police chiefs  from the 23 law enforcement agencies and asked them about the  information they received from federal agencies in their localities.
