Without proper safeguards, systems  are unprotected from individuals and groups with malicious intent who  can intrude and use their access to obtain sensitive information, commit  fraud, disrupt operations, or launch attacks against other computer  systems and networks. These concerns are well founded for a number of  reasons, including the dramatic increase in reports of security incidents,  the ease of obtaining and using hacking tools, the steady advance in the  sophistication and effectiveness of attack technology, and the dire  warnings of new and more destructive attacks to come.", "Computer-supported federal operations are likewise at risk.

It means that users are granted  only those access rights and permissions that they need to perform their  official duties. To restrict legitimate users\u2019 access to only those programs  and files that they need in order to do their work, organizations establish  access rights and permissions. \u201cUser rights\u201d are allowable actions that can  be assigned to users or to groups of users.
