In developing digital flood maps, FEMA plans to incorporate data that are of a level of specificity and accuracy commensurate with communities' relative flood risk. According to FEMA, there is a direct relationship between the types, quantity, and detail of the data and analysis used to develop maps and the costs of obtaining and analyzing those data. Although FEMA ranked the nation's 3,146 counties from highest to lowest risk, it has not yet established data standards that describe the appropriate level of detail, accuracy, and analysis required to develop digital maps based on risk level. Without such standards, FEMA cannot ensure that it uses the same level of data collection and analysis for all communities in the same risk category. Such standards can also help FEMA to target its map modernization resources more efficiently by matching the level of data collection and analysis with the level of flood risk. FEMA has developed partnerships with states and local entities that have begun mapping activities and has a strategy on how to best work with these entities. However, the overall effectiveness of FEMA's future partnering efforts is uncertain because FEMA has not yet developed a clear strategy for partnering with communities with less resources and little or no experience in flood mapping. By developing such a strategy, FEMA will be better able to identify and use the most effective approaches to engage all of its partners in map modernization."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Floods inflict more damage and economic losses upon the United States  than any other natural disaster. During the 10 years from fiscal year 1992  through fiscal year 2001, flooding caused over 900 deaths and resulted in  approximately $55 billion in damages. Since its inception 36 years ago, the  National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) has combined the development  of flood maps to identify the areas at greatest risk of flooding with  mitigation efforts to reduce or eliminate flood risks to people and  property and the availability of insurance that property owners can  purchase to protect themselves from flood losses. To date, the flood  insurance program has paid about $12 billion in insurance claims,  primarily from policyholder premiums, that otherwise would have been  paid, at least in part, from taxpayer-funded disaster relief.", "The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is responsible for  managing the NFIP, including the development of flood maps. Accurate  flood maps that identify the areas at greatest risk of flooding are the  foundation of the NFIP. The maps are principally used by (1) the  approximately 20,000 communities participating in the NFIP to adopt and  enforce the program\u2019s minimum building standards for new construction  within the maps\u2019 identified floodplains, (2) FEMA to develop accurate  flood insurance policy rates based on flood risk, and (3) federally  regulated mortgage lenders to identify those property owners who are  statutorily required to purchase federal flood insurance. Under the  National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended, property owners  whose properties are within the designated floodplain and have a  mortgage from a federally regulated financial institution are required to  purchase federal flood insurance. Flood maps can become outdated for a  variety of reasons, such as erosion or community growth and development  that can affect the drainage patterns of rainwater. Thus, flood maps must  be periodically updated to assess and map changes in the boundaries of  floodplains that result from community growth, development, erosion, and  other factors that affect the boundaries of areas at risk for flooding.  According to FEMA, limited funding for flood mapping has resulted in a  backlog of outdated maps. FEMA estimates that as of March 2004 nearly  70 percent of the nation\u2019s flood maps were more than 10 years old and  reflected outdated data that could affect the ability to accurately identify  current flood hazard areas.", "With congressional support and funding, FEMA has embarked on a   $1 billion, 5-year effort to update the nation\u2019s flood maps. Recognizing that  FEMA is currently in the early stages of its map modernization effort, our  objectives for this review were to answer the following questions: (1) How  is map modernization intended to improve the accuracy and accessibility  of the nation\u2019s flood maps? (2) What are the expected benefits of more  accurate and accessible flood maps? (3) To what extent does FEMA\u2019s  strategy for managing the map modernization program support the  achievement of these benefits and what, if any, limitations could affect the  implementation of the strategy?", "To answer these questions, we analyzed available information from FEMA  on the program\u2019s purpose, objectives, and status and met with agency  officials in headquarters and in the regional offices to discuss the  program\u2019s progress. We also conducted site visits to states and  communities that have already begun to modernize their flood maps and  interviewed industry organizations such as the Association of State Flood  Plain Managers, the National Association of Flood and Stormwater  Management Agencies, and the National Emergency Management  Association.

FEMA\u2019s NFIP has served as a key component of the agency\u2019s efforts to  minimize or mitigate the damage and financial impact of floods on the  public, as well as to limit federal expenditures needed after floods occur.", "In 1968, to address the increasing amount of flood damage, the lack of  readily available insurance for property owners, and the cost to the  taxpayer for flood-related disaster relief, the National Flood Insurance Act  of 1968, created the NFIP. Since its inception, the program has sought to  minimize flood-related property losses by making flood insurance  available on reasonable terms and encouraging its purchase by people  who need flood insurance protection\u2014particularly those living in the  areas at highest risk of flooding known as special flood hazard areas. The  program identifies and maps flood-prone areas in the country, makes flood  insurance available to property owners in the nearly 20,000 communities  that currently participate in the program, and requires floodplain  management efforts to mitigate flood hazards on the part of participating  communities.", "FEMA\u2019s flood maps are one of the basic, essential tools for flood hazard  mitigation in the United States. FEMA estimates that the maps are used an  estimated 30 million times annually in the private and public sectors.  FEMA uses the maps to identify the floodplain boundaries in which flood  insurance is required and to set flood insurance rates. Mortgage lending  institutions use the maps to determine who is required to purchase flood  insurance and ensure that flood insurance is purchased and maintained for  these properties. Community planning officials, land developers, and  engineers use the maps for designing new buildings and infrastructure to  be safe from flooding. See appendix II for more information on the various  stakeholders that use and rely upon flood maps.", "Flood maps provide the basis for establishing floodplain building  standards that participating communities must adopt and enforce as part  of the program. For a community to participate in the program, any  structures built within special flood hazard areas\u2014also known as 100-year  floodplains\u2014that have a 1 percent or greater chance of experiencing  flooding in any given year must be built according to the program\u2019s  building standards whose purpose is to minimize flood losses. A key  component of the program\u2019s building standards that must be followed by  participating communities is a requirement that the lowest floor of the  structure be elevated to or above the base flood level\u2014the elevation at  which there is a 1 percent chance of flooding in a given year. The  administration has estimated that local governments\u2019 compliance with the  program\u2019s standards for new construction is saving over $1 billion  annually in flood damage avoided.", "Flood maps also provide the basis for setting insurance rates and  identifying properties whose owners are required to purchase flood  insurance. When the NFIP was created, the purchase of flood insurance  was voluntary. To increase the impact of the program, however, Congress  amended the original law in 1973 to require the purchase of flood  insurance in certain circumstances. Flood insurance is required for  structures in special flood hazard areas of communities participating in the  program if (1) any federal loans or grants were used to acquire or build the  structures or (2) the structures have outstanding mortgage loans made by  lending institutions that are regulated by the federal government. Owners  of properties without mortgages or properties with mortgages held by  unregulated lenders were not, and still are not, required to purchase flood  insurance, even if the properties are in special flood hazard areas.", "Federal regulations require that FEMA communicate potential changes in  flood risk to the public when it decides to initiate a flood mapping study  and when it is ready to release preliminary maps. At the beginning of the  mapping process, FEMA is required to notify community stakeholders.  When FEMA is ready to release preliminary maps, the agency must publish  the proposed base flood elevations in the Federal Register for public  comment and notify the community of the results of the study. When the  final map is approved and implemented, FEMA publishes another Federal  Register notice.", "In the early 1990s, some of the data and information FEMA collected to  develop flood maps were becoming available in digital format. In 1994, the  President issued Executive Order 12906, which mandated that standards  for digital geographic data be applied uniformly across the federal  government. Anticipating that electronic data would soon become the  standard vehicle for information delivery and in an attempt to make flood  map production more cost-effective and efficient, FEMA developed a  prototype for a digital flood map.", "In 1997, FEMA developed its initial flood map modernization plan that  outlined the steps necessary to update the nation\u2019s flood maps to digital  format and streamline FEMA\u2019s operations in raising public awareness of  the importance of the maps and responding to requests to revise them.  This initial plan and subsequent updates to the plan reflected the  recommendations of the Technical Mapping Advisory Council created by  Congress and active from 1995-2000. The council provided a number of  recommendations which were aimed at making the digital flood map the  future method for assessing flood hazard risk and setting federal insurance  rates. Recognizing the importance of updating the nation\u2019s flood maps,  Congress appropriated additional funds in fiscal years 2000-2002. FEMA  used these funds to launch its map modernization program through such  activities as developing new flood mapping standards and procedures,  expanding the Cooperating Technical Partner (CTP) program that  recognizes and encourages state and local participation in flood hazard  data development and maintenance and developing some digital flood  maps. In fiscal year 2003, Congress appropriated $150 million, allowing  FEMA to initiate a full-scale update of the nation\u2019s flood maps called the  Multi-Hazard Flood Map Modernization Program, an effort FEMA expects  to take about 5 years and cost about $1 billion. In fiscal year 2004,  Congress appropriated an additional $200 million for map modernization,  and the administration has requested an additional $200 million for fiscal  year 2005 to continue the program. FEMA has established four primary  objectives for implementing map modernization: (1) establish and  maintain a premier data collection and delivery system, (2) expand  outreach and better inform the user community, (3) build and maintain  mutually beneficial partnerships, and (4) achieve effective program  management. In March 2004, FEMA awarded a performance-based  contract for overseeing map modernization that includes contractor  performance measures for each of these objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Map Modernization Intends to Use Advanced Technologies to Produce More Accurate and Accessible Digital Flood Maps", "paragraphs": ["Through map modernization, FEMA intends to produce more accurate and  accessible flood maps by using advanced technology to gather accurate  data and make the resulting information available on the Internet.  Currently, many of the flood maps in FEMA\u2019s inventory do not accurately  reflect the true flood hazard risks because over time, new development  and other factors altered watersheds and floodplains faster than the maps  could be updated. For the most part, the $35 million to $50 million in  annual flood insurance policy fees has been the only source of funding for  updating flood maps, and according to FEMA, the agency has not been  able to keep the maps updated with the funds available. As a result, nearly  70 percent of the nation\u2019s approximately 92,222 flood maps are more than  10 years old and many of these maps reflect inaccurate data, according to  FEMA. Figure 1 shows the age distribution of the current map inventory.", "Over time, physical conditions in watersheds and floodplains can change,  and improvements in the techniques for assessing and displaying flood  risks are made. FEMA plans to use the latest technology, such as  Geographic Information Systems (GIS), to create accurate digital flood  maps. GIS technology provides the foundation for achieving FEMA\u2019s goals  of melding different types and sources of data to create the new digital  flood maps and making the new digital flood maps available to a variety of  users over the Internet.", "The primary function of GIS is to link multiple digital databases and  graphically display that information as maps with potentially many  different types of \u201clayers\u201d of information. When layers of information are  formatted using the same standards, users can potentially overlay various  layers of information about any number of specific topics to examine how  the layers interrelate. Each layer of a GIS map represents a particular  \u201ctheme\u201d or feature, and one layer could be derived from a data source  completely different from the other layers. For example, one theme could  represent all the streets in a specified area. Another theme could  correspond to the topography or elevation data of an area, and others  could show aerial photography and streams in the same area. These  themes are all key elements needed to create flood maps that accurately  depict floodplains and can be used to identify properties in these areas. In  preparing for full-scale implementation of map modernization, FEMA has  established standards and graphic specifications for digital flood maps  created with GIS. Figure 2 shows the concept of data themes in GIS for  flood maps.", "GIS technology also enables the creation of more accurate and accessible  maps than would be possible with older mapping methods and technology.  The majority of FEMA\u2019s flood map inventory was produced using manual  techniques that have inherent accuracy and accessibility limitations. For  example, in creating traditional paper flood maps, field measurements  taken by surveyors would have been transferred by hand to paper base  maps. If the paper base map contained any inaccuracies, then the field- survey data could be shown in the wrong place on the final flood map.  This would then result in floodplain boundaries being shown in the wrong  place."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Douglas County, Colorado", "paragraphs": ["Recent remapping efforts in Douglas County, Colorado, show the accuracy  of digital maps using GIS technology compared with paper maps created  using manual techniques.

More critically, some areas  shown outside the floodplain on the original map will now be shown in the  floodway, the most dangerous area of the floodplain (greatest depth,  highest flood water velocity). According to FEMA and community  officials, the limitations of the manual techniques used to create the  original map contributed to the resulting inaccuracy.", "Using GIS technology to create digital flood maps minimizes mapping  errors and improves accuracy because each data component (e.g.,  streams, streets, etc.) would have a common geographic reference system.", "By their nature, paper flood maps have limited accessibility as compared  with a digital map that can be made available on the Internet. The  expansion of Internet connectivity in recent years has substantially  enhanced the potential value of digital maps created with GIS because  now it is possible to locate and connect data from many distinct GIS  databases to develop analytical information on almost any topic that is  associated with physical locations. Digital flood maps created according to  FEMA\u2019s standards are intended to provide users not only with the ability  to determine the flood zone and base flood elevations for a particular  location, but also with the ability to access other information like road,  stream, and public land survey data. Communities could use this  information for a variety of purposes, including decisions on future  development and evacuation routes.", "As part of map modernization, FEMA has promoted the use of a variety of  advanced technologies to improve the accuracy of flood maps. In recent  years, for example, where it deems it appropriate, FEMA has promoted the  use of Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) remote sensing technologies  to generate highly detailed, digital elevation data. Elevation data are a key  component needed to determine flood risk and identify floodplain  boundaries. According to FEMA, for very flat areas where small changes in  elevation can have a large impact on where flood plain boundaries are  drawn, LIDAR can provide the level of detail needed to accurately  delineate these boundaries. Communities can also use detailed, digital  elevation data for planning and land development purposes. Figure 4  shows an airplane equipped with laser-pulsing sensors using LIDAR to  gather digital elevation data to measure the contours and crevices that  determine where floodwaters collect.", "The state of North Carolina has been utilizing GIS and LIDAR technology  to develop new flood maps.

Specifically, FEMA expects the new maps to be used to (1) improve flood  mitigation, (2) increase flood insurance participation, and (3) improve  \u201cmulti-hazard\u201d mitigation and risk management capabilities. First, FEMA  expects communities to be able to use these new and revised maps to  better manage and mitigate flood risk by regulating floodplain  development through building codes, ordinances, and regulations. Second,  the new maps also have the potential to help increase flood insurance  participation because they will more accurately identify those properties  that are in the floodplain and whose owners would be required to  purchase flood insurance. Compared with the existing paper maps,  accessing the new maps through the Internet will make it much easier for  lenders to identify property owners who should have flood insurance. In  addition, the newly revised flood maps should more accurately identify all  properties in the floodplain, including those whose owners do not have a  mortgage or whose mortgage is held by a lender that is not federally  regulated. Accurately identifying these property owners should assist  FEMA and communities in targeting their outreach about the importance  of flood insurance. Third, the data and infrastructure developed by map  modernization is also expected to help national, state, and local officials  mitigate and manage risk from multiple hazards, both natural and man- made. Accurate digital maps can provide more precise data on such things  as the location of hazardous material facilities, power plants, railroads,  and airports to state and national officials for planning development as  well as to assess internal weaknesses and evacuation routes.

At the time, the county had experienced several  significant flooding events where hundreds of properties not depicted in  the floodplain on its 11-year old maps were damaged.

Ultimately, these projects would result in structures no longer being in the  floodplain. County officials estimate that they have reduced the number of  structures in the floodplain by 75 percent (from 800 to under 200) through  these projects. According to these officials, the reduction in their  Community Rating System rating from an 8 to a 6 was due in large part to  their remapping efforts.

The guidelines do not specify standards to be used for all mapping  projects within a given risk category. Without establishing standards for  different categories of risk, FEMA cannot ensure that it uses the same  level of data collection and analysis across all communities within the  same risk category. These standards could also provide a consistent basis  for estimating the costs of developing maps in each risk category.  According to FEMA, the agency plans to develop standards that can be  applied to different levels of flood risk as part of a 5-year map  modernization implementation plan.

However, if a property was not located in the  floodplain in the old map, but is in the floodplain in the new revised map,  NFIP floodplain management regulations do not require those owners to  implement mitigation measures unless they make substantial  improvements to the structure. FEMA cannot compel affected property  owners to take steps to mitigate their properties against flood risks or to  purchase flood insurance.

According to FEMA, local, state, and  federal partners that have invested resources and assisted in managing  mapping activities have the potential to positively affect the detail,  accuracy, and quantity of the data collected and improve how these data  are used. As part of their strategy for partnering, FEMA provides guidance  to the states on how to develop \u201cbusiness plans\u201d that document planned  efforts to develop states\u2019 and communities\u2019 capability and capacity to  oversee the collection, analysis, and implementation of flood data in their  state and community and to justify funding for these efforts.

Since 2000, FEMA has leveraged millions of dollars in  funding from 171 partners (states and local communities) for producing  maps through its CTP program. For example, from fiscal years 2000 to  2002, FEMA used $70 million of its federal map modernization funding  along with state and local funds to develop what FEMA has estimated to  be more than $155 million worth of new mapping data.

Approximately 80 percent of the homes  damaged or destroyed during Hurricane Floyd were not depicted in the  floodplain on the state\u2019s flood maps. In 2000, North Carolina became the  first Cooperating Technical State under FEMA\u2019s CTP program, agreeing to  assume primary ownership and responsibility of flood maps for all North  Carolina communities. Since then, according to state floodplain mapping  officials, the state has contributed approximately $41 million towards the  overall floodplain mapping program. On the basis of this amount, North  Carolina has covered approximately 65 percent of the total cost to date for  the remapping effort. To date, 8 counties had received new effective flood  maps and 28 counties received new preliminary maps, which are now  under community review. (See fig. 13.)", "Some states and communities with few resources and technical capacities  or little history of flood mapping activities are likely to pose a challenge to  FEMA\u2019s ability to fund and implement mapping activities. For example, we  talked with flood management officials in several smaller communities in  Montgomery County, Texas; Santa Cruz County, Arizona; and Larkspur,  Colorado. These officials said that their communities lacked either the  funding needed to develop flood data, the technological capability to  develop digital flood data and use geospatial information systems, or, in  some cases, the community support needed to conduct mapping activities.  One approach for obtaining additional resources, capabilities, and  community support would be for FEMA to facilitate coordination with  other agencies within the state that have a stake in, or could benefit from,  mapping activities. For example, state departments of transportation can  benefit from information in FEMA\u2019s geospatial information system, such  as elevation data, in developing and implementing state roads and bridges.  North Carolina was able to get its state transportation department to help  fund the development of elevation data used for flood maps. FEMA has  not yet developed a strategy for how to partner with communities that do  not have the resources, capabilities, or motivation to initiate and sustain  mapping activities. Such a strategy could focus on how to assist these  potential partners in garnering community resources and developing  technological capabilities, how to coordinate with other agencies in their  state, and how to integrate these efforts with FEMA\u2019s community outreach  efforts to gain community support for mapping activities."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "New Program Management Contract Is Performance- Based, but FEMA May Have Difficulty Overseeing the Contract and Measuring Achievement of Program Objectives", "paragraphs": ["In March 2004, FEMA awarded a performance-based contract to obtain  assistance from a nationwide mapping contractor to manage tasks  associated with the significant expansion of the map modernization  program.

These tasks include managing grants for many  new mapping partners and administering contracts with independent firms  to develop and process a significantly larger quantity of flood data to  support local efforts. A staffing needs assessment completed by FEMA in  December 2003 identifies a need for an additional 75 staff with additional  skills, including contracting and program management capabilities. In  appropriating fiscal year 2004 map modernization funds, Congress  included a provision that would allow FEMA to use up to 3 percent, or   $6 million, for administrative purposes. As of March 2004, FEMA had filled  1 of the 75 positions by reallocating existing resources. According to  FEMA, it plans to fill another 33 positions using the administrative funding  identified in the fiscal year 2004 budget. In addition, FEMA also plans to  fill an additional 10 positions by moving staff from other FEMA  departments or filling vacancies.

Even with these outreach efforts,  the credibility and likely use of the maps can be compromised if there is a  perception that similar communities are not treated similarly during map  modernization. Establishing and implementing data collection and analysis  standards for communities with similar risk can help to assure  communities that map development for all communities within the same  risk category will be consistent and comparable. Such standards can also  help FEMA to target its map modernization resources more efficiently by  matching the level of data collection and analysis with the level of flood  risk. Similarly, by developing strategies for partnering with state, and local  flood management stakeholders with lower levels of capabilities and  resources, FEMA will be better able to leverage available resources and  identify the most effective approaches to engaging its partners in the  remapping process.", "To the extent that FEMA does not have appropriate numbers of staff with  the requisite skills, it may have limited ability to provide effective  monitoring and oversight of its new performance-based contract, whose  contractor has been charged with much of the day-to-day work of map  modernization that formerly FEMA performed.
