FMCSA partners with state agencies to conduct a variety of motor carrier oversight activities, which are carried out by certified auditors, inspectors, and investigators. Some motor carriers have registered under a new identity and begun to operate in interstate commerce, violating federal law in an effort to disguise their former identity and evade detection by FMCSA. Such carriers are known as chameleon carriers.", "GAO\u0092s objectives were to examine (1) the prevalence of chameleon carriers; (2) how well FMCSA\u0092s investigative programs are designed to identify suspected chameleon carriers; and (3) what constraints, if any, FMCSA faces in pursuing enforcement actions against suspected chameleon carriers.", "To address these objectives, GAO analyzed data on new applicants; reviewed investigative program guidance, federal motor carrier laws and regulations, GAO and other reports, and selected state corporate successor liability laws; observed two new entrant safety audits; and interviewed FMCSA headquarters and field officials, state officials\u0097including law enforcement agencies\u0097and motor carrier stakeholders."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["FMCSA does not determine the total number of chameleon carriers within the motor carrier industry. Such a determination would require FMCSA to investigate each of the tens of thousands of new applicants that register annually and then complete a legal process for some of these suspected chameleon carriers, an effort for which FMCSA does not have sufficient resources. Rather, FMCSA\u0092s attempt to identify chameleon carriers among new applicants, referred to as the vetting program, is limited to bus companies (passenger carriers) and movers (household goods carriers). These two relatively small groups, representing only 2 percent of all new applicants in 2010, were selected because they present consumer protection and relatively high safety risks. Through the vetting program, FMCSA conducts electronic matching of applicant registration data against data on existing carriers and investigates each application from these two small groups, but does not determine whether all other new applicants, including freight carriers, may be attempting to assume a new identity. Federal internal control standards direct agencies to assess the risks they face to determine the most effective allocation of federal resources, including how best to distribute resources for activities such as investigations and enforcement. GAO demonstrated how analysis of registration data can be used to assess risk by targeting all new applicant carriers that have attributes similar to those of chameleon carriers\u0097for example, company registration data that match data for another carrier with a history of safety violations. Using FMCSA data, GAO found an increasing number of carriers with chameleon attributes, from 759 in 2005 to 1,136 in 2010. GAO also found that 18 percent of the applicants with chameleon attributes were involved in severe crashes compared with 6 percent of new applicants without chameleon attributes.", "FMCSA\u0092s investigative programs\u0097the vetting and new entrant safety assurance programs\u0097are not well designed to identify suspected chameleon carriers. The vetting program assesses all passenger and household goods carriers applying for operating authority, but it does not cover other groups of carriers, including freight truck carriers, which represented 98 percent of all new motor carrier applicants in 2010 and were more likely to be involved in fatal crashes than passenger carriers. The new entrant safety assurance program\u0097which involves a safety audit for all new entrants, including freight carriers\u0097entails a brief assessment of whether a carrier may be chameleon, but is primarily designed to educate new entrants about federal motor carrier safety regulations. The safety audit includes questions to elicit information on connections between new and previous carriers, but auditors lack necessary guidance on how to interpret the responses to distinguish chameleon carriers from legitimate carriers.", "FMCSA faces several constraints in pursuing enforcement actions against suspected chameleon carriers. For example, as a result of a 2010 decision by an FMCSA Assistant Administrator, it is unclear whether FMCSA should use a state or a federal legal standard to demonstrate that a carrier is a chameleon. Thus, evidence is gathered to meet both a state and federal legal standard, which can lead to differing enforcement actions across states and has increased the time necessary to pursue chameleon carrier cases. FMCSA is pursuing several options to achieve a single standard, including providing input to Congress on a legislative proposal, monitoring chameleon carrier cases that could clarify the 2010 decision, and pursuing a separate rulemaking. Other constraints on FMCSA enforcement actions include a resource-intensive legal process, the inability to preclude carriers from obtaining multiple registration numbers, and low maximum fines."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["FMCSA should expand the vetting program using a data-driven approach; and provide guidance to improve the new entrant program.

Such carriers are referred  to as chameleon carriers and may include interstate passenger carriers  (intercity and charter or tour bus operators), household goods carriers  (hired by consumers to move personal property), or freight truck carriers  (shippers of commercial goods).", "Chameleon carriers can pose risks to the public. For example, the carrier  operating a bus involved in an August 2008 crash in Sherman, Texas, in  which 17 passengers were killed and several others were injured, was  found by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) to be a  chameleon carrier that FMCSA had ordered out-of-service 2 months  earlier. Subsequent fatal bus crashes have intensified public scrutiny over  passenger carriers and led FMCSA to focus its oversight efforts on  passenger carriers that it suspects may be chameleons. FMCSA also  recognized the need to strengthen its oversight of household goods  carriers to protect consumers from unscrupulous operators.", "In a July 2009 report on chameleon carriers, suggesting that 20 passenger carriers were chameleons and referred  about 500 freight and household goods carriers to FMCSA for further  investigation. These carriers had attempted to register with FMCSA in  fiscal year 2007 or 2008, and each had submitted registration data that  were similar to data submitted by another carrier that FMCSA had  ordered out-of-service. We noted that FMCSA had taken steps to improve  how it identified suspected chameleons among passenger and household  goods carriers, including initiating a vetting program to examine new  applications for operating authority, and was planning to expand its  actions to other types of carriers if it could obtain the resources to do so.", "Recognizing that chameleon carriers are often difficult to catch because they  close down and reopen as new companies, you asked us to examine  FMCSA\u2019s ongoing efforts to identify and pursue enforcement actions against  chameleon carriers, including freight carriers. To do so, we addressed the  following questions: (1) How prevalent are chameleon carriers? (2) How well  are FMCSA\u2019s investigative programs designed to identify suspected  chameleon carriers? (3) What constraints, if any, does FMCSA face in  pursuing enforcement actions against suspected chameleon carriers?", "GAO, Motor Carrier Safety: Reincarnating Commercial Vehicle Companies Pose Safety  Threat to Motoring Public; Federal Safety Agency Has Initiated Efforts to Prevent Future  Occurrences, GAO-09-924 (Washington, D.C.: July 28, 2009).", "Management Information System, enforcement actions taken against  carriers in its Enforcement Management Information System, and  insurance information from its Licensing and Insurance databases.

We analyzed data for  new applicants from January 1, 2005, through December 31, 2010,  against data for all carriers that had registered with FMCSA since June 1,  1974. To assess the reliability of these databases, we reviewed  documentation on data collection efforts and quality assurance  processes, talked with knowledgeable FMCSA officials about these data,  and checked the data for completeness and reasonableness. We  determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for describing this  population of motor carriers and performing our data-matching analysis.", "To determine how well FMCSA\u2019s investigative programs are designed to  identify chameleon carriers, we reviewed federal motor carrier laws and  safety regulations; federal internal control standards; related reports and  statements published by GAO, NTSB, and the U.S. Department of  Transportation\u2019s Office of Inspector General; documentation about  FMCSA\u2019s applicant review processes and procedures, which FMCSA  refers to as the vetting program; FMCSA policy memorandums on the  new entrant safety assurance program and the monitoring of potential  chameleon new entrant motor carriers; and FMCSA\u2019s Field Operations  Training Manual. We also observed two new entrant safety audits\u2014one in  California of a new passenger carrier and the other in Virginia of a new  freight carrier. Finally, to identify constraints FMCSA faces in pursuing  enforcement actions against chameleon carriers, we reviewed federal  motor carrier laws and regulations; GAO and other reports; FMCSA\u2019s  summary and analysis of 50 states\u2019 corporate successor liability laws,  which identified relevant case law and explained the legal standards  currently used to determine corporate successor liability; and FMCSA  decisions affecting FMCSA\u2019s enforcement authority, among other things.  In addition, to address all of our objectives, we interviewed officials at  FMCSA headquarters in Washington, D.C.; 4 regional service centers;  and 10 selected division offices. We also interviewed law enforcement  agencies in the 10 states whose division offices we had selected to  understand how the agencies are involved in identifying or taking  enforcement actions against chameleon carriers. We selected the 10  division offices and states primarily because they were the ones with the  most registered interstate carriers. In addition, we interviewed NTSB  officials, industry associations, and safety advocacy groups.

With more than 1,000 staff members at headquarters, 4 regional  service centers, and 52 division offices (one in each state, Washington, D.C.,  and Puerto Rico), FMCSA carries out this mission by administering and  enforcing federal motor carrier safety and hazardous materials regulations  and by gathering and analyzing data on motor carriers, drivers, and vehicles,  among other things. Division offices partner with state agencies to conduct a  variety of motor carrier oversight activities carried out by certified auditors,  inspectors, and investigators. These oversight activities are funded by Motor  Carrier Safety Assistance Program grants, which totaled about $165 million  in fiscal year 2010. FMCSA\u2019s total budget for fiscal year 2011 was  approximately $550 million.", "The interstate commercial motor carrier industry is large and dynamic.  According to Department of Transportation data, there were more than  500,000 active interstate carriers and intrastate hazardous materials carriers  in 2010, including about 66,000 new carriers that applied to enter the  industry. The vast majority of these carriers apply as freight carriers. While the largest motor carriers operate upwards of 50,000 vehicles, 80 percent of  carriers are small\u2014operating between 1 and 6 vehicles. Fatalities due to  accidents involving large trucks (including vehicles operated by both freight  and household goods carriers) and buses (operated by passenger carriers)  generally declined from 2000 through 2009. FMCSA officials attributed the  declines to actions taken by the federal government, the motor carrier  industry, and safety groups. Fatalities and the estimated fatality rate for large  trucks and buses are shown in figure 1. In 2009, more than 3,600 people  were killed in crashes involving large trucks and buses.", "FMCSA oversees two main groups of interstate motor carriers: (1) private  carriers, who run an internal trucking operation to support a primary  business in another industry, such as a retail store chain, and (2) for-hire  carriers that sell their trucking services on the open market. Private and  for-hire motor carriers seeking to operate in interstate commerce must  register once with FMCSA, and thereby obtain a U.S. Department of  Transportation (USDOT) number\u2014a unique identifier used for collecting  and monitoring safety information acquired during audits, compliance  reviews, inspections, and crash investigations. USDOT numbers are  issued after carriers submit information about their business, such as the  name of the business and the company\u2019s officers, a mailing address,  business and cell phone numbers, the tax number (employer identification  number or social security number) used to identify the business entity,  and other information. For private carriers, this submission completes the  registration process, and they can begin operating. In contrast, for-hire  carriers must also obtain operating authority, which dictates the type of  operation the carrier may run and the cargo it may carry.36,209 private carriers registered and 29,421 for-hire carriers applied for  operating authority with FMCSA.", "Before the August 2008 bus crash in Sherman, Texas, FMCSA had no  dedicated process to identify and prevent chameleon carriers from  applying for and receiving operating authority. At that time, a carrier could  take on a new identity by applying online for operating authority using the  same information (business name, address, phone number(s), and  company officer name(s), or other information) on file for the old carrier.  FMCSA did not have a process to identify these applications and thus  would have granted operating authority to an apparent new entrant after  the carrier submitted the appropriate data.", "Immediately after the Sherman crash, FMCSA established the vetting  program to review each new application for operating authority submitted  by for-hire passenger carriers. Subsequently, in April 2009, FMCSA  began to apply the vetting program to household goods carriers. Under  this program, FMCSA conducts a two-step process:", "First, FMCSA uses a new applicant screening algorithm to  electronically compare and match information contained in the  carrier\u2019s application to data for poorly performing carriers dating back   This match information is used by a dedicated team (called  to 2003.the vetting team) as indicators for further investigation.", "Second, the vetting team reviews each new for-hire passenger and  household goods carrier\u2019s application for completeness and accuracy  and takes additional steps to determine whether the applicant is a  chameleon carrier. For example, the team compares information in  the application to information available on the Internet, including a  carrier\u2019s address; phone number; public filings with the state (e.g.,  articles of incorporation); and, if available, the company website. The  vetting team also works with FMCSA division offices to take  advantage of local officials\u2019 knowledge of individual carriers.", "FMCSA\u2019s ability to vet for-hire motor carriers that apply for operating  authority stems from the Secretary\u2019s statutory authority to withhold  registration for operating authority from a carrier that does not meet  federal safety fitness standards or is unwilling and unable to comply with  all applicable statutes and regulations. It does not have this authority to  vet and, therefore, potentially reject the registrations of private carriers,  which may begin to operate as soon as they receive a USDOT number.", "If the computer-matching process or FMCSA division office review  identifies a suspected chameleon carrier, FMCSA requests clarification  from the applicant. If the carrier does not respond or the response  indicates the applicant is attempting to become a chameleon carrier,  FMCSA rejects the application. The entire vetting process, including the  electronic matching and the application review, can take anywhere from a  few weeks to more than 2 months depending on several factors, including  how long it takes the applicant to respond to any FMCSA requests.", "After a carrier registers for a USDOT number, FMCSA uses the new  entrant safety assurance program to examine all new entrants registered  to operate in interstate commerce\u2014including all for-hire and private  passenger, household goods, and freight carriers\u2014and intrastate  hazardous materials carriers. Under this program, which began in 2003,  carriers are required to undergo a safety audit within 18 months of  obtaining a USDOT number and beginning interstate operations. The  purpose of this audit is to determine whether carriers are knowledgeable  about and compliant with applicable safety regulations. In 2009, FMCSA  added a set of six, yes/no questions to the safety audit designed to elicit  information indicative of any connections with other carriers to help the  certified auditors and investigators that conduct these audits identify  potential chameleon carriers. At the end of the audit, a carrier may pass  or fail. If the carrier fails the audit, the carrier may continue to operate, but  must submit a plan for corrective action. Upon receiving written  confirmation that it has failed the audit, a carrier has between 45 and 60  days to provide an acceptable response or request an administrative  review of the safety audit findings before the new entrant registration is  revoked and the carrier is no longer permitted to operate in interstate  commerce.", "FMCSA operates other programs that identify suspected chameleon  carriers. For example, officials may identify suspected chameleon carriers  during compliance reviews, which are in-depth examinations of carriers  identified as high crash risks, or during roadside inspections of vehicles  that include checks for compliance with driver and maintenance  requirements. FMCSA has also implemented a new safety oversight initiative\u2014the Compliance, Safety, Accountability program\u2014under which  it plans to introduce several new investigative programs, including  targeted roadside inspections, off-site investigations, and on-site focused  investigations. Like compliance reviews and roadside inspections, these  new oversight programs may identify a suspected chameleon carrier  during either a review or a follow-up review or inspection initiated to  gather additional evidence on the carrier.", "Identifying a suspected chameleon carrier is the first step in determining  whether the carrier is attempting to conceal its identity. FMCSA and state  officials then conduct an investigation. When federal or state investigators  or auditors first suspects that a carrier may be a chameleon, they work  with officials in one of FMCSA\u2019s 52 division offices and attorneys in four  regional service centers to gather evidence and assemble the  documentation needed to demonstrate that a new carrier is the same  entity as a prior carrier and is attempting to evade a prior FMCSA  enforcement action or a poor safety record. After gathering as much  information as possible, a division office provides the evidence to a  regional service center, where FMCSA attorneys decide whether to  initiate a legal process in order to prove that the new carrier is responsible  for the actions of the prior carrier (referred to as \u201ccorporate successor  liability\u201d). As part of their evaluation, the attorneys assess the strength of the evidence and give highest priority to those cases involving carriers  with serious safety violations. If the attorneys determine that the evidence  for a chameleon carrier case is insufficient, FMCSA does not pursue the  case and the carrier continues its operations. The carrier is only  recognized as a chameleon once FMCSA proves that the carrier is a  chameleon based on the applicable legal standard or a carrier admits it  created a new identity to evade detection.", "Once FMCSA gathers the necessary evidence against a chameleon,  FMCSA issues a notice of claim to tie the history of the chameleon carrier  to that of its predecessor. The notice of claim may include several  enforcement actions, including ordering a carrier to cease operations\u2014 called out-of-service orders\u2014for safety violations and failure to pay civil  penalties. For example, one of the fines FMCSA assesses on chameleon  carriers is for evading regulations, which ranges from $200 to $500 for the  first violation and $250 to $2,000 for any subsequent violation, as  established by regulation. FMCSA may assess higher civil penalties for  carriers that are proven chameleons and can assess any unpaid penalties  of the predecessor carrier to the successor carrier."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FMCSA Does Not Determine the Prevalence of Chameleon Carriers; Our Analysis Found More than 1,100 New Applicant Carriers with Chameleon Attributes in 2010", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "FMCSA Cannot Readily Determine the Number of Chameleon Carriers", "paragraphs": ["FMCSA does not determine the prevalence of chameleon carriers  because doing so would require extensive investigation of the tens of  thousands of new applicants that register with FMCSA each year and, in  some cases, the completion of a legal process. However, FMCSA, state  enforcement officials, and industry and safety association representatives  we interviewed offered general, varying impressions of the number of  chameleon carriers in the motor carrier industry. For example, a number  of FMCSA and state officials with whom we spoke believed that while the  number of chameleon carriers is a relatively small proportion of new  entrant carriers, it is also a serious or growing problem. In addition,  groups of officials from Florida, Georgia, Illinois, and North Carolina  stated that chameleon carriers are either a serious or a growing problem  that they encounter regularly.", "Given the volume of new applicants and the necessary resources to  investigate them, FMCSA uses the vetting program to focus its review of  new applicants on two groups of carriers\u2014for-hire passenger and  household goods carriers. FMCSA has chosen to vet all applicants in  these groups for two reasons: (1) according to officials, these two groups  pose higher safety and consumer protection concerns than other carrier  groups and (2) it does not have the resources to vet all new carriers and  these two groups present a manageable number. As part of the vetting  program, FMCSA uses registration data to compare information for every  applicant in these two groups to information from previously registered  carriers to identify any matches. Officials use these results to inform  decisions about whether to grant operating authority to the applicants.", "According to FMCSA, however, data analysis by itself cannot positively  identify chameleon carriers that are purposefully trying to evade  oversight; matches do not always signify an issue. For example, vehicle  data can match when new carriers legitimately have purchased and are  using vehicles that were once owned by other carriers. Company names  also can match when carriers independently selected the same name.  Therefore, while data analysis is a helpful tool, FMCSA must conduct  further investigation to determine the reasons for an apparent relationship  between carriers and, unless the carrier admits to being a chameleon,  undertake a legal process to determine whether the carrier is a  chameleon. (Our assessment of the processes used to demonstrate a  carrier is a chameleon is discussed later in this report.)", "While FMCSA\u2019s exclusive focus on passenger and household goods  carriers limits the vetting program to a manageable number, it does not  account for the risk presented by chameleon carriers in the other groups  that made up 98 percent of new applicants in 2010. In our view, data  analysis can be used to target other types of new applicants\u2014including  freight carriers\u2014that are more likely to be chameleons for further  investigation as they register or apply for operating authority. While  FMCSA only has statutory authority to accept or reject applications of for- hire motor carriers, examining all new applicant carriers, including private  carriers, as they register for a USDOT number with FMCSA is important  to provide officials with information about all carriers subject to their  oversight activities. FMCSA and other federal agencies use data analysis  to target entities or items with certain risk factors. Specifically, FMCSA  uses state inspection and other data to identify carriers with a poor safety  record for follow-up reviews. In addition, the Department of Homeland  Security uses a targeting strategy, which includes a computerized model,  to help select imported containers for additional review, inspection, or  both. Regularly using data analysis for targeting new applicants would  allow FMCSA to expand its examinations of newly registered carriers to  include new applicants of all types using few or no additional staff  resources, as discussed in the next section of this report. As we have  previously reported, federal agencies need to assess the risks they face  to determine the most effective allocation of federal resources, including  how best to distribute resources for investigative and enforcement-related  activities.", "To demonstrate that it is possible to use data analysis to target new  applicants for further investigation, we developed a method and applied it  to FMCSA data to identify carriers with chameleon attributes. We defined  such carriers as those that met two criteria:  1.  They submitted registration information that matched information for a  previously registered carrier.2.  The previously registered carrier had a motive for evading detection.", "We use the term \u201cmotive\u201d to describe carriers that had a history of  safety violations or filed for bankruptcy that might motivate a carrier to  become a chameleon carrier.", "These criteria are similar to those FMCSA uses during the electronic  matching step in the current vetting process for for-hire passenger and  household goods carriers. However, we applied our method to all carriers  and established a threshold for selecting new applicants for further  investigation, whereas FMCSA limits its electronic matching to for-hire  passenger and household goods carriers and does not have a  mechanism or threshold for determining which new applicants to  investigate further because it vets all the carriers in these two groups. An  example of a carrier that met our criteria was a 2009 new applicant that  had submitted registration information with the same company name,  company officer, and phone number as a previously registered carrier  that had been in a crash and ordered out-of-service by FMCSA. An  example of a carrier that did not meet our criteria was a 2008 new  applicant that matched a previously registered carrier on six different  pieces of information\u2014address, company name, company officer, Dun &  Bradstreet number (a unique nine-digit number used to identify a  business location), employer identification number, and phone number\u2014 but the previously registered carrier did not have a motive for evading  detection, as defined by our criteria for this analysis. Because we were  interested in demonstrating a method of targeting new applicants as they  registered or applied for operating authority, and not specifically in  counting the number of chameleons that might currently be operating, we  did not attempt to exclude carriers that never operated or ceased to  operate after they registered with FMCSA. This approach is consistent  with the purpose of our analysis, which was to provide an objective,  efficient means of identifying carriers that may warrant additional  investigation as they enter the motor carrier industry, not specifically to  identify chameleon carriers. For a detailed discussion of our data analysis  method, see appendix II."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Our Analysis Identified More than 1,100 New Applicant Carriers with Chameleon Attributes in 2010", "paragraphs": ["Through our data analysis, we identified 1,136 new applicant carriers with  chameleon attributes in 2010\u2014an increase from 759 in 2005.

These percentages remained fairly stable over the 6-year period.  Because freight carriers represented the majority of carriers, they showed  the largest numerical increase of carriers with chameleon attributes, from  724 carriers with chameleon attributes in 2005 to 1,082 such carriers in  2010. (See table 1.)", "Although freight carriers accounted for 94 percent of the carriers with  chameleon attributes that we identified, freight carriers also made up  about the same percentage of all new applicants (about 93 percent).  When we looked at the rates at which carriers of different types had  chameleon attributes, we found that passenger carriers were more likely  to have chameleon attributes than were carriers of other types.  Specifically, over the 6-year period from 2005 through 2010, the  percentage of new applicant passenger carriers with chameleon attributes  was higher in every year (ranging from 1.9 to 3.3 percent) than the  percentages for freight carriers (ranging from 1.6 to 1.9 percent) and  household goods carriers (ranging from 0.6 to 1.2 percent). (See fig. 2.)", "One concern with our approach, which FMCSA raised in connection with our  data-matching efforts as well as its own, is that the matching may not give an  accurate picture of the total number of chameleon carriers for two reasons.  First, data matching could identify carriers that have legitimate business  reasons for registering a new company that appears to be related to an older  one, and second, similar or even identical registration information may  inadvertently or coincidentally be submitted by unrelated companies. We  were able to address this concern in part by analyzing data about whether an  older carrier had a motive to evade detection\u2014information that we and  FMCSA believe indicates that a new carrier is more likely to be a chameleon.  In particular, we looked at the relative likelihood that an old carrier with and  without a motive would match a new applicant. If data matches were only the  result of carriers having legitimate business reasons for assuming a new  identity or coincidental similarities in registration information, then we would  expect old carriers with a motive to be no more likely to match new  applicants than old carriers without a motive. In fact, however, we found that  old carriers with a motive were roughly twice as likely to match a new  applicant in 2009 or 2010 as were carriers without a motive. This suggests  that the data-matching component of our analysis was effective in detecting  carriers with chameleon attributes and not just carriers with legitimate  reasons to assume new identities or coincidental similarities to previously  registered carriers.", "While this test demonstrates that our method identified carriers with a  motive to evade detection, further investigation would be needed to  confirm whether any of the carriers on our list of carriers with chameleon  attributes actually are chameleons. We believe using the two criteria of  matching registration information and a motive to evade detection  provides a sound basis for targeting. Using a risk-based, data-driven  approach such as the one we outline would allow FMCSA to use  available resources to target all types of carriers, including freight, and  then periodically evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and  adjust its method based on the outcomes of follow-up investigations.  Without such a method, FMCSA cannot target a manageable group of  new applicant carriers of all types for investigation and possible  enforcement action, an important caveat given FMCSA\u2019s staffing levels."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Carriers with Chameleon Attributes Present High Safety Risks", "paragraphs": ["The carriers we identified as having chameleon attributes presented high  safety risks relative to new applicants without these attributes.

After a carrier obtains operating  authority, however, FMCSA is required to gather evidence and prove that  the carrier is a chameleon\u2014a process that calls for significantly more  resources, as discussed later in this report. Therefore, as FMCSA officials  and safety advocates have observed, it is more effective for FMCSA to  identify chameleon carriers up front through vetting than it is to pursue  them after they have obtained operating authority.", "FMCSA recognizes the benefits of identifying chameleon carriers early,  before they obtain operating authority. However, FMCSA officials stated  they do not have the resources to vet all for-hire carriers that apply for new  operating authority. Therefore, as noted, FMCSA focuses the vetting  program on for-hire passenger and household goods carriers, which  together account for about 2 percent of the approximately 66,000 new  applicant carriers in 2010. FMCSA has selected these two types of carriers  because it sees the chameleons among them as presenting risks to  consumers. Specifically, crashes involving unsafe passenger carriers, such  as the Sherman bus crash, may have multiple fatalities. In addition,  passenger carriers with safety violations have a motive to become  chameleon carriers to conceal their history of violations from consumers, as  well as from FMCSA. Similarly, unscrupulous household goods carriers  that have defrauded consumers, such as by holding their property hostage  until they have paid more than agreed to have their property delivered,  have a reason to become chameleon carriers to avoid association with  complaints from defrauded consumers. Having a statutory consumer  , FMCSA vets every for-hire passenger and  protection responsibilityhousehold goods carrier so that consumers will have greater assurance  when they buy bus tickets or contract with movers that the carriers they are  dealing with are safe, honest, and comply with FMCSA regulations.", "From August 2008 through May 2011, FMCSA vetted 5,777 for-hire  passenger and household goods carriers. Table 3 shows the results of  FMCSA\u2019s vetting program, including the number of carriers that were  approved or rejected, withdrew, or switched their application to operate as  a freight carrier rather than a household goods carrier. FMCSA officials  believe, but cannot be certain, that some of these carriers withdrew or  switched their application to avoid the vetting program.", "FMCSA officials credit the vetting program with helping to prevent and  deter unsafe for-hire passenger and household goods carriers, which can  include potential chameleon carriers, from obtaining operating authority.  However our analysis found that the vast majority of passenger and  household goods carriers do not have chameleon attributes and therefore  FMCSA is using the majority of its program resources to vet carriers that  may not represent a higher risk of being chameleons. At the same time, the  current vetting program excludes 98 percent of all new applicants, such as  all freight carriers as well as private passenger carriers. Moreover,  according to our analysis, freight carriers present safety risks that are as  great as or greater than those presented by passenger carriers. As  discussed, freight carriers made up 94 percent of the carriers we identified  with chameleon attributes from 2005 through 2010, and carriers with  chameleon attributes were about three times more likely than all other new  applicants to be involved in a severe crash or to be assessed a fine by  FMCSA for a safety violation. In addition, according to 2009 Department of  Transportation crash data, the number of fatalities per fatal crash is nearly  the same for large trucks (1.13) as for buses (1.15), even though buses  have more occupants. Furthermore, the number of people who died in  truck crashes in 2009 (3,380) is more than 13 times greater than the  number who died in bus crashes (254). (See fig. 3).", "As previously noted, federal agencies must assess the risks they face to  determine the most effective allocation of federal resources, including the  best distribution of resources for enforcement-related activities. Other  federal organizations have reviewed the vetting program and  recommended that FMCSA (1) show the program is effective and (2) use  a risk-based approach to target its limited resources before expanding the  program to all new freight carrier applicants. First, NTSB recommended  that FMCSA add a performance evaluation component to the vetting  program to show whether the new applicant screening algorithm is  effectively preventing carriers with a history of evading safety  requirements from continuing to operate.recommendation and is working to implement it. The results of the vetting   FMCSA agreed with this  program appear to indicate that it has value in preventing many carriers  from obtaining operating authority, but its effectiveness remains to be  determined. As our presentation of FMCSA\u2019s data in table 3 shows, 1,408  of the 5,777 applicants for new operating authority were rejected and  another 594 withdrew their applications.", "Second, the Department of Transportation\u2019s Inspector General reported  that expanding the vetting program to include freight carriers would  require a risk-based approach, since FMCSA has limited resources to   Our analysis suggests that a risk-based  examine all new applicants.approach would allow such an expansion with few or no additional staff  resources. Specifically, with six dedicated specialists, FMCSA vetted, on  average, 175 for-hire passenger and household goods carriers per month  from August 13, 2008, through May 18, 2011 (5,777 carriers divided by  33 months). Expanding the program to include all the freight carriers with  chameleon attributes that we identified using our data-driven, risk-based  approach would require FMCSA to vet, on average, an additional 74  freight carriers per month (5,329 freight carriers divided by 72 months), or  a total of 249 carriers per month. If, for example, six specialists can vet an  average of 175 carriers per month, or about 29 carriers per specialist,  then eight to nine specialists (or two to three more specialists) should  reasonably be expected to vet 249 carriers per month, on average,  including all the passenger and household goods carriers that FMCSA  currently vets, plus the freight carriers we identified with chameleon  attributes. Alternatively, if FMCSA were to modify its current program and  vet only carriers with chameleon attributes identified through data  analysis, it could vet all passenger, household goods, and freight carriers  with chameleon attributes using fewer specialists than it now uses.  FMCSA officials stated that, given the safety risks associated with  passenger carriers, they would be unwilling to exclude any of them from  the vetting program. Yet no matter which approach FMCSA takes to  vetting passenger carriers, the use of data analysis would allow it to  expand the vetting program to include freight carriers with chameleon  attributes and give FMCSA an early opportunity to detect and deny  operating authority to freight carriers that pose safety risks."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "New Entrant Safety Assurance Program Audit Includes Questions Designed to Help Identify Chameleon Carriers but Does Not Provide Related Guidance", "paragraphs": ["Newly registered motor carriers, including those that were vetted, are  required to enter the new entrant safety assurance program and undergo  a safety audit. This audit is mainly designed to educate new entrant  carriers about federal motor carrier safety regulations, ensure they are  able to comply with these regulations, and require them correct any  deficiencies before continuing to operate.

These  questions provide a cursory review of new entrants with regards to  whether they may be chameleon carriers.", "The new entrant safety assurance program provides the first opportunity  for FMCSA to assess freight and private passenger carriers, which are  not currently vetted. The program does not, however, allow FMCSA to  deny the new entrant registration of a carrier simply because it suspects  that the carrier may be a chameleon. Instead, freight and private  passenger carriers acquire provisional registration when they submit new  entrant applications to FMCSA, often months before they undergo a  safety audit, and it is not as easy for FMCSA to prevent them from  operating as it is to deny operating authority to for-hire passenger and  household goods carriers through the vetting program. FMCSA can  place new entrant carriers out-of-service for at least 1 of 16 safety  violations, but not because it suspects the carrier of being a chameleon.", "According to representatives responsible for safety audits in the states we  contacted, the set of six, yes/no questions added to the safety audit helps  raise new staff awareness of chameleon carriers and reminds more  experienced staff to watch for them. Yet, they said the questions may not  help them identify chameleon carriers because there is little guidance on  how to use the questions. Specifically, FMCSA\u2019s electronic Field  Operations Training Manual\u2014a guide that helps to standardize audits  across all states and includes law enforcement best practices\u2014provides  instructions for staff to follow when conducting the safety audit, but  contains no guidance for these questions, even though it includes  guidance for all other questions asked during the audit. According to  FMCSA, the computer application used during the safety audit\u2014called  SENTRI\u2014provides some guidance on what constitutes an affiliation with  another carrier and how to document responses to these questions.  However, this guidance does little to help staff distinguish legitimate  carriers from chameleons, does not provide follow-up questions that could  help them make this distinction, and does not require them to collect any  evidence that could be used during the enforcement process at a later  date. As a result, staff lack direction on how to use the yes/no questions  to distinguish a chameleon from a legitimate carrier, what follow-up  questions to ask when carriers provide information, what documents to  request from a suspected chameleon carrier, and how to document  suspicions in the safety audit report that a carrier may be chameleon. The  representatives told us the lack of guidance on how to use the questions  made it difficult to distinguish chameleon from legitimate carriers. For  example, according to representatives of Pennsylvania\u2019s Bureau of  Transportation and Safety, an auditor could mistakenly flag one carrier as  a suspected chameleon for leasing vehicles from another carrier when  the leasing can be a legitimate business transaction between the two  companies. Florida Highway Patrol officers commented that a question  about whether a carrier was affiliated with another was not useful  because corporate officers may have legitimate professional associations  with other corporate officers of other carriers. According to federal internal  control standards, federal agencies, such as FMCSA, are to develop and  clearly communicate guidance that flows from agency priorities. Without  guidance for staff on how to use the six yes/no questions related to  identifying chameleon carriers, FMCSA cannot ensure that the new  entrant program will effectively identify such carriers. In commenting on  our findings, FMCSA stated that as part of a larger effort to improve the  new entrant program, it is reviewing the questions used to detect  chameleon carriers during the safety audit process, which is where  FMCSA believes the best impact can be made. In addition, FMCSA plans  to ensure that all the questions are clear, including those used to identify  chameleon carriers, and auditors understand how to answer them  properly in order to obtain the best information.

Roadside inspections check carriers for compliance  with driver and vehicle maintenance requirements. Neither of these  investigations is designed to identify chameleon carriers, but can  incidentally lead to identifying such carriers. For example, safety  investigators conducting compliance reviews or roadside inspectors have  identified chameleon carriers because they happened to see  documentation (e.g., a driver\u2019s hours-of-service logbook or vehicle  maintenance records) labeled with another carrier\u2019s name, noticed the  vehicle marked with another carrier\u2019s name or USDOT number under a  coat of fresh paint, or recognized a suspected chameleon carrier in the  local area. During one roadside inspection in Florida, an inspector noticed  a freight truck displaying a makeshift cardboard sign with the carrier\u2019s  name written in magic marker. The crude sign, along with the driver\u2019s  suspicious behavior, led the inspector to notify FMCSA, which determined  the carrier was a suspected chameleon carrier.

The legal  standard for determining corporate successor liability varies among  states, and until 2006, FMCSA used the applicable state standard to  determine liability. In a 2006 decision, an Administrative Law Judge  applied a federal legal standard rather than a state standard to  demonstrate corporate successor liability. However, a 2010 decision by  an FMCSA Assistant Administrator left an open question as to which  standard\u2014federal or state\u2014FMCSA should use to determine motor  carrier successor liability.

Absent a single federal legal standard, FMCSA attempts to  gather evidence to meet both the federal standard and the state  standards that could be applicable in a case. Applying multiple standards  may lead to enforcement actions that differ from state to state and,  according to FMCSA officials, gathering evidence to meet both the federal  and the applicable state standard has increased the amount of time  necessary to pursue enforcement actions against chameleon carriers.

The carrier can decide to  pay the fine, contest the NOC, or fail to respond to the NOC. If the carrier  fails to respond to the NOC, FMCSA orders the carrier out-of-service after  90 days. If the carrier contests the NOC, the process provides four  alternative routes, each with a number of steps. If FMCSA is able to  demonstrate that the suspected chameleon carrier and its presumed  predecessor are the same entity, the process concludes with a final  agency order, which allows FMCSA to take the enforcement actions  identified in the order. For example, a final agency order may require  the successor carrier to pay the fines owed by the predecessor carrier,  adjust the successor carrier\u2019s rating to reflect the entire history of the  company, or order the successor carrier to cease operations.

Specifically,  FMCSA cannot preclude carriers, including suspected chameleon  carriers, from acquiring a new USDOT number. A new number allows a  carrier to operate under a new identity and thus avoid any association  with its history operating under another USDOT number, including any  fines or out-of-service orders incurred under its former identity. FMCSA  officials have stated that it is not illegal for a carrier to apply for multiple  USDOT numbers because carriers may have legitimate business reasons  for needing more than one number. For example, carriers that operate in  different locations may want to separate their business practices across  multiple routes or businesses. However, carriers that apply for multiple  USDOT numbers may also do so to prevent or avoid subsequent  detection as chameleon carriers. To strengthen its enforcement efforts  against chameleon carriers, FMCSA stated that it is drafting a rule in  response to a congressional mandate that would enable it to deny an  application for operating authority of a for-hire motor carrier if any of the  company\u2019s officers has engaged in a pattern or practice of avoiding  compliance, or concealing noncompliance with such regulations.

According to a recent  NTSB report, the fines imposed on carriers for violations are low and do  not serve as an effective deterrent. NTSB further concluded that the fines for serious violations are so low that some carriers, especially  passenger carriers, may treat them as a cost of doing business. FMCSA  and state officials, as well as industry association representatives, have  also expressed concerns about the deterrent value of FMCSA\u2019s fines. For  example, a civil penalty that can be assessed against chameleon carriers,  such as for evasion of regulations, ranges from $200 to $500 for the first  violation and $250 to $2,000 for any subsequent violation. This penalty  is potentially less than the cost to apply for operating authority, which is  set at $300. FMCSA officials acknowledged that setting fines at the  appropriate levels is a delicate balancing act. The fines must be high  enough for carriers to view them as a deterrent and not simply as a cost  of doing business, but not so high that carriers choose to become  chameleons to avoid payment.

This proposal included language  establishing a federal legal standard for determining corporate  successorship that would set a single standard nationwide. This standard  would expressly preempt state corporation successor laws applying only  to federal motor carrier safety. According to FMCSA officials, the federal  standard would be consistent with FMCSA\u2019s mission to ensure motor  carrier safety and would establish FMCSA\u2019s authority over the chameleon  carrier corporate succesorship issues. The federal standard would include  specific criteria for determining what constitutes a successor carrier and  would eliminate the need for FMCSA to apply various state laws in its  chameleon carrier cases. Furthermore, a single nationwide standard  would provide uniformity in FMCSA\u2019s enforcement actions against  chameleon carriers. In addition, such a standard could discourage  carriers from incorporating their business in states where corporate  successorship is difficult to demonstrate\u2014a phenomenon that FMCSA  officials suspect takes place now. For example, corporate successor  liability is generally more difficult to prove in New York than it is in New  Jersey and Pennsylvania, which may encourage carriers that understand  the legalities of corporate successorship to consider reincorporating in  New York. In addition, FMCSA is pursuing two other means to achieve a  single federal legal standard. First, officials are monitoring chameleon  carrier cases to identify one that could be used to clarify the 2010  Assistant Administrator\u2019s decision.

FMCSA has made strides toward protecting consumers from some of  these unscrupulous carriers by vetting for-hire passenger and household  goods carriers to identify and deny operating authority to those that may  be chameleon carriers. However, these two types of carriers together  accounted for only about 2 percent of the new motor carrier population in  2010, leaving the remaining 98 percent unvetted and free to operate  before they undergo a new entrant safety audit\u2014a program that provides  some opportunity for auditors to identify potential chameleon carriers, but  is not primarily designed to do so. Our analysis of FMCSA data found that  of the more than 1,100 new motor carrier applicants in 2010 that had  chameleon attributes, the vast majority were freight carriers. Given that  the number of fatalities is far greater for freight carriers than for  passenger carriers, we believe that FMCSA should not exclude freight  carriers from its vetting program. Even with the large number of new  applicant carriers and constraints on its resources, FMCSA could target  the carriers that present the highest risk of becoming chameleons by  using a data-driven, risk-based approach. Targeting could reduce the  population of carriers to be vetted to a manageable number. FMCSA  could choose to apply a data-driven, risk-based approach to all types of  carriers, or could limit its use to freight carriers while continuing its current  practice of vetting all for-hire passenger and household goods carriers.  We believe that our targeting method, which considers both matching on  registration information and having a motive to evade detection, provides  a sound basis for FMCSA to select new applicant carriers for further  investigation. Yet we also recognize that FMCSA will need to periodically  evaluate the effectiveness of this approach as officials investigate carriers  and learn more about the attributes of chameleon carriers. By applying a  risk-based approach and expanding the vetting program to include freight  carriers, FMCSA would help keep unsafe carriers off the road and reduce  the amount of time, effort, and money necessary to investigate and  prosecute chameleon carriers at a later date.", "In addition, FMCSA is not taking full advantage of the new entrant safety  assurance program audit to identify potential chameleon carriers,  including those that slipped through the vetting program and those that  are freight carriers undergoing scrutiny for the first time. While the audit  includes a set of questions designed to help auditors identify chameleon  carriers, FMCSA\u2019s electronic Field Operations Training Manual lacks  guidance on how to use the questions during the audit to distinguish  chameleons from legitimate carriers. For example, the guidance should  prompt auditors on what types of follow-up questions to ask and what  further evidence should be collected based on carrier\u2019s responses.  FMCSA is reviewing the new entrant audit questions, but unless the  guidance contains such aspects, FMCSA lacks assurance that the new  entrant auditors can effectively identify chameleon carriers.", "Absent a single standard for determining corporate successor liability,  FMCSA can take months to develop a case to meet both a federal and the  applicable state standard in order to prove that the carrier is a chameleon,  and subsequently carry out enforcement actions. A federal standard would  make the enforcement process parallel across all states, especially in  states where FMCSA currently faces difficulties demonstrating corporate  successor liability. A federal standard would also discourage carriers from  incorporating across state lines to evade detection. FMCSA is currently  exploring three different avenues for establishing a federal standard: (1)  congressional action, (2) monitoring a case that could lead to the  establishment of a single federal legal standard for chameleon carrier  cases in all states, and (3) rulemaking.

We  used information from the following Department of Transportation  databases: MCMIS, the Licensing and Insurance system, and the  Enforcement Management Information System, as of May 2011.

Alternatively, if a new carrier matched an old carrier on carrier  name and address, but not on company officer name (or any other fields),  the new carrier would receive a score of (1 \u00d7 0) + 0.5 = 0.5.

We selected these  attributes based on discussions with FMCSA officials indicating that they  are possible reasons that a carrier might attempt to become a chameleon  and are attributes that FMCSA used for creating a list of poorly  performing carriers within its new applicant screening algorithm.

In addition, we counted a carrier as  having a motive only if the first appearance of the motive predated the  new carrier\u2019s registration with FMCSA. For example, a filing for  bankruptcy was counted as motive only if the old carrier filed for  bankruptcy before the new carrier registered. However, we were unable  to determine whether a motive, having initially appeared, was still present  at just the time when the new carrier registered.

First, data matching could identify carriers that have legitimate  business reasons for registering a new company that appears to be  related to an older one. Second, similar or even identical registration  information may inadvertently be submitted by unrelated companies. In  order to address this issue, we used information about whether an older  carrier had a motive to evade detection\u2014a feature that we and FMCSA  believe indicates that a new carrier is more likely to be a chameleon than  a carrier without such a feature. In particular, we looked at the likelihood  that an older carrier with a motive would match a new applicant, as  compared to the likelihood that an older carrier without a motive would  match a new applicant. If the only causes of data matches were carriers  that had legitimate business reasons for assuming a new identity and  accidental similarities in registration information, then we would expect  older carriers with a motive to be no more likely to match new applicants  than older carriers without a motive. However, if matches do occur  because of chameleons registering, then we would expect older carriers  with a motive to be more likely to match new applicants than older  carriers without a motive. We formalize this reasoning as follows:   Using these formulas in conjunction with several different match score  thresholds, we found that a difference in the likelihood of a match for  carriers with a motive and those without depended on the particular  match score threshold that was used (see tables 6 and 7).", "In table 6, the number in the final column, R, can be interpreted as  follows: when we used a match score threshold of 1.0 (see the first row of  the table), pre-2009 carriers with a motive were 2.1 times more likely to  match a new applicant in 2009 than were pre-2009 carriers without a  motive. Similarly, when we used a threshold of 1.5, pre-2009 carriers with  a motive were 2.6 times more likely to match a new applicant in 2009  than were pre-2009 carriers without a motive.", "As shown in table 7, we conducted a similar analysis for 2010:  As the tables show, the difference in likelihood between carriers with a  motive and those without depended on the particular match score  threshold that we used. For both 2009 and 2010, we tested a range of  match score thresholds (from 1.0 to 2.5), and in all cases carriers with  motive were statistically significantly more likely to match a new applicant  than were carriers without motive.", "These results suggest that the matching component of our analysis did  not merely detect accidental or benign matches, such as carriers that  registered a new company for legitimate business reasons, but rather  identified carriers seeking to evade detection. Specifically, if matches  occurred only for benign or accidental reasons, then we would expect  matching to be no more likely among carriers with a motive than among  carriers without. That is, we would expect R to be near 1.0. In fact, we  found that older carriers with a motive were roughly twice as likely to  match a new applicant in 2009 or 2010 as were older carriers without a  motive. This suggests that the data-matching component of our analysis  was effective in detecting carriers with chameleon attributes and not just  carriers with legitimate reasons to assume new identities or accidental  similarities to previously registered carriers.
