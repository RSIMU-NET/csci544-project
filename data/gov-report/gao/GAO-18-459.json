This report examines (1) the extent to which APHIS and NIH have provided federal facilities with guidance for reporting their animal use programs, (2) the extent to which APHIS and NIH have shared agencies' animal use information with the public, and (3) stakeholder views on federal agencies' sharing additional information. GAO identified federal agencies that used vertebrate animals in research in fiscal years 2014 through 2016, reviewed their reports to APHIS and NIH, and examined publicly available data.

Federal research facilities we reviewed met NIH's reporting instructions. However, APHIS's instructions have not ensured consistent and complete reporting in three areas: research with birds, activities outside the United States, and field studies outside a typical laboratory. By clarifying its instructions, APHIS could improve the quality of animal use data it receives from agencies.", "APHIS and NIH voluntarily share some information about agencies' animal research with the public. In particular, APHIS posts to its website data on agencies' annual use of animals covered by the Animal Welfare Act, and NIH publicly posts a list of research facilities with approved animal use programs. However, APHIS does not describe potential limitations related to the accuracy and completeness of the data it shares as called for by USDA guidance. For example, APHIS does not explain that the data do not include birds used for activities that are covered by the Animal Welfare Act and may include field studies that are not covered by the act. APHIS could increase the data's usefulness to the public by making such disclosures.", "Federal agencies may have additional information about their animal use programs, including data on vertebrate species used but not reported to APHIS; the purpose of research activities; and internal inspection reports. However, stakeholders GAO surveyed had different views on agencies' sharing such data with the public.

These activities can occur in laboratories or field  settings and have many purposes, such as developing knowledge about  human disease diagnosis and treatment, testing medicines and other  products for toxicity, training professionals in veterinary methods, and  conserving animal populations. Federal agencies conducted research  using animals at about 120 domestic and international research facilities  in fiscal years 2014 through 2016. For example, the Departments of  Defense, Health and Human Services (HHS), and Veterans Affairs have  used rats, mice, nonhuman primates, and other species in research on  disease prevention and treatment. The U.S. Department of Agriculture  (USDA) has used cattle, poultry, and other agricultural species in  research on animal production and health and on the effects of animal  agriculture on the environment, among other things. The Departments of  Commerce and the Interior and other agencies have also conducted  conservation research on a wide range of species, often in the field.", "Research with animals has led to advances in scientific understanding,  but it has also raised concerns about animal welfare. In particular,  concerns about the welfare of animals used in research encompass a  range of factors, such as efforts to minimize pain, the suitability of living  conditions, the negative effects on wild populations when animals are  removed or handled, and the care provided for animals when they are no  longer needed for research. In response to these and other concerns, the  U.S. government has implemented statutes, regulations, and policies that  govern how animals are to be cared for and used for certain purposes,  including research conducted by federal and nonfederal facilities.", "In particular, the USDA\u2019s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service  (APHIS) is responsible for implementing the Animal Welfare Act. APHIS  is to:  implement standards for the humane handling, care, treatment, and  transportation of the species covered by the act,  routinely inspect nonfederal research facilities for compliance with  those standards, and collect information from federal and nonfederal research facilities  about their uses of animals covered by the act.", "The HHS\u2019s National Institutes of Health (NIH) is responsible for  establishing guidelines implementing certain provisions of the Health  Research Extension Act of 1985. Specifically, NIH  is responsible for  reviewing federal and nonfederal research facilities\u2019 animal care and use  programs to determine whether they meet relevant standards and are  thereby eligible to receive funding from HHS\u2019s Public Health Service  agencies, including NIH. To complete this review, NIH  collects  information from research facilities about their use of animals. NIH\u2019s  review includes federal agencies that wish to receive Public Health  Service funding.", "These and other statutes also address, to varying degrees, actions that  federal and nonfederal research facilities must take to collect and report  information about their animal research activities to APHIS, NIH,  or the  public. For example, the regulations implementing the Animal Welfare Act  require that all research facilities annually report information about their  use of certain animals to APHIS. Likewise, the Health Research  Extension Act requires that facilities that receive Public Health Service  funding report information about their animal use program to NIH. The  public may request information about agencies\u2019 research activities using  procedures established under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA),  which requires federal agencies to provide the public with access to  government information, with some exceptions, on the basis of the  principles of openness and accountability in government.", "You asked us to review several issues related to federal agencies\u2019 use of  animals in research and related activities\u2014specifically, research with their  own staff using their own facilities and equipment. This report examines:  the extent to which APHIS  and NIH provided federal agencies with  guidance for reporting on their animal use programs,  the extent to which APHIS  and NIH share information on animal use  with the public, and stakeholders\u2019 views on federal agencies\u2019 sharing of additional  information.", "We focused our review on federal agencies that conduct research with  vertebrate animals. Our review did not examine the research performed  by nonfederal entities using federal funding. We sought to identify  agencies that conduct activities with vertebrate species because the  Animal Welfare Act and the Health Research Extension Act govern  activities with vertebrate species but not activities with invertebrate  species.", "Using these criteria, we focused our review on 10 agencies that we  identified as conducting such activities (with their own staff using their  own facilities and equipment) during fiscal years 2014, 2015, or 2016.  The agencies are Commerce, Defense, HHS, Department of Homeland  Security (DHS), Interior, USDA, VA, the Environmental Protection Agency  (EPA), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and  the Smithsonian Institution. We chose to analyze these agencies\u2019  activities and compliance with the reporting requirements over the 3-year  period in order to better identify issues that might not be evident in  examining a single year, and fiscal year 2016 was the most recent year  for which data reported to APHIS  were available.  To identify these 10  agencies, we contacted a total of 14 independent agencies that we  believed were likely to conduct research using vertebrate animal species  based on information from USDA, HHS, and other relevant sources. We  asked the 14 agencies to identify the species of vertebrate animals that  they used in research within the 3-year time frame. Four agencies responded that they did not conduct research with vertebrate animals in  fiscal years 2014 through 2016. Therefore, they did not meet our criteria  for inclusion in our review. See appendix I for detailed information on the  activities of the 10 agencies included in our review.", "To examine the extent to which APHIS and NIH provided federal  agencies with guidance for reporting on their animal use programs, we  took the following steps:", "APHIS. We reviewed the Animal Welfare Act and its implementing  regulations and interviewed agency officials to identify relevant  reporting requirements and determine whether they were consistent  with APHIS\u2019s reporting instructions. To assess the instructions, we  examined how agencies followed them in practice. In particular, we  obtained from APHIS the data that federal agencies or their facilities  submitted for fiscal years 2014 through 2016 to determine whether  agencies submitted reports as expected.", "NIH. We reviewed the Health Research Extension Act and  accompanying NIH policy to identify the information that federal  research facilities must provide to NIH to be eligible for Public Health  Service funding. We also reviewed NIH\u2019s guidance to research  facilities on how to obtain eligibility  for funding. To assess the  guidance, we examined its implementation through NIH  and other  federal agencies\u2019 actions. In particular, we determined whether NIH  had current approvals for all federal research facilities receiving such  funding through interviews with NIH officials and by reviewing NIH  documents. We then reviewed a sample of 16 assurances from  federal facilities chosen by randomly selecting a facility from each  agency or sub-agency that had approved animal care and use  programs. We compared the information in the selected assurance  documents with NIH\u2019s guidance to determine whether the documents  contained key information.", "We also took steps to assess the reliability of information that APHIS  provided us about federal agencies and facilities that report to it under the  Animal Welfare Act and information that NIH provided on federal research facilities receiving Public Health Service funding. In particular, we cross- checked animal use information from APHIS with animal use information  we obtained directly from the 10 agencies in our review of their facilities\u2019  research activities. In addition, we checked summary data on animal use  that we obtained from APHIS against the annual reports that federal  agencies sent to APHIS under the Animal Welfare Act to determine  whether the data were consistent. We also reviewed NIH\u2019s website for  information about research facilities with approved assurances, and we  reviewed NIH documentation and queried NIH officials about their  process for ensuring that facilities receiving Public Health Service funding  for animal research have an assurance. Based on these steps, we  determined that the APHIS and NIH  information on federal facilities that  conduct animal research was sufficiently reliable for examining APHIS  and NIH guidance to agencies on reporting about their animal use  programs.", "To examine the extent to which APHIS and NIH share information on  animal use with the public, we interviewed agency officials and reviewed  agency websites. In particular, we interviewed APHIS officials to identify  the agency\u2019s current policies and procedures for collecting and posting to  its website the annual reports the agency receives from research  facilities. We reviewed the APHIS website to document the timespan  covered by the data that are posted and the methods by which the data  can be searched by the public. We also reviewed APHIS\u2019s posting of  annual report data against USDA\u2019s data quality requirements, which state  that USDA\u2019s agencies and its offices will strive to ensure that the  information they disseminate for the public is substantively accurate,  reliable, and unbiased and presented in an accurate, clear, complete, and  unbiased manner. We interviewed NIH officials to identify the agency\u2019s  policies and procedures for making public information about research  facilities that seek approval for a Public Health Service animal welfare  assurance, such as the identity of facilities with approved assurances or  descriptions of their animal care programs.", "For insight into stakeholders\u2019 views on federal agencies\u2019 sharing  additional information, we surveyed federal departments and agencies that conduct research as well as nonfederal organizations and individuals  we identified as having knowledge and interest in animal research. We  surveyed the 10 federal agencies that we identified as conducting  research with vertebrate animals in fiscal years 2014, 2015, or 2016. All  10 agencies provided at least one response, with some providing  responses from multiple sub-agencies or components. The total number  of federal responses was 20.", "We also sent surveys to a nongeneralizable sample of 28 nonfederal  stakeholders identified using a \u201csnowball selection\u201d methodology. We  sought to gather perspectives from a variety of stakeholders, and our  sample included organizations that advocate on behalf of animals;  research and science organizations; individuals from academia; and other  stakeholders we identified as having knowledge of animal research  issues and a national focus or representation. Nineteen of these 28  groups completed the survey. See app. II for a complete list of  respondents.", "The survey asked about specific types of information about animal use  and whether stakeholders believed federal agencies should proactively  and routinely share such information with the public on a website or by  other means. In particular, we asked respondents for their views on  whether agencies should routinely make available to the public  information that we determined agencies may possess for internal  decision-making purposes and, under certain circumstances, may provide  to other parties, including NIH or a private organization for accreditation of  a facility\u2019s animal care program. Such information could include data on  all vertebrate animals used, information on the purpose of specific  research activities, and general descriptions of the agency\u2019s animal care  program. The survey also asked whether stakeholders reviewed and  used annual reports that APHIS posts on its website and what changes  stakeholders would like to see, if any, in how APHIS collects and posts  annual report data on its website. See app. III  for a summary of the  stakeholders\u2019 suggested changes. We included these questions to  understand the extent to which stakeholders use available data and  whether they had suggestions for changes in how APHIS currently makes  data routinely available. We did not ask stakeholders a similar question  about NIH because that agency does not proactively provide data to the  public about federal agencies\u2019 use of animals in research.", "We conducted this performance audit from April 2017 to May 2018 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

One federal  stakeholder said that it provides the public with information about the  nature and extent of field research when it is required by the Marine  Mammal Protection Act of 1972 or the Endangered Species Act of  1973 to obtain permits; the permitting processes include public notice  and comment. In addition, some stakeholders said that certain types of  information, such as the identity of the species used and the purpose and  expected benefit of specific research projects are already published in  peer-reviewed journals that are accessible to the public.", "Several stakeholders also responded that providing additional information  would impose an administrative burden on agencies. For example,  several stakeholders said any potential public benefit from the additional  information shared with the public would not justify the effort to collect and  share the information, and one stakeholder said that providing certain  types of information would reduce the time they have to do actual  research. In addition, one stakeholder said that a requirement to make  additional information available to the public would be in direct conflict  with a 2016 law that directed NIH, the Food and Drug Administration, and  USDA to look for ways to reduce administrative burdens associated with  animal welfare regulations.", "Other less frequently cited reasons that stakeholders gave for not  believing that agencies should proactively and routinely share additional  information with the public included:", "Certain information, such as expenditures on animal use, could be  difficult to collect from disparate sources.
