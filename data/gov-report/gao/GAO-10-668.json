L. No. 110-315, mandated GAO to study the financial and compliance audits and reviews required or conducted for the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) program and the Federal Direct Student Loan (DL) program. The Department of Education's (Education) Office of Federal Student Aid is responsible for administering these programs. This report focuses on (1) identifying differences and similarities in audit requirements and oversight procedures for the FFEL and DL programs, including anticipated changes to selected oversight activities and (2) describing how the Office of Federal Student Aid's policies and procedures are designed to monitor audits and reviews. To do so, GAO interviewed Education and inspector general officials and reviewed numerous audit guides, agency procedures, checklists, and audit tracking systems."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO identified differences and similarities in audit requirements and oversight procedures for the two programs. Differences include the following: (1) The FFEL and DL programs generally had different audit requirements stemming primarily from divergent program structures. The FFEL program relied on lenders, guaranty agencies--which administer federal government loan guarantees to lenders--and other entities that were subject to statutory and regulatory audit requirements. The DL program did not have as many audit requirements because DL loans are provided by the federal government, and fewer external entities are involved. (2) GAO found differences in audit requirements for nonprofit and for-profit lenders. Certain applicable audit objectives included in Office of Management and Budget (OMB) requirements for compliance audits of nonprofit lenders were not included in the Department of Education Office of Inspector General (OIG) Lender Audit Guide for compliance audits of for-profit lenders. As a result, audits of lenders performed in accordance with the OIG Lender Audit Guide were at risk of omitting compliance testing for a key audit objective. Similarities in audit requirements and oversight procedures include these: (1) Schools were subject to annual financial statement and compliance audits under both programs. (2) The functions performed by the DL servicer, with which Education contracts to administer certain functions of the DL program, were similar to functions performed by lenders, guaranty agencies, and their servicers in the FFEL program. GAO's analysis found that objectives addressed by FFEL participant compliance audits were similar to the objectives addressed through oversight procedures for the DL servicer, such as Education's review of the servicer's monthly performance metrics. The passage of the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 terminated the authority to make new FFEL loans after June 30, 2010. Borrowers who would have been eligible to obtain new FFEL loans could receive loans under the DL program. Regarding Office of Federal Student Aid's monitoring activities, staff were to use financial statement audits to oversee the financial condition of the schools and guaranty agencies that participate in the student loan programs. Compliance audits of schools, lenders, guaranty agencies, and their third-party servicers help Education ensure that these participants comply with applicable statutes, regulations, and program requirements. The Office of Federal Student Aid was required to track findings in these audit reports. GAO found that third-party servicers for lenders in the FFEL program did not submit their audited financial statements to Education as required. Education lacked a policy and specific procedures to ensure receipt and review of these audited financial statements. Without such reviews, the Office of Federal Student Aid might not be informed of a third-party servicer's unfavorable audit opinion or significant reported findings that could affect program operations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the Education Inspector General update the OIG Lender Audit Guide to include all appropriate regulatory requirements for audits of ongoing FFEL participants.

School financial statement audits focus on whether the financial  statements are fairly presented in accordance with generally accepted  accounting principles. These financial statement audits are to be  performed in accordance with GAGAS. GAGAS also requires IPAs to  report on the results of certain tests performed on internal controls over  financial reporting and compliance with certain provisions of laws,  regulations, and program requirements. Financial statement audit reports  provide Education with information about the financial condition of  participants, any significant internal control deficiencies, and instances  of noncompliance.

The audits focus on whether these  participants comply with applicable statutes, regulations, and program  requirements. For example, school compliance audits for both programs  are designed to test whether schools perform student eligibility  validation. These audits are to determine whether a school has verified  that certain student requirements, such as citizenship and financial need,  have been met. In addition, schools participating in the student loan  programs are required to follow specified criteria for applying loan  proceeds to students\u2019 accounts and disbursing residual amounts to  students within established time frames. To illustrate, for students  borrowing from the FFEL or DL programs, schools should not credit a  registered student\u2019s account more than 10 days before the first day of  classes.

Audits address federal  fiscal interests if they are designed to help protect the government from  financial loss and address borrower interests if they are designed to help  ensure that qualified individuals (1) have access to federal student loans  and (2) are protected from financial loss. For instance, auditors assess  whether schools that participate in either program complied with refund  requirements. Refund requirements for both programs include the proper  return of program funds in the case of unearned tuition and other charges  for a student who received federal student aid if the student did not  register, dropped out, was expelled, or otherwise failed to complete the  period of enrollment.

FFEL lenders can be for-profit or  nonprofit and, in some cases, can be the schools themselves. For-profit  lenders are required to have their audits performed in accordance with the  OIG Lender Audit Guide.

The DL servicer is not required to have an independent  auditor perform financial and compliance audits similar to those required  of guaranty agencies, guaranty agency servicers, and lender servicers in  the FFEL program. Instead, Federal Student Aid directly oversees the DL  servicer\u2019s performance as a federal contractor through monthly reviews of  performance metrics as well as other procedures, including monthly  reconciliations of loan balances recorded by the DL servicer to those in  Federal Student Aid records. Federal Student Aid officials are to review  reports generated by the Independent Quality Control Unit, a component  of the DL servicer that performs analysis to help ensure that the DL  servicer\u2019s performance metrics are correctly calculated and accurately  reported and that corrective actions from prior audits are implemented.  These oversight procedures are designed to assess and evaluate the DL  servicer\u2019s performance in servicing loans in the DL program.", "Our analysis showed that the objectives of the oversight procedures to be  performed by Federal Student Aid over the DL servicer share some  similarities with the objectives being addressed by audits of FFEL lenders,  guaranty agencies, and their servicers. For example, both FFEL lenders  and the DL servicer are to update student records to reflect changes in a  student\u2019s status\u2014such as student enrollment, which affects the repayment  of the loan. For FFEL lenders, the performance of this function is to be  evaluated in the annual compliance audit of lenders performed by IPAs.  For the DL servicer, this function is to be evaluated through the oversight  procedures performed by Federal Student Aid staff, including monthly  reviews of performance metrics that monitor the DL servicer\u2019s  performance. For example, Federal Student Aid is to monitor whether the  DL servicer meets the 2-day standard for completing student status  updates and the 98 percent standard for status update accuracy.

The new servicers, expected to begin servicing  direct loans by August 31, 2010, are subject to oversight procedures that  differ from the current DL servicer. According to Federal Student Aid\u2019s  contract monitoring plan, these activities will include transaction analysis  and reconciliations as well as internal control and program compliance  reviews. For example, according to the contract monitoring plan, Federal  Student Aid staff are expected to perform periodic transaction analysis at  the borrower account level to determine the servicing accuracy of  transactions. Federal Student Aid officials and DL servicer are to discuss  issues identified through transaction analysis and the status of corrective  actions at weekly operational meetings. In addition, the monitoring plan  states that program compliance reviews are to be conducted as needed, at  least annually, to determine if servicing is in compliance with  requirements. According to Federal Student Aid officials, guidance for  some of these oversight procedures is under development.", "The contract monitoring plan also calls for the additional DL servicers to  be subject to internal control examinations performed by IPAs in  accordance with Statement on Auditing Standards No. 70. Each  additional DL servicer is to provide Federal Student Aid with an IPA report  on the examination of its operational controls semiannually and on the  examination of its information technology controls annually. These  examinations are in addition to Education\u2019s annual review of internal  controls required by OMB Circular No. A-123. In addition, the contracts  call for the additional DL servicers to be subject to performance measures  focused on default prevention and surveys of borrower satisfaction,  school satisfaction, and Federal Student Aid staff satisfaction with servicer  performance. These performance measures are to be used to compare the  additional DL servicers\u2019 relative performance as one factor in determining  the allocation of direct loans to them for servicing.

Further,  PEPS does not allow Financial Partners to readily identify those lenders  required to submit annual compliance audits. Accordingly, Financial  Partners staff must analyze database information to identify these lenders.  Further, because PEPS does not track all audit information that is  important to Financial Partners, staff supplement their use of PEPS with  Excel-based tracking sheets.

In addition, our work  did not include program reviews conducted by guaranty agencies and  other Federal Student Aid reviews because (1) in some cases, these  reviews had similar objectives to the audits that we did include in our  study and (2) in other cases, the reviews were risk-based and addressed  specific operating conditions, and therefore these objectives were unique  to each review.", "To address the second objective, we focused on the design of the  processes Education uses to oversee the programs and to ensure  compliance with statutory and regulatory requirements for the timely  submission of audit reports. We reviewed applicable statutes and  regulations and Federal Student Aid policies and procedures, including  process flow diagrams and audit acceptability checklists. To further our  understanding of the design of Education\u2019s processes for overseeing these  programs and ensuring compliance, we observed systems demonstrations  that included automated and Excel-based systems used to track receipt of  audits and related findings. During these demonstrations, we observed  actual steps taken by staff in order to review, and if necessary resolve, the  audit. We obtained and reviewed supporting documentation referenced  during these demonstrations, such as audit acceptability checklists and  copies of Excel-based tracking sheets, used by staff to determine the  sufficiency of the audit report\u2019s content and to ensure the timeliness of  audit submissions, respectively. We interviewed officials from Federal  Student Aid and OIG, including the Acting Director of Financial Partners,  the General Manager of the School Eligibility Channel, and the Deputy  Assistant Inspector General for Audit, to obtain clarification and  explanations for any discrepancies identified during our review of  documentation and the demonstrations. We focused on describing the  processes Education has designed to ensure that applicable requirements  are being met. While the scope of our audit did not include testing the  implementation of these processes including controls, as appropriate, we  noted any design deficiencies.", "We requested comments on a draft of this report from Education. We  received written comments from the Education Inspector General and the  Chief Operating Officer of Federal Student Aid (reprinted in their entirety  in appendixes III and IV, respectively). We conducted this performance  audit at Federal Student Aid offices in Washington, D.C., from August 2009  to July 2010 in accordance with GAGAS. Those standards require that we  plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to  provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our  audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a  reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit  objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the Department of Education Office of Inspector General", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Comments from the Department of Education Office of Federal Student Aid", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, significant contributions to this  report were made by Jack Warner (Assistant Director), Jennifer Dent,  Chau Dinh, P.
