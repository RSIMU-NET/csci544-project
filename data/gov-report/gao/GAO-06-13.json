For example, DOD defined four risk areas, and developed performance goals and department-level measures, but it needs to, among other things, further develop and refine the measures so that they clearly demonstrate results and provide a well-rounded depiction of departmental performance. DOD's current strategic plan and goals also are not clearly linked to the framework's performance goals and measures, and linkages between the framework and budget are also unclear. While DOD officials stated that risk was considered during the fiscal year 2006 budget cycle, DOD's budget submission does not specifically discuss how DOD identified or assessed risks to establish DOD-wide investment priorities. Without better measures, clear linkages, and greater transparency, DOD will be unable to fully measure progress in achieving strategic goals or demonstrate to Congress and others how it considered risks, and made trade-off decisions, balancing needs and costs for weapon programs and other investment priorities. DOD faces four challenges that have affected the implementation of the framework. First, DOD's organizational culture resists department-level approaches to priority setting and investment decisions. Second, sustained leadership, adequate transparency, and appropriate accountability are lacking. Further, no one individual or office has been assigned overall responsibility or sufficient authority for the framework's implementation. DOD also has not developed implementation goals or timelines with which to establish accountability, or measure progress. Finally, integrating the risk management framework with decision support processes and related reform initiatives into a coherent, unified management approach for the department is a challenge that DOD plans to address during the 2005 QDR. However, GAO has concerns about DOD's ability to follow through on this integration, because of its limited success in implementing other management reforms.

DOD intended the framework to be used as a  management tool to focus DOD\u2019s efforts on implementing the defense  program as outlined in the strategic plan. In particular, DOD\u2019s senior  leadership intended the risk management framework to assist decision  makers in formulating top-down strategy, balancing investment priorities  against risk over time, measuring near- and midterm outputs against  strategic goals, and focusing on actual performance results.

We have advocated  that the federal government, including DOD, adopt a comprehensive threat  or risk management approach as a framework for decision making that  fully links strategic goals to plans and budgets, assesses values and risks  of various courses of actions as a tool for setting priorities and allocating  resources, and provides for the use of performance measures to assess  outcomes. Based on our review of the literature, as shown in figure 1, the  goal of risk management is to integrate systematic concern for risk into  the usual cycle of agency decision making and implementation.", "A risk management cycle represents a series of analytical and managerial  steps, basically sequential, that can be used to assess risk, evaluate  alternatives for reducing risks, choose among those alternatives,  implement the alternatives, monitor their implementation, and continually  use new information to adjust and revise the assessments and actions, as  needed. Adoption of a risk management cycle such as this can aid in  assessing risk by determining which vulnerabilities should be addressed,  and how they should be addressed, within available resources.

Therefore, risk management\u2019s objectives are  also compatible with those of the federal government\u2019s results-oriented  management approach, which was enacted in the Government  Performance and Results Act (GPRA) of 1993, and the balanced  scorecard approach. Congress enacted GPRA to focus the federal  government on achieving results through the creation of clear links  between the process of allocating scarce resources and an agency\u2019s  strategic goals, or the expected results to be achieved with those  resources.

However, the set of measures DOD has  developed for the risk management framework do not adequately address  these principles. While DOD established four risk quadrants and  developed performance goals and measures of two types\u2014activity  measures (measures to track initiatives) and performance measures\u2014the  majority of its measures do not provide sufficient information to monitor  performance against the risk quadrants\u2019 goals.", "First, DOD officials acknowledge that establishing department-level  measures for the framework that demonstrate results is still a work in  progress, as the majority of the risk management framework\u2019s measures  require further development or refinement. In fact, as shown in table 1, 44  of the 77 department-level measures for all four quadrants, or over 50  percent, are activity measures. According to DOD sources, activity  measures are to result in a new performance measure, a new baseline or  benchmark, or define a new capability, rather than monitor a specific  annual performance target. Once these activities are completed, DOD  officials stated that the department will be better able to monitor  department-level performance against strategic goals. However, our  analysis found that the activity measures, as defined in DOD\u2019s external  reports, typically do not provide sufficient information to monitor the  department\u2019s progress in achieving the stated goal they are to measure,  such as developing a new performance measure or baseline. The desired  outcomes for activity measures generally state that a task was or will be  completed by a certain date but they do not provide sufficient information  on whether the activity is on schedule, the interdependencies among  tasks, or the contribution toward enhancing the department\u2019s  performance. Therefore, Congress and other external stakeholders lack  information and adequate assurances that DOD is making progress in  implementing a risk-based and results-oriented management approach to  making investment decisions.", "Second, DOD\u2019s department-level performance measures are still a work in  progress in that these measures do not provide a well-rounded depiction  of DOD\u2019s performance. In our previous work, we have found that  performance measurement efforts that are not balanced across priorities  may skew an agency\u2019s performance and keep its senior leadership from  seeing the whole picture. For example, in developing department-level  measures for the risk management framework, DOD appears to have  overemphasized its force management priorities at the expense of  operational risk. As illustrated in table 2, the operational risk quadrant has  no performance measures, while the force management risk quadrant has  a total of 36 measures, including 15 activity measures and 21 performance  measures.", "In providing technical comments to a draft of this report, DOD objected to  our recoding of five department-level performance measures as activity  measures. We recoded these measures because they tracked milestones  and events, which corresponded to DOD\u2019s definition of an activity  measure. The measures we recoded addressed the following: a civilian human resources strategic plan, a military human resources strategic plan, monitor the status of defense technology objectives, strategic transformation appraisal, and   support acquisition excellence goals.", "Finally, DOD officials indicated that DOD is systematically using  performance measures to monitor progress and improve performance for  only one risk quadrant, although individual measures under the other three  risk quadrants may be monitored. We have found that leading  organizations use performance information to improve organizational  performance and identify performance gaps, and to provide incentives that  reinforce a results-oriented management approach. According to DOD  officials, the force management quadrant is the only quadrant that is  managed by one individual and one office\u2014the Under Secretary of  Defense for Personnel and Readiness and his office. These officials stated  that this situation is a critical factor in the progress DOD has made in  systematically monitoring performance across the force management  quadrant on a routine basis. For example, officials stated that the Under  Secretary of Defense personally leads quarterly monitoring sessions on the  force management quadrant\u2019s performance. DOD officials also told us that  the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness has greatly  facilitated this monitoring by developing a centralized database to capture  the performance data used to track DOD\u2019s performance in meeting the  quadrant\u2019s goals. Unless all of the risk management framework\u2019s quadrants  are systematically monitored, implementation of the framework may be  hindered and the framework risks becoming a paper-driven, compliance  exercise.

Our previous work indicated that DOD\u2019s strategic  plan, the 2001 QDR, did not provide a sound foundation for the risk  management framework. We reported that the usefulness of the 2001  QDR was limited by the lack of focus on longer-term threats and  requirements for critical support capabilities, and provided few insights  into how future threats and planned technical advances could affect future  force requirements.

In discussing the ongoing 2005  QDR, DOD stated that although the department would continue its efforts  to do so, establishing these linkages was very challenging because of the  size and scope of DOD\u2019s operations. However, as suggested by the Defense  Business Board and our previous work, if DOD\u2019s strategic plan is to drive  the department\u2019s operations, a straightforward linkage is needed among  strategic goals, annual performance goals, and day-to-day activities.

Our work indicates that  leading organizations link strategy to the budget process through results- oriented management to evaluate potential investments or initiatives.", "DOD sources indicated that the department has begun to consider risk  during its usual cycle of investment decision making. For example,  according to DOD sources, the Secretary of Defense articulated broad  areas for increasing or decreasing risk under each quadrant in the fiscal  years 2006\u20132011 planning guidance, leaving it up to the defense  components to decide how to structure their investment decisions within  those broad areas consistent with the Secretary\u2019s risk guidance. In  addition, DOD officials stated that the framework has increased awareness  within the department on the need to balance risk over time. For example,  when DOD reduced the fiscal years 2006\u20132011 defense program by  $30 billion, DOD officials stated that the department did not take the  traditional budgetary approach of cutting each defense component\u2019s  budget by a certain percentage. Instead, DOD officials stated that the  Secretary of Defense used a collaborative approach with service  participation to discuss where to take the budget reductions and how  these cuts would affect risk, although DOD officials offered various views  on how extensively the framework was used to make those decisions.", "Second, DOD required that the services and other defense components  offset any funding increase in one area with a funding decrease in another  area for the fiscal years 2006\u20132007 budget submission. According to DOD  officials, risk\u2014whether on the basis of \u201cprofessional judgment\u201d or  analysis\u2014was considered in these deliberations. For example, the Army\u2019s  plan for fiscal years 2006\u20132023 articulated areas for increasing risks so  that it could decrease risk in the operational risk dimension by investing in  current capacity.", "However, the fiscal year 2006 budget submission does not include any  specific information on how DOD systematically identified or assessed  departmental risks to establish DOD-wide investment priorities. For  example, the military services\u2019 share of the Future Years Defense Program  (FYDP) remained relatively unchanged from fiscal year 2005 to fiscal year  2006 (see table 3), providing one indication that the risk management  framework may not yet be a useful tool for balancing departmental risks  across the services.", "DOD has reported on the risk management framework in the department\u2019s  GPRA and other reporting requirements. For example, the fiscal year 2004  Performance and Accountability Report describes what DOD is doing, or  plans to do, to define, measure, and monitor performance goals in the four  risk quadrants but does not discuss the implementation status of the risk  management framework. Furthermore, the fiscal year 2004 report, the  most recent available, provided insufficient information to assist Congress  in overseeing how DOD plans to prioritize investment decisions within or  across the risk quadrants. Without more detailed information, Congress  may have insufficient transparency into how DOD has identified and  assessed risks and made trade-offs in its investment decision making. In  addition, we reported in May 2004 that congressional visibility over  investment decision making also was limited by the absence of linkages  between the risk management framework and military capabilities  planning and the FYDP. Because the FYDP lacked these linkages, we  concluded that decision makers could not use it to determine how a  proposed increase in capability would affect the risk management  framework.", "Our work also has shown that the FYDP may understate the costs of  weapon system programs; therefore, DOD may be starting more programs  than it can afford. For example, our assessment of 54 major programs,  representing an investment of over $800 billion, found that the majority of  these programs were costing more and taking longer to develop than  planned. Problems occurred because of DOD\u2019s overly optimistic planning  assumptions about the long-term costs of weapon system programs and its  failure to capture early on the requisite knowledge that is needed to  efficiently and effectively manage program risks. When DOD has too many  programs competing for funding and approves programs with low levels of  knowledge, it is accepting the attendant likely adverse cost and schedule  risks. As a result, it will probably get fewer quantities for the same  investment or face difficult choices on which investments it cannot afford  to pursue. The findings of our work suggest that having a departmentwide  investment strategy for weapon systems, to allocate resources across  investment priorities, would help reduce these risks."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Cultural Resistance, Combined with the Lack of Leadership, Implementation Goals, and Process Integration, Affects DOD\u2019s Implementation of the Risk Management Framework", "paragraphs": ["Four key challenges impede DOD\u2019s progress toward implementing the risk  management framework.

First, as we noted in our 21st Century Challenges report,  to successfully transform, DOD needs to overcome the inertia of various  organizations, policies, and practices that became rooted in the Cold War  era. The department\u2019s expense, size, and complexity, however, make  overcoming this resistance and inertia difficult. In fiscal year 2004, DOD  reported that its operations involved $1.2 trillion in assets, $1.7 trillion in  liabilities, over $605 billion in net cost of operations, and over 3.3 million  military and civilian personnel. For fiscal year 2005, DOD received  appropriations of about $417 billion. Moreover, execution of its operations  spans a wide range of defense organizations, including the military  services and their respective major commands and functional activities,  numerous large defense agencies and field activities, and various  combatant and joint operation commands, which are responsible for  military operations for specific geographic regions or theaters of  operations.", "Second, DOD\u2019s highly decentralized management structure is another  contributing factor that makes cultural change difficult. Although under  the authority, direction, and control of the Secretary of Defense, the  military services have the legislative authority to organize, equip, and train  the nation\u2019s armed forces for combat under Title 10 of the U.S. Code.  Furthermore, Congress directly appropriates funds to the services for  programs and activities that support these purposes. In the opinion of  knowledgeable DOD officials, this legislative authority has resulted in a  culture that makes it difficult to develop department-level, or joint,  management approaches. For example, the allocation of budgets on a  proportional, rather than a strategic basis, among the military services is a  long-standing budgetary problem that we have identified as a major  management challenge for the department. In addition, the Joint Defense  Capabilities Study, chartered by the Secretary of Defense in March 2003,  made the following observations on how DOD\u2019s organizational culture  does not reinforce a departmental or joint approach to investment  decision making and results management:  DOD\u2019s bottom-up strategic planning process did not support early senior  leadership involvement and did not provide integrated departmentwide  objectives, priorities, and roles as a framework for planning joint  capabilities.", "Service-centric focus on programs and weapons platforms resulted in a  process that did not provide an accurate picture of joint needs, nor did it  provide a consistent view of priorities and acceptable risks across the  department.", "The resulting budget did not optimize capabilities at either the department  or the service level.", "Accountability and feedback focused on monetary input rather than  output; therefore, much of the information provided did not support the  senior leaders\u2019 decision making as it did not tell how well the department  was being resourced to meet current and future mission requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Lack of Sustained Leadership and Appropriate Accountability Has Challenged DOD\u2019s Implementation of the Risk Management Framework", "paragraphs": ["The lack of sustained leadership attention and appropriate accountability  has challenged DOD\u2019s progress in implementing the risk management  framework. Our work has indicated that sustained leadership is a key  transformational, or change management, practice. However,  knowledgeable DOD officials indicated that DOD\u2019s senior leadership did  not provide sustained attention to the framework\u2019s implementation. For  example, a DOD official actively involved in the framework\u2019s  implementation stated that meetings with senior leadership that were to  provide oversight of the framework\u2019s implementation have not been  regularly scheduled. DOD officials indicated that as a result of this lack of  sustained leadership, DOD has not placed much emphasis on  implementing the risk management framework at the department level. In  addition, other DOD officials stated that changes in leadership have made  it difficult to implement the risk management framework or develop  performance measures. For example, since October 2004, DOD has  experienced turnover in the following senior level positions, including the  Deputy Secretary of Defense; the Under Secretary of Defense for  Acquisition, Technology and Logistics; and the Director of Program  Analysis and Evaluation (PA&E). Lacking sustained leadership attention,  DOD officials offered conflicting perspectives on the status of the risk  management framework with some officials suggesting that the  framework had been overtaken by other performance-based or risk-based  management initiatives while another suggested that the framework was  primarily a compliance exercise.

No single individual or organization has been given  overarching leadership responsibilities, authority, or the accountability for  achieving the framework\u2019s implementation. Instead, the responsibility for  various tasks and performance measures have been spread among several  organizations, including the Director, PA&E; the Under Secretary of  Defense for Personnel and Readiness (P&R); and the Under Secretary of  Defense, Comptroller/Chief Financial Officer.", "We testified in April 2005 that as DOD embarks on large-scale change  initiatives, the complexity and long-term nature of these initiatives require  the development of an executive position capable of providing strong and  sustained leadership\u2014over a number of years and various  administrations. For this reason, we have supported legislation to create  a CMO at DOD to provide such sustained leadership.

However, DOD\u2019s  limited guidance on the risk management framework did not establish  implementation goals and timelines, nor did it require that implementation  goals and timelines be developed. According to knowledgeable DOD  officials, DOD did not see the need for implementation goals or timelines  because the framework was not meant to change processes or create new  ones, but rather was a management tool to improve upon investment  decision-making processes. Regardless of how DOD classifies the risk  management framework, we have found that implementation goals and  timelines are essential to any transformational change, such as that  envisioned by the Secretary of Defense with the risk management  framework, because of the number of years it can take to complete the  change. Moreover, the absence of implementation goals and timelines  makes it difficult to determine whether progress has been made in  implementing the framework over the last 2 \u00bd years, and whether DOD\u2019s  revisiting of the framework during the 2005 QDR represents an  evolutionary progression or implementation delays."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Integrating the Risk Management Framework with Decision Support Processes and Related Reform Initiatives Is a Significant Challenge", "paragraphs": ["DOD faces a significant challenge integrating the risk management  framework with decision support processes for planning, programming,  and budgeting and with related reform initiatives into a coherent, unified  management approach. The goal of both risk management and results- oriented management is to integrate the systematic concern for risk and  performance into the usual cycle of agency decision making and  implementation. DOD\u2019s challenge in meeting these goals is demonstrated  by the number of initiatives, as shown in table 4, that DOD has put in place  to improve investment decision making and manage performance results.  For example, both capabilities planning and the risk management  framework are to define risks and develop performance measures but,  according to DOD officials, the department is still determining how to  align capabilities planning with the risk management framework. Other  initiatives, including GPRA and PART, are also to develop performance  measures and DOD is still working on integrating these initiatives with the  risk management framework and individual performance monitoring  approaches of the services and other defense components into a single,  integrated system. In December 2002, the Deputy Secretary of Defense  issued a memorandum to correct this situation by requiring the alignment  of the risk management framework and the President\u2019s Management  Agenda with DOD\u2019s results-oriented management activities, including  those associated with GPRA.", "We note that these reform initiatives address key business processes  within the department and that we have placed DOD\u2019s overall business  transformation on our list of federal programs and activities at high risk of  waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement.", "The Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics  indicated that DOD plans to address the challenge associated with the  integration of DOD\u2019s planning, resourcing, and execution processes and  initiatives, including the risk management framework.

However, more work will be required for DOD to be able to put in place a  management tool, such as the risk management framework, to  strategically balance the allocation of resources across the spectrum of its  investment priorities against risk over time and to monitor performance.  The development of performance measures that clearly demonstrate  results and that are cascaded down throughout the department would  enable DOD to provide a clear roadmap of how its activities at all levels  contribute to meeting its strategic goals and would assist the department  in aligning the core processes and resources of its four military services  and multiple defense agencies to better support a departmental or joint  approach to national security. Furthermore, the risk management  framework cannot be fully implemented until its performance goals are  clearly linked to DOD\u2019s strategic planning goals. Unless a cause and effect  relationship can be demonstrated between the department\u2019s performance  measures and strategic goals, the framework\u2019s usefulness as a tool for  monitoring DOD\u2019s execution of its strategic plan and identifying  performance goals will be severely restricted, if not eliminated.  Furthermore, the fiscal year 2006 budget submission does not provide  sufficient information on how DOD identified or assessed departmental  risks to establish DOD-wide investment priorities; thus, the linkages  between the framework and the budget are unclear. Without better  measures, clear linkages, and greater transparency, DOD will be unable to  fully measure progress in achieving strategic goals or demonstrate to  Congress and others how it considered risks and made trade-off decisions,  balancing needs and costs for weapon programs and other investment  priorities.", "The efforts of DOD\u2019s senior leadership to establish a risk-based and  results-oriented management approach have been impeded by some key  challenges. The lack of sustained leadership and clear lines of  accountability has hampered implementation of the risk management  framework and the establishment and achievement of implementation  goals and timelines. Strong and sustained leadership could enable DOD to  overcome resistance to change that exists in a department as massive and  complex as DOD. In addition, the establishment of implementation goals  and timelines could enable DOD to determine what progress has been  made in implementing the risk management framework. Furthermore, the  successful integration of the risk management framework into DOD\u2019s  investment decision-making processes, including recent reform initiatives,  could assist DOD in its overall transformation efforts. Until DOD develops  a risk-based and results-oriented management approach for making  investment decisions, it will likely continue to experience a mismatch  between programs and budgets, and the proportional, rather than  strategic, allocation of resources to the services."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To address the challenges associated with implementing the risk  management framework, or a similar risk-based management approach,  we recommend that the Secretary of Defense take the following four  actions:    develop or refine department-level performance measures so that they  clearly demonstrate performance results and cascade those measures  down throughout the department,    assign clear leadership with accountability and authority to implement and  sustain the risk management framework,    develop implementation goals and timelines, and    demonstrate the integration of the risk management framework with  DOD\u2019s decision support processes and related reform initiatives to  improve investment decision making and manage performance results."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In written comments on a draft of this report, DOD partially concurred  with our four recommendations. DOD\u2019s written comments are reprinted in  their entirety in appendix II. DOD also provided technical comments,  which we incorporated as appropriate.", "DOD partially concurred with our first recommendation. DOD stated that  it concurred with our recommendation that the Secretary of Defense  refine department-level performance measures so that they clearly  demonstrate results, but that it did not concur with the notion that  effectively cascading the risk management framework has been inhibited  by the current suite of performance measures. DOD noted that that a  number of defense components\u2014including the Army, DOD Comptroller,  the Defense Logistics Agency, and the Defense Information Systems  Agency\u2014have successfully cascaded departmentwide strategic goals and  implemented frameworks to measure their organization\u2019s performance.  DOD also believes that empowering the leadership at the component level  to develop measures, while ensuring strategic alignment, is the most  effective way of encouraging performance management and increasing its  utility. In our report, we acknowledge that DOD has taken positive steps  toward developing a performance monitoring system and cascading the  framework\u2019s goals and measures to defense components. However, our  recommendation addresses limitations in those measures that currently  hinder DOD\u2019s ability to use the risk management framework as a  management tool for aligning the components\u2019 performance goals and  measures with the risk management framework, or for strategic balancing  investment decisions across the risk quadrants. For example, the majority  of the risk management framework\u2019s measures are activity measures, or  initiatives, that do not monitor a specific annual performance target, nor  do these measures provide sufficient information to determine whether  the activity is on schedule or contributes to enhancing the department\u2019s  overall performance. Finally, our recommendation is not intended to  suggest that DOD not empower the components to develop performance  measures, but rather that DOD establish a clear hierarchy of goals and  measures that provide straightforward roadmaps to demonstrate how the  components\u2019 activities contribute to meeting DOD\u2019s strategic goals.", "DOD partially concurred with our second recommendation that the  Secretary of Defense assign clear leadership with accountability and  authority to implement and sustain the risk management framework. DOD  stated that, although it agrees that such leadership is key to any successful  performance management system, the department\u2019s senior executives  provide sufficient leadership and accountability for implementing and  sustaining the risk management framework. DOD also stated that it did not  agree that a new organization or bureaucratic structure is needed to  ensure successful implementation and sustainment of the risk  management framework. We agree that DOD has assigned specific roles  and responsibilities for goals and measures associated with the risk  management framework to various high-level DOD officials. However, we  based our recommendation on the fact that no single individual, with  appropriate authority, was held responsible for ensuring that the risk  management framework was implemented across the department.  Further, our recommendation does not propose that DOD set up a new  organization or bureaucratic structure, but, as stated in this report, we  continue to believe that one way to provide strong and sustained  leadership for change initiatives, such as the risk management framework,  over a number of years and various administrations is to legislatively  establish a CMO.", "In partially concurring with our third recommendation to develop  implementation goals and timelines, DOD agreed that tracking progress in  implementing the risk management framework is a good management  practice. DOD stated that it has established goals and timelines for the risk  management framework that are unique to the individual metrics, or  measures, and that because the risk management framework continually  evolves over time, new metrics will be developed while others may be  retired. As we stated in the report, successful change management efforts  use implementation goals\u2014such as, for example, linking the risk  management framework to the budget\u2014and timelines for meeting those  goals, to pinpoint shortfalls and gaps, suggest midcourse corrections, and  build momentum by demonstrating progress. Therefore, while DOD may  continually refine the individual goals and measures associated with the  framework\u2019s risk quadrants, we believe that goals and timelines for the  overall implementation of the framework across the department are  essential for keeping this reform initiative on track.", "DOD partially concurred with our fourth recommendation that the  Secretary of Defense demonstrate the integration of the risk management  framework with DOD\u2019s decision support processes and related reform  initiatives to improve investment decision making and manage  performance results. DOD stated that the department is currently studying  ways to further integrate the risk management framework with other  decision support processes, but no single framework or decision model  can provide all the necessary information or flexibility needed by the  Secretary of Defense and his senior leadership team. We recognize that  DOD\u2019s senior leadership needs reliable information from a variety of  sources and flexibility to make decisions among alternative actions or  solutions. However, if the risk management framework is to successfully  serve as a management tool to assist decision makers in formulating top- down strategy, balancing investment priorities against risk over time,  measuring near- and midterm outputs against strategic goals, and focusing  on actual performance results\u2014as intended by DOD\u2019s senior leadership\u2014 it is crucial that it be successfully integrated with DOD\u2019s investment  decision-making processes, including recent reform initiatives.", "We are sending copies of this report to interested congressional  committees; the Secretaries of Defense, Army, Navy, and Air Force; the  Commandant of the Marine Corps; and the Director, Office of Management  and Budget.

We also obtained and analyzed DOD\u2019s 2001  Quadrennial Defense Review and annual strategic planning and budget  documents. Moreover, we interviewed knowledgeable DOD and service  officials involved with the implementation of the risk management  framework. Specifically, we obtained testimonial evidence from officials  representing the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) offices\u2014such as  Program Analysis and Evaluation; Comptroller; Policy; Acquisition,  Technology and Logistics; and Personnel and Readiness\u2014the Joint Staff,  the military services, and the Defense Business Board. To identify key risk- based and results-oriented management principles, we reviewed our prior  reports and other relevant literature, including information on the  balanced scorecard concept. For example, we identified characteristics of  results-oriented performance measures. These characteristics focused on  performance measures that are (1) designed to demonstrate results by  providing information on how well the organization is achieving its goals;  (2) limited to a vital few, and balanced across priorities; and (3) used by  management to improve performance. As another example, risk-based and  results-oriented management principles indicate that leading organizations  seek to establish clear hierarchies of goals and measures that cascade  down so that subordinate units have straightforward roadmaps to  demonstrate how their activities contribute to meeting the organization\u2019s  strategy. We systematically analyzed and compared the risk management  framework\u2019s department-level performance measures with these  characteristics. However, we did not validate the procedures that DOD has  in place to ascertain the reliability of the data used to support the  performance measures. Regarding strategic planning, these principles  focused on (1) establishing clear linkages among strategic planning goals,  resources, performance goals and measures and (2) integrating the  consideration of risk into the usual cycle of agency decision making and  implementation. While these principles do not cover all attributes  associated with risk-based and results-oriented management approaches,  we believe that they are the most important ones for assessing DOD\u2019s  progress in implementing the risk management framework.", "To identify the most significant challenges, we reviewed our previous  work on change management principles.
