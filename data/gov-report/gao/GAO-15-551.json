Specifically, DHS created three  individual socioeconomic tracks within functional category 1 for qualifying  8(a), HUBZone, and SDVOSB small businesses and a general small  business track. An OSDBU official told us that the creation of  socioeconomic business tracks was the single most important step that  DHS took to enhance small business participation. Small businesses can  compete for task orders within the small business tracks or compete  against larger businesses within the unrestricted business track.

For example, after the  contracting officer determines into which functional category a  requirement falls, the contracting officer and the component\u2019s small  business specialist are required to determine if the competition should be  set aside for small businesses. In the case of functional category 1, this  determination expands to whether the procurement should be set aside  for competition within one or all of the small business socioeconomic  tracks.

Further, federal internal control  standards state that the ability to compare actual performance to planned  or expected results can help managers identify and analyze significant  differences in expected outcomes.

DHS CPO officials explained that they considered inclusion of  core team members and teaming coordinators in the EAGLE II solicitation  to be sufficient to meet goals. At the same time, however, they  recognized that tracking team member use at the task order level would  be difficult. For example, the officials noted that almost five years have  passed since the time of the original EAGLE II offers in 2011, and that the  contractors may now not have the same relationships with their core team  members. In terms of teaming coordinators, DHS CPO officials told us  they have received informal feedback that teaming coordinators are  helpful in locating subcontractors with innovative technologies. However,  as indicated by the market research during acquisition planning for the  unrestricted business track, vendors reported mixed views to DHS as to  whether companies should be required to have teaming coordinators, for  example, questioning the additional costs. Without establishing  performance measures to gauge progress, and collecting needed  information, DHS will not be able to fully assess if its goals for EAGLE II  are being met.", "We also identified a potential barrier to DHS\u2019s ability to measure the full  extent of small business participation. DHS does not consistently record  the use of set asides within FPDS-NG, which may limit DHS\u2019s ability to  accurately track results.

Specifically, the department has established the use of core  team members as a key element in enhancing opportunities for small  businesses that did not receive prime contracts and teaming coordinators  to improve DHS mission performance, but does not collect information on  the extent of use of these entities. Without this information, it will be  difficult for DHS to assess their contributions towards its EAGLE II goals  such as promoting small business participation.

While  these actions are important, monitoring contractor use of their core team  members post-award is also significant.  As DHS notes in its letter, use of  small business core team members was intended to maximize  opportunities for companies that may not have individually been  competitive. Our report shows that this approach was largely successful  in the solicitation phase since almost all small businesses that were  awarded EAGLE II contracts took advantage of this opportunity and had  at least one small business core team member. However, being a small  business core team member does not guarantee that the company will  actually be used to conduct work. As a result, the impact of these efforts  will be unknown if DHS does not gather information to monitor whether  small business core team members are actually used to conduct work at  the task order level.  For example, as noted in the report, of ten task  orders we reviewed, only 2 prime contractors used a core team member  to conduct work. Further, such information would also prove helpful to  DHS when planning for EAGLE II\u2019s successor, just as EAGLE II benefited  from the lessons-learned from EAGLE contractors. Given that the base  period of performance for EAGLE II ends in 2018, DHS is likely to begin  its acquisition planning for EAGLE II\u2019s successor in just a few years.", "Regarding our recommendation that DHS collect and review information  to assess how teaming coordinators have provided DHS with greater  access to innovative technology, DHS explained that it did not concur  because it has no valid means to evaluate a teaming coordinator\u2019s  individual efforts in bringing innovative products and services to EAGLE II  task orders. Nevertheless, DHS reported its plans to survey the DHS  Chief Information Officer community, as the principal user of the EAGLE II  contracts, to indicate whether they are seeing new and innovative  solutions and services in the proposals received. While this outcome may  not link directly to contractor teaming coordinator activities, it could  provide DHS with useful insights. To the extent that the survey obtains  information on how contractor proposals have contributed to enhancing  DHS\u2019s access to new and innovative solutions and also seeks information  on factors that may contribute to the results, it has the potential to satisfy  our recommendation.

We also interviewed the Director of the DHS Office of Small and  Disadvantaged Business Utilization Office (OSDBU), and a small  business specialist from DHS\u2019s Office of Procurement Operations, to  obtain their perspectives on which steps were key to enhancing small  business participation. To obtain an additional small business  perspective, we reviewed correspondence submitted by a small business  advocacy group and interviewed its representative. In addition, to  understand how a series of bid protests delayed finalization of EAGLE II  IDIQ awards, we analyzed DHS bid protest data to identify the dates on  which the protests were filed and resolved. We also analyzed EAGLE II  source selection decisions to identify the dates on which DHS finalized its  selection decisions for each EAGLE II business track.", "To determine the number and estimated value of EAGLE II task order  awards as well as the business size of the recipients, we analyzed  Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation (FPDS-NG) data for  fiscal years 2013, 2014, and the first two quarters of fiscal year 2015. We  assessed the reliability of the FPDS-NG data by (1) performing electronic  testing of the required data fields, (2) reviewing data documentation and  validation rules, and (3) comparing data for selected data fields, including  the award date, total dollar value, and type of set-aside, to contract  documentation for 10 EAGLE II task orders. We selected a non- probability sample of task orders, selecting contracts that provided us the  opportunity to determine whether DHS staff from a variety of components  had correctly recorded if a small business set aside had been used for the  procurement. Our task order selection was made using November 2014  FPDS-NG data, at which time DHS had awarded 54 task orders. We  concluded that while the FPDS-NG data was reliable for the purposes of  assessing the number and estimated value of task orders as well as the  business size of the recipient, it was not reliable for the purpose of  determining whether DHS had set aside the task order award for small  business competition due to the errors we identified and discussed in our  report. As a result, our analysis reflects the estimated values of awards  made to EAGLE II prime contractors based on the specific functional  category business track for which they won their IDIQ award. DHS CPO  officials corrected the errors in the 7 contracts we identified, and agreed  to take additional steps to correct this problem, as discussed in this  report.", "To determine the number of prime contractors that used core team  members when making offers for the IDIQ awards, we analyzed  information DHS had compiled for each IDIQ award. We assessed the  accuracy of this information by identifying whether both DHS\u2019s information  and the listing of core team members on the Federal Business  Opportunities website listed one or more team members for 12 of the 150  IDIQ awardees. We selected 4 contracts from Functional Category 1\u2019s  unrestricted business track, and 1 from each of the other eight business  tracks, for a total of 12 contracts. We determined that the DHS  information on core team members was reliable for the purposes of this  report. In addition, to identify if prime contractors used one or more of  their core team members on the 10 task orders, we then reviewed DHS  information indicating whether the prime contractors had used one or  more of their core team members in performing work under a task order.", "To identify EAGLE II\u2019s goals and performance measures and progress  made to date, we assessed the January 2011 EAGLE II Solutions  Business Case to identify EAGLE II goals and performance measures  that DHS specified during acquisition planning. We interviewed DHS  CPO officials to obtain their perspectives on the goals, related activities,  and performance measures and to refine our understanding of what they  intended EAGLE II to accomplish. To assess the progress EAGLE II has  made towards meeting each goal, we undertook a range of activities.  First, to identify DHS progress in meeting its socioeconomic goals, we  analyzed FPDS-NG data to assess the value of contracts awarded to  small businesses as of March 31, 2015, the most recent quarter of FPDS- NG data. Second, to identify how DHS measures cost savings, including  fees avoided by using EAGLE II rather than other strategic sourcing  vehicles and enhancements to EAGLE II\u2019s acquisition efficiencies, we  obtained and reviewed the strategic sourcing saving methodology  sponsored by the DHS Strategic Sourcing Program Office, and obtained  saving estimates from this office. Third, to verify DHS\u2019s assertion that it  had increased the efficiency of the acquisition process by consolidating  ordering information for its staff on the EAGLE II intranet, DHS provided  us with access and we directly examined the contents of the EAGLE II  intranet. We then reviewed federal internal control standards and  assessed whether DHS had established performance measures for  program goals consistent with these standards. We obtained information  from DHS on its progress in meeting those goals as of March 2015.", "GAO is also conducting additional work about the benefits of strategic  sourcing for information technology services, including opportunities that  may exist to leverage the government\u2019s buying power and barriers to the  use of strategic sourcing. This review, expected to be completed in 2015,  also involves EAGLE and EAGLE II in addition to other government  agency contract vehicles.", "We conducted this performance audit from November 2014 to June 2015  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Number of Bid Protests and Outcomes by Business Track", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) made its initial EAGLE II  source selection decisions in 2012 and 2013, but its final round of source  selections was not finalized until 2014 because of a series of bid protests  filed by businesses, for the unrestricted and small business tracks,  objecting to the selection decisions. A bid protest is a challenge to the  award or proposed award of a contract for procurement of goods and  services or a challenge to the terms of a solicitation for a contract. A total  of 46 large and small businesses filed a total of 56 bid protests with GAO.  These protests took place from August 2012 through July 2014 and were  all resolved by late 2014. The number of bid protests varied by functional  category and by business track, with the highest number of protests (21)  filed by large businesses in functional category 1\u2019s unrestricted business  track. Most of the bid protests (44 of the 56 bid protests filed) were  dismissed. GAO sustained none of the cases. According to DHS officials,  the agency took corrective action for the dismissed cases by reevaluating  its source selection decisions.
