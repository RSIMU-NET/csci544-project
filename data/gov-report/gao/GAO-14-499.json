A performance baseline would commit DOE to delivering the U.S. ITER Project at a specific cost and date and provide a way to measure the project's progress. According to DOE documents and officials, the agency has been unable to finalize its cost and schedule estimates in part because the international project schedule the estimates are linked to is not reliable. DOE has taken some steps to help push for a more reliable international project schedule, such as providing position papers and suggested actions to the ITER Organization. However, DOE has not taken additional actions such as preparing formal proposals that could help resolve these issues. Unless such formal actions are taken to resolve the reliability concerns of the international project schedule, DOE will remain hampered in its efforts to create and set a performance baseline for the U.S. ITER Project.", "DOE has taken several actions that have reduced U.S. ITER Project costs by about $388 million as of February 2014, but DOE has not adequately planned for the potential impact of those costs on the overall U.S. fusion program.

GAO has previously reported that strategic planning is a leading practice that can help clarify priorities, and DOE has begun work on such a plan but has not committed to a specific completion date.

Fusion occurs when the nuclei of two light  atoms\u2014typically hydrogen isotopes\u2014collide and fuse together when  heated at high temperatures and placed under tremendous pressure. The  result is the release of a large amount of energy that, it is hoped,  someday may be captured to produce electricity. Fusion has the potential  to be an abundant source of energy to help meet future energy needs,  and it also offers many other benefits. Among those benefits would be no  emissions of greenhouse gases, no risk of the type of severe accidents  that could occur at existing nuclear power plants, and no long-lived  radioactive waste. Over the last 50 years, scientists around the world  have made progress in understanding how to create the conditions for  fusion, but many outstanding scientific and technical questions must still  be addressed before fusion can be used as an energy source. As a  result, the United States and the six other parties to the ITER Agreement  identified ITER as a critical experiment that, if successful, could finally  produce more power from fusion reactions than is needed to start the  fusion reaction\u2014the first step toward producing electricity from fusion  energy and developing the first demonstration fusion power plant. By  participating in ITER, the United States will share the cost of building this  complex and expensive fusion device, benefit from the scientific and  technological expertise of the six other ITER members, and have full  access to ITER research results. However, since the ITER Agreement  was signed in 2006, the expected total cost of building ITER has grown  by billions of dollars from its original estimate of about $5 billion, and its  construction schedule has slipped by years, as have the cost and  schedule estimates for the U.S. portion of the construction project.", "The ITER Agreement established the management framework for ITER.

DOE\u2019s Office of Fusion Energy  Sciences, which is responsible for managing the overall U.S. fusion  program within the Office of Science, provides program-level oversight of  the U.S. ITER Project. Through March 2014, DOE had spent about $692  million on the project. In fiscal year 2014, the U.S. ITER Project received  $199.5 million, which represented about 40 percent of that year\u2019s overall  U.S. fusion program budget and continued a pattern of substantial  funding increases for the project that began in fiscal year 2011 after  several years of fluctuating funding levels.", "In 2007, when the U.S. ITER Project was just beginning, we reported on  the importance of DOE assessing the full costs of U.S. participation in  ITER and setting a definitive cost estimate for the project.

We also noted the risk that  management challenges facing the ITER Organization could result in  ITER construction delays and further increase costs for the United States.  Today, significant questions remain about how much the U.S. ITER  Project will cost, when it will be completed, and how DOE plans to  manage the impact of U.S. ITER Project costs on the overall U.S. fusion  program in a constrained federal budget environment. The House and  Senate Appropriations Committees, in particular, have expressed concern  that DOE will fund the U.S. ITER Project at the expense of the rest of the  U.S. fusion program, and they have directed DOE to provide detailed cost  and schedule estimates for the project.", "In this context, you asked us to review DOE\u2019s cost and schedule  estimates for U.S. contributions to ITER\u2019s construction.

To determine how and why the estimated costs and  schedule for the U.S. ITER Project have changed since 2006, we  reviewed DOE and U.S. ITER Project Office documents. We assessed  the reliability of the data on the changes in the cost estimates by  interviewing DOE officials and U.S. ITER Project Office representatives  who had knowledge of the data and by other means, and we determined  that the data were sufficiently reliable for reporting on the reasons for the  changes in the cost estimates. To evaluate the reliability of DOE\u2019s current  cost and schedule estimates and the factors, if any, that have affected  their reliability, we reviewed DOE\u2019s most recent cost and schedule  estimates for the U.S. ITER Project\u2014as developed by the U.S. ITER  Project Office in August 2013\u2014and DOE\u2019s internal peer review of those  estimates. We also reviewed DOE\u2019s project management order and  related guidance, as well as an October 2013 report to the ITER Council  on the results of a management assessment of the ITER Organization.

The United States is pursuing two paths to  achieve controlled fusion\u2014magnetic and inertial. The goal for both  approaches is to generate more energy than is needed to begin and  sustain the fusion reaction. The world\u2019s first controlled release of fusion  power was achieved in 1991, but no fusion device has succeeded in  generating more power than it consumes. Magnetic fusion uses magnetic  devices to confine a plasma, consisting of electrically charged atoms, and  sustain a fusion reaction. ITER will be a magnetic fusion device known  as a \u201ctokamak.\u201d To reduce the risk of investing in only one device,  DOE\u2019s Office of Fusion Energy Sciences also funds scientific research on  alternative types of magnetic devices. Inertial fusion relies on intense  lasers or particle beams to heat and compress a small, frozen pellet of  deuterium and tritium\u2014a few millimeters in size\u2014that would yield a burst  of energy. The lasers or particle beams would continuously heat and  compress the pellets, which would simulate, on a very small scale, the  actions of a hydrogen bomb.

It is an  experiment to study fusion reactions in conditions similar to those  expected in a future electricity-generating power plant. The goal is to be  the first fusion device in the world to produce a substantial amount of net  power\u2014that is, produce more power than it consumes. Specifically, the  objective is to produce 10 times more power than is needed to start the  fusion reaction in pulses of 5 or more minutes. ITER also will test a  number of key technologies, including the heating, control, and remote  maintenance systems that will be needed for a fusion power station. ITER  has been planned to consist of four phases: (1) construction, (2)  operation, (3) deactivation, and (4) decommissioning.

At the time  the ITER Agreement was signed, DOE planned on spending $1.122  billion on the U.S. ITER Project and expected to complete the project in  2013 based on preliminary estimates it approved in 2005. In 2008,  DOE formally increased its preliminary cost estimate to a cost range of  from $1.45 billion to $2.2 billion. This was the most recent time DOE  approved a cost estimate for the U.S. ITER Project. Also, in 2008, DOE  said it expected ITER to achieve first plasma in 2016 and expected the  U.S. ITER Project to be completed in 2017. DOE now estimates that the  U.S. ITER Project will cost $3.915 billion, that ITER will achieve first  plasma in 2023, and that the U.S. ITER Project will be completed in 2033.  These estimates were developed based on a set of key assumptions that  were not used by DOE in its 2008 estimates. The current estimates  include an assumption of annual funding for the U.S. ITER Project of  $225 million, starting in fiscal year 2015 and continuing until the project is  completed, with no adjustment for inflation; limited U.S. cash contributions  to the ITER Organization from 2014 to 2016; future U.S. contributions to  the ITER Organization for ITER\u2019s operation, deactivation, and  decommissioning phases coming out of the $225 million annual funding  level; and a hardware delivery schedule not tied to the ITER  Organization\u2019s schedule. DOE also instructed the U.S. ITER Project  Office to use its estimate of ITER achieving first plasma in 2023 rather  than the 2020 date in the ITER Organization\u2019s schedule, and to use its  best estimate for ITER Organization construction costs rather than the  budget most recently approved by the ITER Council. Nonetheless,  these current estimates remain preliminary, according to DOE officials,  because DOE has not approved a performance baseline for the U.S.  ITER Project. A performance baseline captures a project\u2019s key  performance, scope, cost, and schedule parameters, and represents a  commitment from DOE to Congress to deliver a project within those  parameters.", "According to DOE documents, the current $3.915 billion cost estimate for  the U.S. ITER Project includes the following: $1.469 billion (38 percent) to complete the remaining work to  procure and deliver U.S. hardware components for ITER; $928 million (24 percent) in contingency to address potential schedule  delays or increases in costs for manufacturing components, including  $852 million in contingency for the remaining work to procure and  deliver U.S. hardware components, and $76 million in contingency for  U.S. cash contributions to the ITER Organization; $541 million (14 percent) to account for project costs through June $519 million (13 percent) for remaining cash contributions to the ITER  Organization to pay for scientists, engineers, and support personnel  working at the ITER Organization; the assembly and installation of the  components in France to build the reactor; quality assurance testing  of all ITER member-supplied components; and contingencies; and $458 million (12 percent) for escalation costs, such as changes in  currency exchange rates and commodity prices, which are driven by  the extended length of the project due to the funding assumptions  used to develop the cost estimate.", "DOE documents and officials identified several key reasons for the  growth of the cost and schedule estimates for the U.S. ITER Project. DOE  officials identified a number of reasons that led to the change in the  project\u2019s initial 2005 cost estimate of $1.122 billion to its 2008 cost range  of from $1.45 billion to $2.2 billion. These included (1) higher estimates  for the cost of U.S. hardware components as their designs and  requirements were more fully developed; (2) updated estimates for  external factors such as currency exchange rates and commodity prices;  (3) changes to U.S. hardware component requirements and the  international project schedule due to a 2007 design review of the overall  ITER project; and (4) additions for contingency and recognized risks.  According to DOE documents and officials, the primary reasons the U.S.", "ITER Project\u2019s cost estimate grew from the upper range of $2.2 billion in  2008 to the current $3.915 billion estimate included the following:", "Higher estimates for U.S. hardware components as designs and  requirements have been more fully developed over time: The design  and requirements for U.S. hardware components have evolved over  time, and the cost estimates for these components have changed as a  result, according to DOE documents and officials. Specifically, the  current U.S. ITER Project cost estimate includes about $770 million  more than the 2008 figures due to greater understanding of what U.S.  hardware components are likely to cost. According to DOE officials,  expected hardware costs now reflect more fully developed designs,  better industry estimates of the cost of producing those designs, and  greater understanding of project risks, among other things. DOE  documents noted that, as of February 2014, about two-thirds of U.S.  hardware components by value were in final design or beyond,  although there were some smaller components that were still in earlier  stages of design. According to DOE officials, because of the progress in developing hardware component designs, the project  team has a greater understanding of what those components are  likely to cost and has reflected that understanding in the current  $3.915 billion cost estimate.", "Higher contingency amounts added to address risks: The U.S. ITER  Project Office has increased the amount of contingency in the current  cost estimate to address the risks from the project\u2019s significantly  longer schedule and to increase confidence in the estimate, according  to DOE documents and officials. Specifically, the current estimate  includes about $681 million more in contingency than was in the U.S.  ITER Project cost estimate in 2008. According to DOE officials, the  amount of contingency is based on detailed risk analyses as well as a  management assessment of key assumptions. DOE officials told us  that, to develop contingency amounts for the current estimate, the  U.S. ITER Project Office identified and evaluated program-level risks,  such as changes in currency exchange rates and growth in ITER  Organization cash contribution requirements. They also considered  project-level risks, such as the U.S. ITER Project\u2019s dependence on  other ITER members or the ITER Organization for inputs needed to  complete U.S. hardware components and potential procurement and  manufacturing difficulties. Further, they added contingency amounts if  U.S. ITER Project Office management representatives thought initial  contingency amounts were too low for the risks associated with the  project\u2019s longer schedule or based on their past experience with large  science projects.", "Schedule delays: U.S. schedule delays due to international project  schedule delays and U.S. funding constraints accounted for about  $544 million of the increase in the U.S. ITER Project\u2019s cost estimate  since DOE last approved the estimate in 2008, according to DOE  documents and officials. First, international project schedule delays  have lengthened the U.S. ITER Project schedule and have also led to  increases in the cost estimate. For example, in 2007, an international  review identified extensive changes that were needed in ITER\u2019s  design, and that significantly delayed the ITER Organization from  defining requirements for U.S. hardware components. This in turn  created delays in the U.S. ITER Project schedule for procuring and  delivering those components, which led to higher cost estimates for  those components. Second, U.S. funding constraints resulting from  the project\u2019s most recent $225 million per year funding plan and  lower-than-requested funding levels in some years have lengthened  the U.S. ITER Project schedule, according to DOE documents and  officials. This in turn has made it necessary for the U.S. ITER Project  Office to build additional amounts into the project\u2019s cost estimate to  account for higher escalation costs and the longer period of time the  U.S. ITER Project workforce will be needed. For example, DOE  officials told us that the project\u2019s most recent $225 million per year  funding plan reflected discussions between DOE, the Department of  State (State), the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and the  Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) to provide enough  funding to meet U.S. obligations to ITER and reduce the amount of  the U.S. fusion program budget and the overall DOE budget that had  to be devoted to the U.S. ITER Project on an annual basis.  However, this lengthened the U.S. ITER Project\u2019s schedule and  created procurement inefficiencies, resulting in increases in the  project\u2019s overall cost estimate.", "Higher cash contributions to the ITER Organization due to growth in  ITER construction costs: The U.S. ITER Project Office built an  additional $348 million into the current cost estimate to reflect the  increase in U.S. cash contributions it expects to have to make to the  ITER Organization, according to DOE documents and officials. DOE  officials explained this increase includes $169 million for the U.S.  share of a previously approved increase in the ITER Organization\u2019s  construction budget, as well as $179 million for the U.S. share of a  potential future billion euro increase in the ITER Organization  construction budget and the anticipated cost increases for the ITER  Organization staff based on a 2023 first plasma date.", "The United States has taken on additional hardware responsibilities:  DOE agreed to take on additional hardware responsibilities,  accounting for $39 million of the increase in the U.S. ITER Project  cost estimates since 2008, according to DOE documents and  officials. DOE officials told us that there is a cost cap for each of  these additional hardware responsibilities, and that the ITER  Organization will be responsible for paying any amounts that exceed  the caps. As a result, they view taking on these additional hardware  responsibilities as a way to reduce uncertainty about future U.S. ITER  Project costs because DOE will not have to spend more than the  amounts specified in the cost caps for each item."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Despite Reflecting Most Characteristics of Reliable Cost and Schedule Estimates, DOE\u2019s Estimates Cannot Be Used to Set a Baseline in Part Because They Are Linked to an Unreliable International Schedule", "paragraphs": ["DOE\u2019s current cost estimate for the U.S. ITER Project reflects most of the  characteristics of a reliable cost estimate, and its schedule estimates  reflect all characteristics of a reliable schedule.

For example,  DOE\u2019s cost estimate substantially met best practices for documenting all  assumptions that will influence costs (comprehensive), describing step by  step how the estimate was developed (well-documented), and adjusting  properly for inflation (accurate). However, the U.S. ITER Project Office did  not conduct a complete sensitivity analysis on the cost estimate, and an  independent cost estimate has not been conducted (credible). The U.S.  ITER Project Office did identify four key assumptions from the estimate  for sensitivity testing. However, the analysis did not include some cost  elements that represent high percentages of the overall estimate,  including some of the most expensive hardware components being built  by the United States. For example, the sensitivity analysis did not include  the tokamak cooling water system, which is the most expensive U.S.  hardware component. Without a comprehensive sensitivity analysis that  identifies how the cost estimate is affected by changes to its assumptions,  DOE will not fully understand how certain risks can affect the cost  estimate and potentially result in decisions based on incomplete  information. In addition, DOE did not conduct an independent cost  estimate to determine whether other estimating methods produce similar  results. DOE policy does not require an independent cost estimate until it  approves a performance baseline, which the agency does not expect to  occur until late 2015. However, including an independent estimate is a  best practice associated with credible cost estimates. Independent cost  estimates are less likely to reflect organizational bias. They also  incorporate adequate risk, which generally results in more conservative  estimates due to higher estimated costs. Without such an independent  cost estimate, DOE faces a greater risk of underfunding the project, which  can lead to overall cost growth and schedule slippage.

U.S. ITER Project Office representatives acknowledged these  issues with the schedule and attributed them to problems with the  international project schedule. For example, according to project  representatives, DOE\u2019s schedule does not align with the international  project schedule (i.e.: is not vertically traceable) because the international  project schedule does not account for delays in ITER Organization  delivery milestones, including a 30-month delay in ITER construction site  preparations. Without up-to-date reliable international milestones, DOE  cannot develop realistic U.S. milestones that align with the international  project schedule and set a baseline that can provide a reliable, specific  cost and completion date for the project.

DOE policy  says that cost and schedule estimates are considered final only after a  performance baseline has been approved for a project, and DOE has not  approved a performance baseline for the U.S. ITER Project. According to  DOE\u2019s project management order, a performance baseline sets a bar  against which a project\u2019s progress can be measured. DOE\u2019s target date  for setting a performance baseline finalizing its cost and schedule  estimates for the U.S. ITER Project has continually slipped from an  original expected date of fiscal year 2007 to the current target of late in  fiscal year 2015. That is when DOE expects the international project  schedule to be updated, according to DOE documents and officials.", "According to DOE documents and officials, DOE\u2019s current estimates for  the U.S. ITER Project cannot be used to set a performance baseline  because of three factors, two of which DOE can only partially influence as  follows:", "First, the overall international project schedule that DOE uses as a  basis for the U.S. schedule is not reliable. In July 2010, the ITER  Council approved an official schedule for the overall ITER project.  However, an October 2013 management assessment of the ITER  Organization determined that the international project schedule  established in 2010 was not reliable. The assessment attributed the  unreliable schedule, in part, to management deficiencies within the  ITER Organization. For example, the assessment found that the ITER  Organization\u2019s senior management had insisted that the international  project schedule not be changed even when staff had developed what  they thought were more realistic schedules, and that staff had not  been allowed to openly challenge the schedule. According to DOE  officials, the ITER Organization plans to spend the next year  reassessing the international project schedule and taking actions to  address the identified management deficiencies, and it hopes to  complete its schedule reassessment by June 2015.", "Second, DOE has not proposed a final, stable funding plan for the  U.S. ITER Project. DOE\u2019s most recent plan had been to provide a flat  $225 million per year for the project, and that figure was the basis for  its current cost and schedule estimates. However, DOE officials told  us that this funding plan could potentially change depending on the  outcome of the ITER Organization\u2019s reassessment of the international  project schedule. In March 2014, DOE requested $150 million for the  U.S. ITER Project in fiscal year 2015, $75 million less than the $225  million per year funding plan. According to DOE documents, the $150  million request would allow the U.S. ITER Project to meet its fiscal  year 2015 commitments to ITER but would not be enough for the  project to meet the milestones set in the official international project  schedule. Officials noted that if Congress provided less than DOE\u2019s  requested funding, the U.S. ITER Project schedule will slip further. Six  of the 10 fusion energy and project management experts we  interviewed said that identifying sufficient funding to execute the U.S.  ITER Project poses a significant management challenge for DOE.", "The third factor that has kept DOE from setting a performance baseline  finalizing its estimates is within the agency\u2019s direct control. Specifically, an  August 2013 internal peer review found that the methodologies used to  develop DOE\u2019s current cost and schedule estimates were appropriate, but  that the estimates do not sufficiently consider all project risks and  uncertainties.Office did not identify and quantify all risks, that its view of potential risk  mitigation was too optimistic, and that the range of possible cost  outcomes due to each individual risk factor was too narrow. Further, the  review identified potential cost increases related to changing technical   For example, the review found that the U.S. ITER Project  requirements, uncertainty about the ITER Organization\u2019s performance,  and the dependence on other ITER members for production of items that  are used in U.S. hardware components. To better account for these risks  and uncertainties, the review added additional amounts to DOE\u2019s current  cost estimate of $3.915 billion and found that the U.S. ITER Project was  more likely to cost from $4 billion to $6.5 billion. The reviewers  recommended, among other things, that the U.S. ITER Project Office  update its risk estimates to be more comprehensive and reevaluate its  risk mitigation assessments before DOE approves a performance  baseline for the U.S. ITER Project.", "In the absence of a performance baseline, DOE has developed a 2-year  plan for the U.S. ITER Project that sets near-term cost and schedule  targets to guide the project\u2019s performance in fiscal years 2013 and  2014. represent DOE\u2019s commitment to a specific cost and schedule for the U.S.  ITER Project as a performance baseline would. Most of the fusion energy  and project management experts we interviewed emphasized the  importance of DOE approving a performance baseline for the U.S. ITER  Project, with some experts noting that a performance baseline would  provide a goal for all project stakeholders to work toward and might ease  concerns about the uncertainty of the funding levels needed to complete  the project. Several experts also told us that, until DOE approves a  performance baseline for the U.S. ITER Project, there will continue to be  uncertainty about the project\u2019s direction.", "DOE officials told us that the interim 2-year plan also allows the agency to formally  monitor project progress."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOE Has Taken Some Actions to Address the Factors Preventing It from Setting a Baseline, but Challenges Remain", "paragraphs": ["DOE has taken some actions to address the factors preventing it from  setting a performance baseline that would allow the agency to finalize its  cost and schedule estimates for the U.S. ITER Project. However, project  management and schedule deficiencies in the ITER Organization and  uncertainty in the U.S. ITER Project funding plan continue to pose  management challenges for the agency and delay its efforts to set a  performance baseline.", "According to DOE officials, DOE has taken several actions to try to get  the ITER Organization to address international project management and  scheduling deficiencies. For example, DOE officials told us that their  aggressive participation in early ITER Agreement negotiations led to the  adoption of a biannual management assessment requirement. This has  focused attention on international management deficiencies, resulting in  several recommendations for improving the project. Further, DOE officials  told us they have used ITER Council Management Advisory Committee  meetings to introduce, communicate, and advance project management  principles, such as competitive procurement actions, in an effort to  improve ITER Organization project management. Additionally, DOE has  developed position papers describing the agency\u2019s concerns with  ineffective ITER Organization scheduling and management and  suggesting actions the ITER Organization could take to develop a reliable  international project schedule and improve international management. For  example, in a position paper on scheduling issues, DOE recommended  the ITER Council direct the ITER Organization to focus on developing a  short-term schedule, and defer long-term schedule development until  lessons are learned from the short-term effort. DOE has provided the  position papers to other ITER members and achieved some unofficial  support, but the agency has not submitted a formal proposal on the  suggested actions to the ITER Council, which could vote on and  ultimately require the implementation of these actions. According to DOE  officials, DOE has not submitted formal proposals because previous ITER  Council Chairs delayed substantive discussions of issues such as  schedule slippages and conducted meetings with a primary goal of  obtaining consensus among ITER members. However, DOE officials said  the ITER Council and other ITER members are aware of DOE\u2019s position,  and they hope the new ITER Council Chair, who took over in January  2014, will change the way the ITER Council operates. DOE officials also  said the ITER Council approved at the November 2013 ITER Council  meeting the initiative for the ITER Organization to develop a short-term  annual work plan for 2014, the results of which will inform long-term  schedule development, and that all milestones had been met by all seven  ITER members for the first three months.", "Even so, challenges remain that will continue to hamper DOE\u2019s ability to  develop a baseline for the U.S. ITER Project. Eight out of the 10 fusion  energy and project management experts we interviewed said DOE does  not have enough information from the ITER Organization and other ITER  members to effectively plan the U.S. ITER Project, and 7 of the 10  experts said the international structure and management issues  contribute to DOE\u2019s management challenges. In this context, DOE\u2019s  efforts may have helped improve ITER Organization project management  and helped jump-start efforts to develop a reliable international project  schedule, but a reliable international project schedule is not expected until  June 2015, as previously noted. Further, the previous international project  schedule developed by the ITER Organization and approved by the ITER  Council in 2010 has not proved reliable, and management issues that  were identified in previous years continue to pose challenges at the  international level. For example, the October 2013 management  assessment of the ITER Organization found that the ITER Council had  not acted on many recommendations for project management  improvements from a previous management assessment in 2009 and that  the problems identified in that assessment continue. The most recent  management assessment attributed the inaction to the ITER Council\u2019s  reliance on consensus decision making, which caused it to avoid or delay  difficult decisions. The 2013 assessment stated that the ITER members  needed to openly discuss and then make decisions on difficult issues at  ITER Council meetings, even if there is no consensus, and all members  should be held accountable for results. The management assessment  contained 11 recommendations that were designed to be taken together.  The assessment further said that the international project would not  achieve significant improvement if the ITER Council only adopted a few  recommendations, as has been the case with recommendations in  previous management assessments. DOE officials told us that the ITER  Council had approved proposals to address the recommendations from  the October 2013 management assessment and that the ITER Council  Chair was actively monitoring the implementation of the  recommendations.", "To address the uncertainty of the U.S. funding plan for the U.S. ITER  Project, DOE has evaluated a range of funding scenarios for executing  the project. As previously noted, DOE most recently developed a $225  million per year flat funding plan with State, OMB, and OSTP, but DOE  officials acknowledged that the plan constrained funding for the project to  allow DOE to meet U.S. obligations to ITER and reduce the amount of the  U.S. fusion program and overall DOE budgets devoted to the project  annually. DOE officials told us the flat funding plan created a long and  inefficient schedule and has created gaps between the design and  fabrication stages of some systems, which has led to cost growth. DOE  officials said that they will not be able to meet the most recent  international project schedule under this funding plan, and delivery of  some U.S. components will likely be late under the plan. DOE officials  told us they plan to develop a final, stable funding plan for the U.S. ITER  Project, but that plan can only be developed if the international project  schedule is reliable.", "To ensure that all risks and uncertainties are sufficiently incorporated into  its estimates, DOE officials told us the U.S. ITER Project Office held a  series of risk workshops. According to DOE officials, as of March 2014,  the U.S. ITER Project Office had held risk workshops on U.S. hardware  components and associated risks, as well as a workshop on external  risks. U.S. ITER Project Office representatives told us that they are  currently analyzing the results of the workshops and that the workshops  will ultimately lead to updated risk estimates and an update to the current  cost estimate of $3.915 billion for the U.S. ITER Project."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOE Has Taken Actions to Reduce U.S. ITER Project Costs but Has Not Adequately Planned for Their Impact on the U.S. Fusion Program", "paragraphs": ["DOE has taken several actions to reduce the cost of the U.S. ITER  Project.

According to DOE officials, this  strategy\u2014known as \u201cvalue engineering\u201d\u2014has been an integral part of  the U.S. design effort. For example, the U.S. ITER Project Office  has been able to reduce the cost of the central solenoid magnet  system by more than $18 million by eliminating, simplifying, or  reducing the number of some parts. It also has reduced the cost of the  vacuum auxiliary systems by almost $34 million by, among other  things, revising test equipment items and quantities and reducing the  number of system connections and pumps. According to DOE  officials, these and other value engineering efforts have resulted in  about $225 million in savings as of February 2014.

It has also  reached agreement with other ITER members to consolidate  procurement of certain common parts rather than having each ITER  member procure those parts for their assigned hardware components.  For example, the U.S. ITER Project Office has agreed to have the  European Union procure all cable trays needed for U.S. hardware  components. According to DOE officials, centralized and consolidated  procurement for certain items has saved the U.S. ITER Project about  $120 million as of February 2014.", "Scope transfers and reallocations: The U.S. ITER Project Office has  reached agreements to transfer some U.S. hardware responsibilities  to the ITER Organization and to reallocate some hardware  responsibilities among ITER members to improve procurement  efficiency and reduce U.S. costs. For example, project officials told us  that they reached an agreement to shift the U.S. responsibility for  procurement of one system to other ITER members, with the United  States taking on more engineering work for that system in return.  DOE officials estimated that this resulted in $20 million in savings.  According to DOE officials, scope transfers and reallocations have  saved about $43 million as of February 2014.", "Other strategies: According to DOE documents and officials, the U.S.", "ITER Project Office has used several other strategies to reduce U.S.  ITER Project costs.

The optimal  funding plan being suggested would involve different dollar figures  year to year rather than DOE\u2019s most recent strategy of funding the  U.S. ITER Project at a flat $225 million per year starting in fiscal year  2015. Some experts noted that a funding plan that scaled up in the  near-term and then scaled down in later years could potentially  reduce overall U.S. ITER Project costs by hundreds of millions of  dollars. Specifically, three experts said that an optimal funding plan  could shorten the current U.S. ITER Project schedule, and that doing  so would reduce overall project costs. Two experts noted that one  issue with this strategy would be that the U.S. ITER Project would  need to receive more funding in some years, and that could lead to  funding cuts for other DOE projects and programs. To address that  issue, one expert suggested DOE not propose an optimal funding  plan for the U.S. ITER Project until the agency determines that there  is a reliable international project schedule and that the ITER  Organization has made significant progress improving its  management of the overall ITER project. Another expert suggested  that DOE first communicate its plans for managing the impact on the  overall U.S. fusion program of higher U.S. ITER Project funding in  certain years before proposing an optimal funding plan. When we  discussed this strategy with DOE program officials, they agreed that  an optimal funding plan for the project could shorten the U.S. ITER  Project schedule and potentially reduce costs significantly. However,  they emphasized that the most recent $225 million annual funding  plan was an attempt to balance the funding needs of the U.S. ITER  Project and the rest of the U.S. fusion program.", "Three experts suggested that DOE could reduce U.S. ITER Project  costs by working with its international partners to develop a reliable  international project schedule and aligning U.S. ITER Project efforts  with that schedule. One expert noted that this would help make DOE\u2019s  cost estimate for the U.S. ITER Project more certain. Another expert  told us that a reliable international project schedule was necessary for  DOE to set an optimal funding plan, which in turn could help minimize  U.S. ITER Project costs. The expert said that aligning the U.S. ITER  Project with a reliable international project schedule was necessary to  ensure that the United States was not producing its hardware  components too early or too late, either of which could result in cost  growth. When we discussed this strategy with DOE program officials,  they said that the United States has actively presented its views to its  international partners on what would be a realistic schedule for the  overall ITER project.

Two of these experts said that having a  separate office would give the U.S. ITER Project greater visibility at  the highest levels of DOE. Another expert said a benefit would be to  enhance the project\u2019s interaction with stakeholders, including  Congress and the U.S. fusion community. Further, two experts told us  that a separate office for the U.S. ITER Project would enhance DOE\u2019s  ability to oversee the project\u2019s complexity and complications given the  international structure the project operates within. When we discussed  this strategy with DOE program officials, they said that a separate  DOE office to oversee the U.S. ITER Project would not provide many  benefits and could have unintended consequences.

Second, DOE officials said there had  been too much budget uncertainty in fiscal year 2013 regarding the U.S.  ITER Project and the overall U.S. fusion program to complete a plan.  They explained that the House and Senate Appropriations Committees  proposed different direction and funding levels for the U.S. fusion  program in fiscal year 2013, and these differences were not resolved until  the passage of the fiscal year 2014 appropriations act in January 2014.  Third, DOE officials said an effort in 2012 and 2013 to develop a high- level strategic document for the U.S. fusion program was unsuccessful  because OMB did not concur with the document developed by DOE.

To  address these objectives and better understand the U.S. ITER Project,  we reviewed the ITER Agreement, relevant laws, and DOE guidance and  met with DOE and Department of State officials, representatives from the  U.S. ITER Project Office, and fusion energy and project management  experts from industry, DOE\u2019s national laboratories, and universities.", "To determine how and why the estimated cost and schedule for the U.S.  ITER Project have changed since 2006, we reviewed DOE and U.S. ITER  Project Office documents. We assessed the reliability of the data on  changes in the cost estimates by checking for obvious errors in accuracy  and completeness; comparing the data with other sources of information;  and interviewing DOE officials and U.S. ITER Project Office  representatives who had knowledge of the data. We determined that DOE  and the U.S. ITER Project Office\u2019s data on changes in the cost estimates  for the U.S. ITER Project were sufficiently reliable for reporting on the  reasons for the changes in the estimates. We also contacted the national  audit offices of each of the six other ITER members to identify any audit  reports they had issued on ITER, and we reviewed each report that was  identified.", "To evaluate the reliability of DOE\u2019s current cost and schedule estimates  and the factors, if any, that have affected their reliability, we reviewed  DOE\u2019s most recent cost and schedule estimates for the U.S. ITER  Project\u2014as developed by the U.S. ITER Project Office in August 2013\u2014 and DOE\u2019s internal peer review of those estimates. We also reviewed  DOE\u2019s project management order and related guidance, as well as an  October 2013 report to the ITER Council on the results of a management  assessment of the ITER Organization. We assessed the reliability of  DOE\u2019s current cost and schedule estimates by analyzing the August 2013  estimates against the best practices identified in GAO\u2019s Cost Estimating  and Assessment Guide (Cost Guide) and Schedule Assessment Guide  (Schedule Guide).", "Specifically, we determined the reliability of the cost estimate by  reviewing documentation DOE submitted for the cost estimate,  interviewing U.S. ITER Project Office representatives who prepared the  estimate, reviewing relevant sources, and comparing the information  collected with the best practices identified in the Cost Guide to determine  whether the cost estimate was (1) comprehensive, (2) accurate, (3) well- documented, and (4) credible. assessed the extent to which the cost estimate met these best practices  by calculating the assessment rating of each criteria within the four  characteristics on a five-point scale: not met = 1, minimally met = 2,  partially met = 3, substantially met = 4, and fully met = 5. Then, we took  the average of the individual assessment ratings for the criteria to  determine the overall rating for each of the four characteristics. The  resulting average became the overall assessment as follows: not met = 0  to 1.4; minimally met = 1.5 to 2.4; partially met = 2.5 to 3.4; substantially  met = 3.5 to 4.4; and fully met = 4.5 to 5.0. After conducting our initial  analysis, we shared it with DOE officials and representatives from the  U.S. ITER Project Office who developed the cost estimate to provide an  opportunity for them to comment and identify reasons for observed  shortfalls in cost estimating best practices. We took their comments and  any additional information they provided and incorporated it into the  assessments to finalize the scores for each characteristic and best  practice.", "GAO designed the Cost Guide to be used by federal agencies to assist them in  developing reliable cost estimates and also as an evaluation tool for existing cost  estimates. To develop the Cost Guide, GAO cost experts assessed measures applied by  cost-estimating organizations throughout the federal government and industry and  considered best-practices for the development of reliable cost-estimates. schedules\u2014the central solenoid modules schedule and the tokamak  cooling water system schedule\u2014that are used as inputs to the integrated  master schedule. We selected these two schedules because they are the  largest two hardware items, in terms of value, that the United States is  responsible for contributing to ITER. We determined whether the  schedules were (1) comprehensive, (2) well-constructed, (3) credible, and  (4) controlled by reviewing documentation DOE submitted for the U.S.  ITER Project schedule estimate, interviewing U.S. ITER Project Office  representatives who developed the estimate, reviewing relevant sources,  and comparing the information collected against the criteria for each of  these characteristics identified in the Schedule Guide. We also analyzed  schedule metrics as a part of that analysis to highlight potential areas of  strengths and weaknesses against each of our four characteristics of a  reliable schedule. In order to assess each schedule against the four  characteristics and their accompanying 10 best practices, we traced and  verified underlying support and determined whether the U.S. ITER Project  Office provided sufficient evidence to satisfy the criterion and assigned a  score based on the same five-point scale we used in our analysis of the  cost estimate. Then, we took the average of the individual assessment  ratings to determine the overall rating for each of the characteristics, also  using the same scale we used in our analysis of the cost estimate. After  conducting our initial analysis, we shared it with DOE officials and  representatives from the U.S. ITER Project Office who developed the  schedule estimate to provide an opportunity for them to comment and  identify reasons for observed shortfalls in schedule management best  practices. We took their comments and any additional information they  provided and incorporated it into the assessments to finalize the scores  for each characteristic and best practice. By examining the two  subordinate schedules against our guidance, we conducted a reliability  assessment on each of the schedules and incorporated our findings on  reliability limitations in the analysis of each subordinate schedule. We  were also able to use the results of the two subordinate schedules to  provide insight into the health of the integrated master schedule since the  same strengths and weaknesses of the subordinate schedules would  transfer to the master schedule. We determined that the schedules were  sufficiently reliable for our reporting purposes, and our report notes the  instances where reliability concerns affect the quality of the schedules.", "To examine the actions DOE has taken, if any, to reduce U.S. ITER  Project costs and plan for their potential impact on the overall U.S. fusion  program, we reviewed DOE and U.S. ITER Project Office documents on  actions taken to reduce U.S. ITER Project costs, interviewed DOE  program officials about the status of their efforts to complete a strategic  plan for the U.S. fusion program, and reviewed meeting records of DOE\u2019s  Fusion Energy Sciences Advisory Committee. We also reviewed our  prior work on leading practices in federal strategic planning for agency  divisions, programs, or initiatives, as well as the House and Senate  Appropriations Committees\u2019 direction to DOE in the explanatory  statements for the fiscal year 2012 and fiscal year 2014 energy and water  development appropriation acts to submit a 10-year strategic plan for the  U.S. fusion program. Further, we summarized the results of  semistructured interviews with 10 experts in fusion energy and the  management of large scientific research projects. To select these experts,  we first identified 105 experts by reviewing the results of a literature  search; congressional hearings; National Academies of Science  publications; membership lists for the Fusion Energy Sciences Advisory  Committee, the ITER Council Management Advisory Committee, the  ITER Council Science and Technology Advisory Committee, and DOE\u2019s  internal peer reviews of the U.S. ITER Project; and recommendations  from other fusion energy experts we interviewed. From this list, we then  used a multistep process to select 10 experts.range of perspectives, we selected fusion energy and large scientific  project management experts from industry, DOE\u2019s national laboratories,  and universities. We conducted semistructured interviews with the 10  selected experts using a standard set of questions and analyzed their  responses, grouping them into overall themes. We summarized the  results of our analysis and then asked DOE program officials for their  views on actions suggested by multiple stakeholders to potentially reduce  U.S. ITER Project costs or improve U.S. ITER Project management. Not  all 10 of the experts answered all of our questions. The views expressed  by experts do not represent the views of GAO.
