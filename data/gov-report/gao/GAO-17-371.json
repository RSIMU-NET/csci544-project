IRS recently completed the examinations for an NRP study on employment tax returns filed from tax years 2008 to 2010. This study was the first IRS had done on employment taxes in over 30 years. Based on IRS guidance, NRP results are intended to factor into IRS decisions about compliance areas and to be used to estimate the tax gap\u2014the difference between taxes owed and those voluntarily paid on time. Although the examinations for the study are done, IRS has not developed formal plans to analyze the results to (1) identify areas of noncompliance, (2) address such noncompliance, or (3) update its employment tax gap estimate. IRS officials said they have not developed such formal plans due to competing research priorities and limited resources, and because the NRP results have not yet been finalized. Without completed analysis of the NRP employment tax results, IRS risks using outdated data to make decisions about compliance and areas of the tax gap to pursue.", "GAO reviewed the available NRP study results on noncompliance and found that taxable wages for worker classification and fringe benefits were among the most frequently misreported and led to the highest wage adjustment amounts on average. Worker classification issues arise when employers misclassify employees as independent contractors or other nonemployees. If employees are misclassified, the employer's obligation to withhold and pay employment taxes is not established and goes unpaid. Fringe benefits issues involve property, a service, or cash received that should be treated as taxable wages but are not.", "IRS carried over certain NRP practices to operational employment tax examinations, including tools to help plan, document, and report the results of examinations but IRS examiners who responded to GAO's survey identified additional improvements that could be made to operational examinations.", "More than 90 percent of examiners said that they would like to have a certain tool\u2014electronic data on the information returns of employers\u2014when operational examinations start instead of on request, which they said would help identify issues to examine sooner and put fewer burdens on taxpayers. Although IRS officials said that providing the tool when all examinations start would not be a good use of IRS resources, they did not have data to evaluate whether and when providing this tool would improve examinations.", "Half of IRS examiners who were asked about two specific NRP tools in GAO's survey were not aware of how to request them for use during operational examinations. According to IRS officials, these tools may only be used infrequently during employment tax examinations. However, ensuring IRS examiners are aware of how to access them would be in line with IRS's strategic goal of empowering employees with tools and training.

One portion of the  gross tax gap, estimated to be $16 billion (3.5 percent), is due to  taxpayers underreporting employment taxes that employers are to  withhold and remit to cover liabilities for Social Security, Medicare, and  federal unemployment insurance. In fiscal year 2016, federal revenue  from employment taxes to cover these liabilities totaled more than $1  trillion. Employers also withheld federal income tax totaling almost $1.27  trillion. IRS examines only a small fraction of the employment tax returns  that employers file given its resource limitations. In fiscal year 2016, IRS  examined about 54,600 employment tax returns, which covered 0.2  percent of all employment tax returns filed in calendar year 2015.

This NRP study involved detailed examinations of a random, representative sample of Form 941, Employers Quarterly Federal Tax  Return, which IRS selected from employers who filed at least one return  for tax years 2008 through 2010. The in-depth NRP examinations  provide crucial data for measuring noncompliance.

During these discussions, we gathered input on NRP  examination practices that examiners thought could be applied to  operational employment tax examinations. We discussed differences  between NRP and operational employment tax examinations with  program staff in SB/SE and TE/GE. Based on the list of additional NRP  examination practices, we developed and fielded a web-based survey of  all IRS examiners who had completed both NRP and operational  employment tax examinations. The survey obtained their views on having  access to the NRP examination practices during their operational  employment tax examinations, if and why they found them helpful, and if  they were aware of how to access them on operational examinations.

For example, TE/GE-FSLG  government entities do not have a related return, which is why that  practice was not carried over to operational examinations, according to  officials."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "IRS Examiners See Benefits to NRP Practices for Operational Employment Tax Examinations, but Half Were Unaware They Could Request Access to Certain Practices", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Examiners Would Like Access to NRP Practices at the Start of Operational Examinations but IRS Officials Raised Concerns", "paragraphs": ["IRS examiners who have worked on both NRP employment tax  examinations and operational employment tax examinations identified  NRP practices that they would like to have access to when operational  employment tax examinations start. Their responses to our survey, which  asked about a number of the NRP practices, indicated that the majority of  them would like to have access to all of the practices used in NRP  examinations as well as electronic case files upfront when the operational  examination starts. See figure 4.", "The NRP practice that most IRS examiners said they wanted upfront in  the case file and also found to be most helpful were the data used in  IRAS and IRAS itself. Specifically, 181 of 200 (90.5 percent) respondents  wanted access to IRAS and the IRAS data upfront, and 98 of 105  respondents stated that having IRAS and the IRAS data prior to starting  an examination was very or extremely helpful. See figure 5.", "As noted earlier, only TE/GE-FSLG includes the IRAS data in the case  file sent to the examiner at the start of the examination. TE/GE FSLG  officials noted that establishing a case on its systems and requesting the  IRAS data as well as other data such as from the CP2100 and taxpayer\u2019s  examination history can take their one case preparer 60 to 90 minutes,  and that receiving the requested IRAS data takes 1 to 2 weeks depending  on the day of the week the request is made.", "As for the other two units, TE/GE-EO does not include the IRAS data in a  case file since the examination focuses on the Form 990, and  employment tax issues are examined only to the extent the examiners  uncover potential noncompliance when checking those issues. SB/SE  provides the IRAS data if requested by the examiner. In our survey, 87 of  100 SB/SE examiners said they were aware that they could request IRAS  data for operational examinations. However, 91 of the 100 SB/SE  examiners in our survey preferred to have IRAS data in the case file when  an examination starts rather than on request. In addition, of the SB/SE  examiners who have used IRAS on operational examinations since the  NRP examinations, 46 of 50 survey respondents found it very or  extremely helpful.", "For a May 2013 report on a different NRP study, we developed a set of  criteria for evaluating whether NRP practices should be applied to  operational examinations. These criteria include:", "Would the change be likely to help examiners correctly identify more  noncompliance?", "Is it likely to make the examination more efficient\u2014(i.e., reduce the  cost of conducting an examination, increase benefits for the same  cost, or increase benefits commensurate with justifiable or no  increase in costs)?", "Is it likely to reduce taxpayer burden?", "Would the change meet any other IRS need?", "For this review, we planned to apply these criteria to determine if the NRP  employment tax practices that IRS examiners wanted the most and found  most helpful would be applicable to operational examinations, such as  providing IRAS and the data used in it upfront. However, SB/SE had  limited data and information that aligned with the criteria. Therefore, we  relied on our survey of examiners and interviews with IRS officials as  discussed below.", "In the survey, examiners said that having IRAS data upfront is helpful  because it allows them to better plan the examination and identify issues  sooner. IRAS does so by allowing them to electronically match and  analyze a large number of W-2s and information returns. The  identification of examination issues, in turn, facilitates their initial interview  and contact with the taxpayer. It can also reduce taxpayer burden and  make the examination more efficient, according to IRS examiners. These  benefits align with IRS\u2019s strategic plan to deliver high-quality and timely  service to reduce taxpayer burden and encourage voluntary  compliance.", "TE/GE-FSLG officials said that providing IRAS and the IRAS data upfront  has improved efficiency by helping examiners plan the examination and  reduce the need to ask taxpayers to provide information. They added that  they do not have data to document their views. In addition, TE/GE- FSLG\u2019s examinations only focus on employment tax liabilities, which  covered 2,003 returns in fiscal year 2015.", "When we shared our survey results with SB/SE officials, they were  concerned about providing IRAS data upfront for all operational  examinations as was done for NRP examinations. Specifically, SB/SE\u2019s  employment tax examination caseload is much higher as SB/SE  examined 41,554 Form 941 returns in fiscal year 2015. Given this  caseload, SB/SE officials raised concerns about providing the data  upfront through case building. One concern they raised is that returns  sent to an IRS campus for case building or assigned for examination from  the campus may not be examined. As a result, having the campus pull  IRAS data for all returns will risk that the data may not be used for some.  Similarly, SB/SE officials added that many of their large examinations  could involve many corporate subsidiaries of which only a handful are  examined. Thus, requiring SB/SE to include the IRAS data for all  subsidiaries would be burdensome. Beyond these large examinations,  these officials noted that many SB/SE examinations involve employers  with 10 or fewer information returns, which are too few to merit using  IRAS. IRS did not have data on examinations by the numbers of  subsidiaries or information returns.", "SB/SE officials also said that providing IRAS data in all case files upfront  would move the cost burden from the examiner to an administrative office  at IRS\u2019s Cincinnati campus, which helps prepare the cases. According to  IRS officials, the support staff at the Cincinnati campus is shared between  SB/SE\u2019s specialty groups for employment tax and excise tax. In fiscal  year 2015, less than one full-time equivalent employee was devoted to  building employment tax cases for SB/SE at the campus. The  administrative staff who prepare the cases are generally on the General  Schedule (GS)-7 pay scale, whereas the examiners tend to have more  technical experience and a higher GS grade, and can determine whether  the IRAS information would be helpful. The SB/SE examiners who  participated in our survey were GS-11 or higher. IRS officials added that  many support organizations in IRS are operating with smaller staffs due  to budget constraints, and their desire is to maximize the use of resources  for meeting face-to-face with taxpayers.", "While we recognize that resource constraints can be an important  consideration, none of the business units who have offered IRAS on  request or upfront in case files had evaluated whether providing the IRAS  data upfront made sense in line with the criteria we identified in May 2013  for making such decisions. Nor did SB/SE have data on the type of  examinations, such as just those with large numbers of information  returns, in which IRAS would be more or less applicable. Without having  these necessary data, IRS is limited in determining whether and when to  provide IRAS data upfront in line with criteria we have identified in our  prior work on evaluating the applicability of practices used in an NRP  study.", "IRS examiners we surveyed also found it helpful to have electronic case  files and related return information upfront. For example, 108 of 133  survey respondents found electronic case files extremely or very helpful  while 84 of 94 found related return information similarly helpful. They cited  a number of benefits for both.", "According to IRS examiners, electronic case files enhance efficiency by  making it easier to do tasks, such as recording, updating, organizing, and  transmitting the examination information. However, IRS officials added  that in some instances, such as if a case is appealed by the taxpayer,  paper case files have to be completed in addition to electronic case files.  TE/GE FSLG and TE/GE-EO already have fully electronic case files while  SB/SE uses partially electronic case files. SB/SE officials noted that they  are considering moving to fully electronic case files by the middle of 2017  or later. SB/SE officials noted that it would take that long given the  complexity of aligning various IRS information systems and limited IRS  resources for information technology.", "Similarly, for related return information, examiners noted that having the  information upfront helps plan the work and identify issues. SB/SE does  not provide the related return when the examination starts, but SB/SE  examiners are able to access an electronically filed related entity return  shortly after an employment examination starts.", "In contrast, for the CP2100 and cash transaction data, a much smaller  number of IRS examiners used them on operational employment tax  examinations since completing the NRP employment tax study. According  to IRS officials, the low use could be due to examinations where the  CP2100 or cash transaction data were not necessary. For example, 28 of  209 survey respondents had used the CP2100 and 11 of 181 survey  respondents had used the cash transaction data on operational  examinations since completing examinations for NRP employment tax  study. This may be because the data on the CP2100 and cash  transactions infrequently apply to related employment tax issues.", "When the CP2100 and cash transaction data did apply, survey  respondents who used both types of data on operational employment tax  examinations since completing the NRP study generally found them  helpful. According to IRS examiners, the CP2100 can help narrow the  scope and better plan the examination, and the cash transaction data can  help understand the operations of the business under examination."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Half of IRS Examiners Were Unaware They Could Request Certain NRP Practices For Operational Employment Tax Examinations", "paragraphs": ["Over half of IRS examiners in our survey asked if they were aware how to  request two NRP practices for operational examinations\u2014the CP2100  and cash transaction data\u2014answered no.

However, examiners  are not always aware of how to access each NRP practice. This is  inconsistent with IRS\u2019s strategic plan to empower employees with the  tools and training to further develop skill proficiency and improve business  performance.", "IRS officials said examiners may be unaware of how to request CP2100  and cash transaction data because the related employment tax issues are  infrequently examined. Our survey results showed that a small portion of  our survey respondents had used either NRP practice on operational  employment tax examinations since completing the NRP examinations.  Even so, examiners found these two types of data to be helpful when they  did apply to the examination.", "Instructions to examiners for requesting CP2100 and cash transaction  data are in the IRM, which can be accessed at the examiner\u2019s discretion.  However, IRS does not uniformly remind all examiners how to access  them. For example, TE/GE-FSLG made examiners aware of how to  access the CP2100 in a quarterly newsletter, which may explain why 22  of 26 survey respondents from FSLG were aware of how to access it,  compared to 19 of 79 for TE/GE-EO and 47 of 96 for SB/SE. Prior to the  survey, TE/GE-EO had not provided examiners any reminders about how  to access the CP2100, but did so afterwards through an informal training,  which is also available to examiners through a shared computer drive  along with instructions for using CP2100. SB/SE has training on backup  withholding that instructs examiners how to request a CP2100.", "Without examiners being aware of these practices and able to utilize them  when needed, they may be limited in their ability to effectively examine  employment tax returns. While survey respondents said CP2100 and  cash transaction data were not used frequently, these practices can be  helpful when needed.

The study results also provide the opportunity  to analyze those issues by various descriptive statistics such as employer  size and compensation. However, IRS has no specific plans to study the  results and assess issues of noncompliance, or update the current  estimate of the employment tax gap, and has not completed any analysis  of the results.", "In addition, the NRP study provides IRS with an opportunity to improve  the operational examination process. Ensuring that examiners are given  the opportunity to access certain NRP practices\u2014and are aware of how  to do that\u2014once they move from NRP examinations to operational  examinations could reduce the burden placed on taxpayers and help  examiners identify examination issues.

These research and  examination officials represented Research, Applied Analytics, and  Statistics (RAAS) and Tax-Exempt/Government Entities (TE/GE) and  Small Business/Self-Employed (SB/SE). We gathered and reviewed  documentation, if available, to confirm any IRS plans to analyze and use  the data. We compared this testimonial and documentary evidence to  IRS\u2019s strategic plan and the Internal Revenue Manual (IRM).", "To review NRP data available on noncompliance areas for employment  taxes, we obtained the NRP data set on completed examinations of the  employer\u2019s Form 941 - Employer\u2019s Quarterly Federal Tax Return as of  July 18, 2016. Each return selected and examined in the study consisted  of any of the four quarters filed or required for a tax year. IRS\u2019s final  sample sizes for the study were 2,507, 2,387 and 2,318 for tax years  2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively. The sample stratification included 14  strata across the four participating business units (TE/GE-Exempt  Organization (EO), TE/GE-Federal, State, and Local Governments  (FSLG), SB/SE, and Large Business and International (LB&I)) that served  as the primary stratifying variable; other stratifying variables included the  employer\u2019s total wages and the mean number of employees. RAAS  initially estimated that the NRP employment tax study size should be  approximately 20,000 returns. However, according to IRS, this would not  be possible based on resources available for the study. The limitations of  the sample size were pointed out by the Treasury Inspector General for  Tax Administration, which noted that the examination results for the  sampled taxpayers may not enable IRS to fully estimate compliance  levels for business taxpayers, among other findings.", "Unlike other IRS examinations, NRP examinations can be used to  estimate taxpayer reporting compliance, such as for reporting  employment tax liabilities. The NRP employment tax study represents  employers that filed at least one quarterly Form 941 return for the study  year. However, certain types of employers were excluded from the study  sample. For example, any nonfilers and other employment tax reporting  businesses such as agricultural businesses (Form 943), household  employers (Schedule H), or businesses with less than $1,000 in annual  employment taxes due (Form 944) were excluded from the sample.  Additional exclusions from the sample included federal governments,  large corporations with assets of $250 million or more, foreign  subsidiaries, Indian Tribal Governments, and maritime employers.  Furthermore, the TE/GE-EO division excluded all church cases from the  2008 study year due to an unresolved legal issue; churches were  included in the study for tax years 2009 and 2010. Since the study  excluded some government entities and large businesses, the NRP  results may not reflect the full and accurate level of compliance for  government and large business employers.", "We analyzed and estimated the issues examined as well as the wage  adjustments made as a result of the examination, if any. We were not  able to estimate the tax adjustments associated with certain issues being  examined because the workpapers used for the NRP examinations  spread across two data collection instruments (DCIs). The DCI-1 included  the issues (lead sheets) examiners had to examine as part of the NRP  employment tax study as well as the wage adjustments to be documented  from examining those issues. All wage adjustments were required to be  recorded for the study. The DCI-2 included the employment tax reports  that were shared with taxpayers as a result of the examination. The DCI-2  calculated the tax adjustments to a taxpayer\u2019s tax liability (based on the  wage adjustments in the DCI-1), but did not break out the tax adjustment  by issues, similar to the DCI-1. We also analyzed and estimated the  SB/SE employers\u2019 wage adjustments by the number of employees and  the total compensation.", "Our analysis also combined similar issues into higher level groups. For  example, we combined examination results on fringe benefits for  executives and nonexecutives, meaning that the same employer could be  examined for both of these fringe benefit issues. See table 4 for how the  employment tax examination issues were combined. IRS reviewed our  combining of issues and provided suggestions, which we incorporated.", "IRS officials described the quality review and data reliability process they  used for data collected from the NRP examinations. In terms of data  validations, IRS officials said that they used various consistency and  validation checks when the examination was complete to determine if  certain fields were blank or not blank, to ensure certain questions were  answered based on the response to a prior element, and to check all  entries in the DCI-1 against rules they created. This process took place at  the end of examination before data were transmitted to the database.", "During our analysis of the NRP data, we conducted several reliability  tests to ensure the data excerpts were sufficiently complete. For example,  we electronically tested the data for obvious errors. Additionally, we  shared our results with IRS officials to ensure that the data excerpts we  used were complete and accurate for our purposes. We identified a  number of inconsistencies that needed to be corrected before we could  do our analysis. These included the identification of a number of  questionable results for both the total number of employees and the  amount of compensation. The inconsistencies included the numbers of  employees showing \u201c999999\u201d for some cases, or very large numbers that  were the same as the total compensation. Other inconsistencies might  show similar numbers of employees for three of the quarters and a  substantially different number of employees for the other quarter. In  certain instances a fourth quarter value for number of employees or total  compensation would be missing. IRS officials said the potential missing  fourth quarter data represent the difference in time when the return was  filed and when it was selected for the study. In these instances, we  replaced the missing values for the number of employees and total  compensation with the average value for the three quarters that were not  missing.", "We shared these inconsistencies and our corrections with IRS officials,  who agreed with our changes and said they were working on correcting  these inconsistencies as of February 2017. IRS officials said that the NRP  employment tax study presented unique challenges in ensuring data  reliability, which took significantly longer than previous NRP studies  because they were dealing with three business units (SB/SE, TE/GE, and  LB&I) that use different systems to track examinations issues.", "We reviewed documentation on the NRP data, interviewed IRS officials  about the data, and conducted several reliability tests discussed above.  We report average annual estimates for 2008 through 2010 where data  were available. For example, the variables we used to indicate whether  issues were examined during each NRP audit are missing for 2008.  However, other examination information, including wage adjustment  information, is available by examination issue for all three years of the  study. Therefore, we report NRP estimates using data for only 2009\u20132010  when addressing which issues were examined, while NRP estimates  using data for 2008\u20132010 are used to report wage adjustments amounts  by issue and information used to reflect the compliance of SB/SE  employers of different sizes. Generally, the precision of estimates  increases with more observations. Because a probability procedure  based on random selections was used, the sample was only one of a  large number of samples that might have been drawn. Since each sample  could have provided different estimates, we express our confidence in the  precision of our particular sample\u2019s results as a 95 percent confidence  interval (e.g., +/- 7 percentage points). This is the interval that would  contain the actual population value for 95 percent of the samples that  could have been drawn. See appendix II for the specific estimates of this  analysis and information about their sampling errors. Based on the steps  we undertook, we concluded that the data were sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of this report.", "To describe NRP examination practices that IRS has applied to  operational employment tax examinations, we interviewed RAAS staff  who administered the NRP employment tax study on the key differences  between NRP and operational examinations. We also interviewed  examination staff from the SB/SE division and the TEGE division\u2014who  were responsible for NRP examinations during the employment tax study.  Within TE/GE, these included examination staff from EO and FSLG  groups. Based on those discussions, we gathered documentation, to the  extent it was available, to confirm the NRP examination practices carried  over to operational employment tax examinations. We also discussed and  gathered documentation, if available, on the costs and benefits of carrying  over NRP practices to operational employment tax examinations, and  discussed the benefits with the SB/SE and TE/GE staffs.", "To assess the extent that additional improvements could be made to  operational employment tax examinations based on IRS\u2019s NRP  experience, we used a three-step process. First, we interviewed IRS  officials and examiners who completed NRP and operational  examinations to identify potential improvements to operational  examinations from using NRP practices. Second, we sent a survey to all  IRS examiners who worked on NRP and operational examinations to get  their views on additional potential improvements. Third, we discussed the  practices that IRS examiners favored with IRS examination staff. We  compared those ideas against a set of criteria to the extent data were  available to determine whether the ideas warranted further action. We  discuss these three steps in more detail below.", "We held discussions with RAAS staff as well as SB/SE and TE/GE  examination staff who participated in the NRP study to get their views on  additional NRP practices that could improve operational employment tax  examinations. To get similar views, we held four group discussions (one  with FSLG, one with EO, and two with SB/SE) with IRS examiners who  had worked both operational examinations and NRP examinations. These  examiners were identified by IRS. The practices identified included (1)  NRP practices that examiners would like to have, but were not carried  over to the operational examinations; or (2) NRP practices that examiners  were not aware they had access to on operational examinations, but  would like to have that access.", "Based on these discussions, we identified a set of NRP practices that (1)  could be applied to operational examinations, but have not yet been  applied across IRS business units involved in the study; or (2) IRS  examiners were not aware they could access. We developed a set of  specific, close-ended, and open-ended questions that addressed those  topics and had multiple pretests to ensure that the questions were  understandable and answerable. We then administered the web-based  survey to all IRS examiners in SB/SE and TE/GE who had experience  completing operational and NRP employment tax examinations. The  survey asked the same set of questions for six NRP practices we  identified as well as demographic information about the examiners. These  questions included if they would like to have access to these NRP  practices on operational examinations, if and why they found them  helpful, and if they are aware they had access to those NRP practices on  operational employment tax examinations. The survey was sent to the  complete list of 269 examiners identified by IRS officials as of July 2016  that were thought to meet the criteria of examiners with NRP and  operational examination experience. Of those examiners, 23 were  determined to not meet this criteria according to their responses to two  screening questions to ensure IRS examiners had applicable experience  to fill out the survey. These included:  1.  According to IRS records, you have completed both NRP employment  tax examinations and non-NRP employment tax examinations. Is this  correct? (yes/no)  2.  Have you completed a non-NRP employment tax examination since  completing an NRP employment tax examination? (yes/no).", "If the survey respondents answered no to either question, they were sent  to the conclusion section of the survey, and did not provide responses to  the remaining demographics questions and questions about the six NRP  practices. We received a response rate of 85 percent, with 209 of the 246  examiners who met our criteria completing the survey. We also reviewed  the raw data of the survey and made changes to ensure the skip patterns  in the survey were adhered to by the respondents. We analyzed the  survey data by the IRS business unit, current position, and key case year  of NRP returns on which the respondent worked.", "For each of the six NRP practices, we also asked an open-ended  question about why they thought the NRP practice was helpful. We also  asked an open-ended question on whether the respondents had any  other views to share at the end of the survey. To analyze the responses  to these questions, one of our analysts reviewed the responses and  coded them to identify themes for the seven opened-ended responses  with a second analyst reviewing those themes and the coded responses;  we reconciled any disagreements through discussion.", "After analyzing the closed-ended and open-ended data from the survey,  we discussed the IRS examiners\u2019 summary responses with IRS  examination staff in SB/SE and TE/GE. Specifically, we discussed  applying the six NRP examination practices to operational employment  tax examinations. To help lead those discussions with IRS examination  staff, we used the following criteria, which were used for our prior work  evaluating the NRP individual study.", "Would the change be likely to help examiners correctly identify more  noncompliance?", "Is it likely to make the examination more efficient\u2014(i.e., reduce the  cost of conducting an examination, increase benefits for the same  cost, or increase benefits commensurate with justifiable or no  increase in costs)?", "Is it likely to reduce taxpayer burden?", "Would the change meet any other IRS need?", "Where available, we asked for documentation on the criteria above to  assess whether to apply those NRP practices to operational  examinations. These criteria generally are based on our 2005 report,  Understanding the Tax Reform Debate (GAO-05-1009SP), Office of  Management and Budget Circular A-94, and the Internal Revenue  Manual. IRS officials agreed that these criteria were valid. As noted in  our 2005 report, the criteria may conflict with each other, and as a result,  trade-offs are to be considered among the criteria when evaluating a  particular proposal. In those cases, we used our professional judgment in  weighing the relative importance of these criteria in making our  recommendations. We discussed these criteria with IRS to get its  feedback. To the extent data were available on additional NRP practices  that could be used in operational employment tax examinations, we used  that data and information to evaluate those NRP practices using the  criteria above as well as relevant sections from the IRS strategic plan.", "We conducted this performance audit from April 2016 to April 2017 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
