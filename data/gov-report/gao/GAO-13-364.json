TRICARE offers three basic options. Beneficiaries who choose TRICARE Prime, an option that uses civilian provider networks, must enroll. Beneficiaries who do not enroll in this option may obtain care from nonnetwork providers under TRICARE Standard or from network providers under TRICARE Extra. In addition, qualified National Guard and Reserve servicemembers may purchase TRICARE Reserve Select, a plan whose care options are similar to those of TRICARE Standard and TRICARE Extra. GAO refers to servicemembers who use TRICARE Standard, TRICARE Extra, or TRICARE Reserve Select as nonenrolled beneficiaries.", "The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 directed DOD to conduct annual surveys over fiscal years 2008 through 2011 of both beneficiaries and civilian providers to determine the adequacy of access to health and mental health care providers for nonenrolled beneficiaries. It also directed GAO to review these surveys. This report addresses (1) what the results of the 4-year beneficiary surveys indicate about the adequacy of access to care for nonenrolled beneficiaries; (2) what the results of the 4-year civilian provider surveys indicate about civilian providers' awareness and acceptance of TRICARE, and (3) what the collective results of the surveys indicate about access to care by geographic area. To do so, GAO interviewed DOD officials, obtained relevant documentation, and analyzed the data for both surveys over the 4-year period."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In its analysis of the 2008-2011 beneficiary survey data, GAO found that nearly one in three nonenrolled beneficiaries experienced problems finding a civilian provider who would accept TRICARE and that nonenrolled beneficiaries' access to civilian primary care and specialty care providers differed by type of location. Specifically, a higher percentage of nonenrolled beneficiaries in Prime Service Areas (PSA), which are areas with civilian provider networks, experienced problems finding a civilian primary care or specialty care provider compared to those in non-Prime Service Areas (non-PSA), which do not have civilian provider networks. GAO found that the top reasons reported by nonenrolled beneficiaries for why they experienced access problems--regardless of type of provider--were that the providers were either not accepting TRICARE payments or new TRICARE patients. Additionally, GAO's comparison of the Department of Defense's (DOD) beneficiary survey data to related data from a Department of Health and Human Services survey showed that nonenrolled beneficiaries' satisfaction ratings for primary and specialty care providers were consistently lower than those of Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries.", "GAO's analysis of the 2008-2011 civilian provider survey data found that about 6 in 10 civilian providers were accepting new TRICARE patients and the most-cited reason for not accepting new TRICARE patients was that the civilian providers were not aware of the TRICARE program. Civilian physicians' acceptance of TRICARE has also decreased over time. Specifically, when compared to DOD's 2005-2007 civilian physician survey results, civilian physicians' acceptance of new TRICARE patients has decreased. This was also true whether they were accepting any new patients or new Medicare patients. Civilian providers' awareness and acceptance of TRICARE also differed by provider type, as fewer civilian mental health care providers were aware of TRICARE or accepting new TRICARE patients than other types of providers. For example, only an estimated 39 percent of civilian mental health care providers were accepting new TRICARE patients, compared to an estimated 67 percent of civilian primary care providers and an estimated 77 percent of civilian specialty care providers. The analysis also showed that civilian providers' awareness and acceptance of TRICARE differ by location type, as civilian providers in PSAs were less aware of TRICARE and less likely to accept new TRICARE patients than those in non-PSAs.", "GAO's analysis of the collective results of the beneficiary and civilian provider survey results indicates specific geographic areas, including areas in Texas and California, where nonenrolled beneficiaries have experienced considerable access problems. In each of these areas, although almost all civilian providers were accepting new patients, less than half were accepting new TRICARE patients. In most of these areas, civilian providers most often cited reimbursement concerns as the reasons why they were not accepting any new TRICARE patients.", "In commenting on a draft of this report, DOD concurred with GAO's overall findings."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal year 2012, the Department of Defense (DOD) offered health care  services, including mental health care services, to about 9.7 million  eligible beneficiaries in the United States and abroad through TRICARE,  DOD\u2019s regionally structured health care program. Under TRICARE,  beneficiaries may obtain care either from military hospitals and clinics,  referred to as military treatment facilities, or from civilian providers.", "DOD\u2019s TRICARE Management Activity (TMA), which oversees the  program, uses managed care support contractors to develop networks of civilian providers\u2014referred to as network providers\u2014to serve all  TRICARE beneficiaries in geographic areas called Prime Service Areas  (PSA).among other factors, to develop provider networks and ensure adequate  access to care for beneficiaries. Although some network providers may  be located outside of PSAs, contractors are not required to develop  networks in these areas (which we refer to as non-PSAs).", "The contractors use estimates of the number of TRICARE users,  The number and type of civilian providers available to serve TRICARE  beneficiaries can vary depending on a beneficiary\u2019s location and choice of  coverage among TRICARE\u2019s three basic plans\u2014TRICARE Prime,  TRICARE Standard, and TRICARE Extra. TRICARE Prime, a managed care option, must enroll and can obtain care  through military treatment facilities or TRICARE\u2019s civilian provider  network. Beneficiaries do not need to enroll to receive care under  TRICARE Standard, a fee-for-service option, or TRICARE Extra, a  preferred provider organization option; they can choose to receive care  through TRICARE Standard when they are seeing nonnetwork civilian  providers and through TRICARE Extra when they are seeing network  civilian providers. We use the term \u201cnonenrolled beneficiaries\u201d for  beneficiaries who are not enrolled in TRICARE Prime and who use the  TRICARE Standard or Extra options, or TRICARE Reserve Select  (TRS).", "TRICARE offers several other plans, including TRICARE Reserve Select (TRS) for  certain National Guard and Reserve servicemembers, and TRICARE Young Adult (Prime  and Standard options) for servicemembers\u2019 dependents up to age 26. TRICARE also  offers TRICARE for Life to TRICARE beneficiaries who are eligible for Medicare and enroll  in Part B. Under the TRICARE for Life program, TRICARE processes claims after they  have been adjudicated by Medicare.", "Since TRICARE\u2019s inception in 1995, nonenrolled beneficiaries in some  locations have complained about difficulties finding civilian providers who  will accept them as patients. In response to these concerns, the National  Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2004 directed DOD to  monitor access to care for nonenrolled TRICARE beneficiaries through a  survey of civilian providers. The act also directed GAO to review the  processes, procedures, and analyses used by DOD to determine the  adequacy of the number of network and nonnetwork civilian providers and  the actions DOD has taken to ensure access to care for beneficiaries who  were not enrolled in TRICARE Prime. In December 2006, we reported  that TMA and contractor officials used various methods to evaluate  access to care, including the survey of civilian providers, and according to  those officials, their methods indicated that access was generally  sufficient for nonenrolled beneficiaries.", "Nonetheless, concerns about the ability of TRICARE beneficiaries,  particularly nonenrolled beneficiaries, to access health care and mental  health care continued. In light of these continued concerns about access  to civilian providers, the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2008 (NDAA 2008)  directed DOD to conduct annual surveys over 4 years of both  beneficiaries and civilian providers to determine the adequacy of access  to health care and mental health care providers for nonenrolled  beneficiaries. It also directed GAO to review these surveys along with  other factors such as DOD\u2019s outreach, marketing, and education efforts,  and provider reimbursement issues. We have issued several reports that  address the topics covered in this mandate, including a March 2010  report on the methodology and results of the first year of DOD\u2019s 4-year  beneficiary and provider surveys.", "In our initial review of the surveys, we  reported that a higher percentage of nonenrolled beneficiaries in the  surveyed PSAs experienced problems accessing care from civilian  primary care providers than those in the surveyed non-PSAs. However,  we could not reach any generalizable conclusions about the civilian  provider survey because it had not generated sufficient survey responses  during the first year. The NDAA for Fiscal Year 2012 extended DOD\u2019s  annual beneficiary and provider surveys for another 4 years, from fiscal  years 2012 through 2015. As of early January 2013, TMA had mailed  the 2012 beneficiary and civilian provider survey instruments.", "This report addresses DOD\u2019s beneficiary and civilian provider surveys for  the first 4-year survey period, covering fiscal years 2008 through 2011.  Specifically, it addresses (1) what the results of the 4-year beneficiary  surveys indicate about the adequacy of access to care for nonenrolled  beneficiaries, (2) what the results of the 4-year civilian provider surveys  indicate about civilian providers\u2019 awareness and acceptance of TRICARE,  and (3) what the collective results of the 4-year beneficiary and civilian  provider surveys indicate about access to care for nonenrolled  beneficiaries by geographic area.", "To determine what the results of the 4-year beneficiary surveys indicate  about the adequacy of access to care for nonenrolled beneficiaries, we  obtained and analyzed survey data on access to civilian primary,  specialty, and mental health care from TMA\u2019s TRICARE Standard  Surveys of Beneficiaries for 2008 through 2011. For the purposes of our  analysis, we analyzed survey results for those nonenrolled beneficiaries  who reported using TRICARE Standard, TRICARE Extra, or TRS the  most in the last year. Because the overall response rate for the 4 years  was about 38 percent, we verified that TMA\u2019s survey results were  representative of the areas surveyed by reviewing TMA\u2019s nonresponse  analyses and interviewing TMA officials. We also obtained and analyzed  the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 (HHS) Consumer  Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) survey data  for the same 2008-2011 period in order to compare nonenrolled  TRICARE beneficiaries\u2019 satisfaction with their health care, health plan,  and primary and specialty care providers to that of Medicare fee-for- service, Medicaid, and commercially insured beneficiaries. We  assessed the reliability of these data by obtaining information from  knowledgeable officials and reviewing related documentation, and we  determined that TMA\u2019s 4-year beneficiary survey data and HHS\u2019s CAHPS  data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes.", "To determine what the results of the 4-year civilian provider surveys  indicate about civilian providers\u2019 awareness and acceptance of TRICARE,  we obtained and analyzed the survey data from TMA\u2019s TRICARE  Standard Surveys of Providers for 2008 through 2011. Because the  overall response rate was about 42 percent, we verified that TMA\u2019s civilian provider survey results were representative of the areas surveyed  by reviewing TMA\u2019s nonresponse analyses and interviewing TMA  officials.

Specifically, we identified areas  where the estimated percentage of nonenrolled beneficiaries that  experienced problems finding a civilian provider was either at or above  the national estimate for nonenrolled beneficiaries, using the 95 percent  confidence limits. For these geographic areas, we then looked at civilian  provider acceptance of new TRICARE patients and identified areas where  the percentage of civilian providers that were accepting any new  TRICARE patients was at or below the national estimate, using the   95 percent confidence limits.", "Our analyses have some limitations. In our analyses of TMA\u2019s beneficiary  and provider surveys we report survey results for some individual areas,  but we were unable to compare survey results among all of the individual  geographic areas surveyed because of low numbers of respondents in  some areas. Similarly, in our analysis of TMA\u2019s beneficiary survey we  were unable to identify specific geographic areas in which nonenrolled  beneficiaries experienced problems finding mental health care providers  because of the low numbers of respondents who indicated that they  needed mental health care.", "We conducted this performance audit from June 2012 through February  2013 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

The  NDAA 2008 also required DOD to consult with representatives of  TRICARE beneficiaries and health care and mental health care providers  to identify locations where nonenrolled beneficiaries have experienced  significant access-to-care problems, and give a high priority to surveying  health care and mental health care providers in these areas.

TMA identified the 80 PSAs by collecting  zip codes where TRICARE Prime was offered from officials within each of  the three TRICARE Regional Offices. TMA grouped these zip codes into  80 nonoverlapping areas so that each area had roughly the same number  of TRICARE-eligible beneficiaries. Because non-PSAs had not previously  been defined, TMA sought to define them by grouping all zip codes not in  PSAs into one large area using Hospital Referral Regions, which are  groupings of Hospital Service Areas (HSA). TMA divided the large area  into 80 non-PSAs so that each area had roughly the same number of  TRICARE-eligible beneficiaries.", "To identify locations where nonenrolled beneficiaries and health care and  mental health care providers have identified significant levels of access- to-care problems under TRICARE Standard and Extra, TMA spoke with  groups representing beneficiaries and health care and mental health care  providers, as well as officials at the TRICARE Regional Offices. These  groups suggested cities and towns where access should be measured (in  addition to the larger PSAs and non-PSAs), and HSAs corresponding to  each city and town were then identified. On the basis of the groups\u2019  recommendations, multiple lists were created and sorted in priority order:  21 HSAs were surveyed in the 2008 surveys; 9 HSAs in the 2009  surveys; 25 HSAs in the 2010 surveys; and 16 HSAs in the 2011 civilian  provider survey. This resulted in a total of 55 HSAs surveyed for the  nonenrolled beneficiary survey, and 71 HSAs surveyed in the civilian  provider survey (the 71 HSAs includes the same 55 HSAs surveyed for  the nonenrolled beneficiary survey and an additional 16 that were  selected for the 2011 fielding). Although the NDAA 2008 required DOD  to give a high priority to surveying areas in which a high concentration of  Selected Reserve servicemembers live, TMA officials decided to  randomly select areas for the surveys in order to produce results that  could be generalized to the populations in the areas surveyed and to  survey the entire United States over the 4-year period\u2014an approach we  deemed acceptable in our previous report."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Survey Sample Selection", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Nonenrolled Beneficiary Survey Sample Selection", "paragraphs": ["TMA selected its sample of beneficiaries who met its criteria for inclusion  in the beneficiary survey using DOD\u2019s Defense Enrollment Eligibility  Reporting System (DEERS), a database of DOD beneficiaries who may  be eligible for military health benefits.

For the 2008, 2009, and 2010 survey  fieldings, TMA used a sample size between approximately 40,000 and  50,000 beneficiaries. Because of budgetary constraints, the sample size  of the 2011 nonenrolled beneficiary survey was decreased to around  34,000. Because of this reduction, the 2011 sample was further  stratified by using claims data to identify beneficiaries who would likely  self-report as TRICARE Standard and Extra users. After receiving the  returned surveys, TMA identified the responses that it considered  complete and eligible on the basis of whether the beneficiary had  answered at least half of TMA\u2019s identified \u201ckey\u201d questions.

TMA used the American Medical Association Physician  Masterfile to select a sample of physicians who were licensed, office- based civilian medical doctors or licensed civilian doctors of osteopathy  within the specified locations who were engaged in more than 20 hours of  patient care each week. The American Medical Association Physician  Masterfile is a database of physicians in the U.S.\u2014Doctors of Medicine  and Doctors of Osteopathic Medicine\u2014that includes data on all  physicians who have the necessary educational and credentialing  requirements.

As  such, TMA selected this file because it is widely recognized as one of the  best commercially available lists of providers in the United States and  contained more than 940,000 physicians along with their addresses,  phone numbers, and information on practice characteristics, such as their  specialty. According to TMA, the American Medical Association updates  physicians\u2019 addresses monthly and other elements through a rotating  census methodology involving approximately one-third of the physician  population each year. Although the Masterfile is considered to contain  most providers, deficiencies in coverage and inaccuracies in detail  remain. Therefore, TMA attempted to update providers\u2019 addresses and  phone numbers and ensure that providers were eligible for the survey by  also using state licensing databases, local commercial lists, and  professional society and association lists.", "For its 2008 and 2009 mental health care provider sample selection, TMA  selected a sample of mental health care providers from two sources: the  American Medical Association\u2019s Masterfile of psychiatrists, and LISTS,  Inc.\u2014a list of names with contact information assembled from state  licensing boards. For the 2010 and 2011 mental health care provider  sample selections, TMA also used mental health specialty areas from the  National Plan and Provider Enumeration System database maintained by  the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, in addition to data from  LISTS, Inc., and the psychiatrist data from the American Medical  Association\u2019s Masterfile. According to TMA, it selected these sources for  mental health care providers because they have been identified as the  most comprehensive databases for these health care providers.", "From these data sets, TMA planned to randomly sample about   800 providers (400 each of physicians and mental health care providers)  from each PSA, non-PSA, and HSA\u2014a sample size that would achieve   In those instances where there were  TMA\u2019s desired sample error rate.not 800 providers in a single area, TMA selected all of the providers in  that area to receive surveys. As the PSA and non-PSA regions were  formed on the basis of the number of beneficiaries and not the number of  civilian providers, some regions with a large number of civilian providers  were sampled at relatively low rates in 2008, 2009, and 2010.
