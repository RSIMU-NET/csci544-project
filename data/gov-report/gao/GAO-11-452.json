This is GAO's fourth report under the mandate. GAO reviewed a stratified random sample of 100 lobbying disclosure reports filed from the fourth quarter of calendar year 2009 through the third quarter of calendar year 2010. GAO also selected two random samples totaling 160 reports of federal political campaign contributions from year-end 2009 and midyear 2010. This methodology allowed GAO to generalize to the population of 55,282 disclosure reports with $5,000 or more in lobbying activity. GAO also met with officials from the Office regarding efforts to focus resources on lobbyists who fail to comply. GAO provided a draft of this report to the Attorney General for review and comment. The Assistant U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia responded on behalf of the Attorney General that the Department of Justice had no comments on the draft of this report."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Lobbyists were generally able to provide documentation to support the amount of income and expenses reported; however, less documentation was provided to support other items in their disclosure reports. This finding is similar to GAO's results from prior reviews. There are no specific requirements for lobbyists to create or maintain documentation related to disclosure reports they file under the LDA. For income and expenses, two key elements of the reports, GAO estimates that lobbyists could provide documentation for approximately 97 percent of the disclosure reports for the fourth quarter 2009 and the first three quarters of 2010. According to the documentation lobbyists provided for income and expenses, we estimate the amount disclosed was supported for 68 percent of disclosure reports. After GAO's review, 21 lobbyists stated that they planned to amend their disclosure reports to make corrections on one or more data elements. As of March 2011, 12 of the 21 amended their disclosure reports. For political contributions reports, GAO estimates that a minimum of 2 percent of reports failed to disclose political contributions that were documented in the Federal Election Commission database. The majority of lobbyists who newly registered with the Secretary of the Senate and Clerk of the House of Representatives in the last quarter of 2009 and first three quarters of 2010 filed required disclosure reports for that period. GAO could identify corresponding reports on file for lobbying activity for 90 percent of registrants. The majority of lobbyists felt that the terms associated with disclosure reporting were clear and understandable. For the few lobbyists who stated that disclosure reporting terminology remained a challenge, areas of potential inconsistency and confusion in applying the terms associated with disclosure reporting requirements have been highlighted. Some lobbyists reported a lack of clarity in determining lobbying activities versus non-lobbying activities. A few lobbyists stated that they misreported on their disclosure reports because they carried information from old reports to new reports without properly updating information. The Office is responsible for enforcement of the LDA and has the authority to pursue a civil or criminal case for noncompliance. To enforce LDA compliance, the Office has primarily focused on sending letters to lobbyists who have potentially violated the LDA by not filing disclosure reports. For calendar years 2008 and 2009, the Office sent 1,597 noncompliance letters for disclosure reports and political contributions reports. About half of the lobbyists who received noncompliance letters are now compliant. In response to an earlier GAO recommendation, the Office has developed a system to better focus enforcement efforts by tracking and recording the status of enforcement activities. The system allows the Office to monitor lobbyists who continually fail to file the required disclosure reports. The Office stated that they plan to institute procedures to formalize data review, refine summary data, and ensure data are accurate and reliable in the next few months."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Questions regarding the influence of special interests in the formation of  government policy have led to a move toward more transparency and  accountability with regard to the lobbying community.

To assess whether these disclosure data were sufficiently  reliable for the purposes of this report, we reviewed relevant  documentation and spoke to officials responsible for maintaining the data.  Although registrations and reports are filed thorough a single Web portal,  each chamber subsequently receives copies of the data and follows  different data cleaning, processing, and editing procedures before storing  the data in either individual files (in the House) or databases (in the  Senate). Currently, there is no means of reconciling discrepancies between  the two databases that result from chamber differences in data processing.  For example, Senate staff has told us during previous reviews that they  set aside a greater proportion of registration and report submissions than  the House for manual review before entering the information into the  database, and as a result, the Senate database would be slightly less  current than the House database on any given day pending review and  clearance; and House staff told us during previous reviews that they rely  heavily on automated processing, and that while they manually review  reports that do not perfectly match information on file for a given  registrant or client, they will approve and upload such reports as originally  filed by each lobbyist even if the reports contain errors or discrepancies  (such as a variant on how a name is spelled). Nevertheless, we do not have  reason to believe that the content of the Senate and House systems would  vary substantially. While we determined that both the Senate and House  disclosure data were sufficiently reliable for identifying a sample of  quarterly disclosure reports (LD-2 reports) and for assessing whether  newly filed registrants also filed required reports, we chose to use data  from the Clerk of the House for sampling LD-2 reports from the last  quarter of 2009, first three quarters of 2010, as well as for sampling year- end 2009 and midyear 2009 contributions reports (LD-203 reports), and  finally for matching quarterly registrations with filed reports. We did not  evaluate the Offices of the Secretary of the Senate or the Clerk of the  House, both of which have key roles in the lobbying disclosure process,  although we consulted with officials from each office, and they provided  us with general background information at our request and detailed  information on data processing procedures.", "To assess the extent to which lobbyists could provide evidence of their  compliance with reporting requirements, we examined a stratified random  sample of 100 LD-2 reports from the fourth quarter of calendar year 2009  and the first, second, and third quarters of calendar year 2010, with 25  reports selected from each quarter. We excluded reports with no lobbying  activity or with income less than $5,000 from our sampling frame and  drew our sample from 55,282 activity reports filed for the last quarter of  2009 and the first three quarters of 2010 available in the public House  database, as of our final download date for each quarter. There is 1 LD-2  report in the sample that amended their LD-2 after notification of being  selected for the sample but prior to our review. The amended LD-2 report  decreased lobbying activity income for that quarter from $21,000 to less  than $5,000. Further, that report was amended to show no lobbying  contact, whereas the original LD-2 activity report showed lobbying contact  with the Senate and House. We conducted a review of this report because  they amended to no activity with lobbying income of less than $5,000  following notification of inclusion in the sample. Since \u201cno lobbying  activity\u201d was indicated on the amended LD-2 activity report, lobbyists  were not required to provide information for all reporting elements on the  LD-2. Therefore, in certain calculations this 1 report is excluded from the  sample. Our sample is based on a stratified random selection, and it is only  one of a large number of samples that we may have drawn. Because each  sample could have provided different estimates, we express our  confidence in the precision of our particular sample\u2019s results as a 95  percent confidence interval. This is the interval that would contain the  actual population value for 95 percent of the samples that we could have  drawn. All percentage estimates in this report have 95 percent confidence  intervals of within plus or minus 10.0 percentage points or less of the  estimate itself, unless otherwise noted. When estimating compliance with  certain of the elements we examined, we base our estimate on a one-sided  95 percent confidence interval to generate a conservative estimate of  either the minimum or maximum percentage of reports in the population  exhibiting the characteristic.", "We contacted all the lobbyists and lobbying firms in our sample and asked  them to provide support for key elements in their reports, including:  the amount of income reported for lobbying activities,  the amount of expenses reported on lobbying activities,  the names of those lobbyists listed in the report,  the houses of Congress and federal agencies that they lobbied, and  the issue codes that they had lobbied.", "In addition, we determined whether each individual lobbyist listed on the  LD-2 report had filed a semiannual LD-203 report.", "Prior to interviewing lobbyists about each LD-2 report in our sample, we  conducted an open-source search to determine whether each lobbyist  listed on the report appeared to have held a covered official position  required to be disclosed. For lobbyists registered prior to January 1, 2008,  covered official positions held within 2 years of the date of the report must  be disclosed; this period was extended to 20 years for lobbyists who  registered on or after January 1, 2008. Lobbyists are required to disclose  covered official positions on either the client registration (LD-1) or on the  first LD-2 report for a specific client, and consequently those who had held  covered official positions may have disclosed the information on a LD-2  report filed prior to the report we examined as part of our random sample.  To identify likely covered official positions, we examined lobbying firms\u2019  Web sites and conducted extensive open-source search of Leadership  Directories, Who\u2019s Who in American Politics, and U.S. newspapers through  Nexis for lobbyists\u2019 names and variations on their names. We then  examined the current LD-2 report under review, prior LD-2 reports, and  the client registration to determine if the identified covered positions were  disclosed properly. Finally, we asked lobbying firms and organizations  about each lobbyist listed on the LD-2 report that we had identified as  having a previous covered official position that we had not found  disclosure of to determine whether covered official positions had been  appropriately disclosed or whether there was some other acceptable  reason for the omission (such as having been disclosed on an earlier  registration or LD-2 report). Despite our rigorous search protocol, it is  possible that our search failed to identify omitted reports of covered  official positions. Thus, our estimate of the proportion of reports with  lobbyists who failed to appropriately disclose covered official positions is  a lower-bound estimate of the minimum proportion of reports that failed  to report such positions.", "In addition to examining the content of LD-2 reports, we confirmed  whether year-end 2009 and midyear 2010 LD-203 reports had been filed for  each firm and lobbyist listed on the LD-2 reports in our random sample.  Although this review represents a random selection of lobbyists and firms,  it is not a direct probability sample of firms filing LD-2 reports or lobbyists  listed on LD-2 reports. As such, we did not estimate the likelihood that LD- 203 reports were appropriately filed for the population of firms or  lobbyists listed on LD-2 reports.", "To determine if the LDA\u2019s requirement for registrants to file a report in the  quarter of registration was met for the fourth quarter of 2009 and the first,  second, and third quarters of 2010, we used data filed with the Clerk of the  House to match newly filed registrations with corresponding disclosure  reports. Using direct matching and text and pattern matching procedures,  we were able to identify matching disclosure reports for 4,132 of the 4,553,  or 90.8 percent, of newly filed registrations. We began by standardizing  client and registrant names in both the report and registration files  (including removing punctuation and standardizing words and  abbreviations such as \u201cCompany and CO\u201d). We then matched reports and  registrations using the House identification number (which is linked to a  unique registrant-client pair), as well as the names of the registrant and  client. For reports we could not match by identification number and  standardized name, we also attempted to match reports and registrations  by client and registrant name, allowing for variations in the names to  accommodate minor misspellings or typos. We could not readily identify  matches in the report database for the remaining registrations using  electronic means.", "To assess the accuracy of the LD-203 reports, we analyzed two stratified  random samples of LD-203 reports from the 32,893 total LD-203 reports.  The first sample contains 80 reports of the 10,956 reports with political  contributions and the second contains 80 reports of the 21,937 reports  listing no contributions. Each sample contains 40 reports from the year- end 2009 filing period and 40 reports from the midyear 2010 filing period.  The samples allow us to generalize estimates in this report to either the  population of LD-203 reports with contributions or the reports without  contributions to within a 95 percent confidence interval of plus or minus  7.1 percentage points or less, and to within 3.5 percentage points of the  estimate when analyzing both samples together. We analyzed the contents  of the LD-203 reports and compared them to contribution data found in  the publicly available Federal Elections Commission\u2019s (FEC) political  contribution database. For our fiscal year 2009 report, we interviewed staff  at the FEC responsible for administering the database and determined that  the data reliability is suitable for the purpose of confirming whether a  FEC-reportable disclosure listed in the FEC database had been reported  on an LD-203.", "We compared the FEC-reportable contributions reported on the LD-203  reports with information in the FEC database. The verification process  required text and pattern matching procedures, and we used professional  judgment when assessing whether an individual listed is the same  individual filing an LD-203. For contributions reported in the FEC database  and not on the LD-203, we asked the lobbyists or organizations to provide  an explanation of why the contribution was not listed on the LD-203 report  or to provide documentation of those contributions. As with covered  positions on LD-2 disclosure reports, we cannot be certain that our review  identified all cases of FEC-reportable contributions that were  inappropriately omitted from a lobbyist\u2019s LD-203 report. We did not  estimate the percent of other non-FEC political contributions that were  omitted (such as honoraria, or gifts to presidential libraries).", "We obtained views from lobbyists included in our sample of reports on  any challenges to compliance.", "To describe the processes used by the Office in following up on referrals  from the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House, data  reliability in the Office\u2019s tracking system for referrals, and to provide  information on the resources and authorities used by the Office in its role  in enforcing compliance with the LDA, we interviewed officials from the  Office and obtained information on the capabilities of the system they  established to track and report compliance trends and referrals and other  practices they have established to focus resources on enforcement of the  LDA; the extent to which they have implemented data reliability checks  into their tracking system; and the level of staffing and resources  dedicated to lobbying disclosure enforcement. The Office provided us with  reports from the tracking system on the number and status of cases  referred, pending, and resolved.", "The mandate does not include identifying lobbyists who failed to register  and report in accordance with LDA requirements, or whether for those  lobbyists that did register and report all lobbying activity or contributions  were disclosed.
