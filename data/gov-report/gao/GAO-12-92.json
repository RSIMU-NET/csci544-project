These assets rely on networked computers and systems, thus making them susceptible to cyber-based risks. Managing such risk involves the use of cybersecurity guidance that promotes or requires actions to enhance the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of computer systems. For seven critical infrastructure sectors, GAO was asked to identify (1) cybersecurity guidance for entities within the sectors, (2) the extent to which implementation of this guidance is enforced and promoted, and (3) areas of commonalities and differences between sector cybersecurity guidance and guidance applicable to federal agencies. To do this, GAO collected and analyzed information from responsible private sector coordinating councils; federal agencies, including sector-specific agencies that are responsible for coordinating critical infrastructure protection efforts; and standards-making bodies. In addition, GAO compared a set of guidance in each of three subsectors with guidance applicable to federal agencies."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["A wide variety of cybersecurity guidance is available from national and international organizations for entities within the seven critical infrastructure sectors GAO reviewed--banking and finance; communications; energy; health care and public health; information technology; nuclear reactors, material, and waste; and water. Much of this guidance is tailored to business needs of entities or provides methods to address unique risks or operations. In addition, entities operating in regulated environments are subject to mandatory standards to meet their regulatory requirements; entities operating outside of a regulatory environment may voluntarily adopt standards and guidance. While private sector coordinating council representatives confirmed lists of cybersecurity guidance that they stated were used within their respective sectors, the representatives emphasized that the lists were not comprehensive and that additional standards and guidance are likely used.", "Implementation of cybersecurity guidance can occur through a variety of mechanisms, including enforcement of regulations and voluntarily in response to business incentives; however, sector-specific agencies could take additional steps to promote the most applicable and effective guidance throughout the sectors. A number of subsectors within the sectors included in GAO's review, such as electricity in the energy sector, are required to meet mandatory cybersecurity standards established by regulation under federal law or face enforcement mechanisms, such as civil monetary penalties. By contrast, entities not subject to regulation may voluntarily implement cybersecurity guidance to, among other things, reduce risk, protect intellectual property, and meet customer expectations. Federal policy establishes the dissemination and promotion of cybersecurity-related standards and guidance as a goal to enhancing the security of our nation's cyber-reliant critical infrastructure. DHS and the other lead agencies for the sectors selected for review have disseminated and promoted cybersecurity guidance among and within sectors. However, DHS and the other sector-specific agencies have not identified the key cybersecurity guidance applicable to or widely used in each of their respective critical infrastructure sectors. In addition, most of the sector-specific critical infrastructure protection plans for the sectors reviewed do not identify key guidance and standards for cybersecurity because doing so was not specifically suggested by DHS guidance. Given the plethora of guidance available, individual entities within the sectors may be challenged in identifying the guidance that is most applicable and effective in improving their security posture. Improved knowledge of the guidance that is available could help both federal and private sector decision makers better coordinate their efforts to protect critical cyber-reliant assets.", "Sector cybersecurity guidance that GAO compared in three subsectors within the banking and finance, energy, and nuclear sectors is substantially similar to guidance applicable to federal agencies. Specifically, one set of guidance for each subsector, along with supplementary documents, addressed most risk management steps and most recommended security controls that are specified for federal information systems in guidance from the Commerce Department's National Institute of Standards and Technology. GAO is recommending that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), in collaboration with public and private sector partners, determine whether it is appropriate to have cybersecurity guidance listed in sector plans.

In  addition, most sectors reviewed had not specified available guidance in  their respective planning documents, in part because DHS\u2019s planning  guidance did not suggest the inclusion of cybersecurity guidance. Given  the plethora of guidance available, individual entities within the sectors  may be challenged in identifying the guidance that is most applicable and  effective in improving their security posture. Greater knowledge of the  guidance that is available could help both federal and private sector  decision makers better coordinate their efforts to protect critical cyber- reliant assets. Finally, the sector-specific cybersecurity guidance that we  compared was substantially similar to guidance applicable to federal  agencies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Secretary of Homeland Security, in collaboration  with the sector-specific agencies, sector coordinating councils, and the  owners and operators of cyber-reliant critical infrastructure for the  associated seven critical infrastructure sectors, determine whether it is  appropriate to have key cybersecurity guidance listed in sector plans or  annual plans and adjust planning guidance accordingly to suggest the  inclusion of such guidance in future plans."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["DHS provided written comments on a draft of our report (see app. III),  signed by DHS\u2019s Director of Departmental GAO/OIG Liaison Office.

We selected these seven sectors because they are  cyber-reliant or have a pervasive impact on the public\u2019s health and  welfare. This determination was based on our analysis of the critical  infrastructure sectors and interviews with agency officials and  representatives from the sector coordinating councils. Our findings and  conclusions are based on information gathered from the seven critical  infrastructure sectors and are not generalizable to a larger population.", "To identify cybersecurity guidance for entities within the critical  infrastructure sectors, we identified and analyzed cybersecurity standards  and guidance developed by federal and international standards  development communities; cybersecurity policies and requirements  developed by regulators for their industry; and specific industry standards,  guidance, and practices developed by industry associations or groups.  We interviewed sector coordinating council representatives for the seven  critical infrastructure sectors to determine the cybersecurity standards  used in their specific areas. On the basis of the information gathered, we  developed lists of cybersecurity guidance for each sector. We provided  those lists to representatives from the respective sector coordinating  councils to confirm and update and to verify the applicability of the  identified guidance to entities within their respective sectors.", "To identify the extent to which cybersecurity guidance is enforced within  the selected sectors, we gathered and analyzed related GAO reports,  federal laws, regulations, and regulatory guidance to determine the  various types of enforcement mechanisms that can be employed to  ensure compliance. In addition, we interviewed representatives from  regulatory entities: the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the  Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, the Nuclear  Regulatory Commission, the North American Electric Reliability  Corporation, and the Department of Health and Human Service\u2019s Office  for Civil Rights. We also interviewed representatives from the sector  coordinating councils to identify which critical infrastructure sectors have  mandatory and enforceable cybersecurity guidance. To determine efforts  to identify and promote cybersecurity guidance, we collected and  analyzed related federal law and policy to determine the responsibilities of  the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the other sector-specific  agencies for the seven selected sectors. In addition, we collected and  analyzed the most current approved sector-specific plans, annual reports,  and other related documents for the seven sectors reviewed to determine  the extent of cybersecurity guidance included in the plans. Further, to  determine DHS and sector-specific agency efforts related to cybersecurity  standards, we interviewed sector-specific agency representatives for the  seven critical infrastructure sectors to understand their programs and  efforts in promoting the use of cybersecurity standards, and then  collected and analyzed related supporting evidence.", "To identify areas of commonalities and differences that exist between  sectors\u2019 cybersecurity guidance and guidance applicable to federal  agencies, we selected, analyzed, and used National Institute of  Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-37, Revision  1: Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal  Information Systems, A Security Life Cycle Approach (February 2010),  and NIST Special Publication 800-53, Revision 3: Recommended  Security Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations  (May 2010). On the basis of our analysis of these NIST documents, we  identified key elements of managing cyber risk and 198 recommended  security controls. To select the sector guidance to compare with guidance  applicable to federal agencies, we judgmentally selected three subsectors  from three different regulated sectors: the banking and finance (financial  depositories); nuclear reactors, materials, and waste (reactors); and  energy (bulk power) sectors. For each subsector, sector representatives  identified the respective set of guidance as being widely used by entities  in the sectors to meet cybersecurity-related regulatory requirements. We  compared the sector cybersecurity guidance with NIST\u2019s risk  management elements and recommended security controls. After our  initial comparison, we interviewed relevant representatives from the  regulatory entities and gathered and analyzed supplemental  documentation.", "We conducted this performance audit from October 2010 to December  2011 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.
