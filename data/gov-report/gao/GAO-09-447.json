Unfortunately, a terrorist or other criminal could take advantage of these benefits by fraudulently obtaining a genuine U.S. passport from the Department of State (State). There are many ways that malicious individuals could fraudulently obtain a genuine U.S. passport, including stealing an American citizen's identity and counterfeiting or fraudulently obtaining identification or citizenship documents to meet State requirements. GAO was asked to proactively test the effectiveness of State's passport issuance process to determine whether the process is vulnerable to fraud. To do so, GAO designed four test scenarios that simulated the actions of a malicious individual who had access to an American citizen's personal identity information. GAO created counterfeit documents for four fictitious or deceased individuals using off-the-shelf, commercially available hardware, software, and materials. An undercover GAO investigator then applied for passports at three United States Postal Service (USPS) locations and a State-run passport office."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO's investigation shows that terrorists or criminals could steal an American citizen's identity, use basic counterfeiting skills to create fraudulent documentation for that identity, and obtain a genuine U.S. passport from State. GAO conducted four tests simulating this approach and was successful in obtaining a genuine U.S. passport in each case. In the most egregious case, an undercover GAO investigator obtained a passport using counterfeit documents and the Social Security Number (SSN) of a man who died in 1965. In another case, the investigator obtained a passport using counterfeit documents and the genuine SSN of a fictitious 5-year-old child GAO created for a previous investigation--even though the investigator's counterfeit documents and application indicated he was 53 years old. All four passports were issued to the same GAO investigator, under four different names. In all four tests, GAO used counterfeit and/or fraudulently obtained documents. State and USPS employees did not identify GAO's documents as counterfeit. GAO's investigator later purchased an airline ticket under the name used on one of the four fraudulently obtained U.S. passports, and then used that passport as proof of identity to check in to his flight, get a boarding pass, and pass through the security checkpoint at a major metropolitan-area airport. At a briefing on the results of GAO's investigation, State officials agreed with GAO that the investigation exposes a major vulnerability in State's passport issuance process. According to State officials, State's fraud detection efforts are hampered by limitations to its information sharing and data access with other federal and state agencies. After GAO's briefing, State officials notified GAO that they identified and revoked GAO's four fraudulently obtained U.S. passports, and were studying the matter to determine the appropriate steps for improving State's passport issuance process."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["A U.S. passport not only allows an individual to travel freely in and out of  the United States, but also can be used to obtain further identification  documents, prove U.S. citizenship, and set up bank accounts, among other  things. Because passports issued under a false identity help enable  individuals to conceal their movements and activities, there is great  concern that passport fraud could facilitate acts of terrorism. In fact, the  9/11 Commission stated that \u201cfor terrorists, travel documents are as  important as weapons,\u201d and further noted that terrorists need to travel \u201cto  meet, train, plan, case targets, and gain access to attack.\u201d Further,  passport fraud facilitates other crimes such as illegal immigration, money  laundering, drug trafficking, tax evasion, and alien smuggling.", "Malicious individuals may seek to exploit vulnerabilities in the Department  of State\u2019s (State) current passport issuance process, such as a lack of due  diligence on the part of examiners who screen applications, by using  counterfeit or fraudulently obtained documents as proof of identity and  U.S. citizenship to obtain genuine U.S. passports. For example, between  July 2005 and August 2008, State and the Federal Bureau of Investigation  (FBI) identified 112 individuals who had fraudulently obtained U.S.  passports by using the birth certificates of deceased Americans.  Individuals who fraudulently obtained passports included fugitives, sex  offenders, and delinquent taxpayers, all of whom wanted to use a U.S.  passport to conceal themselves from law enforcement authorities. State  and the FBI identified these 112 individuals by matching State passport  records against state-level death records.", "In 2005, we reported that using the stolen identities and documentation of  U.S. citizens is the primary tactic of those fraudulently applying for U.S.  passports, and that passport fraud is often linked to other crimes. Our  report mentioned a number of ways in which a person might fraudulently  obtain a U.S. passport, including using an assumed identity that is  supported by genuine but fraudulently obtained identification documents;  submitting false claims of lost, stolen, or mutilated passports; using  counterfeit citizenship documents; and using the identity of a deceased  person. We also reported weaknesses in State\u2019s information sharing with  other federal agencies. For example, we stated that the information that  State received and used from the Social Security Administration (SSA)  was limited and outdated. In the report, we stated that although State and  SSA signed a memorandum in April 2004 that gave State access to SSA\u2019s  main database to help verify passport applicants\u2019 identity, the  memorandum had not been implemented as of March 2005. Moreover, we  reported that the memorandum did not include access to SSA\u2019s death  records, but that State officials said they were exploring the possibility of  obtaining these records in the future.", "In 2007 we reported on the risk of fraud that exists in the lack of State\u2019s  oversight of the more than 8,000 passport acceptance facilities nationwide  that it designates to provide passport application services to the American  public. Passport acceptance facilities are located at certain United States  Postal Service (USPS) locations, courthouses, and other institutions, and  do not employ State personnel. The passport acceptance agents at these  facilities are responsible for, among other things, verifying whether an  applicant\u2019s identification document (such as a driver\u2019s license) actually  matches the applicant, and sending each applicant\u2019s proof of citizenship  and passport application to State. Although we found that State had taken  some steps to address weaknesses identified in the training of acceptance  agents, we found that additional measures were needed to ensure  adequate controls over the application acceptance process.", "This report responds to your request that we proactively test the  effectiveness of the current passport issuance process to determine  whether malicious individuals could use counterfeit or fraudulently  obtained documents to obtain a genuine U.S. passport. To perform this  work, we designed four test scenarios that would simulate the actions of a  malicious individual who had access to another person\u2019s identity  information (a practice commonly known as identity theft). We then  attempted to obtain four genuine U.S. passports by using counterfeit or  fraudulently obtained documents, such as birth certificates and drivers\u2019  licenses, and the Social Security Numbers (SSN) of fictitious or deceased  individuals. We created all of these counterfeit documents with off-the- shelf, commercially available hardware, software, and materials. In  addition, we used some of these counterfeit documents to obtain a  genuine District of Columbia (D.C.) identification card, which we  subsequently used to obtain a U.S. passport in one test.", "The fictitious identities we used in our first two tests were based on  information and SSNs we had previously obtained from SSA for the  purpose of conducting undercover tests. These tests were meant to  simulate a malicious individual stealing another person\u2019s identity and  using it to obtain a passport. On our third test, we used the genuine SSN of  a fictitious 5-year-old child we created for a previous investigation to  simulate a malicious individual stealing the identity of a real child to get a  passport. Finally, on our fourth test, we used the SSN of an individual who  died in 1965 to simulate a malicious individual using a deceased person\u2019s  identity to obtain a passport. For three of our four tests, we submitted our  passport applications and supporting materials at USPS locations that  accept passport applications. For one of our four tests, we submitted our  application and materials at State\u2019s regional Washington, D.C., passport- issuing office.", "We conducted the work for this investigation from May 2008 through  March 2009 in accordance with quality standards for investigations as set  forth by the President\u2019s Council on Integrity and Efficiency."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Undercover Investigator Obtained Four Genuine U.S. Passports Using Counterfeit or Fraudulently Obtained Documents", "paragraphs": ["Our investigator was easily able to obtain four genuine U.S. passports  using counterfeit or fraudulently obtained documents.

They agreed  that our findings expose a major vulnerability in State\u2019s passport issuance  process. According to State officials, the department\u2019s ability to verify the  information submitted as part of a passport application is hampered by  limitations to its information sharing and data access with other agencies  at the federal and state levels. They said that some federal agencies limit  State\u2019s access to their records due to privacy concerns or the fact that  State is not a law enforcement agency. In addition, they said that State  does not currently have the ability to conduct real-time verification of the  authenticity of birth certificates presented by passport applicants. They  added that birth certificates present an exceptional challenge to fraud  detection efforts, as there are currently thousands of different acceptable  formats for birth certificates. Further, they indicated that there are  difficulties with verifying the authenticity of drivers\u2019 licenses. Moreover,  they said that although State attempts to verify SSN information submitted  on passport applications on a daily basis with SSA, the results of this data- sharing process are imperfect. For example, State officials said that many  of the mismatches identified through this verification process are actually  due to typos or other common errors. However, they said that while these  data checks may not identify all cases in which an applicant\u2019s data do not  match the information in SSA\u2019s records, in some instances\u2014such as cases  in which an SSN is tied to a deceased individual\u2014investigators from the  Passport Fraud Branch of State\u2019s Bureau of Diplomatic Security will  attempt to check publicly available databases to resolve the mismatch.", "State officials acknowledged that they have issued other fraudulently  obtained passports but did not offer an estimate of the magnitude of the  problem.
