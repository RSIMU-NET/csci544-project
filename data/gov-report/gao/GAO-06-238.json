Although these companies may share consumer information, such as SSNs, with contractors, company officials said that they only share such information with their contractors when it is necessary or unavoidable. Companies in the four business sectors GAO studied primarily relied on accepted industry practices and used the terms of their contracts to protect the personal information shared with contractors. Most company officials stated that their contracts had provisions for auditing and monitoring to assure contract compliance. Some noted that their industry associations have also developed general guidance for their members on sharing personal information with third parties. Federal regulation and oversight of SSN sharing varied across the four industries GAO reviewed, revealing gaps in federal law and agency oversight in the four industries GAO reviewed that share SSNs with contractors. Financial services companies must comply with the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) for safeguarding customers' personal information and regulators have an examination process in place to determine whether banks and securities firms are safeguarding this information. IRS has regulations and guidance in place to restrict the disclosure of SSNs by tax preparers and their contractors, but does not perform periodic reviews of tax preparers' compliance. Because the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) believes that it lacks statutory authority to do so, it has not issued regulations covering SSNs and also does not periodically review telecommunications companies to determine whether they are safeguarding such information."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Today, the Social Security number (SSN) is a vital piece of information  Today, the Social Security number (SSN) is a vital piece of information  needed to function in American society.

Some large financial service  provider officials also told us that in most cases their client only granted  them access to SSNs in those instances where they believed SSNs were  needed, such as when servicing their clients\u2019 accounts or storing data.", "Telecommunication and tax preparation companies we interviewed also  shared SSNs for limited purposes. Telecommunication companies  generally shared SSNs with contractors for services, such as  customer/client contact centers, debt collection, and data storage  functions. For example, officials from one telecommunication company  told us that they shared SSNs and other personally identifiable information  with their contracted customer contact center. The company shared their  customers\u2019 account information, including SSNs, with contact center  employees so that the contracted employees could authenticate, identify,  and service their customers\u2019 accounts.

To verify these claims, we asked each company to provide us with copies  of their standard information security contract provisions and any other  policies and procedures associated with such agreements. Our review of  the standard contract forms and the associated documentation for   10 companies found that they included most of the above safeguard  provisions, but the level of specificity of the safeguard provisions varied  across company contracts. For example, each standard contract form we  reviewed included provisions requiring contractors to establish both  electronic and physical information security safeguards. However, in  many cases, the standard contract form did not require the contractor to  implement a specific type of electronic or physical safeguard, but only  made reference to employing overall administrative, technical, and  physical safeguards to prevent the unauthorized use or disclosure of their  customers\u2019 personal information, such as the SSN. Some company officials  told us that the information security safeguard provisions were  intentionally vague to provide the contractor with flexibility in instituting  such electronic and physical safeguards.

For example, one tax preparation  company\u2019s standard contract provisions stated that the company had the  right to audit or independently evaluate any security processes or controls,  but would only exercise such rights in a manner that limited unnecessary  interference in the contractor\u2019s operations. In addition, most company  standard contract forms required service providers to obtain written  consent from the client company before employing a subcontractor to  conduct any service on the company\u2019s behalf. Some industry sector  officials told us that their standard contract forms contain provisions that  explicitly require subcontractors to comply with the same safeguard  requirements that the original contractor was required to follow.

Also,  the contract language varied on the type of information that would prompt  a notification and the degree to which a contractor should be involved in  rectifying such a breach across industries. For example, officials from one  of the banks we spoke to told us that their company required their  contractors to notify them within 24 hours of any security breach or  suspicious behavior, and they provided their contractors with a 24 hour  telephone hotline. We were also told by most industry officials that any  action taken against the contractor would depend on the extent of the  breach, although in most cases, these companies had established some  form of initial response program to address such breaches. However, we  only found that the financial services companies had included provisions  in their standard contract forms specifically outlining their response  program.", "Finally, we also identified companies that included data-handling and  disposal requirements provisions in their standard contract forms. In these  cases, the companies included general language restricting the use and  disclosure of personal information to only those parties involved in  executing the contracted service.

Officials from two banks told  us that their due diligence practices include administering questionnaires  to ascertain the amount of consumer data needed by the contractor to  perform their duties.

Among other things, this consortium has developed a framework for  developing and managing outsourced relationships.
