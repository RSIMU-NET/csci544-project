The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) reported that all VWP countries have reported passport information through the first agreement, but more than a third of VWP countries are not sharing terrorist identity information through the second agreement and more than a third of the countries have not yet shared criminal history information through the third agreement. While VWP countries may share information through other means, U.S. agency officials told GAO that information sharing through the agreements is essential for national security. In August 2015, DHS decided to require VWP countries to implement agreements to share terrorist identity and criminal history information; previously, VWP countries were required to enter into, but not to implement, these agreements. However, contrary to standard program management practices, DHS did not establish time frames for instituting the amended requirements. In December 2015, Congress passed a law requiring that VWP countries fully implement information-sharing agreements in order to participate in the program. Time frames for working with VWP countries to implement their agreements could help DHS enforce U.S. legal requirements and could strengthen DHS's ability to protect the United States and its citizens.", "GAO's analysis of a nongeneralizeable sample of 12 internal DHS reports, each evaluating one VWP country, found the reports assessed the effects of the countries' participation on U.S. law enforcement, security, and immigration enforcement interests, as required by U.S. law.

U.S. agencies have used information that some VWP  countries have shared under the required agreements or their equivalents  to mitigate this and other threats to U.S. interests. However, because  many VWP countries have not yet provided information through the  agreements\u2014possibly including information about known or suspected  terrorists\u2014agencies\u2019 access to this critical information may be limited.

To identify the information-sharing requirements, we  reviewed relevant U.S. law and DHS policy.

We also visited four VWP countries:  Belgium, Greece, France, and Spain. We selected these countries from  among the 38 VWP countries on the basis of numerous factors\u2014in  particular, high estimated total and per capita numbers of foreign fighters  and concerns about border security and counterterrorism capacity.

Although we discussed the DHS and INTERPOL data  with DHS and DOJ officials, we did not interview officials of all VWP  countries that report through INTERPOL. DOJ officials described their  uses and checks of the data they received.
