The excess capacity problem has been exacerbated in recent years by reductions in military force structure and related weapon system procurement; changes in military operational requirements due to the end of the Cold War; and the increased reliability, maintainability, and durability of military systems. We recently determined that excess capacity in the DOD depot maintenance system is about 40 percent for fiscal year 1996. Additionally, the private sector, which has seen its production workload for new systems and equipment decline and has significant excess production capacity, is seeking an increased share of the depot maintenance workload.", "The BRAC process of closing or realigning depots and transferring their workloads either to remaining depots or to the private sector has, in the past decade, been the most effective way of addressing DOD\u2019s problem of excess capacity. During the 1995 BRAC process, one of DOD\u2019s recommendations was to close the Louisville depot and transfer its workload to other Navy facilities\u2014primarily the naval gun workload to the Norfolk Naval Shipyard, Virginia; the Phalanx workload to the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane, Indiana; and the engineering support functions to the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Port Hueneme, California. \u201ctransfer(ing) workload, equipment, and facilities to the private sector or local jurisdiction as appropriate if the private sector can accommodate the workload on site; or relocate necessary functions along with necessary personnel, equipment, and support to other naval technical activities, primarily the Naval Shipyard, Norfolk, Virginia; Naval Surface Warfare Center, Hueneme, California; and the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane, Indiana.\u201d", "The Louisville Detachment of the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division, is located on a 142-acre site within the city limits of Louisville, Kentucky. The Louisville depot is responsible for providing engineering and technical support as well as overhaul and remanufacturing capability for naval surface ship gun and missile systems, including the 5-inch Mark 45 and Mark 75 guns, missile launchers, gun computer and fire control systems, torpedo tubes, and the Navy\u2019s anti-missile Phalanx Close-In-Weapon System. Louisville has nine major production buildings with approximately 1.4 million square feet of plant space. The facility provides a wide range of mechanical capability, including weapon system disassembly and assembly, gun manufacturing, machining, component fabrication, welding, metal plating, and surface finishing. The depot has 3.8 million direct labor hours of maximum potential capacity to perform 1.3 million hours of work, leaving the facility with 2.5 million hours of excess capacity and only 34 percent utilization. At the time of the BRAC decision, the depot employed approximately 1,600 civilian personnel.", "The Navy is planning to privatize the workload in place in the Louisville facility. On June 13, 1996, the Secretary of the Navy notified Congress that, under the Competition in Contracting Act, the Navy intended to award contracts restricting competition in the public interest to the two defense contractors selected by the local redevelopment authority. The Navy awarded contracts to Hughes Missile Systems Company and United Defense Limited Partnership on July 19, 1996."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Navy Plans Do Not Reduce Excess Capacity in the Public or Private Sector", "paragraphs": ["Because the Navy plans to privatize the Louisville depot\u2019s current workload in place, neither excess capacity nor associated maintenance costs will be reduced at other DOD depots or the private sector. The 1994 Defense Science Board Task Force on Depot Maintenance Management, which included representatives from the public and private sectors, stated that divestiture of excess infrastructure is a key element of reducing overall depot maintenance costs. Private industry representatives pointed out that through consolidations, mergers, and closures, the defense industry has attempted to address its significant excess capacity problem and DOD needs to do the same. Privatizing-in-place transfers excess capacity to the private sector but does not eliminate it. DOD pays for this excess capacity, whether it is in the public or the private sector.", "DOD has had little success eliminating underused industrial facilities except through the BRAC process. In making its recommendations to the BRAC Commission on the Louisville closure, the Navy proposed transferring 402,500 direct labor hours to the Norfolk Naval Shipyard and about 925,750 and 187,250 direct labor hours to the Crane and Port Hueneme locations, respectively, of the Naval Surface Warfare Center. Based on an evaluation of maximum potential capacity and programmed workload for fiscal year 1996, naval shipyards had 35-percent excess capacity, representing 18.5 million direct labor hours. The Norfolk Naval Shipyard has 34-percent excess capacity, representing about 5.4 million direct labor hours, and Crane has 69-percent excess capacity, representing about 1.7 million direct labor hours. The Navy has started to privatize these workloads in place at Louisville. Consequently, an opportunity to reduce excess capacity at the other Navy industrial activities is missed.", "In developing its privatization-in-place plans, the Navy did not consider consolidating the Louisville workloads with comparable workloads in contractor facilities. United Defense Limited Partnership and Hughes Missile Systems Company, which will operate the Louisville site, also have extensive excess capacity in their own facilities.

First, the Commission on Roles and Missions concluded that privatizing depot maintenance activities could lower DOD depot maintenance costs by 20 percent. Second, although Navy officials said they would not complete their cost analysis until the day before they expect to award contracts for the Louisville workloads, their preliminary analysis indicates that privatization is less expensive.

The Commission\u2019s assumption was based primarily on reported savings from public-private competitions for commercial activities under Office of Management and Budget Circular A-76. Unlike depot maintenance activities, which require large investments in capital equipment, technical data, and highly trained and skilled personnel, these commercial activities involved simple, routine, and repetitive tasks. Also, public activities won about half of these competitions. The A-76 competitions generally had many competitors\u2014unlike depot maintenance where most contracts are awarded without competition. Further, reports by us and defense audit groups indicate that projected savings from the A-76 competitions were often not fully achieved. Lastly, there was no competition between Hughes and United Defense and other contractors for the Louisville workloads.", "In its June 13, 1996, letter to Congress, the Navy stated its awards are in the public interest since the Louisville redevelopment authority had already competitively selected the two contractors. However, our review does not support the Navy\u2019s position that a competition occurred. In June 1995, prior to the completion of the BRAC process, the city of Louisville entered into an agreement with Hughes and United Defense to operate the Louisville depot maintenance facility in the event of a BRAC decision. On July 1, 1995, the BRAC Commission forwarded its closure and realignment recommendations to the President, who forwarded the report to Congress on July 13, 1995. Congress completed its review and accepted the Commission\u2019s recommendations in September 1995.", "In a December 1, 1995, letter, the Navy asked the Louisville redevelopment authority to reaffirm that it was finalizing its agreements with Hughes and United Defense. In February 1996, another contractor submitted an unsolicited business concept offering to the city of Louisville for the management and operation of the Louisville facility. In a February 24, 1996, letter to the local redevelopment authority, the Navy expressed concern that the community might open its selection process to competition. The Navy letter stated that the \u201cintroduction of a competitor in Louisville will complicate the interface between the  depot and the original equipment manufacturers.\u201d On March 5, 1996, the Navy wrote the redevelopment authority urging it to make its decision no later than March 7, 1996.

However, they expected to complete their final analysis prior to contract award, which was expected on July 15, 1996. Under the first option, which the Navy indicated in its June 13, 1996, congressional notification letter, the Navy planned to award contracts for the Louisville workloads, assuming it determines that privatization is the more cost-effective alternative. The second option was to transfer workloads to Navy facilities the 1995 BRAC process identified as candidates to receive the Louisville workload. Navy officials expected the first option to be more cost-effective based on a preliminary comparison of the estimated one-time transition costs and their assumption that a contractor will have lower recurring costs.", "However, the data used in this comparison were inaccurate and incomplete.", "In June 1995, the Navy estimated that transferring the workload to other naval facilities would cost about $302 million. In March 1996, the Navy estimated that it would cost $132 million, or $170 million less, to privatize-in-place and retain a small Navy engineering support activity at Louisville.

For example:", "The average cost factor used for permanent change-of-station moves was higher for the transfer option than the privatization-in-place option. Under the March 1996 privatization option cost estimate, the Navy estimated it would cost an average of $26,400 to move each of the 409 employees projected to take government jobs, which was about $3,000 lower than the figure developed by the Navy for the BRAC 1995 process. In contrast, the June 1995 estimate for transferring the workload included an average cost of $48,145 to move 819 employees. The two estimates have a difference of $21,745 per person. We could find no reason why the Navy used higher costs for the depot transfer option. However, assuming that $26,400 is the accurate cost factor, the transfer option is overstated by about $17 million.", "The overstatement of the permanent change-of-station costs also overstated the estimate for DOD\u2019s relocation income tax allowance program. The program, which compensates individuals for federal income taxes incurred on permanent change-of-station payments, is based on a percentage of the payments received. The Navy\u2019s estimate overstated the program\u2019s cost estimate by $2.4 million.", "The workload transfer cost estimate included $36 million to overhaul larger numbers of spares than normally required to satisfy demands. This was included because the Navy believed extra stock would be needed as a cushion during the transition period. However, normal customer sales would generate about $32 million; therefore, this figure should not have been included in the transfer option. The appropriate cost estimate was an additional $4 million that will not be recovered through customer sales.", "The workload transfer cost estimate included $37.6 million for military construction at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard. During its fiscal year 1997 budget review, the Navy later determined this estimate was overstated by $11.2 million.", "The workload transfer estimate included about $2.2 million for DOD\u2019s homeowners assistance program, under which DOD offers to buy an employee\u2019s house if it cannot be sold and provides compensation for some property value losses. According to Navy officials, since this program will not be available for Louisville depot employees, their initial cost estimate should not have included this cost for the transfer option.", "The one-time cost estimate of $302 million for transferring the Louisville workload is overstated by about $66 million, as summarized in table 1. We attempted to analyze other cost factors used in the depot transfer option and noted other costs were potentially overstated, such as those for the employee assistance program and equipment shipment and reinstallation. However, we have not yet developed a more realistic cost for these factors. Nonetheless, because the Navy used preliminary estimates developed for budget purposes, further evaluation is needed.", "In March 1996, the Navy estimated it would cost $132 million to privatize the Louisville depot in place, but this estimate appears to be understated. Based on our preliminary analysis, understated costs include (1) consolidation of equipment to reduce the facility\u2019s size and more efficiently use capacity, (2) incentives paid to contractors for hiring displaced Navy employees, and (3) separation incentives. On July 15, 1996, when we provided a draft of this report to DOD for comment, the Navy was revising its estimates for the costs of privatization-in-place. Subsequently, in a July 19,1996, letter to the House Committee on National Security and the Senate Committee on Armed Services, the Navy reported that its updated cost analysis showed that privatizing the Louisville workload rather than transferring it to other Navy depots should save $60 million\u2014a reduction of about $110 million in savings from its earlier estimate.

At that time, they noted that, although they may consider this factor in their final cost analysis, no decision had yet been made to do so. We estimated the potential savings if the Louisville workloads were consolidated at other Navy facilities by (1) using labor rate data from the three potential receiving locations and (2) revising it to reflect the overhead costs that would be reduced by spreading fixed overhead costs over a larger workload base. Using hour and rate information from contractor proposals, we also calculated the estimated annual costs for the privatization option. Based on these estimates, we projected that the Navy could achieve recurring annual savings of about $47.8 million through workload transfers to the Navy activities originally identified to receive these workloads.", "Our calculations are based primarily on lower rates for workloads currently at Norfolk and Crane, which occurred by increasing the use of these facilities. This projection does not include the $31 million the Commission estimated would be saved by eliminating personnel and operating costs at Louisville. Combining these savings with the $47.8 million resulting from transferring workloads results in an annual savings of about $78.8 million. Therefore, even with one-time transfer costs of $236 million (see table 1), the Navy could recoup the transition costs within 3 years and begin to save $394 million over 5 years.

The Navy did not incorporate these agreements into its contract solicitations. It opted for cost-type contracts. Further, the contractors might also have trouble attracting commercial workload to the Louisville facility, particularly in light of the age and condition of the equipment and facilities.

In an April 1996 report to Congress on depot maintenance policy, DOD required the military services to conduct a risk assessment before privatizing mission-essential workloads. DOD officials stated that qualitative factors have been established for conducting a risk assessment and that privatization is determined to be an acceptable risk when an adequate number of private sector sources exist, and those sources are economical, possess the capability and capacity to do the work, and have demonstrated proven past performance.

In its July 19,1996, letter to the House Committee on National Security and the Senate Committee on Armed Services, the Navy asserted that its plan is consistent with 10 U.S.C. 2469 because (1) 10 U.S.C. 2469 does not generally apply to actions implementing a BRAC recommendation and (2) it already complied with this requirement in its cost analysis.", "We have found nothing in the Closure Act or in its legislative history that would support the Navy\u2019s view that it may implement a BRAC recommendation involving privatization without complying with 10 U.S.C. 2469.
