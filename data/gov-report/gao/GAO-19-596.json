According to agency officials and former public trustees GAO interviewed, factors that may account for delays include late-breaking changes to assumptions or data, and difficulty scheduling the boards' meetings. Additionally, contrary to GAO's guide on best practices for project schedules, officials have not taken steps to update the report-development schedules to reflect actual progress, maintained a formally documented baseline schedule to incorporate lessons learned from prior years, or notified Congress of their progress. Without taking steps to improve report-development schedule management, these trust fund reports will likely continue to be untimely, missing the April 1 statutory deadline.

The remaining two  trustees are members of the public, nominated by the President,  confirmed by the Senate, and the public trustees must not be from the  same political party as one another. The public trustee positions were  established in 1983; they have been vacant since 2015.", "The boards issue two separate Trustees reports each year, one on the  Social Security trust funds and one on the Medicare trust funds. Under  the Social Security Act, these reports are due by April 1 of each year. The  Trustees reports provide information on the present and projected  statuses of the trust funds, including their projected balances over the  next 10 years (short-term), the next 75 years (long-term), and the  assumptions and methods used to make these projections. The reports  provide estimates of the projected costs and incomes of the trust funds,  and any dates that the boards project the trust funds\u2019 reserves to become  depleted, among other information about the programs. Because  projections are inherently uncertain, the reports include three projection  scenarios: intermediate, low-cost, and high-cost alternatives, along with  other information about uncertainty. The intermediate scenario is based  on assumptions that reflect the boards\u2019 best estimate of future  experience. The low-cost scenario makes assumptions that are relatively  more favorable with respect to the projected statuses of the trust funds,  while the high-cost scenario does the opposite. For example, the low-cost  scenario assumes more workers will pay into the trust funds and fewer  beneficiaries will receive benefits, while the high-cost scenario assumes  fewer workers and more beneficiaries."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Officials and Trustees Follow a Collaborative Process Each Year to Develop the Trustees Reports", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Agency Officials and Trustees Determine the Economic, Demographic, and Programmatic Assumptions Prior to Drafting the Trustees Reports", "paragraphs": ["Officials in the Social Security Administration Office of the Chief Actuary  (SSA OCACT) and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Office  of the Actuary (CMS OACT) work with other agency officials and trustees  to develop assumptions and draft and revise the Trustees reports in an  annual cycle, according to agency officials and the board meeting  minutes and report development schedules we reviewed (see fig. 1). At  the end of each cycle, the boards have established a working group that  is largely responsible for overseeing the day-to-day development of the  next year\u2019s report. This working group consists of officials in the four  agencies that are led by the ex officio trustees (Treasury, DOL, HHS, and  SSA), officials from SSA OCACT and CMS OACT, and the public  trustees, when confirmed. All of the working group\u2019s discussions and  agreements are subject to the approval of the boards. The Secretary of  the Treasury serves as the Managing Trustee and Chairperson of the  boards. Treasury staff has historically coordinated the report  development process, including organizing the development schedule  and hosting the working group and boards\u2019 meetings. The reports are  drafted by SSA and CMS.", "SSA OCACT and CMS OACT officials we interviewed said they work to  update the assumptions\u2014both long-term and short-term\u2014they propose  as the basis for the trust fund projections in the reports. Assumptions are  the demographic, economic, and program-specific factors that the  actuaries use to model the future financial status of the trust funds (see  appendix I). For each assumption, SSA OCACT and CMS OACT go  through a process of updating the values for the 75-year projection period  as needed and use those updated values as inputs in their models to  project future costs and income for the trust funds. As a part of this  process, the working group discusses issues that inform the assumptions  proposed by SSA OCACT and CMS OACT.", "The work on assumptions is divided according to the specializations and  expertise of the two actuarial offices, and is developed by staff from a  range of disciplines, including actuaries, demographers, and economists.  SSA OCACT develops the demographic and economic assumptions that  are common to both reports, including rates for fertility, mortality, and  growth in gross domestic product. SSA OCACT also prepares the  programmatic assumptions for Social Security, such as the numbers of  retirement and disability beneficiaries and the anticipated income into the  trust funds from payroll taxes. CMS OACT prepares the programmatic  assumptions that are specific to Medicare, such as the number of  Medicare beneficiaries and expected growth in health care costs.", "SSA OCACT and CMS OACT officials update assumptions and revise  their methodologies based on recent data, if a change is warranted. For  example, the 2017 Social Security Trustees report projected an increase  in the total fertility rate. Information collected in the subsequent year  showed that fertility rates had not risen as expected, so officials reduced  the fertility rate assumptions for the 2018 report. SSA OCACT officials  told us that they look at both the reasonableness of the assumptions  individually and in the aggregate, as some assumptions interrelate.  According to agency officials we interviewed, the assumptions generally  undergo gradual or no changes from year to year, unless there are  significant policy changes. SSA OCACT and CMS OACT also update  their models by incorporating more recent data into them. For example, in  the 2017 Social Security Trustees report, the model for projecting  average age benefit levels of retired worker and disabled worker  beneficiaries who are newly entitled to benefits used a sample of these  beneficiaries from 2013. In the 2018 report, this model was updated to  use a sample from 2015."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Working Group Discusses and Works Toward Consensus on Assumptions", "paragraphs": ["The working group considers and works towards consensus on the  assumptions proposed by SSA OCACT and CMS OACT. Members of the  working group meet periodically to discuss the assumptions and come to  an agreement on the values for them. In these meetings, the working  group often hears presentations from internal or external experts on  specific topics. For example, in one meeting, SSA staff led a presentation  and discussion on Disability Insurance, and DOL staff led a presentation  and discussion on how globalization might affect long-term economic  trends. To inform their discussions, the working group may also review  reports from technical panels or invite panel members to discuss their  findings and recommendations at a working group meeting. For  example, in September 2012, the working group discussed a Medicare  technical panel recommendation that the board continue to present  alternative projections in which average Medicare spending per  beneficiary rises faster than the current law baseline; the working group  and board agreed to implement this recommendation. Throughout the  working group\u2019s activities, the members representing the ex officio  trustees generally serve as a liaison between the trustee for their agency  and the working group. When confirmed, public trustees participate  directly on the working group.", "After consideration, the working group finalizes long-term assumptions at  a fall board meeting. The long-term assumptions serve as the basis for  the short-term assumptions and the 75-year trust fund projections. For  each long-term assumption, the boards set the \u201cultimate value\u201d, i.e. the  constant rate or number that is projected to be met in a particular year  (within 10 years in most cases) and then continued through the remainder  of the 75-year projection period. For example, for the 2019 Trustees  reports, the boards set the ultimate value for the annual change in  covered earnings as a percent of total labor compensation for each year  beginning in 2028 and continuing through 2093. In most cases, according  to agency officials we interviewed, the working group achieves consensus  on the assumptions before the fall board meeting. However, when the  working group is unable to reach consensus, the boards settle any  outstanding issues and tend to either make no changes or incremental  changes over time to avoid major swings in year-to-year projections,  according to some agency officials we interviewed.", "Once the long-term ultimate values are set by the boards, the working  group then discusses the short-term assumptions that bridge the gap  between current data and the ultimate values. The working group first  considers and works toward agreement on the short-term economic  assumptions and then the health assumptions. Short-term economic  assumptions can vary during the early years of the projection period.

To become  members of the board, public trustees must be nominated by the  President and confirmed by the Senate, and the public trustee cannot  both be from the same political party. Those we interviewed stressed the  importance of not allowing personal and political opinions to influence  their work on the Trustees reports.

Former public trustees stated that they worked  closely with their counterpart public trustee to coordinate their comments  and input to the working group.", "Historically, public trustees sometimes questioned or encouraged  changes to some assumptions used in the reports, according to former  public trustees and some agency officials. When in place, public trustees  regularly attend working group meetings, whereas ex officio trustees do  not. According to the former public trustees we interviewed, they saw part  of their role as facilitating conversations as leaders and moving the group  towards consensus on assumptions. Additionally, former public trustees  and some agency officials said trustees are more hesitant to change the  assumptions in the reports when there are no public trustees in place, out  of concern that any change could be viewed as politically motivated. For  example, in 2017 the boards discussed whether or not to change the  long-range real interest rate assumption from the rate used in the  previous year\u2019s Trustees reports. The boards decided to keep the  assumptions unchanged, in part because there were no public trustees in  place.", "When they are in place, public trustees can also help communicate the  message of the Trustees reports to policy makers and the public. As an  example, the Trustees reports can be technical and difficult to  understand; to address this, the public trustees introduced a summary of  the reports in 1991, which presented the reports\u2019 findings in a way that is  more accessible to the general public. Former public trustees said they  were able to inform policy makers on the contents of the reports through  congressional testimony and direct conversations with congressional  staff. One former public trustee reported that he was a resource for the  media, spending hours on the phone providing his perspective and  explaining the reports\u2019 implications for policy decisions.

Since 2009, the boards  have issued the reports at least 2 months late six times; they only issued  the reports this late one time in the 14 years from 1995 to 2008.", "Agency officials and former public trustees provided a number of reasons  why the Trustees reports have been late in recent years. Agency officials  and former public trustees said they may delay reports in order to include  the impact of late-breaking legislation or policy changes on the  assumptions or data. SSA OCACT told us that this decision is based on  (1) if the policy change results in substantial changes to assumptions and  (2) if the policy change affects a policy that is directly governing a trust  fund. For example, agency officials and former public trustees stated that  the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), enacted on  March 23, 2010, significantly contributed to the 2010 reports being issued  August 5, 2010, over 4 months past the deadline. PPACA significantly  affected many of the factors that were the basis for the Medicare Trustees  report projections, such as reducing projected Medicare expenditures  through various policy changes, including a change to the payment  formula for the Medicare Advantage program\u2014the private health plan  alternative to traditional Medicare. According to one former public trustee,  if the boards had issued a report that did not reflect the changes made by  PPACA, it would not have been applicable to the current outlook of the  Medicare trust funds and therefore not as useful to Congress and the  public.", "Agency officials have also reported that there have been instances of  waiting for more complete or recent data sets to become available before  calculating the actuaries\u2019 projections. According to CMS officials, a  tradeoff exists between updating data and meeting the deadline. For  example, Treasury officials told us that because the working group  decided that CMS OACT should not wait for January 2019 Medicare  Advantage enrollment data, the 2019 Trustees reports were issued earlier  (April 22) than they would have been if they had waited for the complete  end of year data, as they had in previous years.", "Agency officials and public trustees also cited difficulties in scheduling the  spring board meetings as a factor that contributed to delays in issuing the  Trustees reports. The boards\u2019 bylaws require the annual reports to be  adopted by a majority of the trustees who are present and voting.  However, sometimes Treasury staff experienced difficulty scheduling the  meeting. According to Treasury officials responsible for scheduling the  meeting, they generally wait until the first drafts of the Trustees reports  are completed before they schedule the spring board meeting to avoid  having to reschedule the meeting if the draft reports are provided after the  working group\u2019s internal deadline. For the last 15 years (2005-2019),  report development schedules from SSA OCACT indicated that the draft  reports were provided to the working group after the internal deadline 12  times. In the other 3 years, the report development schedules did not  show the actual date that the draft reports were provided. As a result of  scheduling the meeting later in the process, Treasury staff has sometimes  not been able schedule a meeting that all of the Trustees can attend prior  to the statutory deadline of April 1.", "Other challenges that contribute to delays include government shutdowns  and staff having conflicting concurrent responsibilities, according to some  agency officials or former public trustees. When the government shut  down for 11 business days in October 2013, the board meeting minutes  show that it affected the timelines for the 2014 Trustees reports.  However, according to HHS, government shutdowns have never  materially delayed the release dates for the Trustees reports.

As a result, agency officials and former  public trustees involved with developing the reports in recent years said  they developed a schedule designed to meet the deadline knowing it  would most likely not be met. Several agency officials and former public  trustees described the schedule as \u201cambitious\u201d and difficult to achieve. If  the schedule is unrealistic from the start of the process, and if involved  parties view it as an unlikely goal, rather than the expected outcome, then  the schedule does not serve as a useful tool for managing the timely  development of the Trustees reports.", "In addition to designing an unrealistic Trustees reports schedule, agency  officials did not always document actual progress in meeting scheduled  dates or modify the schedule in a way that would allow them to overcome  early setbacks. Treasury officials, who organize the schedule for  developing the Trustees reports, stated that the initial proposed schedule  is updated only once during the report process, after the first drafts of the  reports are completed. According to best practices, the schedule should  be updated regularly with actual progress and remaining work. Without  doing so, it could be difficult to respond to actual events while still meeting  set deadlines.", "Treasury has not regularly archived the final version of the schedule with  the dates that milestones were actually met. According to best practices,  the final iteration of the schedule that was actually followed should be  archived and used to inform and improve future schedules. Treasury  officials were able to provide us with the archived, updated schedules for  only 6 of the last 25 years, and these schedules were incomplete. While  these updated schedules showed the actual dates that the draft reports  were provided and the planned dates for later milestones, they did not  include the dates for milestones before the draft reports were provided or  the actual dates for the later milestones, including the reports\u2019 issuance  dates.", "Further, although the boards have regularly missed the statutory  deadline, the initial report-development schedules have not significantly  changed in recent years. Based on the proposed schedules for the  Trustees reports that are presented in the spring board meeting minutes  we reviewed, the initial schedules for each milestone in the report  development process, such as obtaining agreement on assumptions or  circulating drafts, has not significantly changed in the last 6 years,  although the schedules have consistently proven difficult to meet (see  table 1). Without recording the actual report production schedule that was  followed, participating officials do not have the historical data that would  assist them in making meaningful and effective changes to future  schedules.", "Finally, according to best practices, it is important that stakeholders,  including decision makers, have access to information on the progress of  the project. Agency officials and former public trustees stated that they  do not have a policy or practice of informing Congress of delays or  changes to the schedules for the Trustees reports, even in years when  the board issues the reports months after the deadline. Given this,  Congress, the recipient of the Trustees reports, remains uninformed of  the reports\u2019 release date or the factors contributing to a delay in any given  year. This uncertainty may hinder Congress from planning legislative  sessions in advance that would use the findings of the Trustees reports.
