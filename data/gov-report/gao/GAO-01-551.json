The Act also stipulated that SBA would ensure small businesses a fair proportion of government contracts. The Business Opportunity Development Reform Act of 1988 amended the Small Business Act to require the President to establish an annual government-wide goal of awarding not less than 20 percent of prime contract dollars to small businesses. The Small Business Reauthorization Act of 1997 further amended the Small Business Act to increase this goal to not less than 23 percent. SBA is responsible for coordinating with executive branch agencies to ensure that the federal government meets the mandated goal. Of the federal agencies with procurement authority, 20 agencies accounted for over 99 percent of total government contract dollars in fiscal year 2000. These 20 agencies and their fiscal year 2000 procurement dollars, as reported to FPDC, are listed in appendix IV.", "FPDC collects data on prime contract actions from over 50 executive branch agencies.

SBA adopted this change in strategy to ensure that the 23-percent goal was established, and that it was done in a timely manner. The government had difficulty establishing the 23-percent goal in fiscal year 2000.  In addition, only 22.26 percent of procurement dollars were actually awarded to small businesses. The difficulties were primarily because the Department of Energy was directed to change its method of calculating prime contract small business awards. While SBA\u2019s direct assignment of goals was intended to meet the statutory goal-setting requirement, SBA has not documented the criteria it used to derive the assigned goals.  Furthermore, the direct assignment of goals has reduced the consultation and negotiation process envisioned by Congress. Some agency officials noted that they did not have the opportunity to negotiate fiscal year 2001 goals.", "Federal agencies\u2019 initial goal submissions to SBA for fiscal year 2000 totaled only 20.4 percent in the aggregate, falling short of the mandated 23-percent government-wide goal. SBA\u2019s requests to agencies to increase their goals resulted in a government-wide goal of only 21.2 percent. In February 2000, SBA decided to assign goals directly to the 20 agencies that account for over 99 percent of procurement dollars so that the 23-percentgoal could be met. At the same time, in a conference call between SBA and the agencies, SBA assigned fiscal year 2001 goals that were identical to the 2000 goals."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Department of Energy Was Directed to Change Its Method of Calculating Small Business Achievements", "paragraphs": ["In a memorandum to the agencies, the SBA Associate Deputy Administrator cited a significant change in the way the Department of Energy calculates its small business achievements as a key reason for the difficulties in setting the fiscal year 2000 goal and a primary justification for SBA\u2019s decision to unilaterally assign goals.  As shown in appendix IV, the Department of Energy is second only to the Department of Defense in the procurement dollars it reports. Based on a 1991 letter from the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s Office of Federal Procurement Policy, the Department of Energy had been counting contracts awarded by its management and operating contractors as prime contracts rather than subcontracts.  Specifically, the letter stated that \u201ca strong case can be made for management and operating contractors to be treated, for the purposes of small business goaling, as Government prime contracts.\u201d The ruling noted that procurements made by management and operating contractors are for the direct benefit of the federal government and that these contractors are required to follow Department of Energy procurement rules and policies that are similar to those government agencies must use in awarding contracts.", "Using this methodology, the Department of Energy awarded about 18 percent of its prime contracts to small businesses in fiscal year 1998 and about 17 percent in 1999, according to FPDC reports. However, in the opinion of SBA officials, awards made by the Department\u2019s management and operating contractors are actually subcontracts, not prime contracts. Nevertheless, the Department of Energy continued to support its practice of counting them as prime contracts. In 1999, SBA and the Department of Energy asked the Office of Federal Procurement Policy to resolve this disagreement.", "In November 1999, the Office of Federal Procurement Policy reversed its earlier position and, supporting SBA\u2019s position, determined that the contracts awarded by the Department\u2019s management and operating contractors should be counted as subcontracts. The Administrator, Office of Federal Procurement Policy, stated in the decision that federal agencies should be consistent in the types of awards counted as prime contracts. As a result of the change in methodology, the Department of Energy\u2019s reported prime contract actions to small businesses fell sharply. In fiscal year 2000, the Department\u2019s prime contract goal dropped to 5 percent from its 18-percent goal in fiscal year 1999. This reduction in the Department of Energy\u2019s small business goal affected the government\u2019s overall ability to establish the 23-percent goal."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "SBA Cites Improved Timeliness as Benefit of Assigned Goals", "paragraphs": ["According to SBA officials, the direct assignment of goals\u2014as was done in fiscal years 2000 and 2001\u2014has not only ensured that the mandated 23-percent goal will be established, but it has also ensured that goals will be established in a timely manner. Guidance issued by the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s Office of Federal Procurement Policy stipulates that small business prime contract goals are to be established by the start of the fiscal year.  However, both SBA and the agencies have been delinquent in setting goals in a timely manner.  For example, in fiscal years 1998, 1999, and to a lesser extent in fiscal year 2000, many agency goals were established after the start of the fiscal year. However, we found no link between the timeliness of goal-setting and actual awards to small businesses.", "According to SBA records, all 20 large agencies submitted goals after the start of fiscal year 1999. One reason for the delay was that SBA\u2019s letter requesting goals from individual agencies was not distributed until more than 2 weeks after the fiscal year began. In addition, SBA\u2019s deadline for agencies to submit their 1998 and 1999 goals was 1 to 2 months after the start of the fiscal year. SBA officials explained that designating a grace period enabled agencies to evaluate the prior year\u2019s performance and develop strategies for improvement. The officials acknowledged, however, that the period was not used for this purpose because FPDC does not issue preliminary prior-year results until the second quarter of the following fiscal year.", "Despite SBA\u2019s lenient deadlines, most agencies did not submit their goals on time. For example, in fiscal year 1999 only one agency\u2014the Department of Defense\u2014met SBA\u2019s deadline of November 1, 1998. Three agencies submitted goals in the second quarter, three submitted goals in the third quarter, and one submitted its goal in the fourth quarter. Some small agencies did not establish any goals at all. Timeliness improved in fiscal year 2000, when 11 agencies met SBA\u2019s deadline. Once again, some small agencies did not submit goals at all.", "When the large agencies were late in submitting goals, SBA followed up with letters. However, SBA conducted little if any follow-up with the small agencies because they represent a very small fraction of federal procurement dollars. Timeliness of goal submissions was not a problem in fiscal year 2001, because SBA assigned the goals directly.", "We did not find a link between timeliness of goal-setting and actual small business achievements. For example, the Department of Commerce, which submitted its fiscal year 1999 goal 4 months after SBA\u2019s deadline, exceeded its goal of 35 percent, awarding 40.83 percent of its prime contract actions to small businesses. On the other hand, the Department of Agriculture, which missed SBA\u2019s deadline by only 2 days, did not achieve its goal of 45.1 percent, awarding small businesses only 37.96 percent of its prime contract actions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "SBA\u2019s Approach for Assigning Goals Is Not Documented or Shared With Agencies", "paragraphs": ["The approach and criteria SBA used to derive individual agency goals in fiscal years 2000 and 2001 have not been formalized or shared with the procurement agencies.

SBA then published an annual report summarizing each agency\u2019s achievements. SBA officials said that in some cases they were not aware of all exclusions the agencies made when reporting their numbers. In 1998, the reporting process changed, with FPDC reporting small business achievements based on information received from the agencies. With this change, some of the exclusions were no longer made. An example of this change is a contract between NASA and the California Institute of Technology to operate the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a federally funded research and development center. SBA and NASA had agreed that this contract would be excluded from NASA\u2019s small business reports to SBA, because small businesses would have little chance to compete for it. Since 1998, however, when the reporting method changed and FPDC began to report small business goals, the contract has been included in NASA\u2019s business achievement results.", "We found that one exclusion, made on the basis that small businesses would have a limited chance to compete, has not been applied consistently across the government. In 1998, SBA granted an exclusion to the Federal Highway Administration for its anticipated congressionally-directed contract actions, based on the premise that small businesses would have a limited chance to compete for these contracts. However, this exclusion has not been used, nor has such an exclusion been granted to any other government agency.  In addition, while SBA excludes the United States Mint\u2019s contract actions on the basis that it is a non-appropriated activity, an additional reason to exclude these actions is the Mint\u2019s legislated exemption from federal procurement regulations.", "Table 2 shows the types of contracts that are excluded from the small business achievement calculations and SBA\u2019s explanation of its rationale for the exclusions."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Federal Highway Administration Exclusion Has Not Been Used", "paragraphs": ["According to officials at the Department of Transportation and FPDC, the Department of Transportation\u2019s Senior Procurement Executive requested in 1998 that FPDC exclude from the small business baseline those contract actions that Congress had encouraged the Federal Highway Administration to award to certain sources, primarily universities and research centers. SBA agreed, based on the rationale that small businesses would have no chance to compete for these contracts; and in 1998 FPDC implemented the exclusion. The Federal Highway Administration is the only government agency with this type of exclusion.", "In practice, however, according to Department of Transportation officials, the Federal Highway Administration has awarded no contract actions to the sources cited by Congress. Rather, these awards are made in the form of assistance agreements (grants or cooperative agreements), which are not reported to FPDC, in accordance with FPDC\u2019s guidelines.

The guidance is the only source of information available to Congress, the small business community, and federal agencies on the contracts excluded from the small business achievement calculations. However, the guidance presents an unclear picture of the contract exclusions. Examples of weaknesses in the guidance are:   FPDC instructs federal agencies not to report contracts that use predominantly non-appropriated funds and contracts from agencies that are not subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulation, such as the Federal Aviation Administration. However, when listing the exclusions, SBA\u2019s guidance does not distinguish between these types of contracts--that are never included in the FPDC database--and contracts that SBA explicitly directed FPDC to exclude for purposes of calculating small business achievements (e.g., the Federal Highway Administration exclusion).

SBA officials said that this exclusion pertains to transactions between federal agencies. For example, the military services purchase spare parts from the Defense Logistics Agency, which is a mandatory source. However, these transactions are not contract actions. Rather, they are simply intra-governmental transfers of funds and, as such, are not reported to FPDC. Thus, no exclusions are made in practice for the wholesale supply source category.

The exception is contract actions reported by certain Department of State embassies, which are specifically identified in FPDC\u2019s programming logic and automatically excluded from the small business achievements. SBA officials explained that, except for these embassies, FPDC does not currently have a mechanism for capturing the location of the contract award.
