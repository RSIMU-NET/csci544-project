Both methodologies evaluate a sample of health care claims paid or denied by the contractors that process the programs' claims. However, DHA's methodology only examines the claims processing performance of the contractors that process TRICARE's purchased care claims. Unlike Medicare, DHA does not examine the underlying medical record documentation to discern whether each sampled payment was supported. Without examining the medical record, DHA does not verify the medical necessity of services provided. The agency also does not validate that the diagnostic and procedural information reported on the claim matches the care and services documented in the medical record. Comparatively, the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' (CMS) approach to measuring Medicare improper payments examines medical records associated with a sample of claims to verify support for the payment. This methodology more completely identifies improper payments beyond those resulting from claim processing errors, such as those related to provider noncompliance with coding, billing, and payment rules. By not examining medical record documentation to discern if payments are proper, TRICARE's reported improper payment estimates are not comparable to Medicare's estimates, and likely understate the amount of improper payments relative to the estimates produced by Medicare's more comprehensive methodology.", "The root causes of TRICARE improper payments and related corrective actions that DHA has identified are limited to addressing issues of contractor noncompliance with claims processing requirements, and are less comprehensive than the corrective actions identified by CMS. For example, DHA has identified the same single corrective action for each of the last three fiscal years to promote contractor compliance, but it only addresses improper payments caused by contractors' claims processing errors. CMS, by comparison, reports more comprehensive information about root causes of improper Medicare payments, develops corrective actions that more directly address root causes, and uses the information to address the agency's goal of reducing future improper payments. For example, for fiscal year 2013, CMS determined that some payments were improper because the services could have been provided in less intensive settings and CMS subsequently implemented two policies to address the problem. In contrast, DHA's less comprehensive approach limits its ability to address the causes of improper payments in the TRICARE program."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["DOD should implement more comprehensive TRICARE improper payment measurement methods that include medical record reviews, and develop more robust corrective action plans.

Specifically, DHA does not routinely examine  medical record documentation in its approach to measuring TRICARE  improper payments. While DHA has other reviews in place that analyze  medical record documentation and could be leveraged to more  comprehensively identify improper payments, the results of those reviews  are not considered or reported as improper payments. This may account  for why the reported improper payment rate for TRICARE is less than   1 percent while the reported rate for Medicare is 10 percent. Although  TRICARE is a smaller program compared to Medicare, it still costs the  government a significant amount of money\u2014about $21 billion in fiscal  year 2013 for the purchased care portion of TRICARE\u2014and DOD has  determined TRICARE to be susceptible to significant improper payments  under IPIA, as amended. Without a robust measure of improper payment  rates in the TRICARE program, DHA cannot effectively identify root  causes and take steps to address practices that contribute to improper  payments and excess spending."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To better assess and address the full extent of improper payments in the  TRICARE program, we recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct  the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) to take the following  two actions:  1.  implement a more comprehensive TRICARE improper payment  measurement methodology that includes medical record reviews, as  done in other parts of its existing postpayment claims review  programs; and  2.  once a more comprehensive improper payment methodology is  implemented, develop more robust corrective action plans that  address underlying causes of improper payments, as determined by  the medical record reviews."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to DOD and HHS for comment. In its  written comments, reproduced in appendix I, DOD concurred with our  recommendations. DOD also outlined the steps the department will take  prior to implementation, including conducting discussions within the  department; developing implementation plans; and hiring or contracting  for the needed workforce to begin implementing the recommendations.  DOD noted that taking these steps would take time. Given the potentially  high cost of improper payments, we believe DOD should move  expeditiously.
