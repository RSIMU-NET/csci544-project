Operators must assess pipelines in these areas for safety threats (such as corrosion), repair or replace defective segments, and reassess their pipelines at least every 7 years. Under the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration's (PHMSA) regulations, operators must reassess their pipelines for corrosion at least every 7 years and for all safety threats at least every 10, 15, or 20 years. State pipeline safety agencies that assist PHMSA are eligible to receive matching funds up to 50 percent of the cost of their pipeline safety programs. This statement is based on ongoing work for Congress and for others. It focuses on three areas germane to current legislative reauthorization proposals: (1) an overall assessment of the integrity management program, (2) the 7-year reassessment requirement, and (3) provisions to increase state pipeline safety grants. GAO contacted more than 50 pipeline operators and a broad range of stakeholders and surveyed state pipeline agencies. GAO also reviewed PHMSA and industry guidance and reviewed PHMSA pipeline performance data."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["While the gas integrity management program is still being implemented, early indications show that the program benefits pipeline safety. For example, the condition of transmission pipelines is improving as operators assess and repair their pipelines. As of December 31, 2005 (latest data available), 33 percent of the pipelines in highly populated or frequently used areas had been assessed and over 2,300 repairs had been completed. In addition, we estimate that up to 68 percent of the population that lives close to natural gas transmission pipelines is located in highly populated areas and is expected to receive additional protection as a result of improved pipeline safety. Furthermore, despite some uncertainty on the part of operators over the program's documentation requirements, operators, gas pipeline industry representatives, state pipeline officials, and safety advocate representatives all agree that the program enhances public safety, citing operators' improved knowledge of the threats to their pipelines as the primary benefit. Although periodic reassessments of pipeline threats are beneficial, the 7-year reassessment requirement appears to be conservative. Through December 2005, 76 percent of the operators (182 of 241) reporting baseline assessment activity to PHMSA reported that their pipelines were in good condition, requiring only minor repairs. Most of the problems found were concentrated in just 7 pipelines. These results are encouraging, since operators are required to assess their riskiest segments first and operators are required to repair defects, making them safer before reassessments begin toward the end of the decade. There have been no deaths or injuries from corrosion related pipeline incidents over the past 5-1/2 years. An alternative approach is to permit pipeline operators to reassess their pipeline segments at intervals based on technical data, risk factors, and engineering analyses. Such an approach is consistent with the overall philosophy of the 2002 act and would meet its safety objectives. Under this approach, operators could reassess their pipelines at intervals longer than 7 years only if operators can adequately demonstrate that corrosion will not become a threat within the chosen time intervals. Otherwise, the reassessment must occur more frequently. As a safeguard to ensure that operators have identified threats facing these pipeline segments and have determined appropriate reassessment intervals, PHMSA and state regulatory agencies are already conducting integrity management inspections of operators. They plan to inspect most operators' integrity management activities by 2009. The provision to increase the cap on pipeline safety grants to states appears reasonable given that states' workloads are expanding, but funding sources and oversight of states' expanded activities would need to be addressed in order to ensure that the increased grants are appropriately carried out. PHMSA has identified several potential funding sources, such as reprioritizing the agency's budget and increasing pipeline user fees. For oversight, PHMSA anticipates integrating states' expanded activities into the agency's current oversight approach that relies on annual reports from states and field evaluations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["We appreciate the opportunity to assist the Subcommittee in its efforts to  reauthorize the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002, which  strengthened federal pipeline safety programs and enforcement, state  oversight of pipeline operators, and public education on pipeline safety.

We  appeared before this subcommittee in April to discuss these topics. This  statement focuses on three areas that are related to the Subcommittee\u2019s  July 20, 2006, draft bill; H.R. 5782, as introduced; and the administration\u2019s  pipeline reauthorization, introduced as H.R. 5678.

In addition, we surveyed the 47 state pipeline  agencies responsible for inspecting intrastate gas transmission pipeline  operators on their plans for conducting inspections of operators\u2019 integrity  management programs. We also contacted 52 pipeline operators. These  operators represent nearly 60 percent of the miles of pipeline assessed to  date. We relied on pipeline operators\u2019 professional judgment in reporting  on the conditions that they found during their assessments of safety  threats. Because we used a non-probability method of selecting these  operators, we cannot project our findings nationwide. As part of our  work, we assessed the internal controls and the reliability of the data  elements needed for this engagement, and we determined that the data  elements were sufficiently reliable for our purposes.

Our work, which is  nearing completion, concludes that periodic reassessments are beneficial,  but that the 7-year reassessment requirement appears to be conservative  based on a number of factors. Among these are results of the baseline  assessments conducted to date and the overall safety record of the gas  transmission industry. In this regard, through December 2005, 76 percent  of the operators (182 of 241) reporting baseline assessment activity  reported to PHMSA that their pipelines were in good condition and free of  major defects, requiring only minor repairs. Most of the 340 problems  found were concentrated in just 7 pipelines, although it is not known how  many of these problems were due to corrosion. (These assessments  reported by the 241 operators covered about 6,700 miles, or about one- third of the nationwide total to be assessed by 2012.) These results are  encouraging, since operators are required to assess their riskiest segments  first. Furthermore, since operators are required to repair these pipelines,  the overall safety and condition of the pipeline system should be improved  before reassessments begin toward the end of the decade. Regarding  safety, PHMSA data show corrosion incidents are relatively rare: over the  past 5-1/2 years (from January 2001 through early July 2006), there were 26  corrosion-related incidents over the 295,000-mile transmission system per  year, on average\u2014none of which resulted in death or injury.", "The administration\u2019s proposal would require the Secretary of  Transportation to issue regulations basing reassessment intervals on  technical data, risk factors, and engineering analyses. Based on our nearly  completed work, we think that this approach is reasonable and would  achieve the safety objectives of the 2002 act. It is also consistent with the  overall philosophy of the integrity management legislation passed by the  Congress in 2002. As discussed later in this statement, if PHMSA  incorporates existing industry consensus standards for corrosion into its  regulations, operators would be allowed to reassess their pipelines for  time-dependent threats at least every 10, 15, or 20 years only if the  operator can adequately demonstrate that corrosion will not become a  threat within the chosen time interval.

However, if  Congress approves this provision, two areas would need to be addressed  to ensure that the increased grants are appropriately carried out: the  source of funding for the increased grant amounts and oversight of the  expanded state pipeline safety activities. According to PHMSA, the agency  has identified funding options\u2014including reprioritizing the agency\u2019s  budget to channel funds from other activities (such as research) and  increasing user fees charged to pipeline companies \u2014but has not  developed a specific plan for how to provide additional funds to states.  PHMSA currently oversees state pipeline safety activities through annual  reports from the states and field evaluations. According to PHMSA  officials, expanded state pipeline safety agency activities would be  included in PHMSA\u2019s oversight approach."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The United States has a 295,000-mile network of natural gas transmission  pipelines that are owned and operated by approximately 900 operators.  These pipelines are important to the nation because they transport nearly  all the natural gas used, which provides about a quarter of the nation\u2019s  energy supply. Gas transmission pipelines typically move gas products  over long distances from sources to communities and are primarily  interstate. They generally deliver natural gas to local distribution pipelines,  which distribute the gas to commercial and residential end-users. Local  distribution companies may also operate small portions of transmission  pipelines.", "PHMSA administers the national regulatory program to ensure the safe  transportation of natural gas and hazardous liquid by pipeline. In general,  PHMSA retains full responsibility for inspecting and enforcing regulations  on interstate pipelines, but it has arrangements with 48 states, the District  of Columbia, and Puerto Rico to assist with overseeing intrastate  pipelines. These states are currently authorized to receive reimbursement  of up to 50 percent of the costs of their pipeline safety programs from  PHMSA.", "Traditionally, PHMSA has carried out its oversight role using minimum  safety standards that were uniformly applied to all pipelines based on the  \u201cclass location\u201d of the pipeline. A pipeline\u2019s class location\u2014based on  factors such as population within 660 feet of the pipeline\u2014determines the  applicable standards such as the thickness of the pipe required and the  pressure at which it can operate. The Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of  2002 modified PHMSA\u2019s traditional oversight approach by supplementing  the minimum standards with a risk-based program for gas transmission  pipelines. This program\u2014termed \u201cintegrity management\u201d\u2014requires gas  transmission pipeline operators to assess and mitigate safety threats, such  as leaks or ruptures due to incorrect operation or corrosion, to pipeline  segments that are located in highly populated or frequently used areas,  such as parks. Specifically, operators are required to perform baseline  assessments on half of the pipeline mileage located in these areas by  December 2007, and the remainder by December 2012. Those pipeline  segments potentially facing the greatest risks of failure from leaks or  ruptures are to be assessed first. As of December 2005 (latest data  available), 447 gas pipeline operators reported to PHMSA that about  20,000 miles of their pipelines (about 7 percent of all gas transmission  pipeline miles) lie in highly populated or frequently used areas. Individual  operators reported that they have as many as about 1,600 miles and as few  as 0.02 miles of pipeline in these areas.", "The 2002 act also requires that operators reassess these pipeline segments  for safety threats at least every 7 years. Under flexibility provided by the  act, PHMSA requires that operators reassess these pipeline segments for  corrosion damage at least every 7 years in its implementing regulations,  because corrosion is the most frequent cause of failures that can occur  over time. (See fig. 1.) PHMSA\u2019s regulations also incorporated, as  mandatory, voluntary industry consensus standards on maximum  reassessment intervals into these regulations for other types of safety  threats. The industry standards require that operators reassess gas  pipelines at least every 10, 15, or 20 years for all safety threats depending  primarily on the condition of the pipelines and the pressure under which  they operate. If conditions warrant, reassessments must occur more  frequently. In addition, operators must perform prevention and mitigation  activities\u2014such as monitoring their pipelines for excavation or corrosion  damage\u2014on a continuing basis."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Gas Integrity Management Program Benefits Pipeline Safety", "paragraphs": ["Operators are making good progress in assessing and repairing their  pipelines, thereby improving the safety of their pipeline systems. As of  December 2005, operators had assessed about 6,700 miles of their 20,000  miles\u2014or about 33 percent\u2014of pipelines located in highly populated or  frequently used areas. This progress indicates that they are well on their  way to meeting the requirement to conduct baseline assessments on 50  percent of their pipelines in these areas by December 2007. In addition to  assessing their pipelines, operators are also making progress in fulfilling  the requirement to repair problems found on their pipelines in highly  populated or frequently used areas. In the 2 years that operators have  reported the results of integrity management, they have completed 340  repairs that were immediately required and another 1,981 scheduled  repairs in highly populated or frequently used areas. While it is not  possible to determine how many of these needed repairs would have been  identified without integrity management, it is clear that the requirement to  routinely assess pipelines enables operators to identify problems that may  otherwise go undetected. Furthermore, the benefits of integrity  management expand beyond highly populated or frequently used areas  because a large number of operators are using internal inspection tools to  assess their pipelines. These tools must be inserted and removed from the  pipelines at designated locations that often run through other areas.  Consequently, operators reported having assessed about 44,000 miles of  pipelines located outside highly populated or frequently used areas,  representing about 15 percent of all gas transmission pipelines. While  operators are not required to report to PHMSA the results of these  expanded assessments, operators we spoke with said that they plan to  make necessary repairs identified through the assessments regardless of  where they are identified.", "We estimate that the integrity management program should offer  additional safety benefits over the minimum safety standards for up to 68  percent of the population living close to gas transmission pipelines. This  estimate corresponds with PHMSA\u2019s estimate of two-thirds of the  population.", "A number of representatives from pipeline industry organizations, state  pipeline agencies, safety advocate groups, and operators that we  contacted agree that integrity management benefits public safety because  it requires all operators to systematically assess their pipelines to gain a  comprehensive knowledge about the risks to their pipeline systems. Other  benefits cited by operators include improved communications within their  companies and more strategic resource allocation.", "While the operators we contacted generally believe integrity management  is beneficial, the program is not without its costs. For example, over half  of the operators we spoke with said that they have hired additional staff or  contractors as a result of the integrity management requirements. In  addition, 19 of the operators we contacted (37 percent) were concerned  about the level of documentation needed to support their gas integrity  management programs. PHMSA requires operators to develop an integrity  management program and provides a broad framework for the elements  that should be included in the program. The regulations provide operators  the flexibility to develop their programs to best suit their companies\u2019  needs, but each operator must develop and document specific policies and  procedures to demonstrate its commitment to compliance with and  implementation of the integrity management program. Operators may use  existing policies and procedures if they meet the requirements of integrity  management. In addition, an operator must document any decisions made  related to integrity management to demonstrate that it understands the  threats to their pipelines and is systematically managing their pipelines for  these threats. While the operators we contacted generally agreed with the  need to document their policies and procedures, some said that the  detailed documentation required for every decision is very time consuming  and does not contribute to the safety of pipeline operations. In addition, a  few operators expressed concern that they will not know if they have  sufficient documentation until their programs have been inspected. Initial  inspections of operators by PHMSA and state pipeline agencies have  confirmed that some operators are experiencing difficulty with  documentation but are generally doing well with assessments and repairs.  According to PHMSA and state officials, as operators continue to develop  and implement their integrity management programs and as they are  provided feedback during inspections, the documentation issues identified  during these initial inspections should be resolved.", "Another concern raised by 33 (65 percent) of the operators is the  requirement to reassess their pipelines for corrosion problems at least  every 7 years.

Through December 2005 (latest data available), 76 percent of the  operators (182 of 241) reporting baseline assessment activity to PHMSA  told the agency that their pipelines were in good condition, free of major  defects, and requiring only minor repairs.

These  assessments covered about 6,700 miles, or about one-third of the  nationwide total to be assessed.", "It is encouraging that the majority of operators nationwide reported that  they found few or no problems requiring immediate repairs, because  operators are supposed to assess pipeline segments facing the greatest  risk of failure from leaks or ruptures first, as required by the 2002 act. In  addition, since operators are required to identify and repair significant  problems, the overall safety and condition of the pipeline system should  be enhanced before reassessments begin toward the end of the decade.", "Regarding the industry\u2019s overall safety record, over the past 5-1/2 years  (from January 2001 through early July 2006), there were 143 corrosion- related incidents over the 295,000-mile transmission system (26 per year,  on average)\u2014none of which resulted in death or injury. Over the past 10- 1/2 years, 12 people have died and 3 have been injured in two corrosion- related incidents. Neither of these incidents occurred in a highly  populated or frequently used area.", "About 80 percent of the 52 operators that we contacted prefer that  reassessment intervals be based on the condition and characteristics of  the pipeline segment rather than on a prescriptive standard. About half of  these operators (28) expressed a preference for the industry consensus  standard developed by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers  (ASME B31.8S-2004) for setting reassessment intervals for time-dependent  threats because it incorporates a risk-based approach (for pipeline failure)  and is based on science and engineering knowledge. This standard sets  reassessment intervals at a maximum of 10 years for high-stress pipeline  segments, 15 years for medium-stress segments, and 20 years for low- stress segments. Maximum reassessment intervals, such as those in the  industry consensus standard, incorporate such risk concepts as built-in  safety factors (e.g., wall stress, test pressure, or predicted failure),  conditions, and potential consequences of a pipeline incident on a  segment-by-segment basis. The maximum intervals of 10, 15, and 20 years  are based on worst-case corrosion growth rates.", "Industry consensus standards allow for maximum reassessment intervals  for time-dependent threats of 10, 15, or 20 years only if the operator can  adequately demonstrate that corrosion will not become a threat within the  chosen time interval. If not, then the reassessment must occur sooner,  perhaps at 7 or even 5 or fewer years. Furthermore, according to industry  consensus standards, it typically takes longer than the 10, 15, or 20 years  specified in the standard for corrosion problems to result in a leak or  rupture.", "The industry consensus standards were developed in 2001 and updated in  2004 based on, among other things, the experience and expertise of  engineers, contractors, operators, local distribution companies, and  pipeline manufacturers; more than 20 technical studies conducted by the  Gas Technology Institute, ranging from pipeline design factors to natural  gas pipeline risk management; and other industry consensus standards  including the National Association of Corrosion Engineers standards, on  topics such as corrosion. Contributors have been practicing aspects of  risk-based assessments successfully for over 10 years. The ASME standard  serves as a foundation for nearly every section of PHMSA\u2019s integrity  management regulations. The ASME standard was reviewed by the  American National Standards Institute. The Institute found that the  standard was developed in an environment of openness, balance,  consensus, and due process and therefore approved it as an American  National Standard.", "While the mechanical engineering standards are voluntary for the industry,  PHMSA incorporated them as mandatory in its gas transmission integrity  management regulations. The mechanical engineering society\u2019s standard  for setting reassessment intervals is not the only industry consensus  standard in PHMSA\u2019s integrity management regulations. The regulations  incorporate other industry consensus standards for assessing corrosion  threats and for determining temporary reductions in operating pressure. In  addition, it is federal policy to encourage the use of industry consensus  standards: Congress expressed a preference for technical standards  developed by consensus bodies over agency-unique standards in the  National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995. The Office of  Management and Budget\u2019s Circular A-119 provides guidance to federal  agencies on the use of voluntary consensus standards, including the  attributes that define such standards.", "Of the 52 operators we contacted, 44 had undertaken baseline  assessments, and 23 of these have calculated their own reassessment  intervals. Twenty of these 23 operators indicated that, based on the  conditions they identified during their baseline assessments, they would  reassess their pipelines at maximum intervals of 10, 15, or 20 years\u2014as  allowed by industry consensus standards\u2014if the 7-year reassessment  requirement were not in place. The remaining three operators told us that  they would reassess their pipelines at intervals shorter than the industry  consensus standards but longer than 7 years because of the condition of  their pipelines.

One  option is for PHMSA to reprioritize its budget to channel additional funds  from other activities, such as research, to states. Another option may be to  increase user fees that are charged to pipeline companies. User fee  assessments in fiscal year 2006 were about $150 per pipeline mile for  natural gas transmission operators and about $76 per pipeline mile for  hazardous liquid pipelines. All of these options involve tradeoffs among  PHMSA\u2019s pipeline safety oversight activities or could result in increased  fees from the pipeline industry.
