The Sidewinder was first deployed in the 1950s\u2014as the AIM-9B. Over the years, improvements were made as new models were introduced. The missiles have been sold to many friendly countries. The current missile, the AIM-9M, evolved in 1978. U.S. fighter aircraft equipped with the AIM-9M missile, however, are facing modern foreign-built missiles and advanced cueing/targeting systems.", "The rules of engagement for U.S. pilots require that, in many situations, they make a positive identification before firing on an adversary. This results in the pilot\u2019s not being able to fire until the target aircraft is well within visual range. At combat speeds such an encounter can quickly evolve into a close-in fight, during which a short-range missile is required. A joint Navy and Air Force study predicts that a significant percentage of air-to-air encounters will result in a close-in flight.", "In April 1996, the Air Force Chief of Staff testified that U.S. pilots have the fourth best short-range missile in the world. Modern short-range missile systems with their cueing/targeting systems can engage targets throughout the forward hemisphere of the aircraft, providing a decisive advantage in a close-in fight.

That missile became the Advanced Short-Range Air-to-Air Missile (ASRAAM). In the late 1980s, however, the European consortium dissolved. When the consortium dissolved, the Navy and the Air Force reexamined U.S. requirements and determined that the ASRAAM did not have the capability they required. The United States subsequently left the ASRAAM program. The two services then worked on separate upgrades to the AIM-9M. After false starts with their separate programs, a joint Navy and Air Force program with the Navy as lead service was started to extensively upgrade the AIM-9M. The upgraded missile is the AIM-9X.", "As a part of the alternative evaluation process before starting the AIM-9X program, the services considered acquiring one of the modern foreign missiles such as the Russian AA-11, the Israeli PYTHON 4, or the British ASRAAM as an alternative to developing a new U.S. missile. DOD determined, however, that none of these missiles was able to meet all of the U.S. requirements.", "The services conducted an evaluation of the ASRAAM, including a 6-month Foreign Comparison Test that included firing the missile from a U.S. F-16 aircraft. The ASRAAM is electrically and physically compatible with U.S. aircraft and uses the same infrared sensor as the AIM-9X. The evaluation, however, showed that ASRAAM does not meet all of the U.

It will have a new infrared seeker, a tracker to interpret what the seeker sees, a streamlined missile body, and rocket motor thrust vectoring for improved maneuvering. It will be carried on all U.S. fighter aircraft, including the F/A-18, F-15, F-16, and F-22.", "An 18-month AIM-9X competitive demonstration and validation program began in 1994 with the Hughes Missile Systems Company and the Raytheon Corporation as the competing contractors. Both companies demonstrated, among other things, how they would reduce the technical risk of developing the AIM-9X missile. Examples of demonstration and validation work include trade studies, simulating missile performance, analyzing missile compatibility with Navy and Air Force aircraft, and flight testing target-tracking capability. Additionally, the contractors were required to plan for manufacturing the missile, including identifying new or unique processes and special tooling and facilities requirements. Hughes was selected as the AIM-9X missile contractor in December 1996.", "Hughes has total performance responsibility, including development, production, and maintenance support for the missile.

The pilot can then fire the missile without having to turn the aircraft toward the target, increasing the probability of killing a hostile aircraft before it can launch a missile. Another effort is developing the necessary hardware and software modifications to integrate the missile and helmet into the aircraft.

For example, several key components are identical to those used in the AIM-9M missile, including the warhead, rocket motor, and fuze. These components satisfy user requirements and can be obtained either from existing inventory missiles or from new production. In either case, the design and production processes for these items are tested and proven.", "The winning Hughes missile design also includes many nondevelopmental items. For example, Hughes will use fins, an airframe, and an engine control system previously developed and tested by the Air Force. The cryoengine, which cools the missile sensor, is a modified version of a similar device used in other systems. These components do not require lengthy development and testing but will require some modification for the AIM-9X. Hughes officials told us that over 70 percent of the missile design uses parts that do not require development. The company also estimates that 66 percent of AIM-9X missile software can be obtained from existing programs.", "To help anticipate, identify, and solve technical problems, the government\u2019s technical experts in short-range missile development have been added to the Hughes AIM-9X development team as a part of the integrated product teams concept. Technical experts from the Naval Air Warfare Center at China Lake, California, and the Aeronautical Systems Center at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, are now a part of the AIM-9X team. Under this teaming approach, the combined knowledge and efforts of both contractor and government are focused on the development process.", "Hughes has also implemented a comprehensive technical risk assessment system that identifies and tracks all known technical risks in the program.

Low cost was and remains one of the users\u2019 critical requirements for the system. During the concept development phase, an assessment of needed capabilities and anticipated cost considered the projected threat, available and emerging technologies, and projected resources. Performance and cost trade studies identified the minimum essential performance requirements and determined they could be obtained at an acceptable cost if the AIM-9M was upgraded with a new sensor and airframe instead of developing an entirely new missile.", "Reducing AIM-9X missile development and production cost and obtaining high confidence in the contractors\u2019 cost estimates and cost management approach were key objectives of the 18-month demonstration phase. Under the competitive pressure of the winner-take-all development contract, the government required the contractors to establish design-to-cost goals and implementation plans, conduct affordability and producibility studies, and propose a production quantity and price structure. According to the program manager, this emphasis on cost control and cost management both reduced the expected cost of the program and increased the program office\u2019s confidence that the contractor\u2019s development and production cost proposal was sound and likely to be achieved.", "Eight initiatives were pursued during the demonstration phase to reduce program costs with only minor changes to the system\u2019s performance requirements resulting in an estimated cost avoidance of $1.2 billion.

Accordingly, both contractors were required to develop and submit integrated master plans and schedules for development and low-rate initial production during the demonstration phase.", "Following the successful demonstration phase, Hughes and the missile program office reexamined the proposed development schedule. On the bases of that reexamination, they agreed to reduce the development schedule from 68 to 61 months and to begin low-rate initial production a year earlier, thereby lowering development cost by $35 million.
