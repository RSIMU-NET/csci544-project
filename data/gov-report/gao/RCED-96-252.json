More specifically, this report discusses (1) funding for those technologies, (2) characteristics and limitations of available and planned technologies, and (3) deployment of technologies by the United States and foreign countries. The appendixes provide detailed information on the most significant types of technologies available and under development, including brief summaries of their characteristics, their current status in terms of development or deployment, the estimated range of prices for the technologies, and the amount of federal funds spent on the technologies between fiscal years 1978 and 1996.", "This report is one of a series you requested on the role of technology in explosives and narcotics detection. In recent testimony,  we concluded that an approach should be developed immediately to address the actions needed to reduce vulnerabilities in aviation security identified in our classified reports.

A subsequent report will address issues related to governmentwide coordination of technology development and deployment."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The increased threat of terrorism is an urgent national issue. The President directed the establishment of a commission on July 25, 1996, headed by Vice President Gore, whose charter included reviewing aviation security. The commission was charged with reporting to the President within  45 days its initial findings on aviation security, including plans to (1) deploy technology capable of detecting the most sophisticated explosive devices and (2) pay for that technology. In a classified report, we made recommendations to the Vice President, in his capacity as chairman of the commission, that would enhance the effectiveness of the commission\u2019s work. Detection technologies are also important in the effort to stem the flow of drugs into the United States.", "Detection technologies are typically developed for specific applications\u2014some for aviation security, some for drug interdiction, and some for both. The major applications for the aviation security efforts of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) include the screening of checked baggage, passengers, cargo, mail, and carry-on items such as electronics, luggage, and bottles. FAA\u2019s need for detection technology comes from its security responsibilities involving more than 470 domestic airports and 150 U.S. airlines, annually boarding over 500 million passengers with their checked baggage and carry-on luggage, and transporting mail and cargo.", "Some advanced detection technologies are commercially available to serve aviation security applications. However, only one technology is currently deployed in the United States. That technology is being operationally tested at two U.S. airports.", "Major applications for the drug interdiction efforts of the U.S. Customs Service include screening of cargo and containers, pedestrians, and vehicles and their occupants. Customs\u2019 need for detection technology emanates from its responsibilities to control 301 ports of entry. Currently, over 400 million people, almost 120 million cars, and 10 million containers and trucks pass through these points each year.", "Currently, Customs\u2019 screening is done manually by inspectors with relatively little equipment beyond hand-held devices for detecting false compartments in containers.", "The challenges in detecting explosives are significantly different than the challenges in detecting narcotics, as are the consequences in not detecting them. Customs and other drug enforcement agencies are concerned with much larger quantities than are aviation security personnel. Consequently, greater technical challenges are posed in attempting to detect explosives that might be used to bring down a commercial aircraft.", "Two general groups of technologies, with modifications, can be used to detect both explosives and narcotics. The first group uses X-rays, nuclear techniques involving neutron or gamma ray bombardment, or electromagnetic waves, such as radio frequency waves. These technologies show anomalies in a targeted object that might indicate concealed explosives and narcotics or detect actual explosives and narcotics. The second group, referred to as trace detection technologies, uses chemical analyses to identify particles or vapors characteristic of narcotics or explosives and deposited on, or surrounding, objects, such as carry-on electronics or surfaces of vehicles. In addition to technologies, dogs are considered a unique type of trace detector because they can be trained to respond in specific ways to smells of narcotics or explosives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Spending on Detection Technologies", "paragraphs": ["Since 1978, the federal government has spent about $246 million for research and development (R&D) on explosives detection technologies, including over $7 million for ongoing demonstration testing at the Atlanta, San Francisco, and Manila airports. During the same period, the government has spent about $100 million for R&D on narcotics technologies and a little more than $20 million procuring a variety of equipment to assist Customs inspectors, such as hand-held devices for detecting false compartments. The majority of the spending has occurred since 1990.", "As shown in table 1, annual R&D spending on explosives detection technologies fluctuated from $23 million to $28 million during the first part of this decade, before increasing to $39 million for fiscal year 1996. The $14 million, or over 50 percent, increase from fiscal year 1995 is due principally to FAA\u2019s funding of demonstration testing of a technology for screening checked baggage and to the funding of a counterterrorism application by the Technical Support Working Group (TSWG).", "Annual spending on narcotics detection technology increased during the first part of the decade from $14 million to a peak of $20 million in fiscal year 1994 and then dropped $3 million from that peak, or 15 percent. The reason for this decline is reduced spending by the Department of Defense (DOD) as it shifted emphasis from one type of narcotics detection technology to other, less costly types of technologies to satisfy Customs\u2019 needs."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Congressional Direction", "paragraphs": ["The spending on detection technologies that has occurred since 1990 has been due in large part to congressional direction. The Aviation Security Improvement Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-604) directed FAA to increase the pace of its R&D. The act also set a goal of deploying explosives detection technologies by November 1993. However, it prohibited FAA from mandating deployment of a particular technology until that technology had first been certified as capable of detecting various types and quantities of explosives using testing protocols developed in conjunction with the scientific community.", "FAA initially concentrated its efforts on developing protocols and technologies for screening checked baggage to address one of the security vulnerabilities that contributed to the bombing of Pan Am flight 103 in December 1988. However, the goal of deploying such technology has still not been met. FAA has certified one system, and it is being operationally tested at two domestic airports and one airport overseas.", "Congress tasked DOD in 1990 to develop narcotics detection technologies for Customs and other drug enforcement organizations. DOD has focused on developing \u201cnon-intrusive inspection\u201d technologies to screen containers without the need for opening them. Customs is deploying a DOD-developed technology for trucks and empty containers, but it rejected another DOD-developed technology for fully loaded containers (see p. 8). Customs has identified containerized cargo at commercial seaports as its greatest unsolved narcotics detection requirement. According to Customs, it may be necessary to explore new methods of financing the systems that are technologically feasible for seaports, but high in cost."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Characteristics and Limitations of Detection Technologies", "paragraphs": ["Both aviation security and drug interdiction depend on a complex mix of intelligence, procedures, and technologies, which can partially substitute for each other in terms of characteristics, strengths, and limitations. For example, FAA evaluates information from the intelligence community in determining a level of threat and mandating security procedures appropriate to a specific time and place. These security procedures include bag matching and passenger profiling. FAA estimates that incorporating bag matching in everyday security could cost up to $2 billion, while profiling could reduce to 20 percent the number of passengers requiring additional screening. The Customs\u2019 drug interdiction task has an analogous set of procedures and technologies and trade-offs.", "Relevant trade-offs in selecting detection technologies for a given application involve their characteristics and costs, including issues of their effectiveness in detecting explosives or narcotics, safety risks to users of the technology, and impacts on the flow of commerce. For example, some highly effective technologies could be deployed now, but they are expensive, raise safety concerns, or slow the flow of commerce. These trade-offs are required for each of the major detection technology applications for FAA and Customs.", "While areas of overlap exist, FAA\u2019s aviation security applications generally relate to checked baggage, passengers, and carry-on items, and Customs\u2019 drug interdiction applications generally relate to screening of cargo, containers, vehicles, and baggage.

Other less costly and faster systems are available, but they cannot detect all the amounts, configurations, and types of explosive material likely to be used to cause catastrophic damage to commercial aircraft.", "FAA\u2019s plans for developing detection technologies for checked baggage include efforts to improve the certified system, develop new technologies, and evaluate a mix of technologies. FAA believes that an appropriate mix of systems that individually do not meet certification requirements might eventually work together to detect the amounts, configurations, and types of explosive material that are required by the act.", "Appendix I provides additional information about the various types of technologies available and under development for screening checked baggage, including the characteristics and limitations of those technologies, their status, the estimated range of prices for the technologies, and federal government funding for the technologies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Passengers", "paragraphs": ["The National Research Council recently reported that X-ray and electromagnetic technologies produce images of sufficient quality to make them effective for screening passengers for concealed explosives.

One type of portal uses trace detection technologies that collect and analyze traces from the passengers\u2019 clothing or vapors surrounding them. The other type uses electromagnetic waves to screen passengers for items hidden under clothing.", "The National Research Council also recently observed that successful deployment of these technologies is likely to depend on the public\u2019s perception about the seriousness of the threat and the effectiveness of devices in countering the threat, which might also be considered intrusive or thought to be a health risk.

Available low-energy technologies (the equivalent of 3 to 4 times the energy of a passenger X-ray) are less costly and safer but cannot penetrate full containers, so their use is limited to screening for hidden compartments in empty containers and objects concealed in trucks and trailers. About 4 to 25 containers per hour can be processed through low- and high-energy X-ray technologies depending on their configurations.", "According to DOD and Customs officials, future efforts in container screening will include developing less expensive X-ray systems with higher energy levels, mobile X-ray systems, and more capable hand-held trace detection systems.

On the other hand, some countries are using high-energy systems to screen fully loaded containers. The high-energy systems installed at ports of entry in the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and China would have similar uses at seaports here, but Customs officials told us that the systems are too new for reliable operational data.

This system could also be used to detect narcotics.", "In the United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands, and Belgium, we observed governments working closely with airport authorities to deploy explosives detection technologies. In two countries, airport authorities have generally embraced an approach that entails successive levels of review of checked baggage to resolve uncertainty about checked baggage. This approach can require complex systems for tracking throughout the entire baggage handling system. Instead of using only the FAA-certified system for checked baggage, these countries are using a mix of technologies. Their approach has been to implement technology that is an improvement on existing technology or procedures, rather than waiting for perfected technology.", "Officials in the two other countries are waiting for the next generation of explosives detection technologies.

DOD completed the project in Tacoma, Washington, but system was not transitioned to Customs due to Customs\u2019 concerns with cost, safety, and operational issues. $12 to $15 million $15 million (DOD) $224,000 (Customs)", "Required extensive shielding, radiation permit, and FDA permit if used on food.", "System relies on operator\u2019s interpretation of the X-ray images.", "System is designed to scan empty trucks or containers.", "Throughput is about six trucks per hour.", "Commercially available. Customs has deployed one machine at Otay Mesa, California, and plans to deploy up to 11 more along the Southwest border. $3.7 million (DOD)", "Relies on operator\u2019s interpretation of the X-Ray images.", "Systems are designed to scan empty or loaded trucks and containers depending on the energy level and to complement the fixed-site X-ray systems.", "DOD is testing 450 KeV system and still developing machines at other energy levels. $1.75 to $6 million $10.8 million (DOD)", "A 1 MeV system is designed for aircraft size cargo containers.", "May also be useful for scanning passenger vehicles. (continued)", "Funding (FYs 78-96)", "Radio frequency wave probes objects, except that a magnet aligns hydrogen atoms prevalent in liquids.", "Abandoned machine is in storage at major Southeastern seaport. $130,000 (Customs)", "Abandoned FAA prototype for checked baggage was modified for Customs to scan frozen shrimp packages.", "Machine short-circuited during storm and Customs decided against spending for machine repair.", "Systems are based on gas chromatography, chemiluminescence, mass spectroscopy, surface acoustic wave, ion mobility spectroscopy, and biosensor technologies.", "Many commercially available. DOD is developing some prototypes for use by Customs. $2,500 to $170,000 $240,000 (Customs) $2.4 million (TSWG) $4.7 million (DOD)", "Sample collection steps are highly critical for the effectiveness of systems. Most existing systems use vacuum or wiping with a swab.", "Most existing systems are not currently capable of detecting the extremely low vapor pressures of cocaine and heroin. (continued)", "Funding (FYs 78-96)", "System differs from other vapor detectors in that it draws air sample from a barometric chamber into which the object to be inspected has been shaken and subjected to heat cycles.", "Under development by FAA. A fieldable prototype is expected to be tested by October 1996. $1.8 million (TSWG)", "System automatically alarms if explosive is detected.", "System may not work on a tightly sealed object.", "System concentrates 400 litres of air to .5 cc of liquid.", "Under development by FAA. $35,000 to $42,000 $1.3 million (FAA)", "Biosensor specifically identifies the explosives detected.", "System is suitable for use in cargo holds and interiors of aircraft, etc.", "The Funding column indicates whether a specific technology was developed or is being developed for explosives detection, narcotics detection, or both. Genrally, FAA and TSWG funding has supported explosives detection, while funding by DOD, Customs, and ONDCP has supported narcotics detection. Where a technology funding cell shows FAA or TSWG in combination with DOD, Customs, or ONDCP, that technology is generally capable of detecting both narcotics and explosives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Major Contributors to This Report", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "National Security and International Affairs Division, Washington, D.C.", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Resources, Community, and Economic Development Division, Washington, D.C.", "paragraphs": ["Thomas F.
