FAA officials characterized this development effort as an \u201cinsurance policy\u201d to protect FAA against delays in the permanent replacement, then called the Initial Sector Suite System (ISSS) and now called the Display System Replacement (DSR). (See appendix III for more information on DSR.)", "In July 1995, following a flurry of DCC problems and outages and known delays with ISSS, FAA decided that there was an urgent and compelling need to replace DCC at all five DCC-equipped en route centers in the interim before DSR is ready. In making such capital investment decisions, FAA uses four criteria: sponsor (i.e., user) support; mission importance; information technology architectural conformance and maturity; and cost-effectiveness. Each criterion carries a standard weighting factor that is to be consistently applied to all proposed projects. (See figure 4 for these weighting factors.)", "According to DCCR documentation and FAA officials, sponsor support and mission need (i.e., aviation safety) drove the July 1995 decision to produce and deploy DCCR. In particular, FAA\u2019s Air Traffic Services organization, the Air Traffic Controllers Association, and the Air Transport Association strongly endorsed DCCR. Also, FAA officials told us that extensive media attention to the DCC outages, considerable congressional interest, and public safety concern were major considerations. For example, one official stated that FAA was \u201ctaking too much heat in the papers for DCC outages and wanted DCCR to solve the problem.\u201d In FAA\u2019s view, the need to quickly replace DCC was urgent and compelling, and DCCR was the only practical alternative to sustaining safe, orderly, and efficient air traffic services in the near-term.", "FAA considered two cost estimates in analyzing DCCR\u2019s costs versus benefits. However, the results of this analysis were inconclusive, and according to FAA officials, were not relevant to the decision to produce and deploy DCCR because of the urgent need to replace DCC. One of the cost estimates was done by the DCCR project office and the other by the program analysis and operations research office. Using the two cost estimates, the FAA analyzed three DCCR life expectancy scenarios. Under the \u201cmost likely\u201d scenario, the project office\u2019s cost estimate produced a DCCR net present value of negative $37 million and a benefit-to-cost ratio of 0.7 to 1. In contrast, the program analysis and operations research office\u2019s lower cost estimate under the same scenario placed these values at $29 million and 1.4 to 1, respectively. Neither estimate considered maintenance costs. Given the expense of DCC maintenance, including it would likely have made DCCR more cost-effective under both estimates. While FAA officials agreed with our assessment of the impact of including maintenance costs, they did not quantify this impact.", "The month following its July 1995 decision, FAA awarded a roughly $34 million contract to produce five DCCR systems and has publicly committed to having the first site operational in October 1997 and the fifth and last site in February 1998.

According to FAA officials, both (1) contention for Technical Center human resources during testing and (2) test baseline change control are being managed informally and outside the framework of the formal risk management program. By not formally managing these risks, FAA is increasing the chances that they will be overlooked and adversely affect DCCR. For example, by not formally managing the latter, FAA has not ensured that the contractor\u2019s DCCR configuration management plan expressly defines the process for controlling changes across multiple baselines during testing, an inherently more difficult configuration management scenario than is normally encountered during single baseline system testing. Although contractor representatives described for us the process they plan to use for controlling changes over multiple baselines, the configuration management plan does not reflect this. By not having a documented configuration management process that addresses the change control complications introduced by concurrent testing, FAA is unnecessarily increasing the risk of introducing more than one test baseline configuration and thereby rendering concurrent test results meaningless.", "Finally, concurrent testing will save time only if no significant system problems are found.

Our objectives were to determine (1) the portion of the recent major outages experienced at the five DCC-equipped en route centers that were attributable to DCC, (2) whether DCC was meeting its system availability requirement, (3) FAA\u2019s projections of future DCC outages and availability, and (4) whether FAA was effectively managing the DCCR acquisition to ensure delivery of specified capabilities on schedule and within estimated cost.", "To determine what portion of recent major outages at the five DCC-equipped en route centers were attributable to DCC, we used information from a May 21, 1996, FAA report entitled Summary of Major Outages at Centers to calculate by cause the number of major outages and the amount of down time associated with these outages. We also interviewed the FAA Airway Facilities Service official who collected the data used in the report to clarify their meaning and define the term \u201cmajor outage.\u201d We did not verify the information contained in this report concerning the number and cause of the outages or the amount of downtime resulting from the outages.", "To determine whether DCC was meeting its system availability requirement, we collaborated with FAA to calculate DCC\u2019s required availability using data from the system specification. We then compared required availability to DCC\u2019s actual availability for fiscal years 1990 through 1995, which we obtained from FAA\u2019s National Airspace Performance Analysis System. We did not verify the reliability of DCC\u2019s actual availability data generated by the performance analysis system.", "To assess future DCC outages and availability, we obtained FAA projections of the number of DCC outages and the associated MTTR for these outages for calendar years 1996 through 2000, reviewed FAA\u2019s Supportability Review of Display Channel Complex (DCC) and Computer Display Channel (CDC) (Initial Report), dated May 1995, and Supportability Review Update of Display Channel Complex (DCC) Hardware, dated March 1996, and interviewed Air Traffic Services officials responsible for these reports. We also interviewed National Transportation Safety Board officials about the findings in their Special Investigation Report, Air Traffic Control Equipment Outages, dated January 1996.", "To determine whether FAA is effectively managing the DCCR acquisition, we analyzed project and contractor documentation concerning (1) key acquisition and development process areas, such as test and evaluation, risk management, configuration management, and quality assurance, and (2) indicators of product quality, such as trends in reported defects. We also interviewed DCCR project officials and contractor representatives, and analyzed project office and contractor reports addressing progress against cost and schedule plans and budgets. We did not evaluate the reliability of the systems that produced these reports. On the basis of our analysis, we assessed the DCCR risk watch list to ensure that all significant risks were being formally managed.", "In support of all four objectives, we visited one of the five en route centers that is DCC-equipped to observe the system in operation and discuss with controller and maintenance technician representatives DCC functions, mission importance, and performance.", "We requested comments on a draft of this product from the Secretary of Transportation. On September 17, 1996, we obtained oral comments from Transportation and FAA officials. These comments have been incorporated in the report as appropriate.", "We performed our work at FAA Headquarters in Washington, D.C., the FAA Technical Center in Atlantic City, New Jersey, and the Washington en route center in Leesburg, Virginia.
