FDA's data on inspections are severely flawed, and FDA is unaware of the full extent of industry compliance. If BSE was discovered in U.S. cattle, many consumers might refuse to buy domestic beef; beef exports could decline dramatically as could sales in related industries, such as hamburger chains and frozen dinner manufacturers. Furthermore, some people might develop mad cow disease if infected cattle were to enter the food supply. The United States acted as many as five years earlier than did other countries to impose controls over imports of animals and animal feed ingredients from countries that had experienced mad cow disease. Similarly, U.S. surveillance efforts to test cattle brains for mad cow disease met internationally recommended testing targets earlier than did other countries. However, the United States' feed ban is more permissive than that of other countries, allowing cattle feed to contain proteins from horses and pigs. FDA is reviewing whether these ingredients should continue to be allowed in cattle feed. Finally, as in most countries that are BSE-free, cattle brains and other central nervous system tissue can be sold as human food."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), commonly known as mad cow disease, is an always fatal, neuro-degenerative disease that has been found in cattle in 23 countries around the world. Cattle contract the disease through animal feed that contains protein derived from the remains of diseased animals. Scientists generally believe an equally fatal disease in humans\u2014known as variant Creutzfeldt-Jacob Disease (vCJD)\u2014is linked to eating beef from cattle infected with BSE. Just over 100 people have died from vCJD, which many scientists believe is difficult to contract. Both diseases have long incubation periods during which they are undetectable\u20142 to 8 years in cattle and possibly up to 30 years in humans. Countries with BSE have experienced large economic losses in both their beef exports and domestic beef sales. In Europe, more than 5 million head of cattle have been destroyed to thwart the spread of BSE since 1986, when it was first identified in the United Kingdom.", "The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have primary responsibility for preventing the introduction of BSE-contaminated cattle, beef, and cattle-derived products (such as some dietary supplements) into the United States and the spread of the disease if it were to appear. In 1989, USDA began to identify countries from which cattle and cattle-derived products cannot be imported because of BSE concerns; since 1992, FDA has identified the foods, medical products, and other FDA-regulated products derived from cattle for which imports from those countries pose a potential risk. USDA and FDA screen imported shipments of such products. In 1997, to prevent the spread of BSE should it appear in a U.S. herd, FDA implemented a ban on animal feed. It prohibited the use of proteins from most mammals in feed for cattle and other ruminants.The prohibited proteins may still be  used in other animal feed, including pet food and feed for swine and  horses. In addition, USDA inspects domestically prepared meat, and FDA  oversees the manufacture of medical and other products to help ensure  they do not contain potentially infective brain and spinal cord (central  nervous system) tissue. To detect BSE in the estimated 97 million dairy  and beef cattle in the United States, USDA implemented a surveillance  program to conduct post mortem tests for BSE on the brains of certain  adult cattle.", "No cases of BSE-infected animals have been detected in the United States,  but the continuing discovery of new cases in other countries, as well as a  limited understanding of the disease and its prevention, have heightened  concerns about the adequacy of federal efforts to keep BSE out of the  United States. In light of these concerns, you asked us to (1) assess the  effectiveness of federal actions to prevent BSE and ensure compliance  with the animal feed ban; (2) assess the potential economic impacts and  health risks if BSE were to be found in U.S. cattle; and (3) compare U.S.  actions with actions taken in other countries to prevent the emergence or  spread of BSE. As you also requested, we considered, to the extent  feasible, a study by the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis and sponsored by  USDA to examine the potential for BSE in the United States. That study,  issued in November 2001, concluded that BSE is extremely unlikely to  become established in the United States and that, if introduced here, it  would be eliminated within 20 years. The authors acknowledged that  those conclusions, which were based on a probabilistic simulation model  developed for the study, could be influenced by a number of model  assumptions that could not be verified with confidence\u2014including  assumptions about U.S. measures to prevent the introduction and spread  of BSE. The study also states that the most influential sources of  uncertainty regarding the spread of BSE \u201care related to compliance with  the feed ban.\u201d USDA plans to have the study peer-reviewed by a team of  outside experts to validate its scientific integrity. We did not attempt to  validate the model nor the assumptions Harvard made in applying the  model to the United States. Also, we did not conduct an independent risk  analysis of the potential for BSE to occur in the United States."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["BSE and vCJD are among a group of diseases known as transmissible  spongiform encephalopathies (TSE). Currently, there are no therapies or  vaccines to treat TSEs, and a definitive diagnosis can only be made from a  post mortem examination of the brain. The infective agent that gives rise  to TSEs is generally thought to be a malformed protein, called a prion,which causes normal molecules of the same protein in the brain to  become malformed. Prions cannot be killed by conventional heat,  irradiation, or chemical disinfection and sterilization procedures. The  precise amount of material needed to cause disease is unknown but is  generally thought to be very small. TSE prions accumulate in central  nervous system tissue\u2014specifically the brain, spinal cord, and eye\u2014but  are also present in other body tissues of infected humans and animals.  Other TSEs include Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease (in humans), scrapie (in  sheep), transmissible mink encephalopathy, and chronic wasting disease  (in elk and deer).", "The original source of BSE is not known with certainty. However,  evidence suggests that the practice of recycling the remains of diseased  animals, specifically scrapie-infected sheep, into feed for livestock,  including cattle, was responsible for the emergence and spread of BSE in  the United Kingdom. In 1988, the United Kingdom banned the practice of  feeding ruminant-derived protein to ruminants. Following this ban, the  number of new cases of BSE-infected cattle declined from a high in 1992  of 32,280 new cases to a total of 1,312 cases in 2000, and to 526 cases as of  September 30, 2001. About 2,500 cases of BSE have appeared elsewhere in  18 other European countries, as well as Oman, Canada, the Falkland  Islands, and Japan, as a result of the exportation of contaminated feed and  cattle (see fig. 1). The one BSE-infected cow found in Canada had been  imported and was destroyed without entering the animal or human food  chains. The BSE-infected cattle found in Oman (two animals) and the  Falkland Islands (one animal) had also been imported.", "In 1996, experts in the United Kingdom reported the first cases of vCJD.  They believed the victims contracted it by eating beef contaminated by  central nervous system tissue from BSE-infected cattle. Although  contamination of meat with central nervous system tissue could occur in  many ways during the slaughtering and processing of cattle, the major  suspect in these cases was meat removed by a system that mechanically  recovered (by squeezing under pressure) the remaining meat left on  carcasses after all accessible meat has been removed by knife. Prior to  December 1995, when the United Kingdom banned the practice,  mechanically recovered meat, which was included in many cooked meat  products such as sausages, could legally have contained spinal cords.  While scientists believe that at least several hundred thousand people may  have eaten BSE-infective tissue, many believe vCJD is difficult to  contract. As of November 2001, 112 people have had vCJD, of whom just  over 100 had died, nearly all in the United Kingdom. Most vCJD victims  have been young\u2014the average age at death was 28\u2014and half died within  13 months from the time they first showed symptoms.", "As figure 2 shows, cattle provide meat and a wide array of consumer  products. Many of these products may pose at least a theoretical risk for  BSE infection. For example, dietary supplements, vaccines, cosmetics, and  surgical replacement tissue, as well as gelatin, are produced from bovine  carcasses, central nervous system tissue, and blood. The rendering  industry in the United States and elsewhere recycles animals and animal  tissues considered unfit for human consumption into, among other things,  animal feed; diseased animals are routinely part of such recycling. The  United States trades extensively in animals and the full range of animal  products.", "No test for BSE or TSE infectivity has been proven adequate for diagnosis  in humans or animals before symptoms appear or for screening blood and  other products. Tests to detect proteins from cattle in animal feed do not  distinguish between milk and blood proteins that are allowed and meat  and bone proteins that are not. Furthermore, methods to test animal feeds  are based on the analysis of genetic material, bone, and protein, all of  which are degraded or destroyed in the rendering process. The lack of  unique genetic material associated with BSE prions has led scientists to  look for other biological markers for the disease, such as accumulations of  abnormal forms of the prion protein in various tissues. Development of  valid, sensitive, rapid, and reliable tests for live animals is difficult because  the specific agent has not been fully identified and elicits no detectable  immune response. Furthermore, efforts are hampered by the limited  scientific understanding of BSE and other TSEs, including when during the  incubation period infectivity appears, what mechanism causes infection,  and whether infectivity is ever present in blood.", "Four federal agencies are primarily responsible for overseeing the many  imported and domestic products that could pose a risk of BSE and for  surveillance programs designed to detect and monitor animal and human  diseases:", "The U.S. Customs Service screens all goods entering the country to  enforce Customs laws and laws for 40 other agencies.", "USDA\u2019s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service monitors the health of  domestic animals and screens imported animals and other products to  protect animal health.", "USDA\u2019s Food Safety Inspection Service monitors the safety of imported  and domestically produced meat, poultry, and some egg products.", "FDA, within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS),  monitors the safety of all other foreign and domestic food products  (including dietary supplements and animal feed), as well as vaccines for  humans, drugs, cosmetics, medical devices, and the human blood supply.", "In addition, two other HHS agencies\u2014the Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention and the National Institutes of Health\u2014monitor human health  to detect vCJD should it appear and conduct research to better understand  TSEs and the prions thought to cause them.", "In August 1997, FDA banned potentially BSE-infective animal proteins in  feed for cattle and other ruminants. Proteins are added to feed to promote  animal growth and can be derived from a number of sources, including  animal meat and bone meal, fishmeal, and plant products. The feed ban  prohibits the use of most animal-derived proteins in cattle feed. It also  requires that, among other things, feed and feed ingredients that contain  the prohibited proteins be labeled \u201cDo not feed to cattle or other  ruminants;\u201d firms that handle both prohibited and nonprohibited feed and  feed ingredients have procedures to ensure that the two are not  commingled; and firms maintain records sufficient to track feed materials  through their receipt and disposition for certain periods. The ban excludes  animal blood and blood products, gelatin, plate waste, milk and milk  protein, and protein derived from pigs and horses (and other equines).  Renderers, feed manufacturers and blenders, and feed distributors are  subject to the ban.", "Recent research on the ability of animals to be \u201csilent\u201d carriers of TSEs  from another species raises questions about the advisability of including in  feed for cattle, or other ruminants, proteins from animals such as pigs and  horses that are currently not thought to be susceptible to BSE and other  TSEs, according to researchers at the National Institutes of Health.  Specifically, in November 2001 these researchers reported that even  though mice experimentally infected with hamster scrapie did not develop  clinical disease, infectivity persisted in the brains and spleens of the mice  throughout their life spans. Although available laboratory methods were  not sufficiently sensitive to detect the infectivity in these mice, the  researchers could infect other mice and hamsters with tissue from the  original asymptomatic mice.", "The European Commission\u2014the executive and legislative body of the  European Union\u2014 has had its Scientific Steering Committeeconduct  assessments of the geographical risk of BSE for countries that requested  an assessment.

According to USDA, 173 of these  animals could have been used in animal feed or entered the human food  supply. In addition, the United States imported 443 breeding and dairy  cattle from continental Europe between 1983 and 1997, some of which  may also have been used in animal feed or in the human food supply. Since  1996, USDA has placed under quarantine any of these imported cattle it  has found still alive. These animals are monitored and, when they die,  USDA obtains brain samples to test for BSE. Thus far, all tests on these  animals have been negative. As of November 16, 2001, three head of cattle  from the United Kingdom and five from continental Europe were still alive  and being monitored.", "The United States also imported 242 cattle from Japan between 1993 and  1999. Japan reported its first case of BSE in September 2001. As of  November 28, 2001, USDA had located 214 of these cattle. According to  USDA, 24 of these cattle had gone to slaughter or to rendering, 40 had  been exported, and 150 were still alive. USDA has begun monitoring those  animals and is attempting to locate the remaining 28 cattle.", "In its evaluation of the potential for BSE in the United States, the Harvard  study considered the ban on imports of cattle from the United Kingdom as  one of the United States\u2019 key prevention measures. The study assumed  that remains from some of the cattle imported from the United Kingdom  could have been used in animal feed, food for human consumption, or  both. Although more than 95 percent of the study\u2019s simulations, based on  exposure to a low infective dose, resulted in no BSE cases in cattle, a few  resulted in substantial numbers of cases. The study also assumed that  cattle imported from continental Europe after 1996 had been traced and  their movements controlled; it states that these cattle present virtually no  risk for introducing BSE to the United States. However, the Harvard study  did not take into account the 242 cattle imported from Japan between 1993  and 1999. The discovery of BSE in Japan occurred just before Harvard  issued the results of its study.", "The United States also imported about 23 million pounds of inedible meat  by-products\u2014which would include meat and bone meal and other animal- derived meals, flours, and residues\u2014between 1980 and 2000 from  countries later found to have BSE (see fig 5.). However, the amount of  meat by-products derived from cattle is uncertain because the code  Customs uses to classify such shipments includes by-products from cattle  or other animals. Likewise, any meat and bone meal imported under that  code could be from cattle or other animals. While experts, including the  Harvard researchers, see the risk of exposure posed by these shipments as  extremely low, if any cattle feed contained BSE-infected meat and bone  meal, it could create an opportunity to contaminate U.S. cattle.", "The beef and prepared beef products that the United States imported from  countries that later found BSE, were for human consumption. According  to scientific experts, meat products could represent a risk to people who  ate them if the meat came from a BSE-infected animal (see figs. 6 and 7).  Until February 2001, USDA regulations allowed the import of beef and  beef products from countries with BSE or at risk of BSE if the facility that  processed the meat did not receive, store, or process ruminant material  from a country with BSE or at risk for BSE.", "In addition to the BSE risk posed by past imports, a small but steady  stream of BSE-risk material may still be entering the United States through  international bulk mail. USDA inspectors at a New Jersey international  bulk mail facility have begun using new x-ray technology that clearly  distinguishes organic from inorganic matter to screen packages for  products that pose a risk of animal and plant diseases. At this facility, we  saw USDA inspectors seize one package that contained beef soup mix  from Germany, one of the countries from which the United States restricts  trade in beef products. Inspectors also showed us a package from Ireland  that was labeled \u201ccutlery,\u201d but contained corned beef. From May through  October 2001, USDA inspectors, using the new x-ray technology, screened  about 7 percent (about 116,000) of the over 1.5 million packages that  passed through the New Jersey facility. Of the screened packages, 570  contained one or more at-risk beef or beef-derived products. However,  USDA does not screen packages at the New Jersey facility during the  24 hours each week when inspectors are not on duty. According to the  inspectors, the screening rate was low because only one or two inspectors  are on duty at any time, and each has only seconds to visually inspect  packages as they pass by on a conveyor belt. While all 14 international  bulk mail facilities in the United States have some sort of x-ray technology  that can distinguish organic from inorganic material, the new  technology\u2014used only at the New Jersey facility\u2014provides greater  accuracy and clearer imagery. The new technology is also compatible with  the conveyor system and can be placed over the conveyor belt. USDA  officials told us that the new x-ray technology would facilitate the  inspection of international bulk mail arriving in the United States.", "At-risk items may also slip through federal inspections at ports of entry.  Customs often finds discrepancies with the accuracy of importer-provided  information during its annual reviews of trade compliance and, as a result,  BSE-risk products may not be flagged for further inspection. For example,  Customs found a shipment of animal feed ingredients incorrectly classified  as pet food by the importer. It also found a shipment of animal feed  identified by the importer as originating in Canada that inspectors  discovered originated in Switzerland. For fiscal year 1999, Customs  reported that importer-provided information on shipments of live bovine  animals (e.g., cattle, bison, and buffalo) was inaccurate in over 24 percent  of samples taken. Information on shipments of fresh or frozen beef was  inaccurate in over 21 percent of samples and on shipments of animal feed  in over 24 percent of samples.", "Additionally, the ever-increasing volume of imported shipments strains  inspection resources for both FDA and USDA. In October 2001, we  reported that during fiscal year 2000, FDA inspected about 1 percent of the  over 4 million imported food entries under its jurisdiction. Additionally,  FDA inspected less than one percent of the more than 146,000 entries of  imported animal drugs and feeds. FDA has acknowledged that the  increased volume of imports has severely hampered its ability to inspect a  sufficient portion of imports. Specifically, while imported shipments under  FDA\u2019s jurisdiction have risen dramatically in recent years, the agency\u2019s  inspection staff has remained almost static since 1992. Prompted by  bioterrorism concerns, the Secretary of Health and Human Services  requested $61 million in October 2001 to hire 410 additional inspectors and  other personnel to allow increased inspections of imported food products.  In 1997 we reported that USDA\u2019s inspection workload had increased  dramatically since 1990; we concluded that USDA had little assurance that  it was deploying its limited inspection resources at the ports of entry that  are most vulnerable to the introduction of pests and diseases. USDA has  acknowledged the lack of inspection coverage and, in the wake of foot and  mouth disease outbreaks in Europe and other countries, authorized  $32 million in fiscal year 2001 to hire 350 new inspection personnel and  additional canine inspection teams at U.S. borders and ports of entry."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "USDA Tests Many Cattle Brains for BSE in Its Surveillance Program but Does Not Test Many from Cattle That Die on Farms", "paragraphs": ["USDA began testing animal brains to detect BSE in domestic cattle in  1990. This surveillance program consists primarily of collecting and  analyzing brain samples from adult cattle with neurological symptoms and  adult animals that were nonambulatory at slaughter. Testing animal  brains is a key measure to detect BSE, and USDA\u2019s surveillance program  should build on current efforts to increase the number of brain samples  tested each year, according to officials from organizations representing the  beef and grain industries, state officials, and consumers, as well as federal  officials. As table 1 shows, the number of samples collected and tested by  USDA in its surveillance program has generally increased each year. The  table also shows that a substantial portion of those samples have been  taken from nonambulatory cattle since 1994, when USDA first began to  collect this information. USDA has increased the portion of  nonambulatory cattle because research has shown that this population  includes animals that might have subtle neurological symptoms or injuries  resulting from neurological impairment. In fiscal year 2001 these animals  accounted for more than 90 percent of the 4,870 brains collected and  tested by USDA. The remainder includes brain samples from animals  rejected at slaughter for signs of neurological disease.", "In addition to increasing the sample size and the number of  nonambulatory cattle tested, USDA has broadened its testing efforts.  USDA tests samples using two complementary laboratory methods and  conducts surveillance for two TSEs\u2014scrapie in sheep and chronic wasting  disease in deer and elk\u2014that already exist in the United States. USDA  officials and many scientific experts believe surveillance and eradication  of scrapie and chronic wasting disease is important, in part, because of the  suspected link between scrapie in the United Kingdom and the appearance  of BSE, and because both have been experimentally transferred to other  species.", "Although USDA has strengthened its surveillance efforts, the program  does not include many samples from cattle that die on farms. Scientific  experts consider these animals a high-risk population because they are  generally older and the reasons for their death are often unknown. USDA  told us that efforts to obtain samples more systematically from such  animals are limited largely by the dispersed nature of the domestic  livestock industry, the lack of adequate laboratory capacity to conduct the  tests, and the lack of sufficient staff and time to collect the samples. When  animals die on farms they may be buried on the farm, taken to landfills, or  collected by renderers who recycle animals and other animal tissues into,  among other things, animal feed. In 1998 USDA implemented a cooperative  program with the rendering industry to ensure that carcasses of animals  condemned at slaughter for signs of neurological disease are held until test  results are completed. Under this program, USDA may share the expenses  to store or dispose of carcasses during the testing period. USDA was not  able to provide us with information on how frequently the program has  been used, but it has been used only sporadically, according to USDA  officials and the USDA veterinarians and renderers we spoke with in nine  states and Puerto Rico.", "In its evaluation of the potential for BSE in the United States, the Harvard  Center for Risk Analysis included animals that die on farms as a potential  source of BSE exposure. According to their simulation model, excluding  from the rendering process those animals that die on farms significantly  reduces the potential for cattle to be exposed to BSE through animal feed.  Harvard\u2019s report also notes that farmers may not be willing to send  animals displaying neurological symptoms to slaughter, thereby reducing  the likelihood that infected animals would be inspected by USDA at  slaughterhouses. Once dead, these animals might be rendered, as assumed  in the simulation model, or disposed of on farms. According to USDA  officials, when the Harvard study was issued to the public, the Secretary of  Agriculture announced plans to more than double the number of BSE tests  conducted in FY 2002 to more than 12,000."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FDA\u2019s Enforcement of the Feed Ban Is Limited and Inspection Data Are Flawed", "paragraphs": ["Federal and state officials and the scientific community agree that if BSE  were to be found in a U.S. herd, a well-enforced feed ban would prevent its  spread to other herds.

FDA headquarters compiles and maintains this  information in a database, and it provided to us the information in that  database through October 26, 2001.

Inspections were not entered into the database in a timely fashion. We  found several instances where inspections dating back to 1998 and 1999  were not entered into the database until mid to late 2001\u2014too late for FDA  to reinspect in a timely fashion if violations existed.

Moreover, any compliance information FDA reported to  congressional overseers and others would not have been reliable.", "Several states did not use FDA\u2019s inspection form, but instead used their  own state-developed forms. Because the questions were different, certain  assumptions had to be made when these data were entered into FDA\u2019s  database. The HHS Office of Inspector General noted, in a June 2000  report, that many FDA agreements with states, whose inspectors  conducted about 80 percent of feed ban inspections, do not ensure that  states routinely provide FDA with standardized information on the  inspections they conduct. In September 2001 FDA revised the inspection  form and asked states to use the revised form. States are free to ask other  questions during the inspections, but FDA has also asked them to include  FDA\u2019s questions in FDA\u2019s format.", "The database is incomplete. It does not include all firms subject to the feed  ban. FDA officials relied on the personal knowledge of state and FDA field  staff and on membership lists from industry groups to identify and locate  firms. However, our review of membership records for the National  Renderers Association\u2014for the years 1998 to 2001\u2014disclosed 21  rendering firms that were not in FDA\u2019s database. According to association  records, those firms process meat and bone meal and other products that  could contain proteins subject to the feed ban.  FDA did not count data entries with blanks\u2014no responses\u2014in the  selected data fields it uses when it reports on compliance. Therefore,  when FDA provided compliance information to the Congress\u2014and when it  publishes that information electronically\u2014the data are misleading and the  number of firms identified as out of compliance are undercounted. For  example, for the 364 firms identified as out of compliance in FDA\u2019s  October 2001 update\u2014the source for information in table 1 above\u2014FDA  assumed that all entries with blanks in the compliance fields were in  compliance. However, we found entries where firms had blanks in the data  fields FDA used, yet contained inspector comments in other fields  showing that the firms were not in compliance. FDA also did not include  these firms on published lists of noncompliant firms. About half of the  inspection records contain inspector comments. On those entries where  blanks also existed, the inspector comments showed that firms were in  compliance in some instances and out of compliance in others.", "An FDA official told us that the database was not originally intended to  track compliance of individual firms, but rather to guide the agency\u2019s  efforts to educate firms subject to the ban by illustrating particular states  or practices that needed more intensive focus. However, FDA has no  information system other than the inspection database to track  compliance with the feed ban.", "FDA has not placed a priority on oversight of the feed ban. From the  implementation of the feed ban in August 1997 until early 2001, one person  in FDA\u2019s Center for Veterinary Medicine was responsible for feed ban  management. Although state and FDA District Office inspectors conducted  the inspections, this individual designed the inspection form, compiled  inspection data, and made enforcement decisions\u2014in addition to that  individual\u2019s other duties. Furthermore, the inspection form had not been  pretested\u2014a standard practice to ensure that questions are interpreted  and answered consistently.", "In the course of our review, FDA attempted to clean up the database so  that it could serve as an accurate management tool. However, in October  2001, FDA turned that effort over to a contractor to (1) review the  completeness of the feed ban inspection database to ensure that findings  have been captured, including written comments by the inspectors on  inspection forms; (2) analyze the data and present the findings in a report;  and (3) review the current enforcement strategy to determine program  strengths and weaknesses and to make recommendations for  improvements that will better support FDA\u2019s compliance goals. FDA  expects this work to be completed by February 2002. Also in October  2001, FDA entered into a separate contract to reconfigure the data so that  they can be incorporated into FDA\u2019s primary database for all other  inspection activities.

For example, bone-in meat cuts, such  as T-bone steaks, are stripped directly from the animal\u2019s vertebrae and  may contain portions of the spinal cord. Many other edible products, such  as beef stock, beef extract, and beef flavoring, are frequently made by  further processing (e.g., boiling) the skeletal remains (including the  vertebral column) of the carcass after most of the meat has been removed.

In addition, an assessment of  economic impacts would include costs relating to the public sector, such  as farmer compensation payments, increased spending on research and  development, and increased costs to government agencies. While the  extent to which economic impacts would pass from one sector to another  is unclear, these effects would eventually channel through to several  sectors of the economy.

A complete assessment of these impacts is difficult to  forecast given the uncertainties surrounding key assumptions, such as the  source of the BSE, the number and timing of cases, and the public\u2019s  reaction. For instance, if BSE were to enter the country through the  importation of meat and bone meal rather than live cattle imports, the  economic consequences could be more pervasive, because the meat and  bone meal could potentially contaminate many cattle. Another difficulty in  estimating impacts is the problem of determining how the increased costs  of BSE would be passed on from the farmer to the final consumer in the  beef-marketing channel. Moreover, studies that estimate losses due to BSE  from other countries may not be totally applicable to the United States.", "Food safety experts have noted that perceptions about food safety risks  vary from country to country, and the consumer impacts of BSE in one  country may not be applicable to another country. If BSE were found here,  the economic impact on the $56 billion beef industry and related industries  could be devastating, according to USDA economists. For instance,  consumers in the United States, in response to reports of BSE-infected  cattle, may for a period of time restrict their purchases of beef and  products containing beef. That response would be felt not only by the  cattle and beef industries, but also by peripheral industries. For example,  hamburger chains and soup and frozen dinner manufacturers could see  dramatic declines in business.", "Similarly, in international trade, a loss in beef exports may be more  devastating for the United States than for other beef-producing countries.  In particular, since the United States exports nearly 10 percent (by  volume) of its total beef production (about 25 percent of total world beef  exports), the trade sector is also critical in estimating total economic  impacts.", "As a first approximation, however, FDA officials estimated the direct  effects to the beef and livestock industries based on a 1998 study of the  economic impacts of the first year of the BSE outbreak in the United  Kingdom. They estimate that if the United States were to experience an  outbreak as severe as the one in the United Kingdom, the beef industry  could lose as much as $15 billion in sales revenue. Specifically, these costs  were based on the assumption that in the event of a BSE crisis, U.S.  domestic and export demand would decrease by the same amounts as in  the United Kingdom\u2014a 24 percent decline in domestic beef sales and an  80 percent decline in beef and live cattle exports. In addition, the FDA  estimated the livestock sector would incur a minimum of $12 billion to  slaughter and dispose of at-risk cattle. This estimate was based on an  assumption that the United States would need to destroy about four times  as many cattle as the United Kingdom. However, the FDA analysis did not  include the offsetting effects of government payments, as occurred in the  United Kingdom, shifts in consumer demand for other types of meat, or  the effects on other related sectors of the economy.

Many experts believe  that vCJD is difficult to contract and, therefore, that relatively few people  would develop the disease. However, other scientific experts believe that,  because of the long incubation period, no one can predict whether few or  many might contract vCJD. According to some scientific experts in the  United Kingdom, as many as 100,000 people in Europe may develop vCJD  as a result of the BSE outbreak there. This could include Americans who  lived in countries where BSE occurred. In addition to these direct health  implications, an outbreak of BSE in the United States would carry an  emotional toll on consumers who believe federal regulators will protect  them from this devastating disease. Moreover, according to a National  Institutes of Health scientist, the appearance of vCJD could cast doubt on  the safety of organ donations and the U.S. blood supply.

The United States acted earlier than many  countries to ban the import of cattle and meat and bone meal for use in  cattle feed from the United Kingdom and other countries where BSE had  appeared. The United States was one of three countries that banned trade  in cattle from the United Kingdom by 1989; six other countries did so by  1994. Nine other countries had formal bans in place by 1996, the year that  the United Kingdom stopped all trade in cattle. Actions to halt trade in  cattle with other countries where BSE had appeared has been variable,  and the United States and some other countries phased in restrictions as  cases appeared. Also, many of the assessed countries, particularly those  in South America and in Africa, had little or no trade in cattle with the  United Kingdom or other countries where BSE had appeared. With regard  to the import of meat and bone meal for use in cattle feed, the United  States banned imports from the United Kingdom in 1991 and phased in  restrictions from other countries as cases of BSE appeared. While one  country banned such imports from the United Kingdom as early as 1978,  due to concerns about foot and mouth disease, a few countries imported  significant amounts of meat and bone meal from the United Kingdom and  other BSE countries as recently as 1999.", "Surveillance testing to detect BSE. The United States is one of three  countries that reported meeting Office International Des Epizooties  (OIE)-recommended cattle testing levels by 1994. Most countries either  had not met OIE levels at the time of their assessments or met the levels  after 1994. However, nine countries, including six with BSE, had started  or planned to start targeting cattle that die on farms in their surveillance  testing. In their assessments of the United States and the other countries,  the scientific experts most often recommended that countries improve  surveillance largely by including tests of high-risk populations, such as  animals that die on farms.", "Cattle feeding practices (feed bans). Of the 49 countries assessed, 41  had some sort of feed ban in place; however, those bans varied on the  extent that they allowed protein from mammals in feed for cattle.", "Compared to other countries with a ban, the United States and 16 others  allow at least some mammalian protein in feed for cattle. For example, the  United States and Canada allowed cattle feed to contain protein from  horses and pigs. The remaining 24 countries with a feed ban (including  13 that have BSE) prohibit all mammalian protein in cattle feed, although  9 allow such protein in feed for pigs and poultry. Four of the 24 countries  have more stringent bans that prohibit mammalian protein in feed for all  farm animals\u2014a practice the European Commission asked its member  countries to adopt on a temporary basis in 2000. In the assessments,  scientific experts found that the potential for commingling prohibited  protein with cattle feed existed in most countries. Enforcing existing feed  bans was the second most common recommendation made by the  scientific experts. In October 2001, FDA officials held a public hearing to  elicit comments on, among other things, whether the existing feed ban  exemptions should be modified.

As  FDA notes, other countries strengthened their feed bans due to  concerns about commingling prohibited and non-prohibited proteins.  Such commingling is a common area of noncompliance in the United  States.  2.\t As FDA points out, its June 22, 2001, transmittal of compliance  information to the Chairman of the House Committee on Energy and  Commerce \u201cmade an effort to identify the fact that there were  reporting problems, including incomplete data, i.e., blanks.\u201d However,  we do not believe that this caveat conveyed the extent to which the  information could be inaccurate. In fact, noncompliance could be  much higher than FDA reported, because FDA treated all firms with  blanks on compliance questions as if they were in compliance. We  found that over 700 inspection records for firms that handled  prohibited proteins had blanks on compliance questions. In its  response to the Chairman, FDA did not disclose that some of those  records contained inspector comments stating that the firms were not  in compliance. Nor did FDA disclose that, at the time it responded to  the Chairman, it was aware of the need for \u201csignificant improvements  in its data collection system for enforcing the feed ban.\u201d As a result, we  believe the data were misleading.  3.\t We believe that the nature and severity of the problems we found in  FDA\u2019s management, oversight, and enforcement of the feed ban point  to insufficient attention by FDA management. Moreover, the fact that  FDA gave all headquarters responsibility to one individual\u2014as an add- on to that individual\u2019s other duties\u2014is further evidence of the  relatively low priority FDA gave to its regulatory responsibility.  4.\t Although FDA\u2019s field inspectors and state inspectors carried out the  inspections, FDA headquarters tracked overall compliance with the  feed ban and brought together data on FDA field and state compliance  inspections. In meetings with FDA officials, we were repeatedly told  that a single person had designed the program and the database to  monitor inspections and, until January 2001, made all enforcement  decisions. While administrative and other support may have been  available for this person, the overall design and direction of feed ban  implementation rested with this individual. Moreover, because FDA  had no other information system, the database that individual  developed was FDA\u2019s only mechanism to monitor the program and  track feed ban compliance.  5.\t Although FDA cites a number of high-level interagency policy and  technical initiatives aimed at ensuring that BSE-risk products do not  enter the United States, our recommendation is grounded in problems  we found at the operational level. First, the high error rates in  importer-provided information found by Customs are unacceptable.  Second, the ever-increasing volume of imported shipments strains  inspection resources at both USDA and FDA. Third, we observed or  were told by federal field personnel about problems affecting USDA  and FDA staff responsible for reviewing import documentation and  conducting inspections of shipments. FDA staff told us that they need  integrated information technologies, dedicated inspection facilities,  and additional staff to effectively address their workload.  6.\t We do not agree that FDA has made extensive progress implementing  our recommendation, based on the fact that it periodically meets with  states on BSE-related issues and has increased the number of states  under contracts to conduct inspections. With regard to its progress in  identifying the universe of firms subject to the ban, our work shows  that FDA\u2019s efforts have not been successful. In reports, FDA states that  the number of on-farm feed mills, feed blenders, and feed haulers is  still unknown. FDA also asserts that the feed industry has undergone  extensive consolidation, but it has not reconciled the number of firms  inspected with industry or state estimates. Although FDA asserts it has  incorporated into state contracts a requirement to identify firms  subject to the ban, the contracts we reviewed did not include such  provisions. Moreover, as recently as May 2001, we found that FDA was  adding to its database information on inspections conducted in 1998 by  states under contract.  7.\t FDA agrees on the need for a comprehensive strategy for BSE but  points out that it began an enforcement strategy in 1998. However, our  review shows that the strategy did not contain criteria and timeframes  for specific enforcement actions against firms that fail to comply with  the feed ban, as our recommendation envisions. FDA\u2019s contention that  its initial approach was to educate firms does not explain its failure to  take action against firms found out of compliance on repeated  inspections. Now that the feed ban has been in effect for more than 4  years, FDA points out that inspections have resulted in more than 200  recalls. However, those recalls consist of actions taken by 22 firms,  one of which accounted for about 150 recalls. By FDA\u2019s own estimates,  more than 300 firms are out of compliance.  8.\t Regardless of variations in state laws, FDA has instructed states to  provide specific information on the feed ban inspections they conduct.  We believe FDA should request these states to also include  information on enforcement actions taken as a result of those feed ban  inspections.  9.\t While we agree that FDA has initiated efforts to increase the integrity  and usefulness of the BSE inspection data, it has not taken the steps  necessary to ensure that the inspection data are accurate and complete  and recorded in a timely manner. For example, neither the steps listed  in FDA\u2019s letter nor the terms of the contracts we reviewed include  periodic assessment of error rates or controls to help ensure data  entered are complete and accurate. Moreover, FDA\u2019s response does  not address how the data on past BSE inspections will be merged with  the Field Accomplishment Compliance Tracking System. Many of the  firms have never before been subject to FDA oversight and would not  have such control numbers to effectively merge the old and new data.  Also, FDA has not included steps to capture timeliness of inspections,  enforcement actions, and follow up, especially for past inspections."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the Department of Agriculture", "paragraphs": ["The following are GAO\u2019s comments on the Department of Agriculture\u2019s  comments received January 11, 2002."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Comments", "paragraphs": ["1.\t While USDA states that it agrees with our recommendation, in its  discussion of policy-level coordination and strategic planning among  various agencies, USDA does not fully address the substance of our  recommendation. Our recommendation focuses on actions to  strengthen the inspection of imported products at an operational level,  including identifying resources needed to do so.  2.\t With regard to our recommendation to consider interim action to  advise consumers when products may contain central nervous system  tissue, USDA acknowledged its support for providing consumers with  information on product content and for an open process that allows  consumers to make choices.  However, USDA stated that labeling and  warning statements should be reserved for known hazards. We believe  that it would be prudent for USDA to consider taking some action to  inform consumers when products may contain central nervous system  or other tissue that could pose a risk if taken from an infected animal,  especially in light of the experiences in Japan and other countries that  were believed to be BSE free. This would allow consumers to make  informed choices about the products they consume. Caution labels or  signs, if used, could facilitate more timely removal of products that  could pose a health risk if BSE were to appear.  3.\t USDA states that it is more than doubling the number of animals  sampled in its BSE surveillance program for 2002 and that it intends to  obtain more samples from animals that die on farms. USDA notes that  properly equipped laboratory facilities will be needed to support the  increased surveillance.
