EVM is a project management approach that, if implemented appropriately, provides objective reports of project status, produces early warning signs of impending schedule delays and cost overruns, and provides unbiased estimates of a program's total costs. GAO was asked to assess whether the department and its key component agencies (1) have the policies in place to effectively implement EVM and (2) are adequately using EVM techniques to manage critical system investments.

According to the Director for Capital Planning and Investment Control, the department is currently working on revising its policy and according to Deputy Assistant Secretary for Information Systems and Chief Information Officer expects to finalize it by October 2008. Until Treasury develops a comprehensive policy to guide its efforts, it will be difficult for the department to optimize the effectiveness of EVM as a management tool. The department and its bureaus are not fully implementing key EVM practices needed to effectively manage their critical system investments. Specifically, the six programs at Treasury that GAO reviewed were not consistently implementing practices needed for establishing a comprehensive EVM system, ensuring that data from the system are reliable, and using the data to help manage the program. For example, when executing work plans and recording actual costs, a key practice for ensuring that the data resulting from the EVM system are reliable, only two of the six investments reviewed incorporated government costs with contractor costs. These weaknesses exist in part because Treasury's policy is not comprehensive and because the department does not have a process for ensuring effective EVM implementation.

As a result of these weaknesses, we  made recommendations to Treasury for strengthening their investment  management capability.

Schedule  variances are also measured in dollars, but they compare the earned value  of the work completed with the value of work that was expected to be  completed. For example, if a contractor completed $5 million worth of  work at the end of the month but was budgeted to complete $10 million  worth of work, there would be a \u2013$5 million schedule variance.

Specifically, we  compared these policies and guidance documents to both Office of  Management and Budget requirements and key best practices recognized  within the federal government and industry for the implementation of  EVM. These best practices are contained in an exposure draft version of  our cost guide. We also interviewed key agency officials, including the  Director for Capital Planning and Investment Control, to obtain  information on the agency\u2019s ongoing and future EVM plans.", "To determine whether Treasury is adequately using EVM techniques to  manage critical system investments, we reviewed 6 of the 40 systems the  department required to use EVM. Specifically, we selected investments  from each of the four component agencies identified as having eligible  investments. We selected one investment from the Bureau of Public Debt,  another from Departmental Offices, and two from the Financial  Management Service and the Internal Revenue Service since they had a  greater percentage of investments using EVM. With the exception of the  Bureau of Public Debt which had only one major investment, we selected  investments based on (1) size, (2) EVM history (i.e., use of EVM for a long  enough period of time to have some history of EVM data), and (3)  completion date (i.e., those that would not end during the course of our  review). The 6 projects selected were FedDebt and Financial Information  and Reporting Standardization from the Financial Management Service,  DC Pension System to Administer Retirement (STAR) from the  Departmental Offices, Treasury Automated Auction Processing System  (TAAPS) from the Bureau of Public Debt, and Integrated Financial  System/Core Financial System and Enterprise Data Access Strategy from  the Internal Revenue Service. Our review was not intended to be  generalizable, but instead to illustrate the status of a variety of programs.", "To determine the extent of each program\u2019s implementation of sound EVM,  we compared program documentation to the 11 fundamental EVM  practices implemented on acquisition programs of leading organizations,  as identified in the Cost Assessment Guide. We determined whether the  program fully implemented, partially implemented, or did not implement  each of the practices. Finally, we interviewed program officials to obtain  clarification on how EVM practices are implemented and how the data are  validated and used for decision-making purposes. Regarding the reliability  of cost data, we did not test the adequacy of agency or contractor cost- accounting systems. Our evaluation of these cost data was based on what  we were told by the agency and the information they could provide.", "We conducted this performance audit from August 2007 to July 2008 in  Washington, D.C., in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the  audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable  basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We  believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Overview of Industry Guidelines that Support Sound Earned Value Management", "paragraphs": ["Organizations must be able to evaluate the quality of an EVM system in  order to determine the extent to which the cost, schedule, and technical  performance data can be relied on for program management purposes. In  recognition of this, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and  the Electronics Industries Alliance (EIA) jointly established a national  standard for EVM systems\u2014ANSI/EIA 748-B (commonly referred to as the  ANSI standard). This standard consists of 32 guidelines addressing  organizational structure; planning, scheduling, and budgeting; accounting  considerations; analysis and management reports; and revisions and data  maintenance. These standards comprise three fundamental management  functions for effectively using EVM: establishing a sound earned value  management system, ensuring that the EVM data are reliable, and using  earned value data for decision-making purposes.

It also plans to integrate the general ledger  guidance with the collection of all accounting trail balance data, thus providing a  standardized method of collecting, storing, reporting, and analyzing such data. Furthermore,  the investment is expected to facilitate accounting validations of the agency trial balance data  to provide better feedback to agencies concerning the accuracy and consistency of these  data.", "STAR is to assist Treasury and the District of Columbia Government by automating the  determination of eligibility, calculating pension benefits, and delivery of payments, therefore  allowing for (1) increased accuracy of pension benefit calculations and (2) improved  customer service. Key functionality for this investment includes serving annuitants and  survivors of the Judges Pension Plan; making benefit payments to 11,000 teachers, police,  and firefighters who retired before July 1997, as well as their survivors; and automatically  calculating the gross annuity and split benefit payment for teachers, police, and firefighters,  to service those annuitants who retired after June 1997.", "TAAPS is intended to ensure that all auction-related operations are carried out flawlessly and  securely. Key among auction activities are the announcement of upcoming Treasury  auctions; bid submission and processing; calculation of awards; publication of results;  creation and dissemination of settlement wires; creation of accounting reports and reports  needed for auctions analysis; and the storage of all securities-, bidder-, and auction-related  information. TAAPS is expected to make numerous intersystem interfaces and manual  processes obsolete by consolidating auction processing requirements into one system and  providing appropriate backup and disaster recovery systems and services.", "IFS is intended to operate as the Internal Revenue Services\u2019 (IRS) new accounting system of  record, replacing IRS\u2019s core financial systems, including expenditure controls, accounts  payable, accounts receivable, general ledger, budget formulation, and purchasing controls.
