Across Border Patrol's nine southwest border sectors, most apprehensions occurred in the Tucson sector in Arizona. GAO was asked to review how Border Patrol manages resources at the southwest border. This report examines (1) apprehension and other data Border Patrol collects to inform changes in border security for the southwest border and the Tucson sector, in particular; (2) how the Tucson sector compares with other sectors in scheduling agent deployment and to what extent data show that deployments have been effective; and (3) the extent to which Border Patrol has identified mechanisms to assess resource needs under its new strategic plan. GAO analyzed DHS documents and data from fiscal years 2006 to 2011, and interviewed officials in headquarters and five southwest border sectors selected based on cross-border illegal activity, among other things. Results cannot be generalized across the southwest border, but provided insights into Border Patrol operations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal year 2011, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) reported data meeting its goal to secure the land border with a decrease in apprehensions; our data analysis showed that apprehensions decreased within each southwest border sector and by 68 percent in the Tucson sector from fiscal years 2006 to 2011, due in part to changes in the U.S. economy and achievement of Border Patrol strategic objectives. These data generally mirrored the decrease in estimated known illegal entries across locations. Other data are used by Border Patrol sector management to assess efforts in securing the border against the threat of illegal migration, drug smuggling, and terrorism; and Border Patrol may use these data to assess border security at the national level as the agency transitions to a new strategic plan. Our analysis of these data indicated that in the Tucson sector, there was little change in the percentage of estimated known illegal entrants apprehended by Border Patrol over the past 5 fiscal years, and the percentage of individuals apprehended who repeatedly crossed the border illegally declined across the southwest border by 6 percent from fiscal years 2008 to 2011. Additionally, the number of drug seizures increased from 10,321 in fiscal year 2006 to 18,898 in fiscal year 2011, and apprehensions of aliens from countries determined to be at an increased risk of sponsoring terrorism increased from 239 in fiscal year 2006 to 309 in fiscal year 2010, but decreased to 253 in fiscal year 2011.", "The Tucson sector scheduled more agent workdays in fiscal year 2011 for enforcement activities related to patrolling the border than other sectors; however, data limitations preclude comparison of overall effectiveness in how each sector has deployed resources to secure the border.

Other sectors scheduled from 44 to 70 percent of agent enforcement workdays for patrolling the border. Border Patrol sectors assess how effectively they use resources to secure the border, but differences in how sectors collect and report the data preclude comparing results.", "Border Patrol issued guidance in September 2012 to improve the consistency of sector data collection and reporting, which may allow future comparison of performance. Border Patrol is developing key elements of its 2012-2016 Strategic Plan needed to define border security and the resources necessary to achieve it, but has not identified milestones and time frames for developing and implementing performance goals and measures in accordance with standard practices in program management. Border Patrol officials stated that performance goals and measures are in development for assessing the progress of agency efforts to secure the border between the ports of entry, and since fiscal year 2011, DHS has used the number of apprehensions on the southwest border as an interim goal and measure. However, as GAO previously testified, this interim measure does not inform program results and therefore limits DHS and congressional oversight and accountability. Milestones and time frames could assist Border Patrol in monitoring progress in developing goals and measures necessary to assess the status of border security and the extent to which existing resources and capabilities are appropriate and sufficient.

In May 2012 the Border Patrol issued  the 2012-2016 Border Patrol Strategic Plan (2012-2016 Strategic Plan).  Citing the buildup in border resources and the need to use these  enhanced capabilities most effectively, this new strategic plan  emphasizes using intelligence information to inform risk relative to threats  of cross-border terrorism, drug smuggling, and illegal migration across  locations; integrating border security operations with other law  enforcement partners to address threats; and developing rapid response  capabilities to deploy the resources appropriate to changes in threat.", "You asked us to review the approach used by Border Patrol to deploy and  manage resources along the U.S.-Mexico border in Arizona compared  with approaches used at other southwest border locations.

We chose this time period because fiscal year 2006 was  the first full year for which data were available following Border Patrol\u2019s  implementation of its 2004 Strategy. To assess the reliability of these  data, we spoke with Border Patrol headquarters officials who oversee the  maintenance and analyses of the data and with selected sector and  station officials regarding guidance and processes for collecting and  reporting data in regard to apprehensions of illegal entrants, seizures of  drugs and other contraband, and scheduling the deployment of agents  tracked in Border Patrol databases. We determined that these data were  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report. We conducted visits  and observed station and checkpoint operations within five Border Patrol  sectors on the southwest border: San Diego sector, California; Yuma  sector, Arizona; Tucson sector, Arizona; El Paso sector, Texas; and Rio  Grande Valley sector, Texas. We selected these sectors based on a  range of factors, including (1) threat level, (2) agency priorities for  resource deployment, (3) the use of enforcement strategies deemed  successful by Border Patrol in reducing cross-border illegal activity, and  (4) varied terrain and operational conditions. Among these five sectors,  we selected 21 Border Patrol stations to visit based on factors such as  the level of cross-border illegal activity as defined by Border Patrol data  and unique characteristics, such as terrain.

We analyzed data on apprehensions, seizures, apprehensions of  repeat offenders (recidivist rates), and apprehensions of aliens from  special interest countries (ASIC) by sector to obtain an overall view of  changes in cross-border illegal activity. For fiscal years 2010 and 2011,  we also analyzed data for apprehensions, seizures, and apprehensions of  ASICs by location, in terms of distance from the border. Further, we  analyzed data used by Border Patrol to estimate the number of known  illegal entries by sector. Although estimated known illegal entry data can  be compared within a sector over time, these data cannot be compared or  combined across sectors, as discussed later in this report. We also spoke  or corresponded with 13 ranchers who operated in the Tucson sector at  the time of our review to discuss border security issues. We selected  these ranchers based on input from various entities, including Border  Patrol and select organizations that are knowledgeable about border  security issues.

Border Patrol sectors and stations report this  overall effectiveness rate to headquarters. Border Patrol views its border  security efforts as increasing in effectiveness if the number of turn backs  as a percentage of estimated known illegal entries has increased and the  number of got aways as a percentage of estimated known illegal entries  has decreased.", "Our analysis of Tucson sector apprehension, turn back, and got away  data from fiscal years 2006 through 2011 showed that while Tucson  sector apprehensions remained fairly constant at about 60 percent of  estimated known illegal entries, the percentage of reported turn backs  increased from about 5 percent to about 23 percent, while the percentage  of reported got aways decreased from about 33 percent to about 13  percent, as shown in figure 12. As a result of these changes in the mix of  turn backs and got aways, Border Patrol data showed that enforcement  effort, or the overall effectiveness rate for Tucson sector, improved 20  percentage points from fiscal year 2006 to fiscal year 2011, from 67  percent to 87 percent. (See app. VIII for additional information.)", "Border Patrol data showed that the effectiveness rate for eight of the nine  sectors on the southwest border improved from fiscal years 2006 through  2011. The exception was the Big Bend sector, which showed a decrease  in the overall effectiveness rate, from 86 percent to 68 percent, during this  time period. Border Patrol headquarters officials said that differences in  how sectors define, collect, and report turn back and got away data used  to calculate the overall effectiveness rate preclude comparing  performance results across sectors. Border Patrol headquarters officials  stated that until recently, each Border Patrol sector decided how it would  collect and report turn back and got away data, and as a result, practices  for collecting and reporting the data varied across sectors and stations  based on differences in agent experience and judgment, resources, and  terrain. In terms of defining and reporting turn back data, for example,  Border Patrol headquarters officials said that a turn back was to be  recorded only if it is perceived to be an \u201cintended entry\u201d\u2014that is, the  reporting agent believed the entrant intended to stay in the United States,  but Border Patrol activities caused the individual to return to Mexico.  According to Border Patrol officials, it can be difficult to tell if an illegal  crossing should be recorded as a turn back, and sectors have different  procedures for reporting and classifying incidents. In terms of collecting  data, Border Patrol officials reported that sectors rely on a different mix of  cameras, sign cutting, credible sources, and visual observation to identify  and report the number of turn backs and got aways.additional information.)   (See app. IX for  According to Border Patrol officials, the ability to obtain accurate or  consistent data using these identification sources depends on various  factors, such as terrain and weather. For example, data on turn backs  and got aways may be understated in areas with rugged mountains and  steep canyons that can hinder detection of illegal entries. In other cases,  data may be overstated\u2014for example, in cases where the same turn back  identified by a camera is also identified by sign cutting. Double counting  may also occur when agents in one zone record as a got away an  individual who is apprehended and then reported as an apprehension in  another zone. As a result of these data limitations, Border Patrol  headquarters officials said that while they consider turn back and got  away data sufficiently reliable to assess each sector\u2019s progress toward  border security and to inform sector decisions regarding resource  deployment, they do not consider the data sufficiently reliable to  compare\u2014or externally report\u2014results across sectors.", "Border Patrol headquarters officials issued guidance in September 2012  to provide a more consistent, standardized approach for the collection  and reporting of turn back and got away data by Border Patrol sectors.  Each sector is to be individually responsible for monitoring adherence to  the guidance. According to Border Patrol officials, it is expected that once  the guidance is implemented, data reliability will improve.

Border Patrol officials said that they planned to develop and implement  key elements of the new strategic plan in fiscal years 2013 and 2014.", "According to Border Patrol officials, the Border Patrol 2012-2016  Strategic Plan identifies several key elements that are to inform agency  resource needs and deployment decisions. Border Patrol officials  reported in September 2012 that they were in the process of developing  an implementation plan that is to lay out how key elements of the new  strategic plan are to be implemented. Border Patrol officials reported that,  in general, key elements of the strategic plan are to be developed and  implemented during fiscal years 2013 and 2014. According to agency  officials, key strategic plan elements to be addressed by the  implementation plan that are to inform agency resource needs and  deployment decisions include (1) a process for identifying risk that is to  inform resource decisions, (2) the enhancement of mobile response  capabilities to redeploy resources to address the shifts in threat, and (3)  an approach to integrate partner resources and contributions to enhance  Border Patrol capabilities (\u201cwhole-of-government\u201d approach). Border  Patrol officials told us that these elements are interdependent and must  be developed, refined, and disseminated to the field to strengthen the  effectiveness of the new strategic plan. According to these officials,  delays in the development of one element would likely affect the  development of others. For example, delays in implementing the new risk  assessment tools could affect sectors\u2019 ability to identify appropriate  responses to changing levels of risk.", "Risk assessment tools. In September 2012, Border Patrol officials  said they were in the process of developing two tools that are to be  used in the field to identify and manage risk under the agency\u2019s new  risk management approach. The first tool for assessing risk is the  Operational Implementation Plan (OIP), a qualitative process that  prioritizes sector evaluations of border security threats and identifies  potential responses. Border Patrol is developing a second tool\u2014a  quantitative model called the Integrated Mission Analysis Tool  (IMAT)\u2014that is to, among other things, assess risk and capability by  predicting and identifying the need for various courses of action, such  as the rapid response of resources to the highest risks. Actions are to  be assessed based on a comparison of agency capability with risk. In  contrast to the OIP, the IMAT is to be completed at the zone level by  stations; consolidated station outputs may then be used by sectors to  inform the OIP process. The IMAT is to use data from various sources  to develop a \u201cBorder Assessment of Threat\u201d of known or potential  threats by zone and compare that assessment with a point-in-time  operational assessment of each sector\u2019s capability to determine to  what extent current capability\u2014including resources\u2014matches the  perceived risk. On the basis of the outcome, the station can then  choose from various predetermined courses of action to address the  perceived level of risk, such as reallocating resources or leveraging  external\u2014law enforcement partner\u2014resources. Once the IMAT is  fully implemented, Border Patrol plans for the resulting outputs to be  used to reassess and inform OIP decision making; information from  both systems is to be used to inform resource needs and deployment  decisions after the 2012-2016 Strategic Plan has been implemented.", "According to Border Patrol officials, both the OIP and the IMAT are to  identify risk and potential responses at the sector level. However,  these tools will not allow Border Patrol to assess and prioritize risks  and response options across sectors. Moreover, agency officials  said that when the IMAT is fully deployed, in fiscal year 2014, it will  not have the capacity to differentiate among threats related to  terrorists and their weapons, drugs and other illegal contraband, and  illegal migration (such as recidivism, in which individuals repeatedly  cross the border illegally). Border Patrol officials said the agency  plans to explore mechanisms for developing these capabilities\u2014 assessing risk across sectors and differentiating threat\u2014once OIP  and IMAT have been developed and implemented in fiscal year 2014.  According to Border Patrol headquarters officials, as of August 2012,  the agency was in the process of pilot testing the OIP and the IMAT in  the field and expected to begin to initially implement the OIP and  populate the IMAT through a web-based program that will record  baseline data on threat and operational conditions throughout fiscal  year 2013.", "Rapid deployment of resources. A second key element of the 2012- 2016 Strategic Plan is to increase mobility and rapid deployment of  personnel and resources to quickly counter and interdict threats  based on shifts in smuggling routes and tactical intelligence. As we  testified in May 2012, CBP reported expanding the training and  response capabilities of the Border Patrol\u2019s specialized response  teams to support domestic and international intelligence-driven and  antiterrorism efforts as well as other special operations. Additionally,  Border Patrol officials stated that in fiscal year 2011, Border Patrol  allocated 500 agent positions to provide a national group of  organized, trained, and equipped Border Patrol agents who are  capable of rapid movement to regional and national incidents in  support of high-priority CBP missions. However, we testified in May  2012 that Border Patrol officials had not fully assessed to what extent  the redeployment of existing resources would be sufficient to meet  security needs, or when additional resources would need to be  requested. In September 2012, Border Patrol officials said they had  not yet developed a process for assessing the need for, or  implementation of, rapid deployment of existing resources to mitigate  changing risk levels along the border, but expected to do so after  programs and processes\u2014key elements\u2014identified in the strategic  plan have been more fully developed. In the interim, deployment  decisions\u2014such as the redeployment of agents and mobile  technology to border areas identified as having greater, or  unacceptable, levels of risk\u2014are to be made at the sector level.", "Integrated partner resources. A third key element of the 2012-2016  Strategic Plan is the capability of Border Patrol and federal, state,  local, and international partners working together to quickly and  appropriately respond to changing threats through the timely and  effective use of personnel and other resources. According to the new strategic plan, this \u201cwhole of government\u201d approach will be  achieved through various efforts, including the expansion of  operational integration (the combining of best practices, capabilities  and strategies among partners) and jointly planned targeted  operations (the leveraging of combined partner assets to address  risks), the development and fusion of intelligence, and the creation of  integrated partnerships (the sharing of resources, plans, and  operations among partners). In December 2010, we recommended  that CBP develop policy and guidance necessary to identify, assess,  and integrate available partner resources in its operational  assessments and resource planning documents. CBP concurred  with this recommendation, but as of June 2012, Border Patrol had not  yet required partner resources to be incorporated into operational  assessments or into documents that inform the resource planning  process. Border Patrol headquarters officials said that the agency  has yet to finalize interim milestones for integrating partner resources  into Border Patrol operational assessments and resource planning  documents because it is still in the process of determining how  partner resources are to be integrated; however, Border Patrol plans  to have a process in place for that purpose in fiscal year 2014.", "According to Border Patrol officials, since the beginning of fiscal year  2011, as the agency began transitioning from the 2004 resource-based  strategy to the 2012-2016 risk-based strategic plan, the Border Patrol has  been using an interim process for assessing the need for additional  personnel, infrastructure, and technology in agency sectors. Border Patrol  officials said that resource needs using this interim process are intended  to maintain the current status of border security, and will be used until key  elements of the strategic plan\u2014such as the OIP and the IMAT\u2014that are  necessary to develop a new process have been implemented in fiscal  years 2013 and 2014. Under this interim process, Border Patrol has  maintained, with some exceptions, personnel and resource levels  established in fiscal year 2010, the last year in which operational control  was used as a performance goal and measure for border security.", "According to Border Patrol officials, under the new risk management  approach, the need for additional resources will be determined in terms of  unacceptable levels of risk caused by illegal activity across border  locations. Moreover, in considering ways to mitigate elevated risk levels,  Border Patrol will look to mechanisms other than resource enhancement  for expanding capacity, such as the rapid redeployment of resources from  locations with lower risk levels and the leveraging of partner resources  (i.e., a \u201cwhole of government\u201d approach). Border Patrol officials said that  use of the new risk assessment tools\u2014the OIP and the IMAT\u2014in making  decisions for resource requests will be made at the sector level. Until a  new process for identifying resource needs has been developed, sectors  will continue to use annual operational assessments to reflect specific  objectives and measures for accomplishing annual sector priorities, as  well as identifying minimum budgetary requirements necessary to  maintain the current status of border security in each sector.", "Border Patrol headquarters officials said that the resource levels  established at the end of fiscal year 2012 are to serve as a baseline  against which future needs are assessed, and that the personnel and  infrastructure in place across the southwest border by the end of fiscal  year 2012 should be sufficient to support the agency\u2019s transition to a risk- based strategy for securing the border. Key elements\u2014such as the OIP  and the IMAT\u2014of the strategic plan are necessary to evaluate the need  for resources; until these elements are in place, Border Patrol sectors are  to continue to request resources they have identified as necessary to  maintain the current status of border security. However, our review of  Border Patrol\u2019s fiscal year 2012 operational assessments showed that  sectors have continued to show concerns about resource availability. For  example, all nine southwest border sectors reported a need for new or  replacement technology to detect and track illegal activity, six southwest  border sectors reported a need for additional infrastructure (such as all- weather roads), and eight southwest border sectors reported a need for  additional agents to maintain or attain an acceptable level of border  security. Border Patrol officials stated that at the time these operational  assessments were developed\u2014in fiscal year 2011\u2014the agency had yet  to transition to the new risk-management approach under the 2012-2016  Strategic Plan and sectors were continuing to assess resource needs  according to the 2004 resource-based model. According to these  officials, Border Patrol has determined that for fiscal year 2013 resource  levels for most of the southwest border will remain constant, with the  exception of the Tucson and Rio Grande Valley sectors, because of  budget constraints. Border Patrol officials stated that the agency  recognizes the need to develop a new process for assessing resource  needs under the new risk management focus of the 2012-2016 Strategic  Plan and that this process will be different from the prior system, which  focused on increasing resources and activities at the border rather than  using existing resources to manage risk. As Border Patrol is in the initial  stages of developing and implementing the key elements of its 2012-2016  Strategic Plan, it is too early to assess how Border Patrol will identify the  level of resources needed to secure the border under the new plan."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Securing the nation\u2019s borders against the evolving threat of terrorism and  transnational crime is essential to the protection of the nation.

Given the nation\u2019s ongoing  need to identify and balance competing demands for limited resources,  linking necessary resource levels to desired outcomes is critical to  informed decision making. Accordingly, milestones and time frames\u2014 established as soon as possible\u2014for the development of performance  goals that define the levels of security\u2014or risk\u2014to be achieved at the  border could help ensure that goals are developed in a timely manner.  The establishment of such goals could help guide future border  investment and resources decisions. Similarly, milestones and time  frames for developing and implementing performance measures under  the new strategic plan that are linked to the Border Patrol\u2019s goal for  securing the border could better ensure accountability and oversight of  the agency\u2019s programs by better positioning it to show progress in  completing its efforts. Once established, border security performance  goals and measures would also support Border Patrol\u2019s efforts to assess  whether the key elements\u2014programs and processes\u2014of its new strategic  plan have brought the agency closer to its strategic goal of securing the  border."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To support the implementation of Border Patrol\u2019s 2012-2016 Strategic  Plan and identify the resources needed to achieve the nation\u2019s strategic  goal for securing the border, we recommend that the Commissioner of  Customs and Border Protection ensure that the Chief of the Office of  Border Patrol establish milestones and time frames for developing a performance goal, or goals, for border security between the POEs  that defines how border security is to be measured and a performance measure, or measures\u2014linked to a performance goal  or goals\u2014for assessing progress made in securing the border  between POEs and informing resource identification and allocation  efforts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to DHS for review and comment.

Establishing these milestones and time frames would meet the intent of  our recommendations, but doing so as soon as possible, as we reported,  would better position CBP to monitor progress in developing and  implementing goals and measures, which would provide DHS and  Congress with information on the results of CBP efforts to secure the  border between POEs and the extent to which existing resources and  capabilities are appropriate and sufficient. Further, DHS indicated that  Border Patrol cannot unilaterally develop a performance goal for border  security and define how it is to be measured, but can develop  performance goals that will likely become key components of an  overarching goal for border security. Since our recommendations were  directed at Border Patrol establishing milestones and time frames for  developing such goals and measures focused on border security between  the POEs, we believe that DHS\u2019s proposed actions for Border Patrol in  this area would meet the intent of our recommendations, as Border Patrol  has primary responsibility for securing the border between POEs.

Specifically, we  analyzed agency data related to Border Patrol performance and cross- border threats; policy, planning, and budget documents; sector  operational assessments; border security reports; operations manuals;  and strategic plans provided by Border Patrol. We interviewed Border  Patrol headquarters officials regarding data collection and analysis  procedures, strategic planning, operational assessments, and border  security programs and activities. We obtained relevant data from DHS  and Border Patrol databases for fiscal years 2006 through 2011. We  chose this time period because fiscal year 2006 was the first full year for  which data were available following Border Patrol\u2019s implementation of its  2004 National Border Patrol Strategy (2004 Strategy). To assess the  reliability of these data, we spoke with Border Patrol headquarters  officials who oversee the maintenance and analyses of the data and with  select sector and station officials regarding guidance and processes for  collecting and reporting data in regard to apprehensions of illegal  entrants, seizures of drugs and other contraband, and scheduling the  deployment of agents tracked in a Border Patrol database. We  determined that these data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of  this report.", "We conducted visits to five of the nine Border Patrol sectors on the  southwest border\u2014San Diego sector, California; Yuma sector, Arizona;  Tucson sector, Arizona; El Paso sector, Texas; and Rio Grande Valley  sector, Texas. We selected these sectors based on differences in (1) the  level of threat as defined by Border Patrol data, (2) agency priorities for  resource deployment, (3) the level of operational control achieved in fiscal  year 2010, (4) the use of enforcement strategies deemed successful by  the Border Patrol in reducing cross-border illegal activity, and (5) varied  terrain. Within these sectors we selected 21 Border Patrol stations to  visit based on factors such as the level of cross-border illegal activity as  defined by Border Patrol data and unique characteristics such as terrain  and topography. We visited both \u201cborder stations\u201d\u2014those having  international border miles\u2014and \u201cinterior stations\u201d\u2014those without  international border miles. Because Border Patrol officials identified the  Tucson sector as the highest-priority sector for resource deployment in  fiscal year 2011 and it had the highest level of cross-border illegal activity,  we conducted site visits to each of the eight stations. (See table 1 for the  Border Patrol sectors and stations we visited and the location of each  station relative to the border.)

Because of the complexity and amount of the data sets we  requested, Border Patrol queried apprehension and seizure data in two  groups, with different run dates. We analyzed Border Patrol  apprehension and seizure data by sector for each fiscal year to obtain an  overall view of cross-border illegal activity over time and the types of  threats in each sector. In addition, we analyzed apprehension data to  identify the number of repeat offenders (recidivism rate) and aliens from  special interest countries (ASIC) apprehended across years by sector, as  indicators of the extent to which deportable aliens with increased levels of  associated risk were apprehended.
