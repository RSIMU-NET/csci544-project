In addition, there have been long-standing concerns about how SSA responds to court decisions that conflict with its policies. GAO was asked to examine: (1) trends over the past decade in the number of appeals reviewed by the courts and their decisions, (2) reasons for court remands and factors contributing to them, and (3) SSA's process for responding to court decisions that conflict with agency policy.

More disability claims were remanded than affirmed, reversed, or dismissed over the period, and the proportion of total decisions that were remands ranged from 36 percent to 62 percent, with an average of 50 percent. Remanded cases often require SSA to re-adjudicate the claim, with the result that--along with the passage of time and new medical evidence--the majority of remanded cases result in allowances. According to SSA officials and outside observers, a range of errors prompted by heavy workloads is responsible for court remands of SSA's disability determinations, but data that would confirm or clarify the issue are incomplete and not well-managed. SSA has only recently begun collecting data on remands, and we found these data to be incomplete. Additionally, this information is collected by two different offices that have created somewhat different categories for the data, making some of the information inconsistent and possibly redundant. Meanwhile, SSA has acknowledged the need to reduce remands and, in 2006 along with other initiatives, introduced new decision-writing templates to improve efficiency and reduce errors. SSA has a process in place for determining whether appellate court decisions conflict with the agency's interpretation of disability statutes or regulations and has taken steps in recent years to align its national policies with appellate court decisions. For example, officials and stakeholders attributed a downward trend in appellate court decisions that conflict with agency policy to significant policy changes instituted by SSA in the mid-1990s. In addition, for those cases where the agency acceded to conflicting appellate court decisions by issuing acquiescence rulings within the related circuits, we found that about half of the rulings issued were eventually replaced with national policy.

We also grouped and analyzed district court decisions  by circuit for fiscal year 2005, the only year for which complete data by  circuit were available. Furthermore, we analyzed agency data on the  decisions SSA made after a case was remanded (i.e., allowances or denials  of claims) for fiscal years 1995 to 2005. We also analyzed these remand  data to identify trends over time and by circuit, a category that we created  using SSA data on claimant state of residence. SSA officials were  interviewed to gather information on potential reasons for any trends. To  address the second objective, we obtained data on cited reasons for  remands from two SSA databases that are maintained by two separate  offices in SSA responsible for litigating claims in court and re-adjudicating  remanded cases. We compared the data to determine how effectively SSA  was capturing information on reasons for remands within the agency. In  addition, we interviewed SSA officials and other stakeholder groups,  including federal court judges and claimant representatives, on reasons for  remands and factors that influenced them. For the third objective, we  interviewed SSA officials and obtained available documents on how SSA  determines whether a court of appeals decision conflicts with its policies  and what option to pursue to address conflicting decisions, e.g., appeal or  issue an acquiescence ruling whereby the agency agrees to abide by the  court judgment in future cases, albeit only in that jurisdiction. We also  obtained data on the number of acquiescence and other rulings that SSA  issued since establishing its regulations on acquiescence in 1990. For  acquiescence rulings, we further reviewed SSA\u2019s timeliness in issuing  acquiescence rulings, as well as the number issued by circuit and how SSA  replaced acquiescence rulings with nationwide policies. We were unable  to independently determine how significantly any given court decision  conflicted with SSA policy or whether SSA should have pursued one  option over another. We also interviewed SSA officials and relevant  stakeholders\u2014including selected federal court judges and claimant  representatives from the Seventh and Ninth circuits, which represent  those with the lowest and highest numbers of SSA policy changes  associated with acquiescence rulings\u2014to obtain information on how court  decisions and their related agency rulings have affected SSA\u2019s disability  adjudication policy in recent years. After interviewing officials and  reviewing related data reports and manuals, all quantitative data used in  this report were assessed and, with the exception of the reason for remand  data, were determined to be sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this  report.

In most  of the country currently, claimants who are denied initial or continuing  benefits by SSA may appeal their denials administratively up to three  times, each time for review by a different adjudicatory entity. These  entities are 1) the state disability determination service that performs the  initial review of disability claims and, in most states, a reconsideration  determination, 2) an administrative law judge (ALJ) in SSA\u2019s Office of  Disability Adjudication and Review, and 3) a group of appellate reviewing  officials within SSA known as the Appeals Council.

To help achieve  more consistent application of policy between the state disability  determination service level and the ALJ level, in 1996, SSA established the  process unification rulings, a set of nine Social Security rulings for all SSA  disability adjudicators to follow in matters involving difficult judgments,  such as the weight to be given to opinions of claimants\u2019 treating physicians  versus medical opinions from other sources, and the evaluation of pain  and other subjective symptoms.

According  to SSA officials, remanded cases are generally reviewed by the ALJ who  made the original decision. Judges can also dismiss a case if its scope is  outside the court\u2019s legal jurisdiction.  Furthermore, if SSA prefers not to  defend a case that has been filed, usually because of an error it has  identified, the agency may request that the judge remand the case back for  the agency\u2019s review.", "Court remands have implications for SSA\u2019s workload, the types of  decisions SSA adjudicators make on remanded cases, and the time  claimants must wait for decisions on their cases. Generally, when cases  are remanded, ALJs must perform new hearings, which could involve new  evidence presented at the time of court reviews. These remanded cases  add to the already high workloads that ALJs have in reviewing denials by  the agency\u2019s disability determination service offices. The load may also  affect ALJ decisions: In its September 2006 report, the Social Security  Advisory Board found a small correlation between increased ALJ  workload and increased allowances. Furthermore, although remanded  cases are given priority in the line of cases that must be reviewed by ALJs,  a substantial amount of time may pass before new decisions can be made  at this administrative level, and the ALJ\u2019s decision may undergo another  review by the Appeals Council.

However, few cases reach these  appellate court levels and most disability cases are resolved in the district  courts. According to SSA, no more than 20 district court cases have been  appealed by the agency to the appellate courts each year since 2000.

With the acquiescence ruling, SSA agrees to  follow the appellate court\u2019s holding on new cases only when they fall  within the jurisdiction of that appellate court. SSA rescinds an  acquiescence ruling if one of the following occurs: 1) the Supreme Court  overrules or limits the relevant appellate court decision; (2) an appellate  court overrules or limits itself on the relevant issue; (3) Congress enacts a  law that obviates the acquiescence ruling; or (4) SSA clarifies, modifies, or  revokes the regulation or ruling that was the subject of the pertinent  appellate court decision."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Disability Service Improvement Process", "paragraphs": ["With new regulations issued in March 2006, SSA began implementing the  Disability Service Improvement (DSI) process in August 2006 on a limited  basis\u2014i.e., in states in the Boston Region\u2014and plans to gradually roll out  the initiative to other regions.  The regulations include changes to the  appeals process within the agency that could potentially affect the number  and types of cases that will go to federal courts in the future. Among these  changes is the gradual replacement of the Appeals Council with a Decision  Review Board, designed to ensure the accuracy of SSA decisions and  reduce remands from federal courts. The Board would only review select  cases based on whether they are considered likely to have contained  errors or involved new policies, rules, and procedures. Under the DSI  process, claimants who are unhappy with ALJ decisions, therefore, could  no longer turn to the Appeals Council, but rather must appeal directly to  the federal courts. In our June 2006 testimony, we reported that the public  and stakeholders were concerned that replacing the Appeals Council with  a Decision Review Board may increase the number of cases appealed to,  and thus the workloads of, the federal courts. In its response to these  concerns, SSA officials maintained that DSI improvements will ultimately  reduce the need for court appeals and also reduce remands.

ALJs we interviewed  responded that addressing such evidence is sometimes very difficult and  cited cases in which the treating physician appeared to be simply  repeating claimants\u2019 opinions about their inability to work, rather than  offering substantive information about the conditions that would prevent  work. Some district judges agreed that considering and incorporating  medical evidence into a decision can be difficult, but stressed the  importance of articulated and well-documented opinions in order for  district court judges to make a decision other than to remand.", "Stakeholders we interviewed varied in their opinions regarding whether  requirements of the process unification rulings were overly cumbersome  and, therefore, resulted in remands. Members of the Appeals Council and  the Social Security Advisory Board staff we spoke with believe that the  process unification rulings provide important guidance, but have also  made procedures for making decisions and decision-writing more  cumbersome. On the other hand, representatives of the Association of  Administrative Law Judges told us that they have not heard such  complaints and, while acknowledging that decision-making involved more  work, believe the rules did not make decision-writing overly cumbersome.", "At the same time, many of those we interviewed, including ALJs and  district court judges, said the heavy ALJ workload was behind the  apparent errors in documenting agency determinations that lead to  remands. Some ALJs asserted that the frequency of court remands has not  been unreasonable considering the number of cases that they must  review. These ALJs also said their workload expectations of 50 to 60  hearings a month affected the time and attention they could give to each  case. They asserted that they would need to write significantly fewer  decisions in a month in order to assure that the work would withstand  scrutiny by the federal courts. They noted that other ALJs who are able to  write decisions that the courts uphold produce as few as five a month.  Because the time needed to review cases and write decisions varied,  however, representatives of the Association of Administrative Law Judges  were unable to suggest an ideal number of cases that would be reasonable  for ALJs to process. Specifically, these representatives said that decisions  to deny benefits take substantially longer to document than those  involving allowances. These representatives also stated that the number  and quality of staff that ALJs have available to help process and write  decisions vary.", "Finally, stakeholders also suggested that a variety of other factors  contribute to remands, such as: ALJs\u2019 providing poor instructions to  decision writers, SSA\u2019s not providing adequate feedback to ALJs on  reasons for remands, and federal courts\u2019 having bias against ALJs\u2019  decisions. Some stakeholders further stated that federal court bias may be  rooted in concerns over how well decisions are generally written,  expectations about how determinations should be made, and concerns  with the amount of time and attention given to cases under the current  workload.", "Acknowledging the need to address remands from the federal court, SSA  is taking steps to mitigate common documentation errors. One step has  been to promote the use of a decision-writing tool known as the Findings  Integrated Templates (FIT). This tool contains more than 1,600 templates  for presenting analysis of evidence and ensuring that required statutes and  regulations are followed. These templates are also designed to prevent  common mistakes, such as failure to establish an appropriate date for the  onset of disability benefits. SSA officials also said this tool is intended to  help manage workloads by reducing the potential for miscommunication  between ALJs and their staff and the time spent writing decisions.  According to SSA officials, SSA plans to monitor the extent to which  decisions written with this tool are remanded from the federal courts.  Appeals Council judges we interviewed have reviewed some decisions  written with FIT and have found them to be better articulated than  decisions that did not rely on this tool. However, both Appeals Council  judges and ALJ association representatives mentioned that the tool will  not replace the need for additional, competent decision-writing staff.", "Additionally, SSA is pursuing a broader set of initiatives under its  Disability Services Improvement (DSI) initiative that it hopes will result in  more accurate decisions earlier in the process and, thereby, ultimately  reduce workloads at the ALJ level. For example, as a part of DSI, SSA is  implementing an expedited determination process for clear-cut cases,  which it calls its Quick Disability Determinations. The agency also plans to  add a level of reviewing attorneys, known as federal reviewing officials,  who can affirm, reverse, or modify appealed agency decisions prior to  their reaching ALJs.

As a result, the lists of categories  used by these offices are not the same, and SSA officials told us that the  offices may well classify similar remands differently. Moreover, some  remand categories in the two data systems may be duplicative, resulting in  an inefficient use of agency resources. SSA officials acknowledged that  better data reliability and collaboration between the two offices are  needed and that, while the agency plans to develop a common vocabulary  for remand reasons, it has yet to develop specific plans and timetables for  addressing these issues.", "Through our conversations with SSA officials and reviews of reports, we  also found that these data were not consistently entered into the agency\u2019s  databases.

Some of the situations in which SSA would consider appealing to  the Supreme Court are: a conflict between circuits; an issue of exceptional  importance involving high visibility or significant funds; a statute or  regulation held by the courts to be unconstitutional; or an important  regulation held to be invalid.", "If SSA decides to follow the appellate court decision, it issues an  acquiescence ruling that applies only within that circuit. However, because  these rulings result in inconsistent policies throughout the country, the  agency has added a clarification in the preamble to its 1998 regulations  that acquiescence rulings are generally temporary policies that are not  intended to remain in effect permanently. Therefore, after issuing an  acquiescence ruling, SSA attempts to pursue a uniform national policy  through various means, such as modifying regulations or rules, issuing  new regulations or policy interpretations, seeking legislative changes, or  re-litigating the issue within the same circuit. When SSA successfully  incorporates the acquiescence ruling into national policy, it rescinds the  acquiescence ruling.", "When SSA finds it necessary to issue an acquiescence ruling, it has  procedures in place for informing adjudicators of these departures from  national policy. According to officials, SSA communicates these and other  rulings to SSA officials who make claims determinations, such as ALJs,  through a variety of sources including: the Federal Register, SSA\u2019s internal  operations manual, the agency\u2019s Web site, and e-mails. In some instances,  officials learn about these rulings through training sessions. However,  because most acquiescence rulings since the 1990s concerned narrow  issues, SSA officials said the rulings have not warranted special training  for adjudicators."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "SSA Has Taken Steps to Align Its Policies with Court Decisions by Issuing Acquiescence Rulings More Quickly and Following with Changes in National Policy", "paragraphs": ["SSA has taken steps to align its policies with the court decisions by issuing  acquiescence rulings in a timely manner and following up with changes to  its national policies. Since the implementation of its current acquiescence  policy, SSA has issued 45 acquiescence rulings, the majority of which  relate to determining whether a claimant is eligible for disability benefits.  (Fig. 8 shows the number of rulings issued each year from 1990 to 2006,  and app. V provides synopses of court holdings concerning disability  determinations that led to acquiescence rulings.) Most of these rulings  were issued between 1990 and 2000, when SSA published an average of  four acquiescence rulings per year. In contrast, during the 6-year period  from 2001 to 2006, the agency issued only five such rulings. SSA officials  attributed the decline in acquiescence rulings to implementation of its  process unification rulings, which they believe created less room for  differences of opinion between the courts and the agency regarding  broader policies.  Specifically, officials commented that the process  unification rulings clarified SSA policy as well as filled gaps in policy that  were previously open for the courts to fill, and noted that, while the courts  are not bound by these and other Social Security Rulings, the courts have  frequently deferred to SSA\u2019s rulings.  As a result, SSA has seen a decline  in the number of significant court cases involving disability law over time.  (See app. III for a listing of key court cases.)", "We found that the number of acquiescence rulings issued by SSA varied by  circuit during our study period (1990 to 2006), ranging from one in the  First Circuit to eight in the Ninth Circuit. (See fig. 9.)  SSA officials pointed  out that the number of acquiescence rulings the agency issues in a given  circuit is a function of the number and types of decisions issued by the  appellate court within that circuit. For example, officials said that the  Ninth Circuit has the largest disability caseload, and therefore, one would  expect it to have the highest number of acquiescence rulings. Also,  because the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decisions largely concerned technical issues,  SSA officials said they were less amenable to Supreme Court Review. This  official added that the Ninth as well as Eighth Circuits have had precedent- setting decisions.", "Since SSA established a regulation in 1998 that included a timeliness goal  for issuing acquiescence rulings, the promptness of issuances has  improved. (Fig. 10 depicts the timeliness of acquiescence rulings issued  from 1990 to 2006.) Prior to establishing the regulation, SSA took more  than a year to issue over 80 percent of the rulings. Since then, 54 percent  of acquiescence rulings were issued within the guideline of 120 days (or 4  months). For those rulings that were not issued within 120 days, in most  instances the timeliness goal did not apply because SSA either sought  further judicial review or needed to coordinate with DOJ or other federal  agencies.", "Once SSA has issued acquiescence rulings, the agency has frequently  succeeded in replacing them with uniform national policies. We found that  since 1990, nearly half of all acquiescence rulings (21 of 45) were  rescinded and replaced by more permanent guidance. Further, most of  these rescissions resulted from the agency\u2019s issuing or modifying rulings  or regulations. (Fig. 11 shows how acquiescence rulings were rescinded.)  According to officials, acquiescence rulings are most commonly rescinded  when the agency revises, publishes, or revokes rules and regulations\u2014 actions that are fully within the agency\u2019s control. Six other rescissions  occurred through other means: three from Supreme Court rulings  upholding SSA\u2019s policies and three from changes in law made by Congress.", "However, according to SSA, some issues brought about by federal court  decisions, such as those involving the Constitution or federal law, have led  to acquiescence rulings that have not been rescinded by the agency. For  example, acquiescence ruling 91-1(5), which involves a claimant\u2019s right to  cross-examine an examining physician, remains in effect because SSA  officials believe the only option for rescinding the ruling would require re- litigating the case. However, according to SSA officials, the relevant  circuit appellate court and the Supreme Court have declined to review this  ruling. Other reasons that acquiescence rulings may remain in effect  include a lack of practical implications of the acquiescence ruling for other  circuits or the fact that an acquiescence ruling was only recently issued.  Replacing the acquiescence ruling with nationwide policy typically takes a  significant period of time\u2014in one case, 16 years."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["On the whole, SSA has taken many steps to align its policies with court  decisions and establish uniform national standards. The fact that the  agency made some substantial changes to its policies in the mid-1990\u2019s  may account for the reduced incidence of acquiescence rulings in the past  5 years.", "On the other hand, the high proportion of remanded and awarded claims  for the past decade has likely cost SSA additional time and resources to  process, and may have impeded the timely award of benefits to eligible  individuals. While the DSI improvement initiative is designed to ameliorate  this problem, the lack of reliably collected and well-managed data on court  remands is likely to inhibit that effort. Although SSA plans, through the  implementation of DSI, to gradually address the heavy workload that has  been cited by many for contributing to errors that lead to remands, the  agency cannot pinpoint specific reasons for remands and take corrective  action without more reliable data. To the degree that the agency does  collect some data, the fact that collection is carried out by two different  offices risks inconsistency and divergent interpretations. This lack of  complete and consistent information ultimately undermines the agency\u2019s  ability to serve people with disabilities and their families."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["To ensure the agency has accurate and well-managed information to use in  identifying corrective actions for reducing remands, we recommended that  the Commissioner of SSA implement the following two measures:  take steps to ensure the reliability of data on reasons for remands, and    coordinate agency data collection on remands and ascertain how best  to use this information to reduce the proportion of cases remanded by  federal courts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["SSA provided us with comments on a draft of this report, which we have  reprinted in appendix VI.

To obtain information on these  issues, we collected relevant quantitative and qualitative data from SSA;  interviewed SSA officials and stakeholders within and outside the agency,  such as district court judges, claimant representatives and experts; and  reviewed agency policies and regulations that address appellate court  rulings that conflict with SSA disability program policies. To determine the  completeness and accuracy of data we obtained, we took steps, described  below, and determined that these data, with the exception of reasons for  remand, were sufficiently reliable for use in this report. We conducted this  work between February 2006 and January 2007 according to generally  accepted government auditing standards.", "To address the first research objective, we obtained national data from  SSA on the number and decisions of cases reviewed by federal district  courts\u2014the first level of federal court review\u2014for fiscal years 1995 to  2005 and analyzed these data for trends over time. Our analysis excluded  cases that were dismissed because dismissals are generally decided on  technical and procedural grounds rather than on the merits of the claim.  For fiscal year 2005, the only year for which complete data were available,  we obtained information from SSA on court decisions by state. We then  categorized and analyzed these data by circuit. Furthermore, we obtained  and analyzed agency data on the decisions SSA made on disability cases  after they were remanded (i.e., allowances or denials of claims) for fiscal  years 1995 to 2005. We also categorized and analyzed these data by circuit  using information on the claimant\u2019s state of residence. SSA officials were  interviewed to gather information on potential reasons for any trends. In  addition, we interviewed SSA officials and reviewed previously issued  agency reports and data manuals to assess the reliability of these data.", "To address the second objective, we also obtained data on cited reasons  for remands from two SSA databases, the Case Processing and  Management System (CPMS), and the National Docketing/Management  Information System (NDMIS), which are maintained by two separate  offices in SSA responsible for re-adjudicating remanded cases and  litigating claims in court. We compared the data to determine how and  what SSA is reporting on reasons for remands within the agency. After  interviewing agency officials and reviewing reports, we determined that  these data were not sufficiently reliable for providing detailed information  on reasons for remands, although some information was used to illustrate  what SSA currently collects. In addition, we interviewed SSA officials and  other stakeholder groups, including federal court judges and claimant  representatives from the Seventh and Ninth circuits and experts, on  reason for remands and factors that influenced them. Stakeholders from  these two circuits were selected because these jurisdictions represent  those with the lowest and highest numbers of SSA policy changes resulting  from acquiescence rulings. Information from these interviews is not  generalizable to all circuits or stakeholders.", "For the third objective, we interviewed SSA officials and obtained  available documents on how SSA determines whether a court of appeals  decision conflicts with its policies and what option to pursue to address  conflicting decisions, e.g., appeal or issue an acquiescence ruling whereby  the agency agrees to abide by the court judgment in future cases, albeit  only in that jurisdiction. We also obtained data on the number of  acquiescence and other rulings that SSA issued since establishing its  policy of acquiescence in 1990. For acquiescence rulings, we further  reviewed SSA\u2019s timeliness in issuing acquiescence rulings as well as the  number issued by circuit and how SSA replaced acquiescence rulings with  nationwide policies. We were unable to independently determine the  extent to which court decisions conflicted with SSA policy or whether SSA  should have pursued one option over another.
