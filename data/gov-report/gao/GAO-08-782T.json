DOD has taken some action to improve acquisition outcomes, but its weapon programs continue to take longer, cost more, and deliver fewer capabilities than originally planned. These persistent problems--coupled with current operational demands--have impelled DOD to work outside of its traditional acquisition process to acquire equipment that meet urgent warfighter needs. Poor outcomes in DOD's weapon system programs reverberate across the entire federal government. Over the next 5 years, DOD plans to invest about $900 billion to develop and procure weapon systems--the highest level of investment in two decades. Every dollar wasted on acquiring weapon systems is less money available for other priorities. This testimony describes DOD's current weapon system investment portfolio, the problems that contribute to cost and schedule increases, and the potential impacts of recent legislative initiatives and DOD actions aimed at improving outcomes. It also provides some observations about what is needed for DOD to achieve lasting reform. The testimony is drawn from GAO's body of work on DOD's acquisition, requirements, and funding processes, as well as its most recent annual assessment of selected DOD weapon programs."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["DOD's portfolio of weapon system programs has grown at a pace that far exceeds available resources. From 1992 to 2007, the estimated acquisition costs remaining for major weapons programs increased almost 120 percent, while the annual funding provided for these programs only increased 57 percent. Current programs are experiencing, on average, a 21-month delay in delivering initial capabilities to the warfighter--often forcing DOD to spend additional funds on maintaining legacy systems. Systemic problems both at the strategic and at the program level underlie cost growth and schedule delays. At the strategic level, DOD's processes for identifying warfighter needs, allocating resources, and developing and procuring weapon systems--which together define DOD's overall weapon system investment strategy--are fragmented and broken. At the program level, weapon system programs are initiated without sufficient knowledge about system requirements, technology, and design maturity. Lacking such knowledge, managers rely on assumptions that are consistently too optimistic, exposing programs to significant and unnecessary risks and ultimately cost growth and schedule delays. At the same time, frequent turnover of program managers and an increased reliance on contractors increases the government's risk of losing accountability. Recognizing the need for more discipline and accountability in the acquisition process, Congress recently enacted legislation part of which requires decision-makers to certify that programs meet specific criteria at key decision points early in the acquisition process. Likewise, DOD has recently begun to develop several initiatives that are based in part on congressional direction and GAO recommendations. If adopted and implemented properly, these measures could provide a foundation for establishing a well balanced investment strategy, sound business cases for major weapon system acquisition programs, and a better chance to spend resources wisely. While legislation and policy revisions can help guide change, DOD must begin making better choices that reflect joint capability needs and match requirements with resources or the department will continue to experience poor acquisition outcomes. DOD investment decisions continue to be dictated by the services who propose programs that overpromise capabilities and underestimate costs to capture the funding needed to start and sustain development programs. The transitory nature of leadership further undermines successful reform. To better ensure warfighter capabilities are delivered when needed and as promised, incentives must encourage a disciplined, knowledge-based approach, and a true partnership with shared goals must be developed among the department, the military services, the Congress, and the defense industry."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss the Department of Defense\u2019s  (DOD) management of its major weapon system acquisitions\u2014an area that  has been on GAO\u2019s high risk list since 1990.

Our work was  conducted in May 2008 in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards.

While DOD is committing substantially more investment  dollars to develop and procure new weapon systems, our analysis shows  that the 2007 portfolio is experiencing greater cost growth and schedule  delays than the fiscal years 2000 and 2005 portfolios (see table 1). For  example, total acquisition costs for programs in DOD\u2019s fiscal year 2007  portfolio have increased 26 percent from first estimates\u2014compared to a  6-percent increase for programs in its fiscal year 2000 portfolio.

Put  simply, cost growth reduces DOD\u2019s buying power. As program costs  increase, DOD must request more funding to cover the overruns, make  trade-offs with existing programs, delay the start of new programs, or take  funds from other accounts. Delays in providing capabilities to the  warfighter result in the need to operate costly legacy systems longer than  expected, find alternatives to fill capability gaps, or go without the  capability. The warfighter\u2019s urgent need for the new weapon system is  often cited when the case is first made for developing and producing the  system. However, DOD has already missed fielding dates for many  programs and many others are behind schedule.

While DOD\u2019s requirements process provides a framework for reviewing  and validating needs, it does not adequately prioritize those needs and is  not agile enough to meet changing warfighter demands. A senior Army  acquisition official recently testified before Congress that because the  process can take more than a year, it is not suitable for meeting urgent  needs related to ongoing operations; and a recent study by the Center for  Strategic and International Studies indicates that the process is unwieldy  and officials are now trying to find ways to work around it. Ultimately, the  process produces more demand for new programs than available  resources can support. This imbalance promotes an unhealthy competition  for funds that encourages programs to pursue overly ambitious  capabilities, develop unrealistically low cost estimates and optimistic  schedules, and to suppress bad news. Similarly, DOD\u2019s funding process  does not produce an accurate picture of the department\u2019s future resource  needs for individual programs\u2014in large part because it allows programs to  go forward with unreliable cost estimates and lengthy development  cycles\u2014not a sound basis for allocating resources and ensuring program  stability. Invariably, DOD and the Congress end up continually shifting  funds to and from programs\u2014undermining well-performing programs to  pay for poorly performing ones."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Initiating Programs with Unexecutable Business Cases Sets Them Up to Fail", "paragraphs": ["At the program level, the key cause of poor outcomes is the consistent  lack of disciplined analysis that would provide an understanding of what it  would take to field a weapon system before system development.  Our  body of work in best practices has found that an executable business case  is one that provides demonstrated evidence that (1) the identified needs  are real and necessary and that they can best be met with the chosen  concept and (2) the chosen concept can be developed and produced  within existing resources\u2014including technologies, funding, time, and  management capacity. Although DOD has taken steps to revise its  acquisition policies and guidance to reflect the benefits of a knowledge- based approach, we have found no evidence of widespread adoption of  such an approach in the department. Our most recent assessment of major  weapon systems found that the vast majority of programs began  development with unexecutable business cases, and did not attain, or plan  to achieve, adequate levels of knowledge before reaching design review  and production start\u2014the two key junctures in the process following  development start (see figure 2).", "Knowledge gaps are largely the result of a lack of disciplined systems  engineering analysis prior to beginning system development. Systems  engineering translates customer needs into specific product requirements  for which requisite technological, software, engineering, and production  capabilities can be identified through requirements analysis, design, and  testing. Early systems engineering provides knowledge that enables a  developer to identify and resolve gaps before product development begins.  Because the government often does not perform the proper up-front  analysis to determine whether its needs can be met, significant contract  cost increases can occur as the scope of the requirements change or  become better understood by the government and contractor. Not only  does DOD not typically conduct disciplined systems engineering prior to  beginning system development, it has allowed new requirements to be  added well into the acquisition cycle. The acquisition environment  encourages launching ambitious product developments that embody more  technical unknowns and less knowledge about the performance and  production risks they entail. A new weapon system is not likely to be  approved unless it promises the best capability and appears affordable  within forecasted available funding levels. We have recently reported on  the negative impact that poor systems engineering practices have had on  several programs such as the Global Hawk Unmanned Aircraft System,   F-22A, Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle, Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff  Missile and others.", "With high levels of uncertainty about technologies, design, and  requirements, program cost estimates and related funding needs are often  understated, effectively setting programs up for failure. We recently  assessed the service and independent cost estimates for 20 major weapon  system programs and found that the independent estimate was higher in  nearly every case, but the difference between the estimates was typically  not significant. We also found that both estimates were too low in most  cases, and the knowledge needed to develop realistic cost estimates was  often lacking. For example, program Cost Analysis Requirements  Description documents\u2014used to build the program cost estimate\u2014are not  typically based on demonstrated knowledge and therefore provide a shaky  foundation for estimating costs. Cost estimates have proven to be off by  billions of dollars in some of the programs we reviewed. For example, the  initial Cost Analysis Improvement Group estimate for the Expeditionary  Fighting Vehicle program was about $1.4 billion compared to a service  estimate of about $1.1 billion, but development costs for the system are  now expected to be close to $3.6 billion. Estimates this far off the mark do  not provide the necessary foundation for sufficient funding commitments  and realistic long-term planning.", "Constraining development cycles would make it easier to more accurately  estimate costs, and as a result, predict the future funding needs and  effectively allocate resources. We have consistently emphasized the need  for DOD\u2019s weapon programs to establish shorter development cycles.  DOD\u2019s conventional acquisition process often requires as many as 10 or 15  years to get from program start to production. Such lengthy cycle times  promote program funding instability\u2014especially when considering DOD\u2019s  tendency to change requirements and funding as well as frequent changes  in leadership. Constraining cycle times to 5 or 6 years would force  programs to conduct more detailed systems engineering analyses, lend  itself to fully funding programs to completion, and thereby increase the  likelihood that their requirements can be met within established time  frames and available resources. An assessment of DOD\u2019s acquisition  system commissioned by the Deputy Secretary of Defense in 2006 similarly  found that programs should be time-constrained to reduce pressure on  investment accounts and increase funding stability for all programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Accountability Suffers When Program Managers Lack the Authority to Shape Programs", "paragraphs": ["When DOD consistently allows unsound, unexecutable programs to pass  through the requirements, funding, and acquisition processes,  accountability suffers. Program managers cannot be held accountable  when the programs they are handed already have a low probability of  success. In addition, program managers are not empowered to make go or  no-go decisions, have little control over funding, cannot veto new  requirements, and have little authority over staffing. At the same time,  program managers frequently change during a program\u2019s development.   Our analysis indicates that the average tenure for managers on 39 major  acquisition programs started since March 2001 was about 17 months\u2014less  than half the length of the average system development cycle time of 37  months. Such frequent turnover makes it difficult to hold program  managers accountable for the business cases that they are entrusted to  manage and deliver.", "The government\u2019s control over and accountability for decisions is  complicated by DOD\u2019s growing reliance on technical, business, and  procurement expertise supplied by contractors. This reliance can reach a  point where the foundation on which decisions are based may be largely  crafted by individuals who are not employed by the government, who are  not bound by the same rules governing their conduct, and who are not  required to disclose whether they have financial or other personal  interests that conflict with the responsibilities they have performing  contract tasks for DOD. Further, in systems development, DOD typically  uses cost-reimbursement contracts, in which DOD generally pays the  allowable costs incurred for the contractor\u2019s best efforts, to the extent  provided by the contract.

The department acknowledges that any actions  taken to improve accountability must be based on a foundation whereby  program managers can launch and manage programs toward greater  performance, rather than focusing on maintaining support and funding for  individual programs. DOD acquisition leaders have told us that any  improvements to program managers\u2019 performance hinge on the success of  these departmental initiatives.", "In addition, DOD has taken actions to strengthen the link between award  and incentive fees with desired program outcomes, which has the  potential to increase the accountability of DOD programs for fees paid and  of contractors for results achieved.", "If adopted and implemented properly these actions could provide a  foundation for establishing sound, knowledge-based business cases for  individual acquisition programs, and the means for executing those  programs within established cost, schedule, and performance goals."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations on Achieving Successful and Lasting Reform", "paragraphs": ["DOD understands what it needs to do at the strategic and at the program  level to improve acquisition outcomes. The strategic vision of the current  Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics  acknowledges the need to create a high-performing, boundary-less  organization\u2014one that seeks out new ideas and new ways of doing  business and is prepared to question requirements and traditional  processes. Past efforts have had similar goals, yet we continue to find all  too often that DOD\u2019s investment decisions are service- and program- centric and that the military services overpromise capabilities and  underestimate costs to capture the funding needed to start and sustain  development programs. This acquisition environment has been  characterized in many different ways. For example, some have described it  as a \u201cconspiracy of hope,\u201d in which industry is encouraged to propose  unrealistic cost estimates, optimistic performance, and understated  technical risks during the proposal process and DOD is encouraged to  accept these proposals as the foundation for new programs. Either way, it  is clear that DOD\u2019s implied definition of success is to attract funds for new  programs and to keep funds for ongoing programs, no matter what the  impact. DOD and the military services cannot continue to view success  through this prism. Adding pressure to this environment are changes that  have occurred within the defense supplier base. In 2006, a DOD- commissioned study found that the number of fully competent prime  contractors competing for programs had been reduced from more than 20  in 1985 to only 6. This limits DOD\u2019s ability to maximize competition to  reduce costs and encourage innovation.", "More legislation can be enacted and policies can be written, but until DOD  begins making better choices that reflect joint capability needs and  matches requirements with resources, the acquisition environment will  continue to produce poor outcomes. It should not be necessary to take  extraordinary steps to ensure needed capabilities are delivered to the  warfighter on time and within costs. Executable programs should be the  natural outgrowth of a disciplined, knowledge-based process. While DOD\u2019s  current policy supports a knowledge-based, evolutionary approach to  acquiring new weapons, in practice decisions made on individual  programs often sacrifice knowledge and realism in favor of revolutionary  solutions. Meaningful and lasting reform will not be achieved until DOD  changes the acquisition environment and the incentives that drive the  behavior of DOD decision-makers, the military services, program  managers, and the defense industry. Finally, no real reform can be  achieved without a true partnership among all these players and the  Congress.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes my prepared statement.
