Treasury conducted an impact evaluation, using statistical methods to compare lending among SBLF banks to a control group of non-SBLF banks that are as similar as possible to participating SBLF banks. This rigorous approach is a significant improvement over Treasury's previous analyses because it is designed to isolate the impact of the program and provides greater confidence that any differences observed between SBLF and non-SBLF banks are attributable to the program rather than to other factors. Treasury's impact evaluation estimated that 23 percentage points of the increase in small business lending among SBLF banks is attributable to the program. Although Treasury's previous, less rigorous analyses suggested that SBLF banks increased lending by as much as 45 percentage points more than non-SBLF banks, these analyses did not attempt to isolate the impact of SBLF from other factors. Treasury published its impact evaluation in appendixes in its three most recent Lending Growth Reports . However, it did not discuss the results of the evaluation in the summary or body of the reports and has not utilized the control group to update the results. Relevant resources on program evaluations indicate that the most rigorous evidence should be presented most prominently. Because Treasury has not effectively presented or updated its impact evaluation results, stakeholders may not benefit from the most rigorous and recent information on the effect of SBLF.", "SSBCI. Treasury established targets for selected measures to monitor program performance and has taken steps to enhance the design of its planned program evaluation. Treasury established a target for one of its existing performance measures and also developed new performance measures and targets. For example, Treasury established a target for its existing performance measure on the amount of private-sector funds leveraged using SSBCI funds and created a new performance measure and target related to the amount of funds disbursed to states. To select and establish the new performance measures and targets, agency officials stated that they used the program objectives stated in the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 and information from participants' annual 2013 reports.

Using a formula contained in the Small Business Jobs  Act of 2010, Treasury calculated the amount of SSBCI funding for which  each of the 50 states, as well as the District of Columbia, the  Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Commonwealth of the Northern  Mariana Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the United States Virgin  Islands, were eligible to apply. This formula takes into account a state\u2019s  job losses in proportion to the aggregate job losses of all states. In  addition to states, the act granted permission to municipalities to apply  directly for funding under SSBCI in the event that their state did not apply  for funding. Municipalities in Alaska, North Dakota, and Wyoming used  this option.

Under a CAP, when a participating  lender originates a loan, the lender and borrower combine to contribute  an amount equal to a percentage of the loan to a loan reserve fund, which  is held by the lender. Under SSBCI, the contribution must be from 2  percent to 7 percent of the amount borrowed. Typically, the contribution  ranges from 3 percent to 4 percent. The SSBCI participant then matches  the combined contribution and sends that amount to the lender, which  deposits the funds into the lender-held reserve fund. Under SSBCI,  approved CAPs are eligible to receive federal contributions to the reserve  funds held by each participating financial institution in an amount equal to  the total amount of the contributions paid by the borrower and the lender  on a loan-by-loan basis.", "In addition, the following OCSPs are examples of programs eligible to  receive funding under the act:", "Collateral support programs: A Collateral Support Program is  designed to enable financing that might otherwise be unavailable due  to a collateral shortfall.

In most cases,  the SSBCI participant sets aside funds in a dedicated reserve or  account to collateralize the guarantee of a specified percentage of  each approved loan. The guarantee percentage is determined by the  participants and lenders but, under SSBCI, may not exceed 80  percent of loan losses.", "Venture capital programs: These programs provide investment capital  to create and grow start-ups and early-stage businesses, often in one  of two forms: (1) an SSBCI participant-run venture capital fund (which  may include other private investors) that invests directly in  businesses, or (2) a fund of funds, which is a fund that invests in other  venture capital funds that in turn invest in individual businesses.", "Direct loan programs: Although Treasury does not consider these  programs to be a separate SSBCI program type, it acknowledges that  some states may identify programs that they plan to support with  SSBCI funds as direct loan programs. The programs that some  participants label as direct loan programs are viewed by Treasury as  co-lending programs categorized as loan participation programs,  which have lending structures that are allowable under the statute.", "OCSPs approved to receive SSBCI funds are required to target small  businesses with an average size of 500 or fewer employees and to target  support toward loans with an average principal amount of $5 million or  less. In addition, these programs cannot lend to borrowers with more than  750 employees or make any loans in excess of $20 million.", "After their applications were approved, the SSBCI participants entered  into Allocation Agreements with Treasury before they received their  funds. SSBCI Allocation Agreements are signed by Treasury and  participants, and they outline how recipients are to comply with program  requirements. The act requires that each participant receive its SSBCI  funds in three disbursements or tranches of approximately one-third of its  approved allocation. As part of its request to receive the second and third  disbursements, a participant must certify that it has expended,  transferred, or obligated 80 percent or more of the previous  disbursement. When participants request subsequent disbursements,  Treasury may also review a sample of the participant\u2019s transactions for  compliance with SSBCI requirements.

The budget justification states that a  second round of funding, which would begin in 2015 and run through  2021, will expand on the success of the first round, capitalize on new  working relationships between states and small business lenders and  investors, and strengthen the federal government\u2019s relationships with  state economic development agencies. In May 2014, members of the  United States Senate and House of Representatives proposed  companion bills, titled the Small Business Access to Capital Act of 2014,  which would reauthorize SSBCI.

In addition, Treasury officials stated they considered data from  participants\u2019 quarterly reports and considered states\u2019 disbursement and  modification requests to support the proposed $1.5 billion in additional  SSBCI funding. Treasury officials indicated that there is demand for  additional funding as participants approach their third disbursement. In  addition, the rate at which some participants are using their funds  indicates additional demand. Specifically, Treasury officials stated they  were confident that some participants could use the additional funding  based on the 12-month rate of expended, obligated, and transferred  funds among participants.", "To support the proposal for both a competitive process and need-based  formula, Treasury officials stated they considered the variation among  participants regarding the speed at which funds were disbursed and the  impact of the funds, as well as current market conditions in certain areas.  Treasury officials stated that they introduced a competitive funding  element because some participants were able to more quickly disburse  SSBCI funds, demonstrated greater impact using the funds, and  demonstrated greater capacity to establish relationships with private  lenders and investors. The budget proposal states that the competitive  funds would be awarded to states on the basis of their ability to target  underserved groups, leverage federal funding, and evaluate results.  Officials stated that they proposed maintaining a need-based allocation  method because their analysis of market conditions indicated that some  areas continued to have significant needs for increased access to capital.  The proposal states that the need-based award would be allocated based  on economic factors such as job losses and pace of economic recovery.  Treasury has not proposed additional details regarding the structure of  the proposed additional funding, according to agency officials. However,  officials stated that they would recommend that certain features of the  program be maintained, such as keeping the five program types,  maintaining the 10 to 1 public to private leverage ratio, and emphasizing  increasing access to underserved communities.", "Some participants we interviewed said they were better positioned than  others to continue their efforts in the absence of additional SSBCI  funding. Participants recognized that additional funds would allow them to  meet current demand for existing programs, provide funds more  consistently, or explore adding additional programs to meet other  economic development needs in the state. Eight of the 10 participants we  interviewed stated that recycled funds would play a role in continuing their  SSBCI-funded efforts. Two participants indicated that some discussions  had been held at the state level about providing state funds to continue  efforts currently funded by SSBCI.

This  rigorous approach estimated the impact of the program and is a  significant improvement over its previous comparison assessments of the  SBLF program which did not attempt to isolate impact. However, while  Treasury discussed the results of its previous comparisons in the body of  its Lending Growth Reports, it discussed the results of its more rigorous  impact evaluation less prominently and included them only in the  appendixes of the reports.

See GAO-12-183 and GAO 14-135. adjust for differences between treatment and control groups.instance, SBLF banks are considered the treatment group, and banks  that are similar to participating SBLF banks yet did not participate in the  program are considered the control group. To conduct its propensity  score matching approach, Treasury selected a control group of banks that  are as similar as possible to participating SBLF banks along a number of  relevant and observable participant characteristics. Specifically, Treasury  incorporated a broad set of 71 observable financial and market variables  that could affect a bank\u2019s likelihood of participating in the program. These  variables include balance sheet measures, financial performance  measures, capitalization, and loan composition, among others. Using the  observable financial and market variables, Treasury achieved similarity  between the two groups of banks by estimating the propensity to  participate in the program for participants and nonparticipants alike and  then matching nonparticipants to participants with a similar propensity to  participate. Treasury officials stated they chose the propensity score  matching approach because it makes similar comparisons as their  previous assessments in that the propensity score matching approach  also compares lending between SBLF banks and a selected control group  of banks.", "Treasury\u2019s impact evaluation of the program estimated that SBLF resulted  in a median increase of 23 percentage points in small business lending,  relative to the most similar control group of banks that did not participate  in SBLF. In other words, when controlling for observable variables, the  evaluation estimates that 23 percentage points of the increase in small  business lending among SBLF banks is attributable to the program.  Because the propensity score matching approach results in a carefully  selected control group of non-SBLF banks that is as similar as possible to  participating SBLF banks, lending among the control group banks can be  used to estimate lending among SBLF banks if they had not participated  in the program. Specifically, the propensity score matching approach  estimated that the average lending of SBLF banks may have increased  by 29 percent in the absence of the program (i.e., the median change in  lending over baseline among propensity score matched banks). However,  the average lending of participating SBLF banks increased by 52 percent,  23 percentage points more than non-SBLF banks. This difference  represents the estimated impact of SBLF. It is difficult to interpret the  magnitude of the results of Treasury\u2019s impact evaluation as other  evaluations on entrepreneurial assistance\u2014including support for small  businesses\u2014are not comparable because they did not evaluate program  impact on increasing small business lending. However, because SBLF  participants might have increased their lending by 29 percent in the  absence of the program, 23 additional percentage points in small  business lending is a meaningful increase.", "Treasury has developed and refined its approach to assessing SBLF, and  its impact evaluation is a distinct improvement over its previous  comparisons between SBLF banks and groups of non-SBLF banks. While  some differences between participants and nonparticipants may be  unobserved, such as anticipated demand for small business lending, the  control group Treasury developed based on propensity score matching  addresses the observable differences among SBLF and non-SBLF banks  in an effort to isolate the impact of the program. Previous assessments,  however, did not adequately address observable differences between  SBLF and non-SBLF banks and did not attempt to isolate the impact of  the program. In its earliest approach to assess SBLF, Treasury has  compared lending among SBLF banks to small and medium-sized banks,  which suggested that SBLF banks increased business lending by 45  percentage points more than non-SBLF banks as of September 30, 2013  (see fig. 6). To improve its approach to assessing the program,  Treasury also conducted a peer group comparison by which it compared  SBLF banks to a group of peer banks matched according to size,  geography, and the Texas Ratio, a measure of asset quality. Treasury  officials described these characteristics as common and intuitive for  comparing financial institutions. The peer group comparison suggested  that SBLF banks increased business lending by about 41 percentage  points more than peer group banks as of September 30, 2013. As we  stated in our prior reports, these two analyses did not fully identify how  SBLF has affected participants\u2019 lending compared to other factors that   While the peer group comparison  could explain the increase in lending.method was valuable because the peer group was more similar to SBLF  banks than the general population of small banks, it omitted important  characteristics that could influence small business lending among SBLF  participants and nonparticipants, such as liquidity or loan growth rate. The  propensity score matching approach attempted to address these  limitations because it identified a control group of banks that is similar to  SBLF participants along a very broad set of characteristics, which  provides greater confidence that any differences observed between  participants and nonparticipants are attributable to the program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Treasury Has Not Effectively Communicated or Updated the Results of Its Impact Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["Treasury adopted a generally accepted and rigorous approach to conduct  an impact evaluation, as we recommended, but its presentation did not  communicate the results as effectively as possible. In its Lending Growth  Reports, Treasury discussed the results of its prior, simpler  assessments\u2014those that compare lending among SBLF banks to that of  small and medium-sized banks and peer matched banks\u2014more  prominently than the more rigorous results of its impact evaluation.  Specifically, it discussed the simpler assessments in the body, but  published the results of its impact evaluation in the appendixes of its April,  July, and October 2014 Lending Growth Reports. Further, Treasury did  not reference the results of the impact evaluation in the executive  summary or body of the reports. GAO\u2019s Designing Evaluations guide  states that how evaluation results are communicated can dramatically  affect how they are used. Our review of relevant resources on the use  and presentation of program evaluations also indicates that rigorous  evidence should be given prominence in comparison to less credible  evidence so that the strongest evidence is used to inform policy and the  allocation of resources. Further, SBLF\u2019s authorizing legislation requires, in  part, that Treasury provide transparency with respect to its use of funds  provided by the SBLF program. As we concluded in our prior report, it is  important that Congress and stakeholders have information about the  extent to which the program has a meaningful impact on small business  lending.", "Treasury officials stated that the results of the SBLF impact evaluation  (i.e., the propensity score analysis) were included as appendixes instead  of in the body of the reports because the evaluation was intended to be a  one-time analysis of the program. They explained that the purpose of the  evaluation was to serve as another objective method for assessing the  program and validating the results of its previous analyses. According to  agency officials, including the results as an appendix allowed the report\u2019s  format to remain consistent with prior and future Lending Growth Report  iterations, rather than revising the entire report for one quarterly issuance.  However, as agency officials explained, the results of the propensity  score matching approach are relatively comparable to their previous  assessments because the propensity score matching approach also  compares lending between SBLF banks and a selected control group of  banks. As such, we determined it is unlikely that discussing the results of  the impact evaluation in the body of its quarterly Lending Growth Reports  would cause inconsistencies or major revisions.", "Because Treasury presents the results of its simpler group comparison  more prominently than the results of its impact evaluation in its Lending  Growth Reports, readers may not be aware of the results of the more  rigorous analysis or understand the differences between the various  alternative control groups and what they might imply about the overall  impact of the program. As previously discussed and shown in figure 6,  Treasury\u2019s less rigorous comparisons suggested that SBLF banks  increased lending by 45 and 41 percentage points more than all small  and medium-sized banks and peer banks, respectively. The propensity  score matching approach\u2014which is designed to isolate the impact of the  program\u2014produced the smallest relative median increase in lending at 23  percentage points. However, these results are not discussed in the body  of Treasury\u2019s Lending Growth Reports. As a result, readers\u2014including  Congress and other stakeholders\u2014may not use the results of the more  credible analysis to inform their conclusions about the program and the  extent to which it has impacted small business lending.", "In addition, Treasury has not updated the results of the impact evaluation.  In our work on best practices that enhance the use of performance  information, we found that communicating performance information  frequently and routinely enhances the use of that information for making  decisions that affect future strategies, planning and budgeting, identifying  priorities, and allocating resources. Frequently communicated  performance information typically includes performance measures, such  as the changes in small business lending that Treasury reports each  quarter for SBLF banks. Program evaluations, however, are typically  conducted less frequently to assess how well a program works. Treasury  officials stated that they have not updated the results of the impact  evaluation because they intended for the evaluation be a one-time  analysis that captured the effect of the program through September 30,  2013\u2014the period during which participating banks were incentivized to  increase small business lending over their baselines in order to reduce  their dividend rates. Treasury published the same impact evaluation  results in appendixes of its April, July, and October 2014 Lending Growth  Reports and does not have plans to update the results in future reports. In  contrast, Treasury updates the results of its simpler assessments in its  quarterly Lending Growth Reports and anticipates continuing to update  the results until 2016, when Treasury expects about 80 percent of  participants to have exited the program as a result of the scheduled  dividend rate increase to 9 percent for most participating banks.", "Although program evaluations can be costly and time consuming, we  determined that Treasury could adjust its existing propensity-matched  control group to update the results of its impact evaluation without having  to repeat the entire evaluation. Specifically, Treasury could take an  approach similar to the one it uses to update the results of its peer group  comparison. As SBLF banks exit the program, Treasury could remove  similar non-SBLF banks from the control group and repeat its analyses  using the updated groups of banks. Treasury officials acknowledged that  they could update the results of their impact evaluation using this  approach, but explained that they would need to obtain programming  software to conduct the analysis and that considerable time and effort  would be required to ensure the accuracy of the impact evaluation data  and analyses.", "By updating the results of its impact evaluation, Treasury could further  enhance the performance information it provides on SBLF. As we have  described in previous reports and summarize in appendix III, Treasury  provides quarterly information on the performance of SBLF, including its  simpler lending growth comparisons among SBLF and non-SBLF banks.  Updated results from Treasury\u2019s most rigorous and accurate assessment  of SBLF could enhance the performance information that readers and  decision makers consider. For example, updated information on the  impact of the program could be useful for observing any changes in the  impact of the program over time.

In addition, Treasury developed  additional performance measures and targets related to the disbursement  of funds to states and the extent to which OCSPs target small businesses  with an average size of 500 or fewer employees and target support  towards loans with an average principal amount of $5 million or less (see  table 1). Officials stated that because almost all SSBCI-funded programs  became fully operational in 2014, they used the information from the 2013  annual reports to establish performance targets. Officials explained that  they used the stated program objectives in the Small Business Jobs Act  of 2010 to establish the additional measures and select the measures for  which they established targets.

In addition, our work on  improving information to Congress found that information on how  activities have been implemented and the extent to which the program  reached the intended clients can be useful to inform reauthorization  decisions. Further, our work assessing duplication, overlap, and  fragmentation looked across 52 programs supporting entrepreneurs and  emphasized the importance of performance information for decision  making and highlights that program evaluations can provide additional  information about program performance and help gauge program  effectiveness. Specifically, we reported that several of these programs  lacked adequate performance information and program evaluations,  which resulted in limited information on program efficiency and  effectiveness.

In addition, Treasury has published  performance information on SSBCI that could be helpful for decisions  related to the reauthorization of the program.
