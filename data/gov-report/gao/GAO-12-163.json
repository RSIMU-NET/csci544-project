The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is responsible for securing the nation's civil aviation system, which includes ensuring the security of U.S.-bound flights. As requested, GAO evaluated (1) the steps TSA has taken to enhance its foreign airport assessment program since 2007, and any remaining program challenges; (2) TSA's assessment results, including how TSA uses the results to guide future efforts; and (3) what opportunities, if any, exist to enhance the program. To conduct this work, GAO reviewed foreign airport assessment procedures and results, interviewed TSA and foreign aviation security officials, and observed TSA conduct a foreign airport assessment. While these interviews and observations are not generalizable, they provided insights on TSA's program. This is the public version of a sensitive report GAO issued in September, 2011. Information that TSA deemed sensitive has been omitted."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Since 2007, TSA has taken a number of steps to enhance its foreign airport assessment program, some of which were taken in response to GAO's prior recommendations. For example, TSA updated its policies and methodologies used to guide and prioritize its assessment efforts, and implemented tools to track its annual assessment schedule, airport assessment results, and foreign government progress in resolving security deficiencies previously identified during the assessments. However, challenges remain in gaining access to some foreign airports, developing an automated database to better manage program information, prioritizing and providing training and technical assistance to foreign countries, and expanding the scope of TSA's airport assessments to include all-cargo operations. TSA has various efforts under way to address these challenges. Based on GAO's analysis of TSA's foreign airport assessments conducted from fiscal year 2006 through May 2011, some foreign airports complied with all of TSA's aviation security assessment standards; however, TSA has identified serious noncompliance issues at a number of foreign airports. Common areas of noncompliance included weaknesses in airport access controls and passenger and baggage screening. Moreover, GAO's analysis showed variation in airport compliance across geographic regions and individual security standards, among other things. For example, GAO's analysis showed that some number of regions of the world had no airports with egregious noncompliance while other regions had several such airports. However, TSA has not yet taken steps to evaluate its assessment results to identify regional and other trends over time. Developing a mechanism to evaluate its assessment results could help support TSA's priorities for aviation security training and technical assistance, inform its risk management decision making by identifying any trends and security gaps, and target capacity building efforts. Opportunities also exist for TSA to make additional program improvements in several key areas. For example, the agency has not developed criteria and guidance for determining foreign airport vulnerability ratings. This is particularly important given that these ratings are a key component for how TSA determines each foreign airport's risk level. Providing TSA decision makers with more specific criteria and definitions could provide greater assurance that such determinations are consistent across airports over time. In addition, there are opportunities for TSA to increase program efficiency and effectiveness by, for example, conducting more targeted foreign airport assessments and systematically compiling and analyzing security best practices. Taking such actions could help TSA better focus its assessments to address areas of highest risk, and identify security best practices and technologies that may be applicable to enhancing the security of both foreign and domestic airports."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that TSA develop a mechanism to evaluate its assessment results to identify any trends, and target resources and future activities; establish criteria for determining foreign airport vulnerability ratings; and consider the feasibility of conducting more targeted assessments and compiling information on aviation security best practices.

Furthermore, roughly 80 million passengers and 10 billion pounds  of cargo are transported on inbound flights to the United States per year,  further highlighting the need to ensure the security of these flights.  Approximately 300 foreign airports provide last point of departure flights  to the United States in approximately 100 countries. As a result, efforts to  evaluate the security of foreign airports that service the United States\u2014 and mitigating any identified security risks\u2014are important steps in  ensuring the security of the U.S. aviation system particularly considering  that inbound flights continue to be targets of coordinated terrorist activity.", "The Transportation Security Administration (TSA), a component of the  Department of Homeland Security (DHS), is the federal agency with  primary responsibility for securing the nation\u2019s civil aviation system, which  includes ensuring the security of U.S.-bound flights. Through its foreign  airport assessment program, TSA determines whether foreign airports  that provide service to the United States are maintaining and carrying out  effective security measures. While TSA is authorized under U.S. law to  conduct foreign airport assessments at intervals it considers necessary,  TSA may not perform an assessment of security measures at a foreign  airport without permission from the host government.", "In 2007, we reported on TSA\u2019s efforts to assess the security at foreign  airports and recommended that TSA, among other things, take steps to  track the status of foreign airport assessments from initiation through  completion, develop a standard process for tracking and documenting  host governments\u2019 progress in addressing security deficiencies identified  during TSA assessments, and develop outcome-oriented performance  measures to evaluate the impact TSA assessments have on improving  foreign airport compliance with international standards. DHS concurred  with the recommendations and has since taken a number of steps to  address them and improve the program. We discuss these and other  actions TSA has taken, since 2007, later in this report.", "Considering the high volume of passengers and flights arriving in the  United States from foreign locations and the recent history of terrorist  threats against inbound commercial flights, you asked us to reexamine  TSA\u2019s foreign airport assessment program, including the progress it has  made since our prior report in 2007. Specifically, this report addresses the  following questions: (1) to what extent has TSA taken steps to enhance  its foreign airport assessment program since 2007, and what challenges  remain; (2) what are the results of TSA\u2019s foreign airport assessments, and  to what extent does TSA use the results of these assessments to guide  its future assessment activities; and (3) what opportunities, if any, exist to  enhance the value of TSA\u2019s foreign airport assessment program?", "This report is a public version of the prior sensitive report that we  provided to you in September 2011. TSA deemed some of the information  in the prior report as Sensitive Security Information (SSI), which must be  protected from public disclosure. Therefore, this report omits sensitive  information about the specific results of TSA\u2019s foreign airport  assessments. In addition, at TSA\u2019s request, we have omitted some  information regarding the remaining challenges for TSA\u2019s foreign airport  assessment program. Although the information provided in this report is  more limited in scope, it addresses the same questions as the sensitive  report. Also, the overall methodology used for both reports is the same.", "To collectively address these objectives, we obtained and reviewed TSA  guidance for conducting and reporting the results of foreign airport  assessments, such as TSA\u2019s Foreign Airport Assessment Program  Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) document, which prescribes  program and operational guidance for assessing security measures at  foreign airports. We also obtained and analyzed the results of TSA\u2019s  foreign airport assessments from fiscal year 2006 through May 9, 2011, to  determine the extent to which foreign airports complied with international  aviation security standards, and assessed how TSA conducted follow-up  on the results of these assessments. Specifically, we analyzed the  frequency with which foreign airports complied with standards, such as  passenger screening, baggage screening, and access controls, among  others. We assessed the reliability of TSA\u2019s foreign airport assessment  data and concluded that the data were sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of our review. Among the steps we took to assess the reliability  of TSA data were selecting a random sample of records from the  program\u2019s vulnerability results tracking sheet and examining the  corresponding assessment reports to identify any inconsistencies. We  also reviewed the steps TSA takes to assign risk rankings to foreign  airports as well as efforts to analyze its assessment results, and  compared these efforts to Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government. In addition, we interviewed TSA program management  officials located at TSA headquarters as well as visited four of the five  TSA Regional Operations Centers (ROC) located in Miami, Los Angeles,  Dallas, and Frankfurt, Germany, to interview TSA international inspector  officials. We based our site visit selections on the number of available  inspectors at each location and geographic dispersion. We also  interviewed other federal and nonfederal stakeholders, such as the  Department of State, International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), and  European Commission (EC) officials to discuss efforts and programs  these organizations have in place to enhance international aviation  security. In addition, we accompanied TSA officials during an assessment  at a foreign airport to observe how TSA\u2019s policies and procedures were  implemented in practice. Information from our interviews with government  officials, members of the aviation industry, and TSA officials and  inspectors, and our observations of TSA inspectors cannot be  generalized beyond those that we spoke with because we did not use  statistical sampling techniques in selecting individuals to interview.  However, these interviews and observations provide perspectives on  TSA\u2019s foreign airport assessment program, including various officials\u2019  roles and responsibilities related to the program.", "We conducted this performance audit from August 2010 through October  2011 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

In furtherance of its civil aviation security  responsibilities, TSA is statutorily required to assess the effectiveness of  security measures at foreign airports served by a U.S. air carrier, from  which a foreign air carrier serves the United States, that pose a high risk  of introducing danger to international air travel, and at other foreign  airports deemed appropriate by the Secretary of Homeland Security.  This provision of law also identifies measures that the Secretary must  take in the event that he or she determines that an airport is not  maintaining and carrying out effective security measures based on TSA  assessments. See appendix II for a detailed description of the process  for taking secretarial actions against a foreign airport. In addition, TSA  conducts inspections of U.S. air carriers and foreign air carriers that  service the United States from foreign airports pursuant to its authority to  ensure that air carriers certified or permitted to operate to, from, or within  the United States meet applicable security requirements, including those  set forth in an air carrier\u2019s TSA-approved security program.", "The Secretary of Homeland Security delegated to the Assistant Secretary  of TSA the responsibility for conducting foreign airport assessments, but  retained responsibility for making the determination that a foreign airport  does not maintain and carry out effective security measures. Currently,  the Global Compliance Division and Office of International Operations,  within TSA\u2019s Office of Global Strategies, are responsible for conducting  foreign airport assessments. Table 1 highlights the roles and  responsibilities of the TSA positions within these divisions that are  responsible for implementing the foreign airport assessment program.", "TSA assesses the effectiveness of security measures at foreign airports  using select aviation security standards and recommended practices  adopted by ICAO, a United Nations organization representing 190  countries. ICAO standards and recommended practices address  operational issues at an airport, such as ensuring that passengers and  baggage are properly screened and that unauthorized individuals do not  have access to restricted areas of an airport. ICAO standards and  recommended practices also address non-operational issues, such as  whether a foreign government has implemented a national civil aviation  security program for regulating security procedures at its airports and  whether airport officials implementing security controls go through  background investigations, are appropriately trained, and are certified  according to a foreign government\u2019s national civil aviation security  program. ICAO member states have agreed to comply with these  standards, and are strongly encouraged to comply with ICAO- recommended practices. The ICAO standards and recommended  practices TSA assesses foreign airports against are referred to  collectively in this report as ICAO standards or standards. See appendix  III for a description of the ICAO standards TSA uses to assess security  measures at foreign airports.", "TSA uses a risk-informed approach to schedule foreign airport  assessments by categorizing airports into three tiers. Specifically, Tier 1  airports\u2014airports that are determined to be low risk\u2014are assessed once  every 3 years; Tier 2 airports\u2014airports determined to be medium risk\u2014 are assessed every 2 years; and Tier 3 airports\u2014those determined to be  high risk\u2014are assessed annually. TSA\u2019s assessments of foreign airports  are conducted by a team of inspectors, which generally includes one  team leader and one team member. According to TSA, it generally takes  3 to 7 days to complete a foreign airport assessment. However, the  amount of time required to conduct an assessment varies based on  several factors, including the size of the airport, the number of air carrier  station inspections to be conducted at the airport, the threat level to civil  aviation in the host country, and the amount of time it takes inspectors to  travel to and from the airport where the assessment will take place.", "TSA uses a multistep process to conduct assessments of foreign airports.  Specifically, the TSA Representative (TSAR) must obtain approval from  the host government to allow TSA to conduct an airport assessment, and  schedule the date for the on-site assessment. After conducting an entry  briefing with Department of State, host country officials, and airport  officials, the team conducts an on-site visit to the airport. During the  assessment, the team of inspectors uses several methods to determine a  foreign airport\u2019s level of compliance with ICAO standards, including  conducting interviews with airport officials, examining documents  pertaining to the airport\u2019s security measures, and conducting a physical  inspection of the airport. For example, inspectors are to examine the  integrity of fences, lighting, and locks by walking the grounds of the  airport. Inspectors also make observations on access control procedures,  such as looking at employee and vehicle identification methods in secure  areas, as well as monitoring passenger and baggage screening  procedures in the airport. At the close of an airport assessment,  inspectors brief foreign airport and government officials on the results of  the assessment. TSA inspectors also prepare a report summarizing their  findings on the airport\u2019s overall security posture and security measures,  which may contain recommendations for corrective action and must be  reviewed by the TSAR, the ROC manager, and TSA headquarters  officials. See appendix IV for more information on the multistep process  TSA uses to conduct its assessments of foreign airports.", "Along with conducting airport assessments, the same TSA inspection  team also conducts air carrier inspections when visiting a foreign airport  to ensure that air carriers are in compliance with TSA security  requirements. Both U.S. air carriers and foreign air carriers with service to  the United States are subject to inspection. When conducting air carrier  inspections, TSA inspectors examine compliance with applicable security  requirements, including TSA-approved security programs, emergency  amendments to the security programs, and security directives. As in the  case of airport assessments, air carrier inspections are conducted by a  team of inspectors, which generally includes one team leader and one  team member. An inspection of an air carrier typically takes 1 or 2 days,  but can take longer depending on the extent of service by the air carrier.  Inspection teams may spend several days at a foreign airport inspecting  air carriers if there are multiple airlines serving the United States from that  location. During an inspection, inspectors are to review applicable  security manuals, procedures, and records; interview air carrier station  personnel; and observe air carrier employees processing passengers  from at least one flight from passenger check-in until the flight departs the  gate to ensure that the air carrier is in compliance with applicable  requirements. Inspectors evaluate a variety of security measures, such as  passenger processing, checked baggage acceptance and control, aircraft  security, and passenger screening. If an inspector finds that an air carrier  is not complying with applicable security requirements, additional steps  are to be taken to record such instances and, in some cases, pursue  them with further investigation.", "If the inspectors report that an airport\u2019s security measures do not meet  minimum ICAO standards, particularly critical standards, such as those  related to passenger and checked baggage screening and access  controls, TSA headquarters officials are to inform the Secretary of  Homeland Security. If the Secretary, based on TSA\u2019s airport  assessment results, determines that a foreign airport does not maintain  and carry out effective security measures, he or she must, after advising  the Secretary of State, take secretarial action. See appendix II for a  detailed description of the process for taking secretarial actions against a  foreign airport.", "In 2007, we issued a report on TSA \u2018s foreign airport assessment  program, including the results of TSA\u2019s foreign airport assessments,  actions taken and assistance provided by TSA when security deficiencies  were identified at foreign airports, TSA oversight of its program, and  TSA\u2019s efforts to address challenges in conducting foreign airport  assessments. Specifically, we reported that TSA\u2019s oversight of the foreign  airport assessment program could be strengthened. For example, TSA  did not have adequate controls in place to track whether scheduled  assessments and inspections were actually conducted, deferred, or  canceled. TSA also did not always document foreign officials\u2019 progress in  addressing security deficiencies identified by TSA. Further, TSA did not  have outcome-based performance measures to assess the impact of its  assessments on the security of U.S.-bound flights. As a result, we  recommended that TSA develop controls for tracking and documenting  information and establish outcome-based performance measures to  strengthen oversight of its foreign airport and air carrier evaluation  programs. DHS concurred with the recommendations and has since  taken several actions to address them, which we discuss later in our  report."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "TSA Has Taken Steps to Enhance Foreign Airport Assessments, but Challenges Remain", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "TSA Steps to Update and Streamline Its Assessments", "paragraphs": ["Since 2007, TSA has taken a number of steps to update and streamline  its foreign airport assessment program, as discussed below.", "TSA revised and updated its Standard Operating Procedures (SOP)  for the program. In 2010, TSA revised the SOP, which prescribes  program and operational guidance for assessing security measures at  foreign airports. TSA also streamlined the assessment process by  reducing the number of ICAO standards it assesses foreign airports  against from 86 to 40. Of the 40, TSA officials we interviewed told us  the agency has identified 22 standards as key for determining an airport\u2019s  level of security. In addition, TSA reduced the assessment report writing  cycle time for inspectors from 38 calendar days to 20 calendar days,  which was intended to expedite the delivery of assessment reports to host  governments. This new requirement has helped TSA reduce the time  needed to deliver its assessment results to foreign countries, but all 23  inspectors we interviewed told us this requirement was often difficult to  meet due to a variety of factors. For example, upon returning from a visit,  TSA inspectors reported that they need to document both the airport  assessment and air carrier inspections, and plan their next trip, which  makes the reduced reporting time requirement difficult to meet. However,  the Director of Global Compliance told us that for larger airports with  many air carriers, TSA recently began separating the airport assessment  and air carrier inspection visits into two separate visits, thus reducing the  documentation workload. Moreover, the deadline to submit  documentation has been delayed for some back-to-back assessment trips  in order to provide sufficient time for inspectors to complete the  documentation. The Director of Global Compliance also stated that, in  fiscal year 2012, all employees will have training opportunities in order to  improve writing skills and reduce the amount of time dedicated to editing  and rewriting assessments. In addition, to address resource needs we  identified in 2007, TSA hired 6 additional international inspectors in 2007  and 10 international cargo inspectors in 2008 and created 25 new  international inspector positions, of which 15 were filled as of July 2011.  TSA plans to fill the remaining 10 positions by the end of 2011. The  Director of Global Compliance stated that the burden of writing and  processing assessment reports should be lessened as the agency hires  additional inspectors because this will create a greater pool of available  inspectors to conduct and document the assessments.", "TSA implemented a new risk-informed methodology for prioritizing  and scheduling its assessments at foreign airports in 2010.  Specifically, TSA now categorizes foreign airports as high, medium or low  risk. Of the roughly 300 foreign airports TSA assesses, TSA identified  some airports as high risk and others as medium risk as of August,  2011. The remaining airports were deemed low risk. TSA\u2019s  methodology for determining an airport\u2019s risk category is based on the  likelihood of a location being targeted (threat), the protective measures in  place at that location (vulnerability), and the potential impact of an attack  on the international transportation system (consequence). TSA uses  current threat information, airport passenger and flight data, and prior  airport assessment results to assign each airport a numerical risk score,  which is then used to determine its overall risk ranking. As part of this  calculation, TSA assigns each airport an overall vulnerability score of 1\u20135.  These scores, or categories, are numerical representations of compliance  or noncompliance with the ICAO standards the agency assesses each  foreign airport against. Specifically, using an airport\u2019s most recent  assessment report, the ROC Manager and TSA\u2019s Director of Global  Compliance assign an overall vulnerability category for each airport  based on the following descriptions provided in the 2010 Foreign Airport   Assessment Program SOP:  \uf0b7  Category 1: Fully Compliant;  \uf0b7  Category 2: Capability Exists with Minor Episodes of Noncompliance;  \uf0b7  Category 3: Capability Exists, Compliance is Generally Noted,  \uf0b7  Category 4: Capability Exists, Serious Lack of Implementation  \uf0b7  Category 5: Egregious Noncompliance.", "Once the vulnerability score is determined, it is then combined with each  airport\u2019s related threat and consequence information to determine its risk  category. TSA attempts to assess high-risk airports every year, medium- risk airports once every 2 years, and low-risk airports once every   3 years. TSA\u2019s Director of Global Compliance told us this new approach  allows the agency to better allocate resources to identify and mitigate  security concerns at foreign airports it assesses. In addition, all the TSA  ROC managers and 19 of the 23 inspectors we interviewed during our  site visits told us that this new foreign airport risk prioritization  methodology was an improvement over the previous process. These  officials also stated that this new approach has helped them reduce the  number of assessments conducted annually, enabling inspectors to better  adhere to the annual schedule. On the basis of our analysis, TSA\u2019s  approach for scheduling foreign airport assessments is consistent with  generally accepted risk management principles, which define risk as a  function of threat, vulnerability, and consequence.", "TSA developed a 2011 strategic implementation plan. This plan  establishes annual program objectives and milestones, and links program  activities to broader agency aviation security goals providing a road map  for their completion.", "TSA began declassifying its foreign airport assessment reports.  Since 2007, TSA has been declassifying the reports from Confidential  and designating them SSI to facilitate better access to and the  dissemination of program results, while still providing protection for  foreign government information deemed sensitive. TSA officials noted  that the declassification of assessment results is essential for TSA  because staff could not easily access the specifics of prior results and  deficiencies from reports that have not yet been declassified.", "TSA formed the Capacity Development Branch (CDB). TSA created  the CDB in 2007 to manage all TSA international aviation security  capacity building assistance efforts, including requests for assistance in  response to a host government\u2019s airport assessment results. Through  CDB, TSA provides six aviation security training courses that address,  among other things, preventive security measures, incident management  and response, and cargo security. In 2008, TSA also developed the  Aviation Security Sustainable International Standards Team (ASSIST)  Program to provide more long-term, sustainable, technical aviation  security assistance to select foreign countries. Thus far, TSA has  partnered with five countries under the ASSIST program: St. Lucia,  Liberia, Georgia, Haiti, and Palau. See appendix V for more specific  information on TSA assistance provided these countries under ASSIST.", "TSA developed assessment tracking tools to provide better  oversight of program information. In 2007 we reported that TSA did  not have controls in place to track the status of scheduled foreign airport  assessments, including whether assessments were actually conducted or  whether they were deferred or canceled, which could make it difficult for  the agency to ensure that scheduled assessments are actually  completed. We also reported that TSA did not always document the  results of follow-up conducted by TSA staff to determine progress made  by foreign governments in addressing security deficiencies identified by  TSA inspectors during assessments, and that such follow-up would  enable the agency to have access to updated information on the security  status of foreign airports that provide service to the United States. In  response to the findings and recommendations we made in our 2007  report, TSA implemented a tool to track its annual foreign airport  assessment schedule, including reasons why assessments were deferred  or canceled, and a tracking sheet to compile the results of its prior airport  assessments. Specifically, this sheet documents the frequency with which  foreign airports complied with particular categories of ICAO standards,  such as passenger screening, baggage screening, and access controls,  among others. TSA also developed a tool whereby deficiencies previously  identified during an assessment can be tracked to monitor the progress  made by host governments in rectifying security deficiencies. TSA\u2019s  Director of Global Compliance told us these tracking sheets have helped  TSA provide better oversight and monitoring of key program information.", "TSA signed several working arrangements to facilitate its  assessments. Since 2007, TSA has signed a multilateral working  arrangement with the European Union (EU), and several bilateral working  arrangements with individual foreign nations, to facilitate, among other  things, TSA assessments at foreign airports. Specifically, in 2007, we  reported that TSA had taken steps toward harmonizing airport  assessment processes with the European Commission (EC). As part of  these efforts, TSA and the EC established six working groups to facilitate,  among other things, sharing of SSI between TSA and the EC, TSA  observation of EU airport assessments, as well as EC observation of TSA  assessments of airports in the United States. In 2008, TSA signed a  multilateral working arrangement with the EU to facilitate joint  assessments and information sharing between TSA and the EU.  Specifically, under the arrangement, TSA and the EC coordinate  assessment schedules annually to identify airport locations at which to  conduct joint assessments. EC officials we interviewed told us their main  goal under the arrangement was to better leverage resources and reduce  the number of TSA visits per year to European airports because of  concerns from EU member states on the frequency of visits from EC and  U.S. audit teams. TSA officials we interviewed said they also wanted to  better leverage existing resources while ensuring continued TSA access  to European airports for the purposes of conducting security  assessments. While TSA agreed to conduct assessments at EU airports  no more than once every 5 years, EU and TSA officials we interviewed  said the EC permits TSA to approach a country bilaterally if scheduling  conflicts do not allow for an assessment to be conducted jointly. TSA also  occasionally conducts table-top reviews in place of on-site airport visits.  Specifically, if the EC inspected an airport within the last 2 years, TSA will  sometimes meet with EC officials to review the EC inspection report\u2013- referred to as a table top\u2013-which typically contains enough information for  TSA to make its evaluations. However, TSA officials said table-top  reviews should not serve as a permanent substitute for TSA onsite  assessments.", "TSA has also entered into several bilateral working arrangements with  foreign countries to facilitate its airport assessments. Specifically, TSA  has signed arrangements with Brazil, Germany, India, the United  Kingdom, Russia, and is in the process of establishing arrangements with  Nicaragua and Portugal. These arrangements specify certain conditions,  practices, and protocols for sharing key information with TSA, but also  impose some constraints, such as limiting the number of TSA visits per  year, including the length of the visit."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Challenges Affecting TSA Assessment Efforts", "paragraphs": ["Even with TSA\u2019s efforts to enhance the program, challenges remain in  several areas: gaining access to some foreign airports, developing an  automated database to manage program information, prioritizing and  providing training and technical assistance, and expanding the scope of  TSA\u2019s airport assessments to include all-cargo operations, as discussed  below.", "TSA access to some foreign airports has been limited by  sovereignty concerns. In 2007, we reported that some host  governments expressed concerns that TSA assessments infringe upon  their authority to regulate airports and air carriers within their borders, and  that some foreign governments had denied TSA access to their airports.  TSA\u2019s multilateral and bilateral arrangements have helped to facilitate  assessments in some foreign countries, but TSA has had difficulty gaining  access to some foreign airports due to sovereignty concerns raised by  host governments. For example, TSA has not been able to assess any of  the four airports in Venezuela or conduct TSA compliance inspections for  air carriers flying out of Venezuela into the United States, including U.S.  air carriers, since 2006. Thus, TSA has been unable to determine the  security posture of flights from Venezuela bound for the United States. On  September 8, 2008, the Secretary of Homeland Security issued a Public  Notice that informs the public that the U.S. Government is unable to  determine whether airports in Venezuela that serve as the last point of  departure for nonstop flights to the United States maintain and carry out  effective aviation security measures.", "A TSA official told us that a TSA representative traveled to Venezuela  recently to start discussions with the Venezuelan government about TSA  regaining access to Venezuelan airports to conduct assessments and air  carrier inspections. Since it is unclear what the outcome of these  discussions will be, and when TSA will regain access to airports and air  carriers in Venezuela, the Public Notice remains in effect. Until TSA is  able to regain access to airports and air carriers in Venezuela to conduct  assessments and air carrier inspections, the agency will be unable to  determine to what extent, if at all, airports in Venezuela are maintaining  and carrying out effective security measures, or the extent to which air  carriers are complying with TSA security requirements for U.S.-bound  flights. The Director of Global Compliance indicated TSA is concerned  about sovereignty issues with other foreign countries and their willingness  to allow TSA inspectors to assess their airports and air carriers. TSA has  been working on establishing a Memorandum of Understanding with one  country to ensure continued TSA access to its airports. Moreover, TSA  indicated that working arrangements it developed with two other countries  were undertaken to address government sovereignty concerns over  TSA\u2019s assessments.", "TSA has experienced difficulties developing an automated database.  Since 2007, TSA has been in the process of trying to develop an  integrated, automated database management system to allow for more  timely submission of foreign airport assessment results, as well as  perform more substantive analysis and comparisons of foreign airport  trends and issues. Specifically, in response to our 2007  recommendations, TSA stated that they were exploring an automated  means of capturing foreign airport assessment data to track airport  deficiencies identified, corrective actions recommended by TSA, and any  resulting actions taken by the host nation. In 2010, TSA field tested a  system, called the Foreign Airport Assessment Reporting System  (FAARS), which was intended to store results of airport assessments for  easier data extraction and manipulation. For example, while airport  assessments are currently prepared as word documents (typically around  60 pages in length), FAARS was intended to put information into  database fields, which would have allowed the Office of Global Strategies  (OGS) to run reports on specific indicators, such as which foreign airport  checkpoints are using Advanced Imaging Technology (AIT) units.  However, the Director of Global Compliance told us FAARS ultimately did  not meet TSA\u2019s needs and was discontinued because, among other  things, data entry was cumbersome and certain data fields could not be  edited. Further, the database was not web-based, and instead had to be  installed on users\u2019 hard drives, not allowing for easy integration of multiple  users and data.", "In April 2011, TSA developed a comprehensive functional requirements  document, which outlines the capabilities and functions required for a new  proposed software solution. TSA officials told us they provided it to  officials in TSA\u2019s Offices of Acquisition and Information Technology who  developed a contract for developing, testing, fielding, and distributing a  software solution that meets programs needs. TSA officials told us that  the contractor who will develop the product has received the Statement of  Work, and initial implementation of the product is planned for fiscal year  2012, with full capability planned to follow in fiscal year 2013. Given these  time frames, it will be important for TSA to monitor the status of this effort  to ensure a solution is implemented within reasonable time frames,  particularly since we raised this issue in our 2007 report and it is still not  clear when a solution will be fully vetted and implemented. TSA\u2019s Director  of Global Compliance also told us that identifying a database  management system that meets of the needs of the program has been a  long-standing challenge for the program.", "TSA\u2019s training and technical assistance efforts face several  challenges, and TSA\u2019s new equipment loan program has raised  concerns. TSA has initiated several capacity building efforts since our  2007 report, but these efforts have been affected by conflicting  Department of State priorities, and TSA\u2019s new equipment loan program  has raised concerns about ensuring that loaned equipment is properly  operated and maintained. Specifically, in addition to its own training  courses and technical assistance, CDB provides training and technical  assistance sponsored by the Department of State\u2019s Anti-Terrorism  Assistance (ATA) program and from the Organization of American  States Inter-American Committee Against Terrorism, which is funded  through the State Department. A CDB official stated they currently have  eight employees and limited funds to provide aviation security technical  and training assistance to partner nations overseas. As a result, a CDB  official told us their training schedule often has a 3-month lag from when  training is requested to when it is provided. In addition, four TSARs we  spoke with stated they sometimes have difficulty getting their requests for  TSA training from host nations fulfilled because of a lack of resources.  According to a TSA official we spoke with, during the past 2 years, the  U.S. government\u2019s aviation security training and assistance priorities have  been largely driven by State Department priorities. For example, of the 64  course offerings CDB had planned to provide in 47 foreign countries at  the beginning of fiscal year 2011, 33 were sponsored by State ATA or the  Organization of American States, and some number of those countries  have high-risk airports as identified by TSA. In addition, TSA\u2019s 2010  training schedule showed that of the 53 course offerings CDB provided in  33 countries, 29 were sponsored by State ATA or the Organization of  American States, and some number of those countries have high-risk  airports as identified by TSA. CDB and State Department officials told  us they plan to work more closely in the future to better align their  respective priorities.", "In addition to providing various types of training and technical assistance,  TSA has also provided aviation security equipment to foreign countries to  help these countries enhance their existing capabilities and practices.  Specifically, one of TSA\u2019s goals in its CDB fiscal year 2011\u20132015  Strategic Plan is to develop the necessary procedures for a system of  long-term lending of decommissioned TSA screening equipment to  partner countries. In accordance with authority granted under the  Aviation and Transportation Security Act, TSA has undertaken to provide  or loan security technologies and other equipment to foreign  governments. According to TSA officials, the agency exercises this  authority in coordination with the Department of State, and has obtained  authority from the Department of State to negotiate and conclude  agreements with foreign governments to provide technical cooperation  and assistance, referred to as \u201cCircular 175\u201d agreements. For example,  following the October 2010 discovery of explosive devices in air cargo  packages bound for the United States from Yemen, TSA loaned six hand- held explosives trace detection devices to Yemen in an expedited fashion  as a response to an emergent threat to help enhance the government\u2019s  passenger and cargo screening processes. TSA officials also told us  that the agency has provided security technology and equipment to  Aruba, Bahamas, Bermuda, Haiti, Ireland, and Malta under this same  authority.", "While TSA has provided some equipment to foreign countries, TSA and  EC officials we spoke with identified potential challenges associated with  doing so. For example, TSA officials cited some foreign governments\u2019  inability to properly maintain and operate TSA-provided screening  equipment once provided. TSA officials told us it will be important for the  agency to ensure that a foreign government has the appropriate staff, and  that they are properly trained and ready to operate the equipment as well  as conduct any necessary maintenance, to ensure that the U.S.-provided  equipment is being used as intended and remains operational. TSA  officials also explained that while under its existing authority it can donate  or otherwise transfer equipment, such authority does not authorize TSA to  provide maintenance and service contracts for this equipment. TSA  officials we spoke with told us they would support congressional efforts to  provide the agency with this additional authority. In addition, EC officials  we interviewed identified similar challenges to their current and potential  future efforts to provide various types of capacity building assistance to  foreign countries. TSA officials said it will be important for TSA to  establish user agreements with recipient countries that ensure U.S.  government resources are not wasted or inappropriately used.", "Several factors may complicate TSA assessments of foreign all- cargo operations. Following the attempted bombing of an all-cargo flight  bound for the United States from Yemen in October 2010, TSA decided to  devote additional resources to assessing all-cargo airports. While TSA is  still in the early planning stages of its efforts to assess all-cargo  operations at foreign airports, several factors may complicate these  efforts. Specifically, TSA\u2019s Director of Global Compliance stated that the  agency has identified 17 foreign airports that serve as all-cargo last points  of departure to the United States. As of July 2011, TSA has conducted  two all-cargo assessments of two airports in China. Moreover, TSA plans  to assess two additional all-cargo airports by the end of fiscal year 2011.  According to TSA, from these first visits, TSA is making some  adjustments to the assessment process. For fiscal years 2012 through  2013, TSA plans to schedule visits to the remaining 15 airports that serve  as all-cargo last points of departure to the United States, pending host  government permission. However, TSA stated that it is too early to tell  how many additional inspectors may be needed to complete these  assessments.", "TSA officials we interviewed identified several factors that may complicate  TSA\u2019s assessments of all-cargo operations at foreign airports. For  example, all of the 23 TSA inspectors we interviewed expressed concerns  about incorporating additional assessment visits into their annual  schedules given their current workloads. In addition, these officials stated  that it is uncertain whether foreign governments will allow TSA inspectors  to assess their all-cargo operations and all-cargo airports. For example,  while TSA has several bilateral arrangements with foreign countries to  facilitate its assessments, TSA officials told us these arrangements do not  specify access to cargo operations or all-cargo airports. Moreover, all four  cargo inspectors we met with said it is logistically difficult to assess  \u201cupstream\u201d cargo originating from other non-last point of departure  airports. These inspectors said these logistical challenges will be an  important factor for the agency to consider when selecting foreign airports  to assess as well as in making determinations on the security posture of  cargo on flights departing foreign airports for the United States. In  addition, these inspectors also said that travel to some foreign all-cargo  operation airports may be logistically difficult because of the lack of direct  passenger flights and may require long travel by car or train.  The Director  of Global Compliance acknowledged that this new effort is challenging  and stated that the agency will address these issues on a case-by-case  basis. However, the Director also stated that with the increase to the  inspector workforce, the cross-training of generalist international aviation  inspectors to perform cargo inspections, and the limited additional  locations to visit, TSA will be able to perform these additional visits over  the next 2 years."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Some Number of Foreign Airports Complied with ICAO Standards, but TSA Could Better Use Its Assessment Results", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Some Foreign Airports Complied with ICAO Standards, but TSA Identified Serious Noncompliance Issues at Other Airports", "paragraphs": ["Based on our analysis of the results of TSA\u2019s foreign airport assessments  conducted during fiscal year 2006 through May 9, 2011, some number of  the foreign airports TSA assessed complied with all of TSA\u2019s aviation  security assessment standards.

Specifically, TSA\u2019s airport assessment reports are  collected in an online repository that can be accessed by employees, and  TSA\u2019s Director of Global Compliance compiles high-level information from  each airport assessment in a tracking tool, which allows her to view the  overall results of assessments without having to go back to individual  narrative reports. However, according to TSA, the agency has not  analyzed the data contained in this tracking tool, which could assist TSA  in informing and prioritizing its future activities and assessing the results  of its past assessment efforts. In addition, while the spreadsheet provides  a snapshot of airports and their results compared to the ICAO standards,  it does not indicate why a standard was not met by an airport. If TSA  employees would like to know why a certain airport did not meet a  standard in a previous year, they must locate and read the report for that  assessment.

TSA has one internally  funded program in place that is specifically intended to provide aviation  security training and technical assistance to foreign aviation security  officials. However, TSA also coordinates with other federal agencies,  such as the Department of State, to identify global and regional training  needs and provide instructors for the aviation security training courses  State offers to foreign officials. While TSA does not always determine  which foreign countries receive aviation security training and technical  assistance offered by other federal agencies, TSA could use the  cumulative results of TSA\u2019s foreign airport assessments to better support  TSA\u2019s priorities for aviation security training and technical assistance.  Moreover, with analysis of airport assessment results, TSA could better  inform its risk management decision making by identifying trends and  security gaps, and target capacity building efforts accordingly.  Specifically, this evaluation could include an analysis of the frequency of  noncompliance issues TSA inspectors identified, including regional  variations and perspectives on the security posture of individual airports  over time. Further, a mechanism to evaluate cumulative foreign airport  assessment results could help the agency better allocate and target its  future resources and better understand its results, including the impact  the program is having on enhancing foreign nations\u2019 ability to comply with  ICAO standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "TSA Has Not Yet Developed Outcome-Based Performance Measures", "paragraphs": ["In 2007, we reported that TSA was taking steps to assess whether the  goals of the foreign airport assessment program were being met, but that  it had not yet developed outcome-based performance measures to  evaluate the impact TSA assistance has on improving foreign airport  compliance with ICAO standards. As a result, we recommended that TSA  establish outcome-based performance measures to strengthen oversight  of the program. While DHS officials agreed with the recommendation in  2007, according to TSA, the agency has not yet developed such  measures. The goal of the foreign airport assessment program is to  ensure the security of U.S.-bound flights by evaluating the extent to which  foreign governments are complying with applicable security requirements.  The Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) of 1993, as  amended by the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010, requires executive  branch departments to use performance measures to assess progress  toward meeting program goals and to help decision makers assess  program accomplishments and improve program performance.  Performance measures can be categorized either as outcome measures,  which describe the results of carrying out a program or activity, or as  output measures, which describe the direct products or services delivered  by a program or activity, or as process measures, which address the type  or level of program activities conducted, such as timeliness or quality.", "TSA has taken some steps to develop a variety of measures and is  reporting this information to the Office of Management and Budget. These  measures include:  \uf0b7  average number of international inspections conducted annually per  \uf0b7  percentage of foreign airports serving as Last Point of Departure  operating in compliance with leading security indicators,  \uf0b7  percentage of countries with direct flights to the U.S. that are provided  aviation security assistance, and  \uf0b7  percentage of countries/territories with no direct flights to the U.S. that  are provided aviation security assistance.", "While these measures are useful in determining, for example, the  percentage of airports operating in compliance with security indicators,  they do not address the ultimate results of the program, as outcome  measures could. Outcome-based measures could help determine the  extent to which TSA programs that assess and provide training and  technical assistance to foreign airports have helped to improve security at  airports that service the United States. However, TSA\u2019s Director of Global  Compliance noted several possible challenges with applying such  outcome measures to the assessment program. Specifically, the Director  stated that the foreign airport assessment program is designed to  identify\u2014not correct\u2014security deficiencies at foreign airports, and that  whether or not foreign officials improve security at their airports is not  within TSA\u2019s control. The Director added that such measures may create  a disincentive for inspectors to objectively assess an airport\u2019s level of  compliance. Despite these challenges, the Director acknowledged the  importance of developing outcome measures and stated that their  development should be the responsibility of TSA\u2019s Office of Global  Strategies, not individual programs within this office, such as the foreign  airport assessment program that she leads. Even without full control over  the outcomes associated with such measures, we continue to believe our  prior recommendation is still valid and that it would be useful for TSA to  develop reasonable outcome-based measures, such as the percentage of  security deficiencies that were addressed as a result of TSA onsite  assistance or related technical assistance and training offered by the  CDB, and TSA recommendations for corrective action. As we previously  recommended, such measures would help TSA establish greater  accountability over the way in which TSA uses its resources and, in  conjunction with its existing measures, enable the agency to evaluate and  improve the impact of its assistance on improving security at foreign  airports."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Opportunities Exist to Clarify Airport Assessment Criteria, Further Target Airport Assessments, and Systematically Identify Security Best Practices", "paragraphs": ["While TSA has taken a number of steps to improve and streamline its  foreign airport assessment program since our 2007 report, opportunities  exist for TSA to make additional improvements in several key areas. For  example, TSA has taken steps to make its foreign airport assessments  more risk informed, but the agency lacks clearly defined criteria to  determine a foreign airport\u2019s level of noncompliance with ICAO standards.  For example, as stated earlier, TSA provides each airport an overall  vulnerability category, or score, of 1 through 5, which is a numerical  representation of compliance or level of noncompliance with the ICAO  standards the agency assesses each foreign airport against. However,  TSA has not developed any specific criteria, definitions, or implementing  guidelines to ensure ROC managers and other program management  officials apply these categories consistently across airports. For example,  the SOP does not define how to assess whether an airport should receive  a vulnerability rating of 3\u2014\u201ccapability exists, compliance is generally  noted, shortfalls remain,\u201d versus a vulnerability rating of 2\u2014\u201ccapability  exists with minor episodes of noncompliance.\u201d In the absence of more  specific and transparent criteria and guidance, it is not clear how TSA  applied these related categories\u2014which describe the level of  noncompliance\u2014to the results of the assessments, or whether they were  applied consistently over time. The lack of documented guidance  prevented us from making an analysis or comparison of how TSA made  its determinations. This is particularly important given that these scores  represent an overall assessment of an airport\u2019s level of compliance or  noncompliance with ICAO standards that TSA has deemed critical to  airport security, and also are a key component of TSA foreign airport risk- ranking determinations.", "TSA\u2019s Director of Global Compliance agreed these category  determinations are largely subjective judgments based on many facts and  circumstances. TSA\u2019s Director of Global Compliance stated that it is  challenging to establish specific guidance for how to assign these  categories because of the numerous factors that can influence the  decision for assigning vulnerability scores. The Director also noted that  because she reviews each assessment report and weighs in on each  assigned category, she in effect serves to institutionalize the scores and  ensure they are consistent from airport to airport. Standards for Internal  Control in the Federal Government call for controls and other significant  events to be clearly documented in directives, policies, or manuals to help  ensure operations are carried out as intended. This is especially  important should key staff leave the agency. Although we recognize the  inherently subjective nature of the standards, providing TSA decision  makers with more specific criteria and definitions for determining a foreign  airport\u2019s level of compliance with ICAO standards would provide greater  assurance that such determinations are consistent across airports over  time. The Director acknowledged that additional guidance, such as  examples to illustrate what these categories mean, could help ensure  greater transparency and consistency over how airport vulnerability  scores are determined. Such consistency is important since airport  vulnerability determinations are used to calculate an airport\u2019s overall  security risk level, which in turn affects the program\u2019s activities and  resource needs.", "In addition, TSA officials we spoke with identified opportunities for TSA to  increase program efficiency by conducting more targeted airport  assessments. Specifically, ROC managers and inspectors at all the  locations we visited stated there are opportunities for TSA to conduct  more targeted, smaller scale assessments at foreign airports that could  focus more exclusively on the key security issues at a particular airport  rather than having inspectors conduct full-scale assessments every visit.  For example, the ROC Manager of one location we visited stated that the  Federal Aviation Administration previously conducted supplemental-type  visits of foreign airports that were reduced in scope and only focused on  specific issues or deficiencies that needed to be addressed. He said that  TSA should consider ways to incorporate this type of assessment  philosophy into its current operations as it may help further streamline the  assessment process and associated time frames. ROC managers at all  the locations we visited also said inspectors often know, from their prior  visits and assessment reports, what specific issues are present at specific  airports, and that focusing more time on key issues could provide a more  effective way of addressing and correcting security deficiencies. Twenty  of 23 inspectors we spoke with said this type of assessment would also  reduce repetitive and duplicative data gathering. In addition, these  inspectors stated they sometimes do not have the opportunity to conduct  all necessary onsite operational observations, document reviews, and  interviews because they spend a significant amount of time addressing  other descriptive, less critical aspects of the assessment. They said more  targeted risk-informed assessments would allow them to focus more time  and attention on key security issues, resulting in higher quality and more  useful assessment results. Exploring opportunities to conduct more  targeted assessments could help TSA enhance the efficiency and value  of TSA\u2019s foreign airport assessment program.", "TSA\u2019s Director of Global Compliance told us they have begun to conduct  abbreviated and targeted airport assessments in some cases due to the  security risks associated with traveling and working in certain countries.  For example, in 2011 TSA conducted abbreviated assessments at  airports in Mexico and Iraq, due to the current security situation, which  focused on a select number of critical areas rather than on all topics  typically covered during an assessment. While targeted or abbreviated  assessments are viewed as beneficial in some circumstances, TSA\u2019s  Director of Global Compliance also stated that conducting a  comprehensive assessment is important because inspectors may visit an  airport only once every 3 years, to document any security changes,  deficiencies, or improvements since the previous visit. The Director also  raised a concern about conducting additional targeted assessments if  they limited opportunities to conduct regularly scheduled comprehensive  assessment visits. However, we believe TSA\u2019s use of abbreviated or  targeted assessments could be expanded in cases where it would not  have a negative impact on the program. For example, as TSA works to  systematically analyze the results of its assessments, it may determine  that specific regions of the world need additional assistance in meeting  certain critical standards. TSA could use this information to focus or target  its assessments to address these higher risk scenarios, thus leveraging  program resources. Such efforts are consistent with TSA\u2019s ongoing risk- informed activities, as discussed earlier in this report. Moreover, we have  previously reported that risk-informed, priority driven decisions can help  inform decision makers when allocating finite resources to the areas of  greatest need.", "In addition, TSA has not taken steps to systematically compile or analyze  security best practice information that could contribute to enhancing the  security of both foreign and U.S. airports. TSA officials acknowledged  possible opportunities to better identify, compile, and analyze aviation  security best practices through their assessments at foreign airports. We  have previously reported that in order to identify innovative security  practices that could help further mitigate terrorism-related risk to  transportation sector assets, it is important to assess the feasibility as well  as the costs and benefits of implementing security practices currently  used by foreign countries. While TSA compiles information in its foreign  airport assessment reports to evaluate the degree to which airports are in  compliance with select ICAO standards, it does not have a process in  place to identify and analyze aviation security best practices that are  being used by foreign airports to secure their operations and facilities.  TSA officials agreed that identifying relevant best practices could help  TSA better leverage their assessment activities by assisting foreign  airports in increasing their level of compliance with ICAO standards, as  well as in identifying security practices and technologies that may be  applicable to enhancing the security of U.S. airports.", "In December 2, 2010, testimony before the Senate Committee on  Commerce, Science and Transportation, TSA\u2019s Director of Global  Compliance confirmed that there are a variety of ways in which foreign  airports can effectively meet ICAO standards. For example, one airport  might address access control security by using coded door locks and  swipe cards, while another may lock its doors and limit the number of  available keys to certain personnel. Airports may also establish perimeter  security in different ways, such as through fencing or natural barriers. In  addition, TSA inspectors, as part of the assessment, often obtain detailed  information and understanding of the various types of security  technologies and methods being used by foreign governments, which  may also be applicable and cost-effective for U.S. airports. For example,  while accompanying TSA inspectors during an airport assessment, we  observed TSA inspectors being briefed on various passenger screening  processes, technologies, and equipment that were comparable to, and in  some cases may have exceeded, those used in the U.S. We believe  establishing a mechanism to systematically compile and analyze this type  of information could help ensure TSA is more effectively able to assist  foreign airports in meeting ICAO standards and improve security  practices, as well as identify security practices and technologies that may  be applicable to enhancing the security of U.S. airports."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Securing commercial aviation operations remains a daunting task\u2014with  hundreds of airports and thousands of flights carrying millions of  passengers and pieces of checked baggage to the United States every  year.

TSA has taken a  number of actions to enhance its foreign airport assessment program  since 2007, but additional steps can help further strengthen the program.  For example, developing a mechanism to evaluate assessment results to  determine security trends and patterns could enable TSA to target and  prioritize future assessment activities, including training and other  capacity building resources. Moreover, establishing criteria and guidance  for determining the vulnerability of individual foreign airports would  provide for greater consistency of these vulnerability ratings across  airports over time.

DHS also  stated that TSA established a project team to evaluate regional, country,  and airport vulnerabilities and determine those problem areas that could  be effectively addressed by training. DHS also noted that TSA is  developing workshops that can be presented by inspectors at the  conclusion of an airport assessment which will be tailored to address  specific shortfalls observed during the assessment, which could be  effectively mitigated through training. These actions, when fully  implemented, should address the intent of the recommendation.", "DHS concurred with the second recommendation that TSA establish  criteria and guidance to assist TSA decision makers when determining  the vulnerability rating of individual foreign airports. DHS stated that the  most recent version of the Foreign Airport Assessment Program Standard  Operating Procedures now contains several scenarios for managers to  use as a set of guidelines in determining the vulnerability rating for each  open standard and for the airport overall. DHS also stated that the  Director of Global Compliance and ROC managers will collaborate on the  development of a scenario archive to promote more long-term  consistency in the event that key staff leave the agency. We support  TSA\u2019s efforts to ensure greater transparency and consistency over how  airport vulnerability scores are determined and believe it will be important  for TSA to provide sufficient detail in the criteria and guidance that the  agency develops. Such actions, when fully implemented, should address  the intent of the recommendation.", "DHS concurred with the third recommendation that TSA consider the  feasibility of conducting more targeted assessments and systematically  compiling information on aviation security best practices. In its response,  DHS stated that TSA is developing a pre-audit questionnaire that will be  sent to each host government in advance of a planned airport  assessment which will assist assessment teams in obtaining  administrative information and key documents, such as the Airport  Security Program, prior to the visit. DHS added that when the  questionnaire is returned to TSA, the agency will obtain an official  translation of all submitted items so that the assessment team has a  better understanding of the current policies, procedures, and practices in  place at the site. According to DHS, this practice may enable the team to  tailor its efforts at the airports to focus on those areas of concern as  indicated in the responses to the questionnaire, as well as the critical  standards. DHS stated that TSA plans to complete development of the  questionnaire by mid-fiscal year 2012, with wide-scale deployment  beginning in October 2012. We support TSA\u2019s planned actions but also  believe that there may be additional opportunities for TSA to expand its  use of targeted assessments as it works to implement the first  recommendation related to developing a mechanism to evaluate the  results of completed assessment activities to determine any trends and  target activities and resources. For example, as TSA works to  systematically analyze the results of its assessments, it may determine  that specific regions of the world need assistance in meeting certain  critical standards.

DHS stated that TSA participates in the  development and review of this document and draws from it when  recommending improvements to foreign airport authorities. However, it  noted that an infrequently-populated portion of the foreign airport  assessment reports is available for inspectors to capture particularly  noteworthy practices. DHS stated that during fiscal year 2012, inspectors  will be encouraged to more conscientiously identify and document new  approaches encountered at airports that are not reflected in the security  manual but effectively address the ICAO standards and recommended  practices.

We interviewed other federal and  nonfederal stakeholders, such as the Department of State, International  Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), and the European Commission (EC).  We outline the specific steps taken to answer each objective below.", "To determine the steps TSA has taken to enhance its foreign airport  assessment program since 2007, we reviewed various TSA program  management and strategic planning documents to identify revisions to its  current and planned future strategy. Specifically, we reviewed TSA\u2019s 2010  Foreign Airport Assessment Program Standard Operating Procedures  (SOP) document, which prescribes program and operational guidance for  assessing security measures at foreign airports, and informs TSA  personnel at all levels of what is expected of them in the implementation  of the program. We also reviewed the job aids TSA inspectors use during  each assessment, which ensure that the TSA-specified ICAO aviation  security standards and recommended practices are fully evaluated during  each assessment.", "To determine TSA\u2019s current and planned future strategy, we reviewed  available strategic planning documents that TSA uses to guide its  program. Specifically, we reviewed TSA\u2019s Office of Global Strategies  International Strategy to Enhance Aviation Security for 2010\u20132012, TSA\u2019s  Office of Global Strategies Global Compliance Strategic Implementation  Plan Fiscal Year 2011, and the TSA Capacity Development Strategic  Plan for fiscal years 2011\u20132015. In addition, we also obtained and  reviewed multilateral and bilateral arrangements TSA has established  with the European Union (EU) and several foreign nations to facilitate  coordination in the area of aviation security, including facilitation of TSA\u2019s  foreign airport assessments.", "To understand how TSA assesses and manages its foreign airport risk  information, we obtained and reviewed various program documents.  Specifically, we obtained and reviewed documents on TSA\u2019s methodology  for assigning individual risk rankings (called Tier rankings) to each foreign  airport it assesses. TSA\u2019s rankings are based on the likelihood of a  location being targeted, the protective measures in place at that location,  and the potential impact of an attack on the international transportation  system. Airports are then categorized as high, medium, or low risk. While  we did not evaluate the quality of TSA\u2019s risk rankings, as this analysis  was outside the scope of our work, we generally determined that the  rankings addressed all three components of risk (threat, vulnerability, and  consequence).", "To obtain a greater understanding of the foreign airport assessment  process, including how TSA works with host nation officials, we  accompanied a team of TSA inspectors during an assessment of the  Toronto Pearson International Airport. We based our selection on several  factors, including the airport locations TSA had plans to assess during the  course of our audit work, host government willingness to allow us to  accompany TSA, and travel costs.", "To obtain information on the extent to which TSA provided oversight of its  assessment efforts, we obtained and reviewed various TSA program  management documents and tools TSA uses to track and manage  information for the program. Specifically, we reviewed the TSA Airport  and Air Carrier Comprehensive Tool (known as the A.C.T.), which TSA  uses to track its foreign airport assessment schedule, including when  various airports are due to be assessed. We also reviewed the Open  Standards and Recommended Practices Tracking Tool, which the TSA  Representatives (TSAR) use to monitor and track a foreign airport\u2019s  progress in resolving security deficiencies identified by TSA inspectors  during previous assessments. In addition, we reviewed the tracking sheet  TSA\u2019s Director of Global Compliance uses to compile and track current-  and prior-year assessment results, including individual airport vulnerability  scores and information on which specific ICAO standards were in  noncompliance.", "To obtain stakeholder views and perspectives on steps TSA has taken to  enhance its foreign airport assessment program since 2007, we  interviewed and obtained information from various federal and nonfederal  stakeholders. Specifically, we interviewed TSA officials located in the  Office of Global Strategies (OGS), Global Compliance (GC), Office of  International Operations (OIO), and Capacity Development Branch  (CDB). In addition, we also conducted site visits to four of the five TSA  Regional Operations Centers (ROC) located in Los Angeles, Dallas,  Miami, and Frankfurt where we met with the ROC managers and 23  international aviation security inspectors who conduct TSA\u2019s foreign  airport assessments. We based our site visit selections on the number of  available inspectors at each location and geographic dispersion.", "We conducted telephone and in-person interviews with 9 of the 27  TSARs, located in various embassies and consulates throughout the  world, who schedule TSA airport assessment visits and follow up on host  governments\u2019 progress in addressing identified security deficiencies.  When possible, we conducted in-person interviews with TSARs who were  at TSA ROCs during our site visits. We based our TSAR selections on  geographic dispersion and varying years of experience. During each of  these interviews, we discussed these officials\u2019 responsibilities related to  the program, including their role in assisting foreign officials in correcting  security deficiencies identified during assessments.", "We met with Department of State officials to better understand how they  coordinate with TSA through their Anti-Terrorism Assistance (ATA)  Program and other related efforts aimed at assisting foreign partners\u2019  capacity to secure their airports. Additionally, we met with officials from  the EC, International Air Transport Association, and ICAO to discuss  efforts and programs these organizations have in place to enhance  international aviation security. We interviewed or received responses to  questions from five foreign embassies to obtain perspectives of foreign  transportation security officials on TSA\u2019s airport assessment program. We  based our selection on geographic dispersion and countries with the  highest risk airports, as designated by TSA. However, information from  our interviews with government officials, members of the aviation industry,  and TSA officials and inspectors cannot be generalized beyond those that  we spoke with because we did not use statistical sampling techniques in  selecting individuals to interview.", "To identify challenges affecting TSA\u2019s foreign airport assessment  program, we interviewed TSA program management officials and field  officials located at the TSA ROCs on the challenges they experience  obtaining access to foreign airports to conduct assessments, the  development of an automated database management system, and the  provision of aviation security training to foreign governments. In addition,  we met with TSA\u2019s Director of Global Compliance, and ROC managers  and inspectors located in the field, to discuss potential future challenges  TSA may experience when attempting to conduct assessments at foreign  airports with all-cargo flights to the United States. Specifically, we  obtained their perspectives on foreign governments that have been  reluctant to allow TSA inspectors to visit their airports. We interviewed  TSA\u2019s Director of Global Compliance on the agency\u2019s progress in  developing an automated database to manage program information,  including the challenges the agency has experienced finding a solution  that meets program needs. We conducted telephone and in-person  interviews with nine TSARs to obtain their perspectives on challenges to  scheduling airport assessment visits. In addition, we interviewed officials  within TSA\u2019s CDB to better understand the scope and types of requests  for assistance they receive from foreign countries, including challenges  they experience in attempting to provide assistance, such as resource  constraints and aligning security priorities with the Department of State.", "To determine the results of TSA\u2019s foreign airport assessments and the  extent to which the agency evaluates its results to inform future activities,  we interviewed TSA officials on the results of its assessments, obtained  and reviewed assessment reports and relevant program documents, and  conducted our own independent analysis of TSA\u2019s assessment results.  To better understand the scope and type of information contained in  TSA\u2019s foreign airport assessment reports, we obtained and reviewed the  most recently available assessments for all high-risk airports. We also  selected a randomized sample of assessment reports from current and  prior years. We reviewed sections of these reports for completeness and  general consistency with TSA guidance for preparing assessment reports.  We obtained and reviewed TSA\u2019s foreign airport risk-ranking sheet to  better understand which airports TSA identified as high, medium, and low  risk, including how the results of TSA\u2019s assessments influence an  airport\u2019s risk ranking. In addition, we obtained and reviewed TSA\u2019s foreign  airport assessment program vulnerability results tracking sheet used by  the Director of Global Compliance to compile and track current and prior- year assessment results. This tracking sheet included records of TSA\u2019s  compliance assessments for each airport that TSA assessed from fiscal  year 1997 through May 9, 2011. Specifically, the tracking sheet recorded  assessment results for each of the ICAO standards used in the airport  assessments, as well as an overall vulnerability score of 1 through 5  assigned after each assessment. This overall vulnerability score is a  representation of compliance or noncompliance with all the ICAO  standards against which TSA assesses foreign airports. We interviewed  the Director of Global Compliance on the steps taken to develop the  tracking sheet, including how TSA manages and updates data, and how  TSA assigns vulnerability scores. In addition, we conducted our own  independent analysis of TSA\u2019s assessment results from fiscal year 2006  through May 9, 2011. Specifically, we analyzed data from TSA\u2019s foreign  airport assessment program vulnerability results tracking sheet to identify  the number of airports in each vulnerability category by region. We also  analyzed TSA assessment results data to determine the frequency with  which foreign airports complied with particular ICAO standards, such as  access control, quality control, passenger screening, and baggage  screening, among others. For those airports that TSA has identified as  high risk, we analyzed TSA assessment results data to determine the  number of resolved and remaining compliance issues at high-risk airports  by region, as well as the level of noncompliance found at high-risk  airports.", "To assess the reliability of TSA\u2019s data, we selected a random sample of  records from TSA\u2019s foreign airport assessment program vulnerability  results tracking sheet. Next, we examined the corresponding reports to  locate those ICAO standards that had been identified as less than fully  compliant in the tracking sheet (a score of 2 through 5 on a 5-point  scale). The actual scores assigned to the compliance ratings and found  in the tracking sheet were determined by the Director of Global  Compliance using guidance in the 2010 SOP in consultation with  individuals involved in the assessment process (ROC managers,  Supervisory Transportation Security Specialists, and Transportation  Security Specialists). Our comparison of the results in the tracking sheet  with the compliance information provided in the corresponding reports did  not match in several cases. However, in discussions with TSA we  determined that the differences were the result of changes to the ICAO  standards used in the assessments or a change in the definition of the  standards. Specifically, TSA told us that Amendments 10 and 11 to ICAO  Annex 17 changed the definitions of some standards, and the numbers  assigned to identify them. For example, a standard concerning Hold  Baggage Security is now identified as 4.5.1. However, in years prior to  Amendments 10 and 11 to Annex 17, that same standard was identified  as 4.1.1. TSA\u2019s Director of Global Compliance told us that she updated  the foreign airport assessment program vulnerability results tracking  sheet with the new definitions and numbers, and the associated results,  each time an ICAO amendment came out. As a result, we determined  that any analysis of the assessment results for specific ICAO standards  would need to take into account the changes TSA identified. Based on  our overall analysis of the data and reports, we determined that the data  were sufficiently reliable to provide a general indication, by type or  category, of the standards TSA assesses against and the level of  compliance, and frequency of compliance, for TSA\u2019s airport assessments  over the period of our analysis.", "In addition, we interviewed TSA\u2019s Director of Global Compliance on the  steps TSA takes to analyze its assessment results to inform the agency\u2019s  future efforts and compared these efforts to Standards for Internal Control  in the Federal Government. We discussed the status of implementation  of our 2007 recommendation to develop outcome-oriented performance  measures to evaluate the impact that TSA assessments have on  improving foreign airport compliance with ICAO standards. We  interviewed TSA managers and inspectors located in the field on their  roles and responsibilities in determining and documenting assessment  results. We assessed TSA\u2019s efforts to analyze its assessment results  against Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government, which  require agencies to ensure that ongoing monitoring occurs during the  course of normal operations to help evaluate program effectiveness.", "To identify opportunities for TSA to enhance the value of TSA\u2019s foreign  airport assessment program, we reviewed all relevant program  management and strategic documentation, and interviewed TSA officials  as well as various other federal and nonfederal stakeholders. Specifically,  we reviewed the 2011 Foreign Airport Assessment Program SOP and job  aids; OGS, GC, and CDB strategic planning documents; foreign airport  risk assessment and ranking information; program management tools  TSA uses to track and manage its schedule and the status of foreign  airport security deficiencies; and reviewed TSA foreign airport  assessment results and reports. We also reviewed our prior work  concerning how risk-informed and priority driven decisions can help  inform agency decision makers in allocating finite resources to the areas  of greatest need.", "Moreover, we reviewed the process TSA uses to assign vulnerability  ratings of 1-5 to each foreign airport it assesses and then evaluated this  process against Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government, which call for controls and other significant events to be  clearly documented in directives, policies, or manuals to help ensure  operations are carried out as intended. In addition, we visited the  Toronto Pearson International Airport to observe TSA inspectors during  the assessment thereby obtaining a greater understanding of the foreign  airport assessment process, including opportunities for TSA to improve its  program. We reviewed prior GAO work discussing the importance of  identifying potential best practices, as part of conducting U.S. federal  government security assessments in other countries.", "To obtain stakeholder views and perspectives on opportunities to  enhance the program, we interviewed and obtained information from  various TSA and nonfederal stakeholders. Specifically, we interviewed  TSA headquarters officials in GC, OIO, and CDB. During our site visits,  we interviewed ROC managers and international inspectors on possible  opportunities that exist for TSA to improve its foreign airport assessment  program. We discussed opportunities to improve the program during our  telephone and in-person interviews with nine TSARs. In addition, we  discussed ways in which TSA could improve its program during our  interviews with officials from the EC, ICAO, and select foreign embassies.", "We conducted this performance audit from August 2010 through October  2011 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
