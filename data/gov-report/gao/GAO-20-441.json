IUU  fishing is a broad term that includes a variety of fishing activities with  social, economic, and environmental impacts and concerns all aspects  and stages of the capture and marketing of fish, according to the United  Nations\u2019 Food and Agriculture Organization. Examples of IUU activities  include fishing without a license or in excess of quota for certain species;  failing to report catches or making false reports on catches; and  conducting unauthorized transshipments, such as transfers of fish to  cargo vessels at sea or port, according to NOAA. IUU fishing poses a  threat to food security and socioeconomic stability in many parts of the  world, according to NOAA documents, and many crew members on  fishing vessels that engage in IUU fishing are from poor or  underdeveloped areas.

For example, forced labor  may occur if workers are held on fishing vessels for long durations without  adequate breaks or the ability to return to land. It may also occur in later  stages of seafood processing, such as during filleting and canning the fish  for export and sale to consumer, according to an NGO report.  Additionally, various NGO reports indicate that during the harvesting and  processing stages, seafood caught with forced labor may be combined  with legally caught seafood, making illegal shipments more difficult to  identify. For example, companies may combine catches from several  smaller boats onto a bigger vessel before transporting it to shore for  processing. Moreover, some seafood supply chains have an additional  layer of complexity because low-value fish may not be directly exported  but, rather, used as feed for farm-raised seafood that could eventually be  imported into the United States. Forced labor related to this type of  situation can be difficult to detect because the source of feed for farm- raised fish is an early step in a supply chain that occurs well before the  seafood is imported into the United States, according to CBP officials."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Laws and Regulations Relevant to Detaining Seafood Imports Produced by Forced Labor and Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated Fishing", "paragraphs": ["Federal law prohibits the import of goods made with forced labor.

According to CBP documents and officials, the process CBP  uses to enforce section 307 generally includes four phases: (1) assessing  leads to determine whether to initiate a case; (2) investigating cases; (3)  reviewing information for legal sufficiency to propose a WRO; and (4)  implementing the WRO and detaining shipments (see fig. 3). An importer  has several options if CBP detains its shipment, including contesting the  WRO or deciding not to enter the good into U.S. commerce.", "Phase 1: Initiation. CBP analysts within the Forced Labor Division  assess leads for credibility when deciding whether to initiate cases  involving potential forced labor at any point in the supply chain for a  particular good. According to CBP officials, an analyst would examine,  for example, whether an allegation made by an external party is  credible, the goods in question are being imported into the United  States, and sufficient information is available on potential forced labor  to initiate and build a case. CBP officials told us that they do not have  the resources to gather firsthand information on labor practices such  as on fishing vessels or processing operations overseas, but that they  can initiate cases based on information obtained from external  sources. For example, CBP may receive information through its e- allegations system, which is CBP\u2019s online mechanism for the public to  report any suspected violations of trade laws or regulations related to  the importation of goods into the United States. In addition, CBP  may receive an allegation directly from external entities, such as  NGOs; letters from industry or other concerned parties; and  information from other U.S. government agencies. Publicly available  information, such as media reports or NGO publications, can also  serve as leads for CBP to self-initiate a case.

CBP analysts investigate cases by collecting  information from various sources to help determine whether the  evidence \u201creasonably but not conclusively\u201d indicates that goods being  imported into the United States were produced with forced labor,  according to CBP officials. For example, analysts may ask other  federal agencies for information, such as import data, or speak with  NGOs that may have information about a particular good or supply  chain overseas. CBP officials also said they may investigate the  strength of the information collected as part of their case  development. In doing so, they said the Forced Labor Division uses  the International Labor Organization\u2019s forced labor indicators, among  other standards, to help evaluate the sufficiency of evidence for forced  labor conditions. If there is insufficient evidence to continue  investigating a case, the Forced Labor Division may either close or  suspend it pending further information, according to CBP officials.

CBP\u2019s Forced Labor Division prepares a  package, which includes an assessment of evidence and a  justification for a proposed WRO for the goods suspected to be  produced with forced labor, and submits it to CBP\u2019s Office of Chief  Counsel for legal review. To propose a WRO, CBP officials said that  the package must provide sufficient evidence to reasonably but not  conclusively indicate a violation of section 307. This entails having  sufficient supply chain information showing importation of a good  harvested, produced, or otherwise manufactured with forced labor,  according to CBP officials. During its legal review, the Office of Chief  Counsel may request additional information or have discussions with  the Forced Labor Division.

Alternatively, officials said the importer can contest the detention and  provide additional information to show that the shipment did not contain  forced labor elements. If CBP determines the importer has provided  sufficient evidence, it allows the shipment to enter into U.S. commerce.  Should the importer not provide additional information, the shipment can  be excluded (not admitted into U.S. commerce) and/or seized and  destroyed in certain circumstances, according to CBP officials. A WRO  remains in place until the circumstances surrounding the original WRO  change to indicate that forced labor is no longer part of the production or  manufacturing process, and the CBP Commissioner revokes the order,  according to CBP documents.

For example, representatives from one NGO said it was  not clear what constituted a credible allegation for CBP, or what  information CBP needs to make a section 307 determination. Additionally,  representatives from two NGOs managing a grant program designed to  support nonprofit organizations collecting firsthand evidence of forced  labor said that they were unable to obtain specific guidance from CBP on  the types of information the agency needs. As a result, these  representatives said they could not communicate to potential grantees the  specific kinds of information that would be most useful to submit to CBP.  In asking CBP officials about this, CBP confirmed that the NGOs had  reached out but they misunderstood the goals of the grant program at the  time.", "CBP could improve the quality of information it receives from  stakeholders, including NGOs, by better communicating what information  is most useful to initiate and investigate forced labor cases, including  those involving seafood, according to stakeholders. Of the 14  stakeholders that told us there was uncertainty, 11 indicated that  additional or clearer information about the agency\u2019s information needs  could result in more reporting of information to CBP. For example,  representatives from one NGO said there was reluctance among  stakeholders that may have limited resources to develop an allegation  without knowing whether it is helpful, and that they would be more likely  to do so with a better understanding of CBP\u2019s needs. Similarly,  representatives from another NGO said it is not worth dedicating the time  and resources to develop an allegation without a clear sense of the types  of information CBP is looking for to investigate its forced labor cases.  Many of these stakeholders indicated that they are collecting firsthand  information about potential forced labor in seafood supply chains in  countries where labor violations are prevalent, which is information CBP  officials told us could benefit forced labor investigations.", "CBP officials said they have communicated in general about their  information needs for forced labor cases, and that requisite information  varies by case, including for seafood cases. The agency\u2019s website  contains some information, including a reference to a regulation  identifying information individuals are to submit to CBP when making a  forced labor allegation. However, CBP does not indicate what specific  information to submit such as the timing or location of alleged forced labor  activities. Similarly, CBP does not provide examples of the type of  information\u2014such as photos or testimonials from victims\u2014that could be  useful information for initiating or investigating cases.", "In addition, CBP officials said that their e-allegations system provides a  means for stakeholders to submit allegations of potential forced labor,  among other things, to the agency. However, as of April 2020, the  instructions for submitting an allegation do not include specifics on the  types of information CBP needs to initiate or investigate cases, such as  whether photographs or firsthand accounts of forced labor could be  helpful. CBP officials agreed with the need to better communicate to  stakeholders the types of information that are helpful for initiating or  investigating forced labor cases. They said that the Forced Labor  Division had begun considering how it might do so but, to date, had yet to  identify further details such as the approach it might take.", "Federal standards for internal control establish that management should  externally communicate the necessary quality information to achieve an  agency\u2019s objectives. For example, an agency should use appropriate  methods to communicate quality information so that external parties can  help the agency achieve its objectives.

With the United States importing billions of  dollars\u2019 worth of seafood in 2018 and reliant on those imports for much of  the seafood it consumes, it is important that CBP take action to detect  and prevent imports produced with forced labor from entering the country.  Following the enactment of TFTEA in February 2016, CBP created the  Forced Labor Division and placed an increased emphasis on detecting  forced labor in imports, including seafood. CBP officials told us they do  not have the resources to gather firsthand information on labor practices.  To this end, CBP uses information from a variety of sources, including  external stakeholders such as NGOs, to initiate and investigate cases.  However, stakeholders are unclear about the types of information CBP  needs to initiate and investigate cases because CBP has not clearly  communicated this information.

These laws included section 307 of the Tariff Act of 1930  and the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 (TFTEA).  We interviewed CBP officials from the Office of Trade and Office of Field  Operations, in both Washington, D.C., and the field, who are involved in  forced labor detection and enforcement about the steps in CBP\u2019s process  to enforce section 307. In addition, we interviewed officials from U.S.  Immigration and Customs Enforcement to learn about their involvement in  addressing section 307. We examined CBP\u2019s efforts to enforce section  307 since TFTEA was enacted, in February 2016, through March 2020,  the most currently available information at the time of our review.

We reviewed CBP\u2019s list of civil  enforcement actions pertaining to all commodities it published on its  website. In addition, we collected and analyzed information specific to  seafood from a spreadsheet that CBP uses to track cases, which contains  information on all of its active, suspended, and inactive forced labor  investigations pertaining to section 307. CBP provided us with updated  versions of this case-tracking spreadsheet in July 2019, November 2019,  and March 2020. To assess the reliability of the data, we interviewed  CBP officials about the accuracy and completeness of the data and  discussed each seafood case to understand the data represented in the  various fields, such as how the seafood case originated and what the  outcome of the case was. We also discussed in detail the information that  led to the one seafood withhold release order (WRO) CBP issued in  February 2019.

We identified NGOs using  internet searches for groups focused on seafood and forced labor and  the recommendations of officials from federal agencies and NGOs we  interviewed. We also selected NGOs that represented a variety of  goals and missions, including those focused on helping U.S. importers  remain compliant with section 307 and those focused on assistance to  survivors of forced labor overseas.

In some cases, NGO  representatives we interviewed told us their organizations were unable to  share information with CBP because of external factors, such as  nondisclosure agreements or differing information collection objectives,  but they noted that CBP actions could affect the likelihood of other  stakeholders sharing information.
