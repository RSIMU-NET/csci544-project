In response to the President's Management Agenda real property initiative and a related executive order, agencies have, among other things, established asset management plans; standardized data reporting; and adopted performance measures. Also, the administration has created a Federal Real Property Council (FRPC) and plans to work with Congress to provide agencies with tools to better manage real property. These are positive steps, but underlying problems still exist. For example, the Departments of Energy (Energy) and Homeland Security (DHS) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) reported during this review that over 10 percent of their facilities are excess or underutilized. Also, Energy, NASA, the General Services Administration (GSA), and the Departments of the Interior (Interior), State (State), and Veterans Affairs (VA) reported repair and maintenance backlogs for buildings and structures that total over $16 billion. The Department of Defense (DOD) reported a $57 billion restoration and modernization backlog. Also, Energy, Interior, GSA, State, and VA reported an increased reliance on leasing to meet space needs. While agencies have made progress in collecting and reporting standardized real property data, data reliability is still a challenge at DOD and other agencies, and agencies lack a standard framework for data validation. Finally, agencies reported using risk-based approaches to prioritize security needs, which GAO has suggested, but some cited obstacles such as a lack of resources for security enhancements. In past high-risk updates, GAO called for a transformation strategy to address the long-standing problems in this area. While the administration's approach is generally consistent with what GAO envisioned, certain areas warrant further attention. Specifically, problems are exacerbated by underlying obstacles that include competing stakeholder interests, legal and budgetary limitations, and the need for improved capital planning. For example, agencies cited local interests as barriers to disposing of excess property, and agencies' limited ability to pursue ownership leads them to lease property that may be more cost-effective to own over time."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In January 2003, we designated federal real property as a high-risk area  because of long-standing problems with excess and underutilized  property, deteriorating facilities, unreliable real property data, and over- reliance on costly leasing.

In  addition, we found that these problems have been exacerbated by  obstacles that include competing stakeholder interests in real property  decisions, various legal and budget-related limitations, the need for better  agency capital planning, and the lack of a strategic, governmentwide focus  on real property issues. In our 2005 high-risk update, we reported that the  administration had initiated several key reform efforts that included  issuing Executive Order 13327 in February 2004 and adding the real  property initiative to the President\u2019s Management Agenda (PMA).

The federal  government controls over $374 billion (gross value) in real property assets  worldwide. DOD, USPS, GSA, and VA hold the majority of the owned and  leased facility space, totaling over 3 billion square feet of space. Numerous  laws and regulations govern the acquisition, management, and disposal of  federal real property. The Federal Property and Administrative Services  Act of 1949, as amended (Property Act), is the law that generally applies to  real property held by federal agencies, and GSA is responsible for the act\u2019s  implementation. Agencies are subject to the Property Act unless they are  specifically exempted from it. Agencies may also have their own statutory  authority related to real property outside of the Property Act. In addition,  agencies must comply with numerous other laws related to real property.  For example, the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act  (McKinney Act), as amended, provides that property that agencies have  identified as unnecessary for mission requirements must first be made  available to assist the homeless. The National Historic Preservation Act,  as amended, requires agencies to manage historic properties under their  control and jurisdiction and to consider the effects of their actions on  historic preservation. USPS, which is an independent establishment in the  executive branch, is authorized to sell, lease, or dispose of property under  its general powers. USPS is exempt from most federal laws dealing with  real property and contracting.", "A number of federal laws enacted in the 1990s, including the Federal  Acquisition Streamlining Act, the Clinger-Cohen Act, and the Government  Performance and Results Act of 1993, placed increased emphasis on  improving capital decision-making practices. OMB has issued various  guidance and requirements for agencies to implement in developing  disciplined capital programming processes. For example, the Capital  Programming Guide is intended to provide agencies with a basic  reference for establishing an effective investment decision-making  process. Agencies are expected to have a disciplined capital  programming process, and the Capital Programming Guide and our  Executive Guide are intended to help them effectively plan, procure, and  use assets to achieve the maximum return on investment. Under the guide,  agencies have flexibility in implementing the key principles.", "Real property decisions draw considerable attention during congressional  deliberations over federal appropriations. Members of Congress take a  keen interest in federal facilities in their districts and in the economic  impact of any decisions. Several stakeholders other than Congress, OMB,  and the real property-holding agencies, have an interest in how the federal  government carries out its real property acquisition, management, and  disposal practices. These stakeholders include state and local  governments, business interests in the communities where the real  property assets are located, private sector construction and leasing firms,  historic preservation organizations, various advocacy groups, and the  public in general, which often views the facilities as the physical face of  the federal government in their communities. At both the national and  local levels, federal real property practices also often attract significant  media attention, particularly when these practices are under scrutiny for  waste and mismanagement.", "In response to our designation of federal real property as a high-risk area,  the President signed Executive Order 13327 in February 2004. Shortly after  the issuance of the executive order, the President added the Federal Asset  Management Initiative, commonly referred to as the real property  initiative, to the PMA. The executive order, which applies to 24 executive  branch departments and agencies but not to USPS, established new  federal property guidelines for these agencies. To increase accountability  for real property asset management, the executive order called for each  agency to establish the position of Senior Real Property Officer. This  officer is required to prepare and submit to OMB an asset management  plan that is intended to ensure systematic agency procedures and actions  related to real property asset management. The executive order also called  for establishing a FRPC to develop guidance, collect best practices, and  help the Senior Real Property Officers improve the management of real  property assets. FRPC is to be composed of the Senior Real Property  Officers, the Controller of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB),  the Administrator of General Services, and any other officials or  employees permitted by the chair of FRPC. The Deputy Director for  Management for OMB is to be the chair, and OMB is to provide funding  and administrative support to the Council. OMB, FRPC and GSA all have  various roles and responsibilities under the executive order, as shown in  table 1.", "The real property initiative was added to the PMA, which is an  administration program that has raised the visibility of key,  govermentwide management challenges; increased the emphasis on  achieving outcome based results; and reinforced the need for agencies to  focus on sustaining improvements that address long-standing management  problems, including items on our high-risk list. The Executive Branch  Management Scorecard, which OMB administers, tracks how well  agencies are executing the governmentwide management initiatives. The  scorecard employs a simple grading system: green for success, yellow for  mixed results, and red for unsatisfactory. Scores are based on scorecard  standards for success that have been developed for each initiative. The  real property initiative focuses on the 15 largest landholding agencies,  except for USPS; and, like the executive order, the initiative is designed to  ensure that property inventories are maintained at the right size, cost, and  condition to support agency missions and objectives. The real property  initiative\u2019s framework consists of various layers, as shown in figure 1,  which include asset management decision-making tools that are intended  to help agencies right-size their inventories.", "To help agencies achieve these objectives, the base of the initiative\u2019s  framework specifies a complete and accurate inventory of all constructed  assets; asset management plans that systematize agency procedures and  actions related to asset management; and performance metrics against  which agencies can measure and evaluate asset management performance.  Also, the performance assessment tool segment provides an analytical  formula to help federal agencies better identify and rank their assets using  performance measurement data to highlight properties that are  nonmission-dependent, underutilized, costly to operate, and in poor  condition for possible disposal or rehabilitation. The legislative authority  segment is intended to help address barriers and process inefficiencies  that agencies currently encounter when disposing of, transferring,  constructing, or renovating assets in the modern real estate market. The  initiative also requires agencies to develop a 3-year timeline that is  updated annually and identifies the specific real property reform activities  that support their individual asset management plans."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Administration and Major Real Property-Holding Agencies Have Taken Actions to Strategically Manage Real Property and Address Some Long- standing Problems", "paragraphs": ["Pursuant to Executive Order 13327, the administration established the  FRPC to support reform efforts.

Another 6 underutilized assets with  approximately 580,000 gross square feet and $1.4 million in operating costs  are projected for disposal in the next 5 years, pending customer  relocation. However, it is too early to tell whether GSA will be successful  in disposing of these assets. Furthermore, VA officials reported that VA  has a significant number of properties no longer located in places where  veterans live, and many of these properties are over 50 or 60 years old.  Two examples of excess federal properties are the former Main VA  Hospital Building, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and the former Main Post  Office in Chicago, Illinois, both of which are vacant (see fig. 5).", "Addressing the needs of aging and deteriorating federal facilities remains a  problem for major real property-holding agencies. According to current  estimates, tens of billions of dollars will be needed to repair or restore  these assets so that they are fully functional. Furthermore, much of the  federal portfolio was constructed over 50 years ago, and these assets are  reaching the end of their useful lives. Energy, NASA, GSA, Interior, State,  and VA reported repair and maintenance backlogs for buildings and  structures that total over $16 billion. In addition, DOD reported a $57  billion restoration and modernization backlog.", "To determine whether agencies still have repair and restoration backlogs,  we asked each agency to provide updated estimates of their backlogs,  which we defined as needs in facilities for which major upkeep, repair,  and maintenance have not been funded and the repair and maintenance on  these assets has been postponed. We found that there was variation in  how agencies reported data on their backlog. Some agencies reported  deferred maintenance figures consistent with the definition used for data  on deferred maintenance included in their financial statements. Others  provided data that included major renovation or restoration needs. More  specifically,    For DOD, facilities restoration and modernization requirements total over  $57 billion. Officials noted that the backlog does not reflect the impact of  BRAC 2005 or related strategic rebasing decisions that will be  implemented over the next several years. BRAC decisions that result in  closing installations will reduce the overall restoration and modernization  backlog. However, this benefit will be partially offset by new requirements  to restore and modernize facilities to accommodate new missions at  gaining BRAC installations.", "For Energy, the backlog in fiscal year 2005 for a portfolio valued at $85.2  billion was $3.6 billion. Officials reported that Energy\u2019s real property  portfolio is aging and assets had been undermaintained in the past; but the  department has emphasized maintenance and has been funding  maintenance within accepted industry guidelines. Moreover, Energy  officials added that multiple real property owning programs have  established funding lines to address the existing backlog. Energy has seen  a stabilization of deferred maintenance and has indications that the overall  backlog has gone down.", "For Interior, officials reported an estimated maintenance backlog of over  $3 billion for buildings and other structures. Officials reported that each  bureau maintains its deferred maintenance backlog based on condition  assessments. Interior officials noted that the maintenance backlog cannot  be expressed as a static figure. For example, in the case of the National  Park Service (NPS), it is based on a limited set of assets (buildings, roads,  water and wastewater plants, trails, and campgrounds) but does not  include other assets such as national landmarks and monument. The  maintenance backlog is based on preliminary condition assessments that  were completed prior to the end of fiscal year 2006. Interior officials noted  that they are continually finding out more about its assets as part of the  comprehensive assessments. Furthermore, every asset is not of equal  priority, according to Interior officials, and managers must make informed  decisions about where to invest dollars using management tools, including  performance metrics. Interior officials also reported that the department  has significantly improved its management of maintenance and  construction priorities and projects with the implementation of the 5-year  plan, the facility condition index, and the asset priority index.", "GSA\u2019s current maintenance backlog is estimated at $6.6 billion. GSA  officials cited obtaining additional sources of capital as the major barrier  in addressing the maintenance backlog. Specifically, officials noted that  additional appropriations are generally not available for reinvestment or  operating expenses, and GSA can rely only on what the Federal Buildings  Fund generates. According to officials, many of GSA\u2019s buildings are in  need of extensive renovation and the reinvestment needs of the portfolio  have not been met with available funding.", "For State, the maintenance backlog is estimated at $132 million, which  includes all of the deferred/unfunded maintenance and repair needs for  prior fiscal years. Officials noted that major rehabilitation projects require  funding of at least $100 million annually.", "For NASA, the restoration and repair backlog is estimated at over $2.05  billion as of the end of fiscal year 2006. Officials noted that having a  maintenance backlog can result in further damage if, for example, a roof  leak is not repaired and water intrusion causes further damage.", "For VA, the maintenance backlog for facilities with major repair needs is  estimated at $5 billion, and according to VA officials, VA must address this  aged infrastructure while patient loads are changing.

For example, we testified in October 2005 that for the Patent and  Trademark Office\u2019s long-term requirements in northern Virginia, the cost  of an operating lease was estimated to be $48 million more than  construction and $38 million more than lease purchase. However, over the  last decade we have reported that GSA\u2014as the central leasing agent for  most agencies\u2014 relies heavily on operating leases to meet new long-term  needs because it lacks funds to pursue ownership.", "Operating leases have become an attractive option, in part because they  generally \u201clook cheaper\u201d in any given year, even though they are generally  more costly over time.

Operating  leases were intended for short-term needs and thus, under the  scorekeeping rules, only the amount needed to cover the first year lease  payments plus cancellation costs needs to be recorded. However, the rules  have been stretched to allow budget authority for some long-term needs  being met with operating leases to be spread out over the term of the  lease, thereby disguising the fact that over time, leasing will cost more  than ownership. Resolving this problem has been difficult; however,  change is needed because the current practice of relying on costly leasing  to meet long-term space needs results in excessive costs to taxpayers and  does not reflect a sensible or economically rational approach to capital  asset management.", "Five of the nine largest real property-holding agencies\u2014Energy, Interior,  GSA, State, and VA\u2014reported an increased reliance on operating leases to  meet new space needs over the past 5 years.

As an alternative, we have suggested  scoring the budget authority for all operating leases up front on the basis  of the underlying time requirement for the space so that all options are  treated equally. If pursued, this approach would pose implementation  challenges, including the need to evaluate the validity of agencies\u2019 stated  space requirements. Finding a solution for this problem has been difficult;  however, the current practice of relying on costly leasing to meet long- term space needs results in excessive costs to taxpayers and does not  reflect a sensible or economically rational approach to capital asset  management.

As previously  mentioned, the first governmentwide reporting of inventory data for FRPP  took place in December 2005, and GSA published the data on behalf of  FRPC, in June 2006. According to the 2005 FRPP report, the goals of the  centralized database are to improve decision making with accurate and  reliable data, provide the ability to benchmark federal real property assets,  and consolidate governmentwide real property data collection into one  system.

Officials reported that it was difficult  to agree on one definition for elements such as square footage (e.g., gross  versus rentable) and value (e.g., book, appraised, or replacement) when  agencies use many working definitions for those elements. According to  OMB staff, FRPC has analyzed the results of the initial inventory data  reporting and determined that at this time, the guidance does not need  further revision. Currently, FRPC is working to promote the identification  and prioritization of assets for disposal; assets that are in good condition  and are highly used are considered low priority, and assets that are in poor  condition and have high operating costs are considered high priority.", "OMB staff reported that the subjective nature of some data elements was  also a challenge when attempting to make comparisons across agencies.  According to OMB staff, the FRPC guidance was drafted to allow each  agency to interpret mission criticality in an agency-specific manner. For  example, part of GSA\u2019s mission is to help federal agencies better serve the  public by providing workplaces. Therefore, GSA\u2019s fulfillment of tenant  agencies\u2019 space needs at a location would make that location mission  dependent from GSA\u2019s perspective. For agencies such as Energy, officials  reported that mission dependency is determined based on the application  of published definitions of mission critical, mission dependent, and not  mission dependent.

It seems reasonable to allow agencies to retain  enough of the proceeds to recoup the costs of disposal, and it may make  sense to permit agencies to retain additional proceeds for reinvestment in  real property where a need exists.

A number  of laws enacted in the 1990s placed increased emphasis on improving  capital decision-making practices and OMB\u2019s Capital Programming  Guide and its revisions to Circular A-11 have attempted to address the  government\u2019s shortcomings in this area.", "Our prior work assessing agencies\u2019 implementation of the planning phase  principles in OMB\u2019s Capital Programming Guide and our Executive  Guide found that some agencies\u2019 practices did not fully conform to the  OMB principles and agencies\u2019 implementation of capital planning  principles was mixed. Specifically, while agencies\u2019 capital planning  processes generally linked to their strategic goals and objectives and most  of the agencies we reviewed had formal processes for ranking and  selecting proposed capital investments, the agencies have had limited  success with using agencywide asset inventory systems and data on asset  condition to identify performance gaps. In addition, we found that none of  the agencies had developed a comprehensive, agencywide, long-term  capital investment plan. The agency capital investment plan is intended to  explain the background for capital decisions and should include a baseline  assessment of agency needs that examines existing assets and identifies  gaps and help define an agency\u2019s long-term investment decisions. In  January 2004, we recommended that OMB begin to require that agencies  submit long-term capital plans to OMB. Since that report was issued, VA\u2014 which was one of our initial case study agencies\u2014issued its first 5-year  capital plan. However, recent work in this area showed that although OMB  now encourages such plans, it does not collect them, and the agencies that  were included in this review did not have agencywide long-term capital  investment plans.", "Shortcomings in the capital planning and decision-making area have clear  implications for the administration\u2019s real property initiative. Real property  is one of the major types of capital assets that agencies acquire. Other  capital assets include information technology, major equipment, and  intellectual property. OMB staff said that agency asset management plans  are supposed to align with the capital plans but that OMB does not assess  whether the plans are in alignment. We found that guidance for the asset  management plans does not discuss how these plans should be linked with  agencies\u2019 broader capital planning efforts outlined in the Capital  Programming Guide. In fact, OMB\u2019s asset management plan sample,  referred to as the \u201cshelf document,\u201d which agencies use to develop the  asset management plans, makes no reference to the guide.

As a result, this area remains high risk until  agencies show significant results in eliminating the problems by, for  example, reducing inventories of excess facilities and making headway in  addressing the repair backlog. Furthermore, the current efforts lack an  overall framework for helping agencies ensure the validity of real property  data in FRPP and do not adequately address the costliness of long-term  leases and security challenges. While the administration has taken several  steps to overcome some obstacles in the real property area, the obstacle  posed by competing stakeholder interests has gone largely unaddressed,  and the linkage between the real property initiative and broader agency  capital planning efforts is not clear.

OMB indicated that significant progress has been  made in four main areas, including (1) all agencies have established asset  management plans, addressing acquisition, operations, and maintenance,  and disposition; (2) the FRPC has established a standard catalog and  identifies 23 data elements to be captured on all assets in the federal  portfolio; (3) agencies have captured and reported the required  constructed asset level inventory and performance data to the FRPP  governmentwide database; and (4) agencies now have reliable  performance information to assist them in identifying underperforming  assets suitable for investment or disposition. OMB reported that tools are  now in place for improved asset management and that this has led to  results that include data on more than 1.2 million assets and more than  $4.2 billion in disposals completed since the real property initiative was  established in 2004.", "OMB agreed with our three recommendations and provided additional  information relating to them. Regarding the first recommendation to  develop a framework that agencies can use to better ensure the validity  and usefulness of key real property data in the FRPP, OMB reported that it  will work with the FRPC to take steps to establish and implement a  framework. OMB agreed that establishing a framework to ensure the  validity and usefulness of key real property data, especially performance  data, will lead to greater reliability of key data. According to OMB, the  framework that it will pursue will identify acceptable validation methods,  frequency, error tolerance, reliability, and processes for reporting  corrective actions.", "For the second recommendation to develop an action plan for how the  FRPC will address key problems, OMB said that the FRPC is currently  drafting a strategic plan for addressing long-standing issues such as the  continued reliance on costly leasing in cases where ownership is more  cost effective over the long-term, the challenge of securing real property  assets, and reducing the effect of competing stakeholder interests on  businesslike outcomes in real property decisions. OMB agreed that it is  important to build upon the substantial progress that has been realized by  both the FRPC and the federal real property community in addressing the  identified areas for improvement. OMB said that it will share the strategic  plan with us once it is in place and will discuss strategies for ensuring  successful implementation. For our third recommendation to establish a  clearer link or crosswalk between agencies\u2019 efforts under the real property  initiative and broader capital planning guidance, OMB stated that as  agencies update their asset management plans and incorporate updated  guidance on capital planning, progressive improvement in this area will be  realized.

However, our statement that agencies lacked such plans refers to the  Offices of Science and Environmental Management within DOE and U.S.  Customs and Border Protection within DHS, and not to State. State asked  us to change text related to funding backlogs and reliance on leasing to  emphasize the relative importance of budgetary constraints in resolving  maintenance backlogs. We agree that the legal and budgetary limitations  are obstacles, and we discussed this extensively in the draft. We also relate  these limitations to more than just the challenge of funding real property  needs, but also to the policy environment these limitations create. As such,  we feel that the effect of legal and budgetary limitations as underlying  obstacles that exacerbate backlogs is accurately portrayed and did not  make the changes to the report that State requested. State requested that  the report acknowledge the limiting effect of scoring rules on lease- purchase agreements.

As stated  previously in this report, we did not analyze whether the leasing activity at  these agencies, either in the aggregate or for individual leases, resulted in  longer-term costs than if these agencies had pursued ownership. For short- term needs, leasing likely makes economic sense for the government in  many cases. However, our past work has shown that, generally speaking,  for long-term space needs, leasing is more costly over time than direct  ownership of these assets. State believed our report should have more  emphasis on maintenance and repair costs associated with trade-offs  between choosing operating leases or property ownership options. We  agree that maintenance and repair costs are key factors and believe that  our draft accurately explained the importance of them.

In the area of unneeded assets, VA stated that it has disposed of  156 buildings since fiscal year 2004 and 146 buildings are planned for  disposal in fiscal year 2007 and fiscal year 2008. VA further stated that it is  implementing a sustainment model and investing in sustainment needs,  among other things, to address its maintenance and repair backlog. Lastly,  VA stated that it has developed an assessment methodology for its  facilities, assessed those facilities considered most mission-critical, and  requested funding for physical security enhancements to address the  physical security of its facilities.

VA said that it is true that it  has increased its reliance on leasing to meet space needs, but that the  majority of its leases are outpatient or store-front facilities. VA said that it  does not use these leases because they look cheaper in any given year,  asserting that our draft made this conclusion.

Instead, our  report states that operating leases have become an attractive option, in  part because they generally \u201clook cheaper\u201d in any given year, even though  they are generally more costly over time. This discussion in the report  related to leasing issues in general and was not specific to VA.  Furthermore, we included information in the report about VA\u2019s views on  leasing.
