In December 2014, we  reported that as of April 2014, the Federal Emergency Management  Agency (FEMA), a component within the Department of Homeland  Security (DHS), had obligated over $95 billion from the Disaster Relief  Fund (DRF) to provide federal disaster assistance for the 650 major  disasters declared under the Stafford Act during fiscal years 2004 through  2013. However, FEMA and other federal departments and agencies are  also authorized to provide a wide range of disaster mitigation, response,  and recovery assistance whether or not an incident is declared a disaster  under the Stafford Act. While FEMA tracks DRF spending related to major  disasters and emergencies declared under the Stafford Act, there has not  been a systematic effort to account for federal obligations for disaster  assistance outside of the DRF.", "The Joint Explanatory Statement accompanying the Consolidated and  Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015, includes a provision for  GAO to report on disaster assistance expenditures by the federal  government. According to the mandate, the term \u201cdisaster assistance\u201d  should go beyond the definition included in the Budget Control Act of  2011, which defines disaster on the basis of the Stafford Act. Further, the  mandate states that the report should include expenditures for major  disasters, emergencies, and fire management assistance grants under  the Stafford Act, and encompass disaster-related spending across all  federal departments and agencies, whether or not they are specifically  referenced in the Stafford Act. This report identifies federal disaster  assistance programs and activities across 17 federal departments and  agencies and the obligations and expenditures for these programs and  activities, where available,  during fiscal years 2005 through 2014.

For the purpose of this report, we defined a disaster  incident as any Stafford Act or non-Stafford Act incident that causes  damage of sufficient severity and magnitude to warrant federal  assistance; or for which federal assistance is needed to supplement the  efforts and available resources of states, local governments, and disaster  relief organizations in alleviating the damage, loss, hardship, or suffering  caused by the incident. We collected information for relevant disaster- specific and disaster-applicable programs and activities that provided  mitigation, response, and recovery assistance during fiscal years 2005  through 2014 across the 17 federal departments and agencies.", "For the purpose of this report, disaster-specific refers to federal programs  and activities that are specifically authorized for the purposes of mitigation  (including pre-disaster), disaster response, or disaster recovery, and that  exist for the express purpose of providing disaster assistance to federal,  state, tribal, and local governments; eligible businesses; non-profits; and  in some cases, individuals. Disaster-applicable refers to federal programs  and activities that, while not specifically designated for disaster or  emergency situations, can be used to mitigate (including pre-disaster),  respond to, or recover from a disaster incident. For each of the 17 federal  departments and agencies, we analyzed documents identifying and  describing the programs and activities that provide assistance for various  types of disaster and emergency incidents, and interviewed department  and agency officials about relevant disaster assistance programs and  activities.", "To obtain spending data for the disaster assistance programs and  activities identified across the 17 federal departments and agencies, we  developed and distributed a data collection instrument which consisted of  questions on (1) agency descriptions of the disaster-specific and disaster- applicable programs or activities identified; (2) the obligation and  expenditure amounts associated with each program or activity for each  fiscal year from 2005 through 2014\u2014the most recent year for which  obligations were available during our review; and (3) the statutory  provisions related to each disaster-specific program or, where  appropriate, regulations or appropriations acts related to the program.  We received responses to our data collection instrument from each of the  17 federal departments and agencies. We assessed the accuracy and  reliability of information collected through our data collection instrument  by conducting three pretests prior to distribution to ensure that our  questions were clear, unbiased, and consistently interpreted; requesting  information on specific data sources; reviewing responses to identify  obvious errors or inconsistencies; cross-referencing information provided  in the data collection instrument with documents we collected for each  department; and conducting follow-up to clarify responses when needed.  We determined that the data were sufficiently reliable to estimate  obligations and expenditures for the 17 federal departments and  agencies.", "To determine FEMA\u2019s disaster assistance spending from the DRF, we  obtained and aggregated obligations and expenditures data for each of  the six DRF categories\u2014Public Assistance, Individual  Assistance, Hazard  Mitigation,  Fire Management Assistance Grants, Mission Assignment,  and Administration\u2014during fiscal years 2005 through 2014. Specifically,  we obtained and aggregated spending data on the first four DRF  categories from FEMA\u2019s responses to our data collection instrument and  related documentation.

The Stafford Act defines a \u201cmajor  disaster\u201d as any natural catastrophe (including any hurricane, tornado,  storm, high water, winddriven water, tidal wave, tsunami, earthquake,  volcanic eruption, landslide, mudslide, snowstorm, or drought), or,  regardless of cause, any fire, flood, or explosion, in any part of the United  States, which the President determines causes damage of sufficient  severity and magnitude to warrant major disaster assistance to  supplement the efforts and available resources of states, local  governments, and disaster relief organizations in alleviating damage,  loss, hardship, or suffering. If the President declares a major disaster,  the declaration can trigger a variety of federal assistance programs  through which the federal government provides disaster assistance to  state, tribal, territorial, and local governments, as well as certain nonprofit  organizations and individuals.", "In addition to its central role in recommending to the President whether to  declare a disaster, FEMA is the primary federal agency responsible for  mitigating, responding to, and recovering from disasters, both natural and  man-made, and has responsibility for coordinating the assistance  provided under the provisions of the Stafford Act. The DRF is the primary  source of federal disaster assistance for state and local governments  when a disaster is declared. The DRF is appropriated no-year funding,  which allows FEMA to fund, direct, coordinate, and manage response and  recovery efforts\u2014including certain efforts by other federal agencies and  state and local governments, among others\u2014associated with domestic  disasters and emergencies. FEMA tracks DRF obligations according to  the following six categories:", "Public Assistance. The Public Assistance Program provides financial  assistance to state, tribal, territorial, and local governments for debris  removal; emergency protective measures; and the repair,  replacement, or restoration of disaster-damaged, publicly owned  facilities and the facilities of certain private nonprofit organizations that  provide services otherwise performed by a government agency.  Individual Assistance. The Individual  Assistance Program provides  financial assistance directly to disaster victims for the necessary  expenses and serious needs that cannot be met through insurance or  low-interest Small Business Administration loans. For example, FEMA  may provide temporary housing assistance, counseling,  unemployment compensation, or medical expenses incurred by  individuals as a result of a disaster.", "Hazard Mitigation. The Hazard Mitigation  Grant Program provides  funds to state, tribal, territorial, and local governments, among other  entities, to assist communities in implementing long-term measures to  help reduce the potential risk of future damages to facilities.", "Fire Management Assistance. The Fire Management Assistance  Grant Program makes fire management assistance available to state,  local and tribal governments for the mitigation, management, and  control of fires on publicly or privately owned forests or grasslands  which threaten such destruction as would constitute a major disaster.", "Mission Assignment. The Stafford Act also authorizes FEMA to  issue work orders\u2014i.e., mission assignments\u2014with or without  reimbursement, that direct another federal agency to utilize its  authorities and the resources granted to it under federal law in support  of direct assistance to state, local, tribal, and territorial governments  during emergency and major disaster declarations. FEMA may use  the DRF to reimburse other federal agencies for eligible costs incurred  under a mission assignment.", "Administration.  FEMA also obligates funds from the DRF to cover its  administrative costs\u2014that is, costs that support the delivery of  disaster assistance. FEMA\u2019s administrative costs include the salary  and travel costs for the disaster workforce, rent and security expenses  associated with field operation locations, and supplies and information  technology for field operation staff, among other things."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Federal Agency Authorities and Responsibilities", "paragraphs": ["In March 2011, the White House issued Presidential Policy Directive 8:  National Preparedness (PPD-8) with the goal of strengthening the  security and resilience of the nation through systematic preparation for  the threats that pose the greatest risk.  PPD-8 called for the  development of a series of policy and planning documents in five mission  areas\u2014Prevention, Protection, Mitigation,  Response, and Recovery\u2014to  explain and guide the nation\u2019s approach for ensuring and enhancing  national preparedness for a wide range of threats and hazards. These  National Planning Frameworks serve as the basis for mission area  activities within FEMA, throughout the federal government, and at the  state and local levels. Among other functions, the frameworks describe  the coordinating structures and alignment of key roles and responsibilities  to federal agencies and are integrated to ensure interoperability across all  mission areas in mitigating, responding to, and recovering from a wide  range of both Stafford-Act and non-Stafford Act disasters and  emergencies. The following three frameworks are relevant to this report:", "The National Mitigation Framework establishes a common platform  and forum for coordinating and addressing how the nation manages  risk through mitigation capabilities. Mitigation  reduces the impact of  disasters by supporting protection and prevention activities, easing  response, and speeding recovery to create better prepared and more  resilient communities. This framework addresses how the nation will  develop, employ, and coordinate core mitigation capabilities to reduce  loss of life and property by lessening the impact of disasters.  Mitigation  activities are not limited to eligible activities within the  Stafford Act.", "The National Response Framework (NRF) describes how the nation  responds to all types of disasters and emergencies. The NRF is the  overarching interagency response coordination structure for both  Stafford Act and non-Stafford Act incidents, and describes specific  authorities and best practices for managing incidents ranging in scope  from local to large-scale, among other things. The NRF identifies 14  Emergency Support Functions (ESF) that serve as the federal  government\u2019s primary coordinating structure for building, sustaining,  and delivering response capabilities. ESF annexes to the NRF  describe the federal coordinating structures that group resources and  capabilities into functional areas that are most frequently needed in a  national response. Each ESF consists of a federal department or  agency designated as the coordinating agency along with a number of  primary and support agencies.", "The National Disaster Recovery Framework (NDRF) establishes a  comprehensive structure to enhance the nation\u2019s ability to work  together, both before and after a disaster, to effectively deliver  recovery assistance through the coordinated efforts of federal, state,  local, and tribal governments and nongovernmental organizations.  While the NDRF provides the overarching interagency coordination  structure for the recovery phase of incidents under the Stafford Act, its  structures and procedures apply equally to non-Stafford Act incidents,  such as federal response to an oil spill of national significance. The  NDRF identifies six Recovery Support Functions (RSF) as the  mechanisms through which federal agencies are to provide  assistance and support to state and local communities, both before  and after a disaster. These RSFs are intended to, among other  things, facilitate problem solving; improve access to resources; ensure  more effective and efficient use of federal, state, nongovernmental  and private sector funds; and foster coordination among state and  federal agencies and nongovernmental entities. Similar to the ESFs,  each RSF consists of a federal department or agency designated as  the coordinating agency along with a number of primary and support  agencies.", "While FEMA coordinates assistance for incidents in which federal  assistance is provided under the Stafford Act and the National Planning  Frameworks generally apply to federal roles and responsibilities for both  Stafford and non-Stafford Act incidents, federal response or assistance to  a disaster event may also be led or coordinated by various federal  departments and agencies consistent with their own authorities.  Specifically, independent of the Stafford Act, the heads of some federal  departments and agencies\u2014such as the Administrator of the Small  Business Administration (SBA) and the Secretaries of Agriculture and  Commerce\u2014also have separate statutory authority to declare a disaster  under certain circumstances for the purpose of providing assistance. For  example, the Secretary of Agriculture is authorized to designate counties  as disaster areas to make emergency loans to agricultural producers  suffering losses in that county or other contiguous counties as was done  for the recent California drought. Following a request from a state  governor, the Administrator of the Small Business Administration (SBA)  can separately make a physical disaster declaration based on the  occurrence of at least a minimum amount of damage to buildings,  machinery, equipment, inventory, homes and other property, which  enables SBA to make disaster loans available to homeowners, renters,  businesses of all sizes, and private nonprofits."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Federal Agencies Obligated at Least $277.6 Billion for Disaster Assistance during Fiscal Years 2005 through 2014 but Were Unable to Quantify All Relevant Obligations", "paragraphs": ["During fiscal years 2005 through 2014, the federal government obligated  at least $277.6 billion across 17 federal departments and agencies for  disaster assistance programs and activities.
