Located about 18 miles from Cincinnati, the Fernald site is undergoing the cleanup of contamination from its former uranium metal production activities. DOE has entered into an initial 5-year, $1.9 billion contract with Fluor Daniel Fernald to clean up the site. The contract to continue the cleanup will be up for a 1- to 3-year renewal in November 1997. DOE estimates that it will take an additional 13 years and about $2.4 billion to complete the cleanup. The seriousness of the allegations prompted both DOE and Fluor Daniel Fernald to create two ad-hoc groups to investigate the situation.", "Concerned about the implications that the allegations might have for the management and oversight of the site, you asked us to report on (1) the extent to which DOE is providing effective management and oversight of two key cleanup projects at Fernald\u2014the vitrification pilot plant project and the uranyl nitrate hexahydrate project\u2014that were reported on in the Cincinnati Enquirer, (2) DOE\u2019s oversight of safety and health activities at the site, and (3) the contractor\u2019s compliance with certain performance and financial system procedures. In this connection, you also asked us to provide you with information concerning DOE\u2019s overall contracting and management initiatives and how they may resolve any problems identified at Fernald.", "In addition, you asked for information on the major allegations and what is known about them, including the results of the two primary investigations of the allegations in each of these areas.

(See app. IV.)"], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["After 36 years of using chemical and mechanical processes to produce slightly enriched uranium from ore, DOE\u2019s Fernald site is faced with a variety of environmental problems. As with other sites in DOE\u2019s nuclear weapons complex, an emphasis on production versus safety has produced a legacy of contaminated radioactive and hazardous wastes at storage sites, in buildings that are deteriorating, or in seepage to underground water supplies.", "Also, as with other DOE sites, contract management has been an ongoing problem. Stemming from the special contracting arrangements for the development of the atomic bomb during World War II, DOE continued with lax oversight of contractors of the weapons complex for decades. For this reason, in 1990 we designated DOE\u2019s contracting as a high-risk area vulnerable to waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement and have issued numerous reports and testimonies that provided an impetus for change.", "The responsibility for the management and oversight of Fernald\u2019s cleanup rests with two units at DOE\u2019s headquarters\u2014the Office of Environmental Management manages the technical, financial, and overall safety aspects of the cleanup, while the Office of Environment, Safety, and Health conducts periodic reviews to independently evaluate safety and heath programs at the site. At the field level, DOE\u2019s Ohio Field Office and Fernald Area Office provide the planning, budgeting, and oversight of cleanup activities. Fernald Area Office staff interact daily with Fluor Daniel Fernald staff, who either directly or through subcontractors actually conduct the cleanup.", "As one of the first former weapons sites to be completely shut down\u2014temporarily in 1989 and permanently in 1991\u2014Fernald, in 1992, became one of the sites to pilot test a new contracting concept called the environmental restoration management contractor. DOE wanted to bring in new contractors, such as Fluor Daniel Fernald, that were experienced in environmental restoration to focus solely on the management and oversight of the cleanup. The actual cleanup was expected to be carried out by subcontractors. In addition, Fernald was one of the first DOE cleanup sites to propose accelerating its schedule for completing work at the site from 25 to 10 years.", "The management of the site\u2019s activities has been complicated by reductions in the contractor\u2019s workforce, DOE\u2019s downsizing, and budget pressures common to other DOE sites. In 1993, shortly after Fluor Daniel Fernald assumed full responsibility for the site\u2019s activities, DOE began a workforce reduction at the site to better match employees\u2019 skills with Fernald\u2019s cleanup needs. As a result, about 250 company and subcontractor employees were released, and 62 employees retired or resigned. These separations caused unrest and concerns among the remaining employees.", "For its part, DOE has not fully staffed the Fernald Area Office. From February 1992, when DOE established Fernald as a field office, through March 1994, when DOE proposed staffing for the newly created Ohio Field Office, DOE decreased Fernald\u2019s staffing authorization from 190 to 82. At the time, DOE officials at Fernald had hired 72 individuals. After transferring positions and staff to the Ohio Field Office, Fernald was left with 39 individuals and an authorized staff level of 68. By April 1996, DOE had decreased Fernald\u2019s authorized staff level to 53 and had 47 individuals on board at the site."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Limited Management Oversight of Projects Has Contributed to Cost Growth and Schedule Delays", "paragraphs": ["DOE\u2019s limited oversight early in the two key cleanup projects we reviewed contributed to cost increases and schedule slippages that mirror problems we have identified across DOE. The two projects cited in the Cincinnati Enquirer are (1) the vitrification pilot plant project to confirm the feasibility of converting 20 million pounds of low-level radioactive waste into a glass-like form for disposal and (2) the uranyl nitrate hexahydrate (uranium ore dissolved in nitric acid) project to process and dispose of about 200,000 gallons of the substance. From a budget perspective, these two projects represent about 5 percent of the site\u2019s funding for fiscal years 1993 through 1996. The vitrification and uranyl projects are of similar size and complexity as some of the projects that DOE will undertake in the future.", "For the vitrification project, which is still ongoing, the estimated schedule to complete the testing of the waste has slipped 19 months, from March 1996 to October 1997. The original cost estimate in February 1994 was $14.1 million. This estimate did not include the costs for operating, maintaining, decontaminating, and decommissioning the plant. By December 1994, when DOE included operating costs in the estimate, DOE increased the projects to about $20.6 million, assuming that a key part of the facility\u2014the melter used to superheat waste material\u2014could operate at 100-percent efficiency. In July 1996, the estimate increased to $56 million, reflecting cost overruns in the initial estimates, and a more conservative estimate of 33-percent operating efficiency was made for the melter, as well as operating, maintaining, decontaminating, and decommissioning costs. As of September 1996, the estimate was $66 million. For the uranyl project, the original estimates made in fiscal year 1990 increased from $750,000 to more than $16.8 million and from 7 months to about 5 years for the project\u2019s completion.", "DOE officials believe that (1) the Department\u2019s deliberate policy of relying on the technical and managerial expertise of its new environmental restoration and management contractor to accomplish cleanup objectives and (2) the technical complexity of the vitrification project led to many of the Department\u2019s subsequent problems with the projects. Although we agree that these factors contributed to the projects\u2019 problems, other actions and decisions by DOE and the contractor helped cause the projects\u2019 cost increases and delays.", "In fact, the projects suffered from several management and oversight weaknesses. For example, DOE had limited involvement during the early design and procurement stages of the vitrification plant and could have avoided major problems if it had exercised more oversight of the contractor\u2019s early decisions. In addition, DOE and the contractor decided early on to accelerate the pace of this project without having fully tested the feasibility of the technology and underestimated the technical complexity of this first-of-a-kind project. DOE also allowed concurrent design and construction at the vitrification plant, which resulted in increased costs and schedule delays. Because the contractor built interfacing systems for a piece of equipment still in the design phase, about 225 design changes had to be made when the final components of the equipment differed from their preliminary designs. For the uranyl project, many of the required project management documents were not prepared until late or not prepared at all, contributing to the cost growth and schedule delays. For example, because a technical information plan was not prepared until late in the project, significant work was not done according to DOE\u2019s requirements.", "As a result of a December 1995 DOE study of the problems at the vitrification plant and preliminary evaluations of alternatives to the current vitrification strategy, DOE has decided to postpone the additional construction and testing of radioactive material at the plant and to convene a panel of experts to reexamine the Department\u2019s strategy for cleaning up the area. DOE expects that by June 1997, the Department and its stakeholders will reach a consensus on the appropriate cleanup strategy for the area. Furthermore, for its most important projects, DOE has increased the frequency with which it meets with the contractor to discuss the status of the projects.", "Cost overruns and schedule slippages similar to those of these two projects exist Departmentwide. They occurred in most of the 80 major systems acquisitions conducted across DOE from 1980 through 1996, one of which is the Fernald Environmental Management Program. Over the years, we and DOE\u2019s Inspector General have reported that cost and schedule overruns on DOE\u2019s major acquisitions have occurred for a number of reasons, including technical problems, poor initial cost estimates, and the ineffective oversight of contractors\u2019 operations. Furthermore, we reported that underlying the problems were, among other things, a lack of sufficient DOE personnel with the appropriate skills to effectively oversee contractors\u2019 operations and a flawed system of incentives both for DOE\u2019s employees and contractors."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Despite Some Progress, Weaknesses Remain in Oversight of Safety and Health", "paragraphs": ["As noted in a May 1996 report by DOE, the Fernald Area Office has made progress in its oversight of safety and health. However, the Area Office is still not complying with some oversight-related requirements and is in the early stages of planning changes to its program that may better address these requirements. However, because the plans have not been fully implemented, it is too early to assess whether they will fully comply with DOE\u2019s standards and guidance.", "The ongoing decontamination and decommissioning activities at Fernald involve radioactive hazards, such as contaminated facilities and nearly 16 million pounds of stored uranium, as well as chemical hazards, such as acids and process waste. To minimize the risks of potential hazards to the workers and the public, DOE requires the contractor to comply with numerous safety and health standards. They include radiation protection of workers and the public, nuclear criticality safety, and occupational safety and health, among others.", "The Fernald Area Office is responsible for overseeing the contractor\u2019s compliance with the safety and health requirements. The Area Office\u2019s oversight activities include, among other things, formal assessments of the contractor\u2019s processes, surveillance of items or activities, and walk-throughs to observe conditions in the site\u2019s facilities.

From 1993 to 1995, the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board and DOE\u2019s headquarters offices raised serious concerns regarding the Fernald Area Office\u2019s ability to ensure the contractor\u2019s compliance with DOE\u2019s safety and health requirements. For example, the Board found in 1992 and 1993 that the Area Office had inadequate plans to supervise the contractor\u2019s activities, did not have the technical staff to ensure that safety requirements were adhered to, and did not stay on top of the daily activities of the contractor. The Board made several recommendations to correct these problems.", "DOE\u2019s Office of Environmental Management found in 1994 that the program for assessing operations at the site was unsatisfactory for a number of reasons. For example, the Area Office was not conducting required assessments, did not systematically follow up on prior assessments, and did not transmit the results of assessments to the contractor.", "Two 1995 reports identified safety and health problems. The first report by DOE, Fluor Daniel Fernald, and consultants stated that an emphasis on meeting projects\u2019 target dates at Fernald contributed to a breakdown in contamination control and an increase in personnel contaminations in July and August 1995. The other report by the Office of Environment, Safety, and Health stated that the Area Office\u2019s oversight program lacked \u201cthe structure and resources necessary to validate the adequacy of the contractor\u2019s operational safety and health program.\u201d Specifically, the Area Office had not developed procedures for implementing its safety and health responsibilities, line managers did not conduct routine walk-throughs of Fernald facilities, and the Area Office did not have a formalized system for tracking and showing trends in the status of safety problems it had identified.", "The low level of oversight activity in 1993 and 1994, according to the Associate Director for Safety and Assessment in the Fernald Area Office, was partly due to confusion over the level of oversight that DOE should exercise over the new environmental restoration management contractor and the change in primary responsibility for oversight from the Oak Ridge Field Office to the Fernald Area Office."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOE\u2019s Oversight of Contractor\u2019s Activities Has Improved", "paragraphs": ["As a result of these reviews, the Fernald Area Office has made a number of improvements over the years in its oversight of the contractor\u2019s safety and health activities. For example, the Area Office developed a technical management plan for Fernald that outlined a detailed program for ensuring the contractor\u2019s compliance with DOE\u2019s safety and health requirements. The Office also established a group of facility representatives to monitor daily activities at the site and initiated a qualification program for these staff. The Office also increased the number of safety and health assessments from 1 in fiscal year 1993 to 15 in fiscal year 1996 and the number of surveillances from zero to 14.", "The site\u2019s record of persons contaminated by radiation is an indicator of improvement in DOE\u2019s oversight program. Although Fernald had 69 contamination occurrences from January 1, 1993, through February 12, 1996, several later assessments by DOE found that the radiological control program had improved. One DOE review compared Fernald\u2019s personnel contamination events per 100 staff years with similar events at other comparable DOE remediation sites. The review concluded that while the type and number of occurrences indicated weaknesses in Fernald\u2019s program, the rate of occurrence was not excessive when compared with that of other remediation sites.", "DOE\u2019s and the contractor\u2019s responses to correct a recently disclosed safety and health problem at the site is yet another indicator of improvements in the area. After a February 1996 surveillance by the contractor identified, among other things, that some inspection records of hazardous and radioactive wastes were missing, DOE and the contractor agreed in April 1996 to ensure that compliance personnel would perform weekly checks of the hazardous waste areas and examine records to ensure that inspections were performed and documented."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some Oversight Requirements Are Not Being Met", "paragraphs": ["Some recommended improvements in safety and health oversight have just been completed, but other aspects of the Fernald Area Office\u2019s oversight still do not meet DOE\u2019s safety and health standards and guidance. For example, in spite of a June 1993 Defense Board recommendation to immediately establish a group of technically qualified facility representatives, as of May 1996, only one out of six appointed representatives had completed the basic qualification requirements, and not until November 1996 did four more representatives complete the requirements. In addition, despite a 1995 DOE recommendation to track and trend identified problems and corrections, the Fernald Area Office is just now implementing a computerized system to do so.", "Furthermore, the Area Office did not fully implement its plan for assessments that it must perform in some areas, such as waste management and occupational medical programs until fiscal year 1997, according to DOE. The Area Office also has not developed an assessment schedule for its facility representatives or a surveillance schedule for its other oversight staff. In addition, the Area Office has not developed guidelines for performing walk-throughs of facilities by DOE facility representatives. Such schedules and guidelines are intended to ensure the conduct of comprehensive and systematic reviews of all aspects of facility operations over an established period of time.", "Furthermore, although a lack of formal reporting is contrary to DOE\u2019s standards and procedures, facility representatives generally do not formally document their findings. The purpose of this reporting is to transmit the findings and follow-up items from surveillances and walk-throughs to the contractor\u2019s and Area Office\u2019s managers. Yet, the representatives usually relay their findings verbally.", "DOE\u2019s Fernald Area Office is either in the process of making changes to its oversight program to correct these weaknesses or plans to do so.

These weaknesses include such problems as incomplete documentation for changing the contractor\u2019s cost and schedule baseline, on which the contractor\u2019s performance is based, and inadequate control of the opening and closing of financial accounts to ensure that only appropriate charges are made to them. DOE has directed the contractor to make numerous changes to address the weaknesses identified in recent reviews of the contractor\u2019s financial and performance management, but it is too early to assess the impact."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Weaknesses Exist in Documentation and Approval Procedures to Change the Baseline", "paragraphs": ["In some cases, the procedures for maintaining and updating the performance measurement baseline were not followed, while in other cases the current procedures are limited or unclear. The baseline governs the expenditure of the site\u2019s budget, which was about $266 million in fiscal year 1997, and defines what work has been authorized. The baseline is the standard against which DOE assesses the contractor\u2019s cost and schedule performance. The baseline is approved by the Fernald Area Office and can be adjusted to reflect changes that are not under the contractor\u2019s control, such as a change in the authorized level of funding or changes in costs due to amended labor rates. DOE\u2019s and the contractor\u2019s procedures define when and how the baseline is adjusted. When the contractor wants to change the baseline, a control account manager prepares a proposal to change it. The required level of approval for the change depends on the magnitude of the change.", "On the basis of our random sample of 176 baseline change proposals, the contractor complied with most but not all of the site\u2019s written procedures for controlling the baseline. For example, the contractor had maintained the required records that described and justified a proposed change for all but one of the randomly selected change proposals that we reviewed. The documentation was usually adequate to support the need for changing the baseline, except that in some cases, the required information on the impact of changes on site activities was not well documented. In addition, we estimated that for about 12 percent of the proposals, the documentation did not include the required source of funding for the change as required by the procedures.", "In some cases, DOE\u2019s and the contractor\u2019s written procedures for maintaining and updating the baseline are unclear and do not facilitate the efficient review and approval by management of either organization. For example, neither the contractor\u2019s nor the Area Office\u2019s written procedures require that if a proposal is disapproved, the reasons for disapproval be formally documented on the proposal form. The procedures also do not require that the contractor clearly mark documents that support change proposals in order to indicate differences between the current approved baseline and the proposed change. The lack of such documentation inhibits the subsequent review or oversight of proposed changes.", "As for requirements for the approval of change proposals, DOE\u2019s and the contractor\u2019s procedures for designating which level within each organization should approve change proposals do not clearly define the criteria for determining the approving officials. Although one of the criteria for determining approval levels is the amount of funds involved in the change, the procedures do not clearly define whether the criteria should be the net change in funds over 1 year or over several years. Because Area Office and contractor officials can interpret the criteria differently, change proposals that involve moving similar amounts of funds among activities may be approved at different levels within the organizations.", "The incompleteness of the formal documentation highlights the degree to which the Fernald Area Office\u2019s management relies on informal and verbal communications to support decision-making. The current procedures and quality of information do not facilitate DOE\u2019s oversight process and also do not provide a complete official record for subsequent internal or external review."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Controls Over Accounts Are Not Always Adequate", "paragraphs": ["In controlling financial accounts, some charges are posted to accounts after they have been closed, and the required approvals for opening and closing accounts are not always obtained. These practices make it difficult for DOE\u2019s and the contractor\u2019s managers to exercise effective control and oversight of the contractor\u2019s costs and performance. The contractor processes several hundred thousand financial transactions each year to accumulate the costs in its accounts. Accounts are opened to allow costs for specific work to be charged against the appropriate account and closed when all related charges have been made to the account. Procedures require that the contractor\u2019s control account managers, who are responsible for managing accounts and verifying the accuracy of charges, perform the opening and closing functions to ensure that a person knowledgeable about the scope of work and the related costs monitors and controls the charges that are made against the account.", "Nearly all charges in the contractor\u2019s financial system occurred when the accounts were properly opened in compliance with standard procedures. However, a small percentage of the charges were routinely made to accounts after the control account managers had closed them, making the effective control of the accounts difficult. This percentage averaged from 1 to 2 percent of the several hundred thousand charges that Fluor Daniel Fernald processes annually to accumulate costs in its authorized accounts. The system will accept charges to closed accounts, according to contractor officials, to allow for certain adjustments to be made, such as the allocation of sales tax to an account, which is posted monthly rather than after each invoice.", "In addition to allowing charges to be made to closed accounts\u2014without reopening them\u2014the contractor\u2019s financial system allowed some accounts to be reopened for charges without the required control account manager\u2019s approval. On the basis of our random sample of 87 control accounts and their associated 239 charge numbers, we estimate that 46 percent of the contractor\u2019s accounts were missing at least one of the documents required to open or close the account. Furthermore, some control account managers we interviewed said they were unaware that their accounts had been reopened until after they saw new charges appear in the accounts. Making charges to closed accounts and reopening accounts without the control account managers\u2019 awareness and approval make it difficult for the managers to effectively control what is charged to their accounts and thus ensure the accuracy of the cost data that DOE uses to make payments to the contractor."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOE Is Implementing Contract and Management Initiatives to Improve Oversight", "paragraphs": ["DOE recognizes that its management and contracting problems are Departmentwide and is implementing major reform efforts to improve these areas.

In stark contrast to its historical contracting patterns, DOE has published a policy adopting a standard of full and open competition, developed guidance for contract performance criteria and measures, created incentive mechanisms for contractors, and developed training in performance-based contracting for DOE personnel.", "DOE also has several initiatives under way that could help the Department better manage its affairs. For example, DOE has developed strategic goals to guide the Department and contractors; defined new requirements for managing major assets throughout their life-cycle; and is evaluating revisions to its management, financial, and business information systems to provide managers with more consistent and accurate information on their projects and budgets.", "DOE\u2019s Fernald site is participating in many of these contracting and management initiatives.

DOE\u2019s enclosure II, which is not included in this report, contains more detailed comments that we incorporated into the report as appropriate.", "Overall, DOE plans to take actions related to our report recommendations. DOE says it will convene a panel to consider the opportunity to integrate additional contract reform initiatives into the next Fernald contract and will continue to focus attention on and strengthen oversight of the contractor\u2019s activities.", "DOE had four major concerns with our draft report. First, DOE was concerned that our report did not bring closure to what DOE characterized as the two key issues raised by the allegations\u2014the Cincinnati Enquirer\u2019s broad conclusions that the site has jeopardized the safety of site workers and neighhbors and that the government is being systematically cheated out of millions of dollars. The scope and objectives of our work, however, were not so broad that we could either validate or dismiss the conclusions drawn from the allegations. Rather, our work points out specific weaknesses that exist in both the safety and health and financial areas that diminish the assurance that safety is adequately addressed and costs are adequately controlled at Fernald. For example, weak processes exist for ensuring that identified safety problems are adequately corrected, and failure to correct such deficiencies present safety risks to workers and the public. In controlling financial accounts, some charges are posted to accounts after they have been closed, and the required approvals for opening and closing accounts are not always obtained. These practices make it difficult for DOE and the contractor\u2019s managers to exercise effective control and oversight of the contractor\u2019s costs and performance.", "Second, with regard to the oversight and management of two key cleanup projects at Fernald\u2014the vitrification pilot plant and the uranyl nitrate hexahydrate project\u2014DOE generally did not dispute the lack of oversight or the cost and schedule increases, but it did disagree with the reasons for them. DOE cited the transition to the new environmental restoration management contract at Fernald and the technical complexities of the project. We agree that DOE\u2019s approach for implementing the new contracting concept contributed to DOE\u2019s initial limited oversight of the project and have added language to the report to this effect. We also agree that the vitrification project was technically complex. However, we continue to believe, as stated in our report, that other factors, such as DOE and the contractor\u2019s decisions to accelerate the pace of the project and the contractor\u2019s decision to allow concurrent design and construction of key parts of the plant also contributed to the delays and cost increases.", "Third, DOE disagrees with our characterization of the weak safety and health oversight program from 1992 to 1995 and the representation of the present program as continuing to have weaknesses. DOE maintains that it has shown continuous improvement in its safety and health oversight program since 1992 and that a 1996 DOE review reported that the program was effective. We agree that DOE has made improvements and recognize that in our report. However, prior to 1995, DOE demonstrated little formal oversight, with most of the improvements occurring more recently. In addition, we acknowledge in our report that the 1996 review found the program to be effective. However, the DOE report also identified numerous weaknesses which we also acknowledge, such as the many unstructured and informally documented activities of the facility representatives which are subsequently not useful for tracking and trending safety problems.", "Fourth, DOE stated that appendix III of our report showed that there was no evidence to the allegation that charges were made to cost accounts with no budget and that the tests we conducted showed that the accounting system was functioning properly. In addition, DOE cited two reviews that it believes indicate that the performance system is performing adequately and that strong controls exist over selected financial activities. We did not perform the type of testing that would allow us to say that no unauthorized work was performed or that all charges in the accounting system were valid. For example, we reviewed only selected control accounts, which did not constitute a statistically valid sample. In addition, while our testing showed that the contractor\u2019s system will not accept charges against fictitious accounts, our work also revealed that charges are routinely made against closed accounts and that accounts are routinely reopened without the knowledge of the responsible account manager.", "In this connection, partly because the Chief Financial Officer\u2019s 1996 review covered the work authorization process, control of funds, and invoice review, our work did not cover those aspects at Fernald. However, while the Chief Financial Officer\u2019s report characterized some areas as strong, it also states that the team identified areas where controls should be strengthened and made several recommendations for changes at the site, such as strengthening certain controls over expenditures of funds to ensure that overexpenditures that have occurred in the past do not recur.", "An additional concern raised by DOE was the cleanup schedule, which DOE thought should be brought up into the report summary. However, because we did not consider this a major objective, as we explain earlier in this report, we present this information in appendix IV.", "We conducted our review from March 1, 1996, through January 31, 1997, in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

The items generally related to safety issues, such as the need to conduct a more extensive analysis of methods to shield workers from the radiation associated with later testing at the plant, posting signs to alert workers of possible dangers, and precautions needed for safely working near the high-temperature melter; maintenance concerns, such as the limited space throughout the plant to access equipment and perform anticipated maintenance and the need to develop worker-friendly procedures for cleaning pipelines that may plug or equipment that might have to be replaced; and suggestions to improve the management process for turning the completed VITPP project over to operating personnel and questions about the reliability of some of the plant\u2019s major systems, such as the system to remove waste gases from the plant.", "The Cincinnati Enquirer\u2019s allegation that when the article was published, DOE and Fluor Daniel Fernald did not have a firm date for addressing the concerns is essentially correct.

The newspaper supported some of these allegations with photographs of alleged defects; other alleged defects that involved questions concerning the quality of construction did not lend themselves to photographs or direct observation.", "In March 1996, DOE reviewed the allegations and Fluor Daniel Fernald\u2019s efforts to identify and correct construction problems at the plant. Although DOE officials found no support for the allegations, they found that in some cases, representatives of the design contractor had not consistently documented their approval of design changes needed to correct construction problems. DOE officials later satisfied themselves that the alleged structural defects had been corrected or did not pose a hazard and that the documentation problems did not jeopardize the overall integrity of the contractor\u2019s construction activities.", "During two tours of the pilot plant during March and April 1996, we observed the results of Fluor Daniel Fernald\u2019s efforts to correct several of the alleged construction problems at the plant. For example, we observed that Fluor Daniel Fernald had coated many of VITPP\u2019s walls with an epoxy-like material from the floor to about 3 feet from the floor. DOE\u2019s facility representative conducting one of the tours indicated that the coating would minimize seepage of any radioactive material that might possibly leak from equipment during vitrification. A December 13, 1994, engineering evaluation of the plant\u2019s poured-concrete walls commissioned by Fluor Daniel Fernald concluded that although some walls were pockmarked, they met design specifications.", "In addition, we observed that extra concrete had been cut away from an improperly poured wall to make a straight vertical surface. The remaining concrete did not appear to be damaged. Also, we observed that the tank discussed by the Cincinnati Enquirer, which had been damaged during delivery and installation, was in place and ready for testing. According to DOE\u2019s December 1995 study of VITPP, after an independent inspection team questioned the integrity of the welds used to fix the tank, Fluor Daniel Fernald satisfactorily repaired the tank.", "During our tours, we did not observe steel reinforcement rods jutting outside of concrete walls similar to those in the photographs published by the Cincinnati Enquirer. Although the steel rods may have protruded from the walls during the plant\u2019s construction, they were no longer visible.", "Overall, the alleged construction problems at VITPP do not appear to have seriously compromised safety. Between June 1996, when DOE started operating the plant, and September 1996, DOE had not reported any occurrence of health or safety problems from the construction or operation of VITPP. However, on December 26, 1996, a small fire developed at the plant after heated glass from the melter leaked onto the epoxy-covered floor.

In regard to fast-tracking the remaining work, the study team observed that the strategy was valid but cautioned that managing a fast-track project is difficult. As for evaluating alternatives, the study team noted that numerous approaches to cleaning up the operable unit existed and recommended that DOE and Fluor Daniel Fernald review the cost and benefits of key alternatives.", "DOE has responded positively to these concerns. Within a few weeks of completing the December 1995 study, a DOE-sponsored value engineering team met to study alternatives to building a full-scale vitrification plant at the site. The resulting study, issued in January 1996, proposed (1) upgrading VITPP and building another pilot-plant-size vitrification facility to operate in tandem with the upgraded plant, (2) using other solidification and stabilization technologies on the less radioactive wastes now stored in one of the silos, and (3) using other technologies to clean up the more radioactive wastes stored in the remaining two silos. DOE has notified its regulatory agencies that it is evaluating the second option, which the study estimated could save $68 million, and plans to evaluate the remaining options in time for the spring 1997 evaluation of the plant\u2019s future. DOE site officials have also stopped the design, procurement, and construction of the full-scale plant until after the spring 1997 evaluation.", "Allegation: Various Problems Contributed to VITPP\u2019s Schedule Delays and Cost Overruns.", "DOE and Fluor Daniel Fernald officials acknowledge that many of the problems discussed by the Cincinnati Enquirer contributed to poor performance at VITPP. These problems included fast-tracking, the project\u2019s underestimated complexity, concurrent design and construction of the project, and the contractor\u2019s overly optimistic assessment of its ability to recover from schedule delays.", "DOE and Fluor Daniel Fernald fast-tracked VITPP in order to meet regulatory milestones under DOE\u2019s amended consent agreement with the EPA for the overall operable unit, despite the technical risks of the project. In 1993, when Fluor Daniel Fernald issued its first request for proposals for a vitrification melter, DOE had completed only laboratory-scale tests of the feasibility of vitrifying the silos\u2019 wastes. Nevertheless, DOE decided to overlap phases of the plant\u2019s design, construction, and operation in order to meet these milestones for the overall operable unit.", "Fluor Daniel Fernald also initially underestimated the complexity of building a larger-than-laboratory-scale, high-temperature vitrification facility. The contractor\u2019s early cost estimates for the project assumed that the plant\u2019s melter, which is a key component of the facility, could operate at 100-percent efficiency. Subsequent baselines have assumed less optimistic 50-percent and 33-percent efficiencies. In addition, procurement, design, and delivery of the melter took 9 months longer than expected. Because Fluor Daniel Fernald subcontractors needed information about the melter to complete the design and construction of other parts of the plant, the delays in selecting a vendor for the melter and designing the melter delayed completion of the plant\u2019s design and mechanical and electrical work.", "Fluor Daniel Fernald continued the design and construction of the plant and plant systems concurrent with a subcontractor\u2019s design and fabrication of the melter. Fluor Daniel Fernald used preliminary information about the melter to design and build interfacing equipment systems and water and electricity hook-ups in the plant. After the vendor delivered melter components that were different from the preliminary designs, Fluor Daniel Fernald had to rework parts of VITPP to connect utilities and equipment systems with the melter. For example, from May 1995, when Fluor Daniel Fernald began receiving melter components, through May 1996, the contractor issued about 225 design change notices to (1) correct problems caused by the concurrent design of the melter and VITPP, (2) improve the plant\u2019s overall safety, or (3) redesign pumps and other equipment that had been installed at the plant but that did not pass initial tests. According to DOE\u2019s December 1995 study of VITPP\u2019s problems, the number of design changes is indicative of problems within a project.", "The contractor was also overly optimistic in assessing its ability to recover from schedule delays. Fluor Daniel Fernald officials provided monthly information for the contractor\u2019s cost performance reports and DOE\u2019s progress-tracking system that highlighted (1) delays in obtaining design information from equipment vendors, (2) frequent design changes needed because of limited data, and (3) delays in starting mechanical and electrical work at the plant. However, the contractor repeatedly assured DOE that it could overcome these delays and meet the regulatory milestones. It was not until August 1995, after the contractor had missed the project\u2019s original milestone for completing construction, that Fluor Daniel Fernald admitted that problems at VITPP could delay the design and construction of the full-scale vitrification plant.", "Allegation: DOE Managers at Fernald Exercised Limited Oversight Over the Project and Allowed Problems at the Plant to Fester Too Long.", "DOE\u2019s Associate Director and Deputy Associate Director for Environmental Restoration at Fernald acknowledge that if DOE managers had exercised more oversight of Fluor Daniel Fernald\u2019s early decisions on the project, DOE could have avoided some of VITPP\u2019s major problems. At the project\u2019s beginning, site managers at the associate director level and above and at DOE headquarters involved themselves by approving the plant\u2019s original baseline schedule. DOE\u2019s primary project manager was also generally aware of early delays and overruns with the project. However, neither level of site managers exercised sufficient oversight of the project to correct problems before they became significant. For example, DOE senior site managers focused their attention during this early phase of the project on whether Fluor Daniel Fernald was meeting regulatory milestones for the overall operable unit. Although some DOE senior managers were aware of early procurement and design delays, they generally did not question the impact of these problems on the schedule or the appropriateness of Fluor Daniel Fernald\u2019s corrective actions. This was largely because (1) no regulatory milestones were associated with construction of VITPP and (2) Fluor Daniel Fernald insisted that the problems would not affect its ability to meet the regulatory milestones of the overall operable unit.", "DOE also did not assign early in the project a sufficient number of staff with the technical capability to challenge Fluor Daniel Fernald\u2019s early assertions that the project would recover from its delays. During 1993, 1994, and the first half of 1995, DOE assigned primarily one staff to the project assisted by a facility representative who monitored field activities. They were to (1) prepare regulatory documents for the overall operable unit, (2) monitor the design and construction of the pilot plant, review monthly invoices of project costs, and (4) prepare budget requests and respond to funding changes that affected the entire operable unit. In balancing this workload, DOE staff did not have the time nor the technical expertise to counter Fluor Daniel Fernald\u2019s assertions that it could recover from the project\u2019s initial delays and meet the plant\u2019s cost and schedule goals. DOE did not have a firm basis for revising the plant\u2019s cost and time estimates until August 1995, when Fluor Daniel Fernald admitted schedule delays.", "Allegation: DOE Did Not Penalize Fluor Daniel Fernald for Poor Performance at VITPP Until November 1995. At That Time, DOE Penalized the Company $675,000 for Missing VITPP\u2019s Milestones.", "DOE has a cost-reimbursable performance-based fee contract with Fluor Daniel Fernald, which reimburses the contractor for its monthly costs and provides for additional semiannual fees on the basis of the contractor\u2019s performance. Specific to VITPP, the contractor can earn award fees for the project if it meets milestones that have been agreed to by DOE and the contractor and are included in semiannual performance evaluation plans. The contractor can also earn award fees if DOE subjectively determines that the contractor\u2019s overall performance for the entire site, including VITPP, is satisfactory. Depending on its performance on VITPP, the contractor may earn all of the milestone and subjective award fees or some portion thereof. For example, the contractor can earn less than the maximum award fee possible during every 6 months if (1) it misses one or more VITPP milestones and/or (2) performance on the project is sufficiently poor enough for DOE to deduct fees from its overall subjective evaluation.", "DOE has twice paid Fluor Daniel Fernald award fees for meeting early VITPP milestones included in DOE\u2019s semiannual performance evaluation plans. In fiscal year 1994, the contractor completed a VITPP safety analysis report on time and earned the full $135,000 in an agreed-upon award fee for the milestone. Similarly, in the first half of fiscal year 1995, the contractor met the agreed-upon milestone for completing construction of a prefabricated VITPP auxiliary building and earned the full $270,000 associated with the milestone.", "The second half of fiscal year 1995, ending October 31, 1995, was the first period in which the contractor did not earn the full amount of potential award fee. The contractor could have earned $675,000 for meeting VITPP\u2019s start-up milestones. However, DOE determined that because of the missed milestones and general deficiencies in managing the project and controlling schedules, the contractor would not receive any of the fee. Furthermore, Fluor Daniel Fernald could have earned an additional $1.62 million in award fees for satisfactory performance at the entire site. DOE determined that because of project delays at VITPP, the contractor should receive $1.2 million\u2014$405,000 less than the contractor could have earned.", "During fiscal year 1996, DOE determined that the contractor would not receive $2.16 million in potential award fees for missing VITPP milestones and for experiencing excessive cost and schedule overruns on the project."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOE\u2019s Uranyl Nitrate Hexahydrate Project", "paragraphs": ["When production ended at Fernald in 1989, about 200,000 gallons of UNH (uranium ore dissolved in nitric acid) remained in 18 stainless steel tanks in various locations at the Fernald complex.

The UNH project consisted of several steps, including (1) precipitating the uranium from the solution by the addition of certain chemicals, (2) filtering the residual material from the solution, (3) loading the residual material into drums, and (4) shipping the drums off-site.

However, Fluor Daniel Fernald did install initial and then substitute styles of transfer pumps that were defective and leaked filtrate water during hydrostatic testing. Fluor Daniel Fernald\u2019s failure to inspect and/or review the two styles of pumps beforehand contributed to the installation of the leaking pumps and the associated delay to the UNH project. Specifically, DOE records show that Fluor Daniel Fernald waived its right to witness a factory performance test on the initial style of pumps used on the project. Fluor Daniel Fernald gave the waiver, in part, because the pumps would also be examined on-site. When the pumps arrived in September 1994, Fluor Daniel Fernald installed the pumps but found that they leaked because of cracked casings. The pumps were removed and sent back to the manufacturer for replacement or repair.", "DOE records further show that Fluor Daniel Fernald then installed substitute pumps without conducting an engineering review of the pumps. According to Fluor Daniel Fernald memoranda, the substitute pumps were installed because they were already available on-site and their installation would keep the UNH project on schedule. However, the substitute pumps also leaked during testing; had vibration problems; were found to be incompatible with system supports, piping, and control instrumentation; and also had to be removed. Ultimately, Fluor Daniel Fernald and DOE made the decision in January 1995 to reinstall the initial pumps, after repair, and found that they worked properly.", "Allegation: UNH Leaked From the System Because of Defective Equipment.", "During 1993 through 1995, Fluor Daniel Fernald reported eight UNH project leaks to DOE through the Department\u2019s occurrence-reporting system. Two of those reported leaks, involving filtrate water, can be attributed either directly or indirectly to defective equipment.", "In one case, in December 1994, about 500 gallons of filtrate water leaked from the system in large part because of a defective weld in system piping. A Fluor Daniel Fernald analysis of the defective weld revealed that the weld had cracked because of improper weld installation. The weld lacked adequate penetration as well as adequate thickness. Subsequently, Fluor Daniel Fernald also identified and corrected three other defective welds.", "In a second case, also in December 1994, about 10 to 15 gallons of filtrate water leaked from the system while one of the transfer pumps was being tested. Defective pipe line valves had previously been detected and removed so that the valves could be repaired. According to a DOE daily report on the UNH project, however, Fluor Daniel Fernald directed its construction contractor to reinstall the defective valves so that scheduled pump testing could continue. When pump testing continued, one of the defective valves had still not been reinstalled and the line had not been closed off. With the pump running, filtrate water poured out of the line where the defective valve had been removed and onto the plant floor.", "Allegation: Fluor Daniel Fernald Eliminated and/or Reduced the Inspection Requirements of Equipment Being Built for the UNH Project.", "Three cases were identified in which Fluor Daniel Fernald eliminated and/or reduced the inspection requirements associated with the UNH project. In each case, the elimination and/or reduction of the inspection requirements led to further UNH project problems.", "For example, in one case previously discussed, Fluor Daniel Fernald waived its right to witness a factory performance test on the transfer pumps prior to their shipment to Fernald. In a second case, Fluor Daniel Fernald eliminated the requirement to perform a dye penetrant test on in-process welds. The dye penetrant test is designed to ensure that the welds are being done properly. According to a Fluor Daniel Fernald quality assurance inspector on the UNH project, Fluor Daniel Fernald eliminated the dye penetrant test so that the UNH project could stay on schedule. DOE\u2019s special project team report on the Fernald allegations indicated that this test may have detected the defective weld that caused the leakage of about 500 gallons of filtrate water in December 1994.", "In a third case, Fluor Daniel Fernald elected not to test the acceptability of UNH construction that had been completed by one of its subcontractors. According to DOE\u2019s UNH project manager, DOE expected the contractor to perform the testing. Subsequently, numerous problems were identified. Those problems included the following: a portion of the piping was built without secondary containment; there were cracked and substandard welds; pumps leaked upon installation; and defective valves (valves that either leaked or could not be easily opened and closed) had been installed. According to the DOE UNH project manager, Fluor Daniel Fernald elected to forego the acceptance testing so that further UNH project testing could begin on schedule. After it was determined that removal of UNH would not begin on January 17, 1995, as mandated by the Ohio EPA, the DOE UNH project manager said that DOE required Fluor Daniel Fernald to conduct the construction acceptance testing before proceeding any further.

In their Recommendation 93-4, issued in June 1993, DNFSB recommended, among other things, that DOE develop and implement a technical management plan for Fernald. This plan would define the responsibilities and necessary qualifications of the DOE staff at the site and outline a detailed program for ensuring Fernald\u2019s compliance with applicable standards related to public and worker safety.

Specifically, EM found that the Fernald Area Office was not conducting required assessments, did not systematically follow up on prior assessments, did not transmit the assessment reports to the contractor, and was not considering assessment results in the award fee process. In response, the Fernald Area Office developed a plan for its Conduct of Operations assessment program, developed and implemented a schedule of assessments, started reporting the assessment results to the contractor and following up to ensure that the contractor corrected identified problems, and started considering the assessment results in award fee decisions.", "In spite of this progress, in February 1995, site residents from DOE\u2019s ES&H Office reported that the Fernald Area Office\u2019s oversight program lacked \u201cthe structure and resources necessary to validate the adequacy of the contractor\u2019s operational safety and health programs.\u201d Specifically, they reported that the Fernald Area Office did not have a formalized system in place to track and show trends in the status of safety and health deficiencies it had identified, that the Fernald Area Office\u2019s line managers did not conduct routine walk-throughs of Fernald facilities, and that the Fernald Area Office had not developed procedures for implementing its safety and health responsibilities.

Consequently, the office has not had readily available information on what safety and health problems it has identified and the current status of these problems.

Such reporting helps DOE realize the maximum benefit from its facility representative programs.", "As a result of the above weaknesses, the Fernald Area Office\u2019s ability to ensure that identified problems are adequately corrected has been limited. For example, in the case of maintenance activities, the Fernald Area Office found in April 1995 that the contractor had problems in maintaining compliance with procedures and maintenance controls throughout the site and requested that these problems be corrected prior to the next assessment. During the next assessment in November 1995, however, the Fernald Area Office found that these problems continued. Although the Fernald Area Office again requested that the contractor correct these problems, the ES&H Office found in May 1996 that the site still had significant and pervasive problems with maintenance. Problems included nonadherence to procedures and deficient procedures. In some cases, continuing problems have or could have adversely affected operations, safety equipment, and workers. For example, two sitewide power outages in January 1996 (one of which resulted from a fire) were attributable to inadequate maintenance of facilities at the site. The consequences of these events included damage to equipment and delays in work activities.", "Our examination of DOE\u2019s performance evaluations of Fluor Daniel Fernald for determining award fees has shown that the Fernald Area Office has used this mechanism to hold Fluor Daniel Fernald accountable for improving its performance in protecting workers from radiation. However, the office has not effectively used award fees to hold the contractor accountable in some other key areas. For example, the performance evaluation for the period October 1995 to March 1996 rated Fluor Daniel Fernald\u2019s overall safety performance as excellent but did not include the contractor\u2019s performance in correcting maintenance problems as a criterion. In addition, although the May 1996 ES&H Office\u2019s report cited electrical safety as another area needing improvement, the performance evaluation of the contractor\u2019s safety performance for the period October 1995 to March 1996 did not include electrical safety as a criterion in rating the contractor.", "An emphasis in the award fee process on meeting deadlines, combined with an inadequate emphasis on safety performance, can lead the contractor to develop a \u201crush mentality\u201d that could compromise safety.

The report also stated that 9 of the 78 incidents did not include contaminants and that workers were primarily exposed to low-level \u201cnuisance\u201d contamination left over from the early days of the site\u2019s operations.", "Allegation: Seven Criticality Incidents Occurred Where Drums of Radioactive Waste Were Stored Too Closely Together.", "ORPS contains seven occurrence reports on criticality safety violations from September 1993 through June 1995, two of which related to drum storage spacing. None of these were criticality incidents as defined by DOE. A criticality incident is the release of energy as a result of accidentally producing a self-sustaining or divergent neutron chain reaction.According to a June 1995 ES&H assessment, the likelihood of an inadvertent criticality incident at Fernald, while possible, was small because of the physical nature of the enriched nuclear material there. The seven violations of criticality safety procedures include: two occurrences of drums being stored too close together, two in which drums were missing, one in which the drum was in an unapproved storage location, one in which the drums were stored so that they blocked a radiation detection alarm, and one in which the drums were mislabeled and as a result stored in an inappropriate place.", "Audits and assessments of the criticality safety program at Fernald, conducted during 1994 and 1995, repeatedly found the program to be deficient. Fluor Daniel Fernald received an unsatisfactory rating from DOE for its nuclear criticality program for the period April 1 through September 30, 1994. For the next period, October 1, 1994, through March 31, 1995, DOE stated that substantial improvements were required across this entire program before it could reach a satisfactory level of performance.", "In addition, a March 1994 independent audit of Fernald\u2019s nuclear criticality safety found that the nuclear criticality safety program was well documented but that the implementation was less than adequate. The Fernald Area Office also found problems with Fluor Daniel Fernald\u2019s criticality safety program in October 1994 and concluded that timely and rigorous corrective actions for improving the conduct of operations in the criticality safety program were not being aggressively undertaken. In June 1995, the Fernald Area Office again found major shortcomings in this program; for example, required criticality safe-operating limits were not properly posted at access points for several buildings, and contractor personnel lacked knowledge about criticality areas.", "By 1996, several assessments of Fluor Daniel Fernald\u2019s nuclear criticality safety program reported improvements in the program. For the period April 1 through September 30, 1995, DOE found that Fluor Daniel Fernald took effective actions to address specific concerns with the criticality program on-site and by the end of the reporting period, improvements were observed. Furthermore, for the period October 1, 1995, through March 31, 1996, the DOE performance evaluation committee\u2019s report stated that Fluor Daniel Fernald demonstrated excellence in the criticality safety program following external assessments.", "Furthermore, a February 2, 1996, Fernald Area Office\u2019s report found that the criticality safety program had moved beyond the inadequate rating and currently met DOE\u2019s requirements. In addition, the May 1996 ES&H oversight evaluation report stated that Fluor Daniel Fernald\u2019s criticality safety program was strong and well documented but that improvement in training and technical competence is needed.", "Also, the Fernald Special Project Team Report stated that the criticality safety program of Fluor Daniel Fernald has been transformed in the last 6 months into a satisfactory and functional program and found that the improved storage of enriched uranium effectively mitigates the potential for a criticality accident and minimizes the potential to violate control procedures.", "Allegation: Using Thousands of Counterfeit or Substandard Fasteners and Bolts Created a Life-Threatening Situation.", "Although Fluor Daniel Fernald identified many suspect and/or counterfeit parts, these parts have been a concern in the United States since the middle of the 1980s, when they were found in such places as aircraft, nuclear weapon production facilities, and buildings. These bolts do not possess the capabilities of the genuine bolts that they counterfeit and can threaten the reliability of the industrial and consumer products, national security, or human lives. In August 1992, DOE issued a quality alert bulletin that highlighted the concerns associated with such parts, provided guidance on their identification, and directed its field offices to take certain actions. According to DOE in a May 1996 report, there have been no reported instances of accidents or near-misses within DOE as a result of suspect/counterfeit parts.", "By September 1995, Fluor Daniel Fernald completed all of its inspections of facilities and mobile equipment. Out of a total of 37,527 parts inspected, 3,935 were considered suspect/counterfeit and 2,232 of these needed to be replaced. The contractor issued 56 work orders to replace the parts. As of November 1996, the contractor had completed 26 work orders and canceled 9 after doing engineering reevaluations. The 21 remaining work orders are for 321 parts.", "In November 1995, the ES&H site representatives assessed the Fernald suspect and counterfeit parts policy and found that it was developed as instructed by DOE\u2019s Office of Environmental Management. However, the May 1996 ES&H oversight report found that the suspect/counterfeit parts program has not been adequately implemented because remedial work orders were not performed. Fluor Daniel Fernald responded that the remaining work orders will be scheduled and done as resources are available. Fluor Daniel Fernald expects to complete replacement activities by September 1, 1997.", "The Fernald Special Project Team Report stated that the team was confident that the current counterfeit bolt inspection program implemented by Fluor Daniel Fernald was effective. The team stated that in the past 2 years, crews at Fernald have been inspecting the site and looking for suspect bolts. When counterfeit bolts are found in load-bearing or structural applications, the bolts have been replaced. Also, no safety events or equipment failures related to counterfeit bolts have occurred at the Fernald site.", "Allegation: Workers Who Were Impaired by Drugs or Alcohol and Repeat Offenders Were Allowed to Keep Their Jobs.", "Although some employees have tested positive for drugs and alcohol, Fluor Daniel Fernald\u2019s records show that repeat offenders are terminated.", "In September 1994, the Fernald Area Office approved Fluor Daniel Fernald\u2019s substance abuse program. The program included random testing for controlled substances and alcohol, testing for reasonable suspicion, and preemployment testing. Fluor Daniel Fernald\u2019s substance abuse policy is that if a person tests positive for the use of controlled substances, an appointment is made for the employee to enter the employee assistance program. After the employee completes the program\u2019s treatment and upon receipt of a negative substance abuse test, the person is permitted to return to work. Later, the employee is tested on an unannounced basis. If this test is positive and the person is a Fluor Daniel Fernald employee, the person\u2019s employment is terminated. If the person is a subcontractor employee, that person\u2019s access to the Fernald site is permanently denied.", "Fluor Daniel Fernald\u2019s reporting system indicates that some workers tested positive for substance abuse in random testing, testing for reasonable cause, and testing after an accident. However, workers testing positive after completing the rehabilitation program and returning to work were terminated.", "In April 1995, Fluor Daniel Fernald started reporting occurrences of substance abuse in ORPS when it realized that a positive drug test result was considered an off-normal event. From April 1995 to February 1996, Fluor Daniel Fernald reported 32 occurrences of substance abuse. After a second positive drug test, 11 workers were either terminated or permanently denied access to the site.", "As of July 1995, Fluor Daniel Fernald revised its employment procedures to require its new employees and subcontractor applicants to receive a confirmed negative result for drug testing before being issued a badge and reporting for work. In October 1995, Fluor Daniel Fernald reported to the Fernald Area Office on the increased trends in substance abuse reports at Fernald. It attributed the increased reporting to the following: (1) the positive drug-screening results were to be reported in the ORPS system and (2) the number of positive results from pre-access drug screens increased. In 1995, of the 894 subcontractor people tested, 39 (4.4 percent) tested positive. From January through October 1996, of the 697 subcontractor people tested, 22 individuals (3.2 percent) tested positive.", "The Fernald Special Project Team Report provided information on the Fluor Daniel Fernald substance abuse program as we described above and concluded that the employees identified are the positive result of an effective substance abuse program.", "The Fernald Area Office plans to do an assessment of Fluor Daniel Fernald\u2019s substance abuse program in the spring of 1997.", "Allegation: Fluor Daniel Fernald Has Intimidated Workers to Prevent Them From Reporting Safety Concerns.", "We did not find evidence to support this allegation. Both DOE and Fluor Daniel Fernald have employee concern programs to identify and resolve safety, health, and environmental concerns raised by employees, and some employees are reporting such concerns. The programs consist of hotline numbers for the employees to call to report concerns and forms that employees can complete and submit anonymously. From January 1995 through September 1996, Fluor Daniel Fernald received 85 hotline calls and 51 written concerns that were recorded in the safety suggestion log.", "For the same period, the Fernald Area Office received three hotline calls and eight written concerns.", "A Fernald Area Office September 5, 1995, assessment found that the employee concerns hotline phone had a caller identification feature which did not protect the caller\u2019s anonymity. According to the Fluor Daniel Fernald official responsible for its safety concerns program, this situation was corrected in October 1995 with the installation of a conventional phone without caller identification and a conventional add-on answering machine that eliminated the potential for identification of the caller.", "In addition to having employee concerns programs for reporting safety concerns, employee involvement in safety is available through the Safety First program. The Safety First program is an ongoing initiative that was created in 1994 to improve the safety culture at Fernald through creating an atmosphere that encourages employees at all levels of the organization to take ownership of safety. A part of the Safety First initiative is the work group concept, which consists of a group of workers working on a task with a common supervisor that meet at the beginning of each day for 5 to 15 minutes to discuss safety issues and work concerns. The May 1996 DOE-ES&H Independent Oversight Evaluation Report concluded that the Safety First initiative and the associated safety work groups promote worker participation and empowerment and are operating effectively.", "In addition, Fluor Daniel Fernald has conducted several surveys of employees\u2019 attitudes toward safety at Fernald\u2014two in 1994 and one in 1995. The first survey was conducted during a May 1994 safety stand-down when employees stopped routine activities to examine their work areas and identify risky operations and unsafe conditions. The second and third surveys were conducted during August and September 1994 and from April through September 1995, respectively, as follow-ups and to satisfy a Fluor Daniel Fernald performance objective criterion established by the Fernald Area Office. Fluor Daniel Fernald is continuing to survey workers; however, it does not plan to analyze and report the results until 1997.", "Two questions in the employee attitude surveys related to workers\u2019 attitude. Table II.2 shows how wage employees, i.e., union workers, responded to the questions.", "Allegation: Workers Were Forced to Wear Torn, Ill-Fitting, or Improper Protective Clothing.", "Although DOE\u2019s assessment found some personal protective clothing in poor condition, we did not find evidence to support that workers were forced to wear this.", "According to the DOE Radiological Control Manual anticontamination clothing is worn when workers handle materials contaminated with removable contamination in excess of certain levels and for work in contaminated, highly-contaminated, and airborne-radioactivity areas. The clothing consists of such items as coveralls, gloves, rubber overshoes, and hoods. Both DOE\u2019s manual and Fluor Daniel Fernald\u2019s procedures require that individuals inspect their anticontamination clothing prior to use for tears, holes, or split seams that would diminish protection and replace defective items with intact clothing. Also, contractor-issued clothing, such as work coveralls and shoes, should be considered the same as personal clothing and should not be used for radiological purposes.", "During a walk-through of a pilot plant in April 1996, the Fernald Area Office\u2019s support contractor observed that much of the anticontamination clothing was in unsatisfactory condition with tears and missing buttons. As stated above, workers are to inspect the anticontamination clothing for defects and to reject unacceptable clothing. As a follow-up, the support contractor visited several other plants at the site and inspected the anticontamination clothing for general condition and integrity. The support contractor found that all other anticontamination clothing was in satisfactory condition with no observed defects and that a significant amount of the clothing appeared new. The support contractor concluded that the condition of the anticontamination clothing at the pilot plant was an isolated case.", "From January 1995 through September 1996, four complaints in the Fluor Daniel Fernald safety suggestion log dealt with clothing. In one case, the person wanted larger-sized clothing of a particular type. The person was informed that this type of clothing did not come in a larger size than was already available. In another case, the laundry erroneously sent bags of contaminated shoe covers back to the user. According to Fluor Daniel Fernald, the problem was addressed by the supervisor to prevent this from happening in the future. In the two other cases, the complaints were about contractor-issued clothing, including a complaint that employees cannot get correct sizes and the clothing is a hazard to wear. Contractor-issued clothing is not considered anticontamination clothing by DOE or Fluor Daniel Fernald. Fluor Daniel Fernald responded that it has bought over 300 sets of coveralls for employees to use and that the quantities and types of clothing are continuously under review. Fluor Daniel Fernald considers each of these employee concerns to be closed.", "Allegation: Radiation Safety Training Decreased and Full Radiation Training Was Eliminated for Most Subcontractor Employees.", "The radiation safety training requirements have not changed, nor has full radiation training been eliminated for subcontractor employees. However, Fluor Daniel Fernald did eliminate redundancies in the training courses, which resulted in a reduction in the number of hours of training. The May 1996 ES&H Oversight report stated that Fluor Daniel Fernald\u2019s training programs met applicable requirements. In addition, a DOE official told us that Fluor Daniel Fernald\u2019s training was sufficient under DOE orders and the DOE Radiological Control Manual.", "Chapter 6 of the DOE Radiological Control Manual establishes the requirements to ensure that personnel have the training to work safely in and around radiological areas. The training requirements apply to all personnel entering DOE sites. The manual establishes standardized core course training and the required hours, including general employee radiological training (1 hour), radiological worker I training (8 hours), and radiological worker II training (16 hours). The required number of hours of course work has not changed since DOE issued the Radiological Manual in 1992, revised it in 1994, and revised it again in 1996. Fluor Daniel Fernald has adopted the DOE Radiological Control Manual requirements for training its workers.", "In addition, an Occupational Safety and Health Administration requirement for employees working at hazardous waste clean-up sites is hazardous waste operations and emergency response training. Workers receiving radiological worker I and radiological worker II training also receive the requisite number of hazardous waste operations and emergency response training hours.", "According to Fluor Daniel Fernald, when it took over the Fernald site in December 1992, it evaluated the requirements for access to the site and as a result streamlined the compliance training. Where compliance training amounted to nearly 90 hours per employee working in restricted areas, the number of hours was reduced to 40. According to a Fluor Daniel Fernald official, previously there were separate courses for hazardous waste operations and emergency response and radiological control. Fluor Daniel Fernald looked at these two training programs and saw much commonality in such areas as hazard recognition and personal protective equipment. With the removal of the redundancies, the courses were pared down to their current number of days.", "According to Fluor Daniel Fernald\u2019s radiological control requirements, everyone entering the controlled area is to be trained in the aspects of radiation protection to a level commensurate with their potential for exposure to radiological hazards. The training requirements also apply to subcontractor employees. According to Fluor Daniel Fernald, as of October 1996, 63 percent of workers employed by subcontractors received radiological worker II training, 17 percent received radiological worker I training, and 20 percent received the general employee radiological training only. This compares with Fluor Daniel Fernald\u2019s wage workers, of whom 82 percent received radiological worker II training, 9 percent received radiological worker I training, and 9 percent received the general employee radiological training only.", "Allegation: Fluor Daniel Fernald Failed to Keep Inspection Records of Hazardous and Radioactive Wastes.", "A Fluor Daniel Fernald environmental compliance surveillance found problems with inspection records for hazardous waste management units. The Ohio EPA requires that owners or operators inspect areas where containers of waste are stored or were formerly stored. The owners or operators are to look for leaks and for deterioration caused by corrosion or other factors. They are also required to record inspections in an inspection log and keep these records for at least 3 years from the date of inspection.", "Fluor Daniel Fernald has inspection procedures and record keeping requirements for hazardous waste management units. The procedures are for completing the inspection logs and performing inspections of container storage areas, equipment, above-ground storage tanks, and landfills that contain such wastes. The site has 32 hazardous waste management units that are inspected on a daily, weekly, monthly, or quarterly basis.", "In a February 1996 environmental compliance surveillance of its hazardous waste management unit program, Fluor Daniel Fernald\u2019s Office of Environmental Compliance found, among other things, missing inspection logs, a lack of corrective actions being performed or noted, and inspectors who did not have the required training conducting the inspections. For the active storage units, 47 of the 627 (7 percent) required inspection logs were missing; for the inactive storage areas, 93 of the 2,031 (5 percent) required inspection logs were missing. After further investigation, Fluor Daniel Fernald found that although many of the inspections had actually been completed, the logs had not been submitted for filing in the operating record.", "As a result, the Fluor Daniel Fernald Environmental Compliance office required the person responsible for the facility to provide the missing inspection records and to follow up to ensure that corrective actions were taken. After trying to recover the missing inspection logs, some were recovered but a number will probably never be. Also, hazardous waste management unit inspectors were required to complete hazardous waste management unit training. In a March 15, 1996, letter, Fluor Daniel Fernald informed the Ohio EPA of the results of the surveillance and its actions to correct the deficiencies.", "In an April 5, 1996, letter, the Ohio EPA stated that the Fernald Environmental Management Project was in violation of the Ohio administrative code and DOE\u2019s agreement with the state. The Ohio EPA also stated that while it was concerned with the violation, the situation did not appear to result in a threat to site workers, the public, or the environment. DOE and Fluor Daniel Fernald responded in an April 19, 1996, letter, that compliance personnel would perform weekly checks of the hazardous waste management unit areas and examine the operating records to ensure that inspections were being performed and that the documentation was placed in the operating record. A Fluor Daniel Fernald environmental compliance official told us that the contractor is continuing to review the inspection records.", "Allegation: Drums of Radioactive and Other Toxic Liquids Leaked During Weekends. The Number of Leaks Was Underreported.", "According to Fluor Daniel Fernald, drums found to be leaking on the weekends were mitigated within the 24 hours required by the Ohio EPA. However, the number of leaky drums was underreported.", "The plant 1 pad is a storage area that was used for storing uranium-bearing material destined for recycling into production. In the mid-1980s, the drum population on the pad increased because material that had formerly been sent to waste pits was drummed and stored at plant 1. The outside storage resulted in significant deterioration of the steel drums because of weathering. Fluor Daniel Fernald has been overpacking the deteriorated drums into new containers.", "According to the Ohio EPA, all containers on the plant 1 pad are to be inspected daily for leakage. Type I drums\u2014those having a leak through the container to the pallet and/or ground\u2014are recorded on the container inspection form. For any drums that are actually leaking, DOE is required to immediately contain the release or spill after detection but not more than 24 hours after discovery. Mitigation can include patching the leak if possible, transferring the materials from the leaking drum, and overpacking the leaking drum. Any spill is controlled with dikes of sorbent materials.", "Fluor Daniel Fernald admitted that it underreported the number of leaky drums to the Cincinnati Enquirer. For calendar year 1995, out of 84 type I drums that should have been reported to the Assistant Emergency Duty Officer (AEDO) 33 were reported. From January through March 6, 1996, 24 out of 28 type I drums were reported. Fluor Daniel Fernald stated that it took corrective actions, such as conducting training for supervisors and developing a checklist for tracking follow-up actions.", "According to Fluor Daniel Fernald, of the 84 type I drums that should have been reported in 1995, 10 occurred on the weekends. For nine of these, weekend drivers were scheduled and available to move the drums. For the remaining one, no drivers were scheduled or called in, but Fluor Daniel Fernald stated that the drum was moved within 24 hours. Of the 28 type I drums found from January through March 6, 1996, 1 occurred on the weekend. Fluor Daniel Fernald states that the leak was mitigated the same day, Saturday, and that the drum was moved to the overpack area on Monday.", "On Saturday, March 9, 1996, Ohio EPA visited the site to investigate allegations regarding leaky drums.

Because the allegations were generally broad and lacking specificity, we did not investigate specific allegations. Rather, we grouped the allegations into two major areas of concern: (1) control of the changes in the cost and schedule of projects against which the contractor\u2019s performance is measured, called the performance measurement baseline, and (2) key practices in the contractor\u2019s financial management system in which all of the costs are accumulated. We also provided numerous opportunities for workers and individuals from the Fernald area to provide us with information about possible financial or performance reporting improprieties.

The documentation in the contractor\u2019s proposals to change the baseline was usually adequate to support the change. However, the impact of changes on work at the site was not as well documented, and the required funding information was not always present. Furthermore, some procedures are not clearly written and do not require certain information that would make review more efficient. In part, these occurrences may be due to a heavy reliance by the DOE Fernald Area Office\u2019s managers on less-formal channels of communication with the contractor, such as verbal presentations and phone calls rather than formal documentation of all actions.", "The financial system will accept charges against accounts that have been properly closed. In addition, the financial system allows closed accounts to be reopened without the approval of the control account managers. Such actions hamper the effective control of accounts by these managers.

Second, procedures related to changes in the baseline are not clearly written and do not require some documentation that would make review more efficient. This may make it difficult for DOE to oversee the cost and schedule performance of projects affected by such changes.

The responsible party for approving a change proposal depends on the cost or schedule impact of the change. Currently, baseline changes within an activity data sheet with a net impact of less than $25,000 can be prepared and approved by the control account manager in charge of the activity. However, the control account managers cannot make changes that affect more than one activity data sheet without the contractor\u2019s and/or DOE\u2019s approval.

In general, the approval level is determined by the net change in costs for all fiscal years covered by the proposal, although there are exceptions. For example, if a change proposes moving $50,000 from a management reserve account, which is not part of the baseline, to support the added scope of work to the baseline, the transfer is not categorized by the net change. On the other hand, if a change proposes moving the same amount from one charge number within a control account to another charge number in the same control account, the net change is used to determine approval. Similarly, if a change proposal lists costs for more than 1 fiscal year, approval is usually determined by adding the impact across all fiscal years. However, in some cases, the cost information for future fiscal years is presented only for informational purposes, and approval is determined by the cost change for only the current fiscal year. Because the criterion used to determine which level of approval is needed is not fully documented in the site\u2019s written procedures, change proposals moving similar amounts of resources may be approved at different levels of review.", "The current procedures do not require that supporting documentation attached to the change proposals have the changes clearly marked to facilitate review. For example, when the scope of work for a project is being changed, forms detailing what work would be authorized if the proposal were approved are revised. However, the work scope forms had no indication of what was being changed. The identification of the change could only be made by comparing the revised form with the previous version. For some proposed changes, that task would not be onerous. However, for others affecting large segments of the site\u2019s work, the task could involve reviewing a large volume of documents (e.g., one rebaselining proposal had over 1,000 pages of supporting documentation). On occasion, one DOE manager has asked the contractor to mark the changes for rebaselining proposals.", "Current procedures also do not require that the reasons for disapproval be documented on the change proposal. However, proposals that are disapproved at one level can be appealed to the next higher level board. In addition, without such information, the official record is incomplete and less useful for internal and external reviewers who are not present at board meetings. The Fernald Area Office agrees that documenting the reasons for disapproval would aid the review of appealed proposals.", "DOE\u2019s Fernald Area Office officials agreed that clear and complete information on the change proposals would facilitate review. The incompleteness of the formal documentation highlights the degree to which the Fernald Area Office\u2019s managers rely on informal and verbal communications to support decision-making. However, the information provided through these informal channels is not part of the official record and, therefore, is not readily available for subsequent internal or external review. Improved procedures and quality of the documentation would facilitate DOE\u2019s oversight process and result in less reliance on informal communication for decision-making.

When the work is scheduled to begin on such a segment, a control account manager requests that an account be opened, thus allowing costs for the work to be charged against the account. When the work on the segment is completed and the control account manager determines that all related charges have been made, the control account manager closes the account. This procedure is meant to ensure that a person knowledgeable about the scope of work and the related costs monitors and controls the charges that are made against the account.

The contractor recorded about 504,000 charges in fiscal year 1994, more than 650,000 in fiscal year 1995, and more than 512,000 in fiscal year 1996 through July, all of which we reviewed.", "According to our analysis, from 0.9 percent of the charges in fiscal year 1994 to 2.4 percent in fiscal year 1996 occurred when the accounts were not properly opened to accept charges. Although the percentage of such charges is low, the charges have occurred on a regular basis. The dollar value of these charges ranged from a charge of $905,902 to a credit of $8 million. Furthermore, accounts can have multiple openings and closings as well as numerous charges after they have been closed. For example, two accounts that we judgmentally selected had multiple openings and closings (three in one case and five in the other) and showed numerous charges after the accounts were closed (363 charges in one case and 178 in the other). Therefore, once an account has been entered into the system, it requires constant monitoring to ensure that only appropriate charges are added to it after the control account manager has closed out the account.", "The system will accept charges to closed accounts because, according to contractor officials, accounts are not considered permanently closed in order to allow for adjustments to be made. According to Fluor Daniel Fernald accounting personnel, charges might be made to a closed account when sales tax is allocated to accounts, which is done monthly rather than after each invoice is posted, and when employee benefits are periodically allocated. In addition, invoices may be entered into the system when they are received but not charged against the accounts until the invoice due date when they are paid.", "The type of transactions posted to closed accounts has not changed over the period. Charges are categorized in one of three ways\u2014labor, materials, or subcontract costs. The highest error rates in each year occurred in transactions for the purchase of materials.

However, because there was no formal corrective action plan, it is difficult to assess directly exactly what was done or how effective the actions were in resolving the problems cited.", "For example, the Office of Field Management recommended that the Fernald Area Office conduct comprehensive assessments of the contractor\u2019s accounting system and compliance with applicable procedures. While the Fernald Area Office has ascertained that the contractor has written procedures governing key components of the Project Control System, such as opening and closing control accounts and charge numbers, it has not assessed the logic or implementation of those procedures. The Chief Financial Officer\u2019s Review reiterated this recommendation in March 1996. However, the Fernald Area Office has not performed the assessments and does not plan to do so until fiscal year 1998 at the earliest.

The Ohio Field Office\u2019s Office of the Chief Financial Officer has been conducting an audit of how well the contractor has followed that written procedure in general and has issued a report on one instance in which it was not followed. In that case, the contractor entered into a subcontract to dismantle Plant 7 at a cost of about $5 million less than the estimated amount included in the baseline. Subsequently, the contractor did not process a proposal to change the baseline. As a result, the contractor\u2019s award fee for the period was based on the higher amount.

On the basis of that information, DOE requested that Fluor Daniel Fernald prepare an analysis that would identify any potential impacts to the 10-year plan. In response, Fluor Daniel Fernald initially estimated in July 1996 that it would require an additional year and approximately $120 million more to clean up the Fernald site.", "In August 1996, Fluor Daniel Fernald provided DOE with more specific recommendations on a 10-year replan strategy based on the lower funding levels provided. Specifically, the contractor recommended a path that called for the completion of work on four of the five operable units by the end of fiscal year 2005. Fluor Daniel Fernald estimated that the completion of work on operable unit 4 would take an additional 2 to 5 years.
