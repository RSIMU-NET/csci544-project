Making government data open by default  ensures that the data are equally open to all types of users; in contrast,  when government information is available by request, it may favor citizens  with greater information about and access to government institutions. In  addition, some open data practitioners we spoke with said that providing  open data can minimize the burden of responding to information requests.  For example, according to Connecticut officials, before the state\u2019s open  spending data website was launched, payroll data were the most  frequently requested information under the state\u2019s Freedom of Information  Act (FOIA). Officials said that providing open payroll data on the website  significantly reduced FOIA requests, which allowed state officials to  spend time and resources on other activities.", "However, not all government information is appropriate to publish. Some  datasets may contain sensitive information such as personally identifiable  information, information that is classified or similarly not subject to  disclosure, or intellectual property. Other legal restrictions may also  prohibit the disclosure of certain information. In some cases the  information in an individual dataset may not pose a risk of identifying  sensitive information, but may pose such a risk when combined with other  available information. For that reason, when considering whether or not  information may be disclosed, OMB M-13-13 requires agencies to  determine whether it may be combined with existing publically available  data to identify an individual or otherwise pose a security concern. In  such situations, agencies must conduct a risk-based privacy analysis to  determine whether the information can be made publicly available that  accounts for the nature of the information, the availability of other  information, and the technology in place that could facilitate the process  of identification.", "As an example of how open data practitioners can balance these types of  considerations, Montgomery County, Maryland, applies safeguards such  as a review by internal departments. Additionally, if Department officials  request a secondary fact-specific review, the Office of the County  Attorney will review the information to further ensure that protected  information is not published. In some cases, sensitive information is  removed from a dataset prior to publication. For example, according to  county officials, the names of housing assistance recipients are removed  from spending data to protect resident privacy. Users can see  nonsensitive aspects of these data, such as the amount spent, with  identifying details removed.", "Do not charge users for access to the data.

Open data experts we spoke with emphasized that data providers should  engage with users both inside and outside of government, including  groups that may typically have less access to government institutions. For  example, to further New York City\u2019s Open Data for All vision to provide  open data for people from all walks of life and all five of the city\u2019s  boroughs, Columbia University students conducted user research on  behalf of the city to better understand the extent to which community  organizations use open data and what barriers they face, according to the  capstone report for this project. By surveying and interviewing these  organizations, the students learned that users found the city\u2019s data portal  interface difficult to use.

Soliciting and being  responsive to user feedback\u2014both when the website is being developed  and on an ongoing basis\u2014can help ensure that the website meets users\u2019  needs. Feedback can also surface issues with the functionality of the  website and the quality of the data, thus enabling the data provider to  make corrections when needed. User feedback mechanisms vary and  can include online comment forms, forums, and discussion boards, as  well as in-person public forums. Open data experts we spoke with said it  is particularly helpful to list the contact information for a responsible  official on the website in case users have questions about the data. In  addition, timely response to feedback encourages engagement by  assuring users that their voices have been heard.", "Monitoring how the public is using the data can also help practitioners  determine which content and features are most useful. Web analytics can  show how the data are being used, such as by identifying commonly-used  search terms and datasets, and showing trends over time.", "Web Analytics  Web analytics is the collection, reporting, and  analysis of website data, such as the number  of users who visit the website.", "According to a city official, Los Angeles uses web analytics to measure  how frequently its datasets are accessed. Web analytics data showed  that some datasets were often accessed on certain dates or in  conjunction with current events, while other datasets were rarely used.  City officials use this information to adjust how data are presented on the  website, which has increased overall use of the city\u2019s data. For example,  the city created data visualizations and links to data\u2014including its City  Revenue and City Budget Expenditures datasets\u2014to accompany the  release of its Comprehensive Annual Financial Report.", "Reach out to potential users to encourage data use. Actively  engaging potential users can provide an opportunity to educate them on  how the data can be appropriately used and encourage innovation. Data  trainings can provide potential users with important context and  information, which can include teaching users how the data can be used.  Resources such as how-to guides can also encourage data use. For  example, as shown on the website, New York City\u2019s open data portal  includes a \u201cHow To\u201d page with a step-by-step guide to help users get  started with open data, and directs them toward additional resources such  as data dictionaries.", "We previously found that open data collaboration and prize competitions  or challenges are two strategies that agencies can use to harness the  ideas, expertise, and resources of those outside of their organization.", "Agencies engage in open data collaboration by mobilizing participants to  use their open data in innovative ways, such as sharing, exploring, and  analyzing publicly-available datasets; using the data to conduct research;  designing data visualizations; or creating web and mobile applications  and websites that help people access and use the data. In addition,  agencies use prize competitions or challenges for help solving a problem  or reaching a specific goal by asking members of the public to submit  potential solutions. The agency then evaluates these proposals and  provides a monetary or nonmonetary award to selected winners.", "New York City encourages the use of its open data using these strategies  by hosting data literacy trainings, hackathons, and contests. For example,  in the spring of 2018 the city hosted a contest to recognize projects that  effectively use its open data and showcase the diversity of potential uses,  according to city officials and contest documentation. Winning projects  were posted to a gallery on the city\u2019s open data website.

The representation of the expenditure is displayed  as a check, and includes the vendor\u2019s name and address, the amount  paid, payment date, check number, and contact information for the  appropriate state office.", "Provide machine-readable data that can be downloaded in bulk and  in selected subsets. Providing data in machine-readable formats makes  them easier to process and analyze, which is particularly important for  large datasets. For example, Kansas City officials said the city has been  working to convert information from the PDF format to machine-readable  formats such as CSV because PDF documents are challenging for the  city to update and for users to navigate. In one instance, officials said that  converting the city\u2019s list of vehicles for sale in its tow lot from PDF to CSV  format allowed the city to update the data more frequently so that users  can see what vehicles are for sale at any given time.", "Making data available to download in bulk allows users who need the full  dataset to easily access it rather than retrieving information record-by- record. If the full dataset is large, allowing users to download selected  subsets can make it easier for them to work with only the data they need.  Data can also be provided to users through an Application Programming  Interface (API), which allows users to connect directly with the dataset by  enabling machine-to-machine communication. APIs can be particularly  useful for large, frequently updated, or highly complex datasets because  they offer users flexibility to obtain the data they need. In addition,  developers can use APIs to build applications based on the data.", "Non-Proprietary File Formats  File formats describe what type of information  a file contains, as well as how that information  is stored and structured. Some file formats are  proprietary, meaning that they can only be  opened by specific commercial software  applications. In contrast, non-proprietary  formats are publicly available and can be  used by all software developers. Examples of  non-proprietary file formats include:", "CSV, which stores tabular data;  RDF, which stores metadata;  TXT, which stores unformatted text; and  XML, which stores both the format and  content of data.", "Provide data downloads in a non-proprietary format. To ensure broad  and equitable access, data downloads should be available in formats that  do not require specific commercial software to access, and therefore do  not exclude users who do not have access to such software. Non- proprietary data formats include, but are not limited to, CSV, RDF, TXT,  and XML. For example, Kansas City, Missouri\u2019s, open data portal allows  users to export spatial data in an open format that does not require  proprietary mapping software, according to city officials and the city\u2019s  open data portal website. Open data experts we spoke with said that  practitioners should consult stakeholders when determining which format  is appropriate for a given program, and that the appropriate format may  change over time as technology advances.", "Make the data interoperable with other datasets. Making data  interoperable with other datasets can make them more useful because  users may want to create new opportunities for analysis by linking  datasets together. This can be done by standardizing the way that the  data are reported. For example, using standard definitions for the specific  items included in a set of data\u2014known as data elements\u2014can promote  consistency with other datasets. Additionally, documentation such as data  dictionaries can help ensure that definitions are clear and avoid  misunderstandings.", "To promote interoperability between datasets that use geographic  information, Kansas City uses standard land parcel identification numbers  across departments. This allows different datasets that contain location  information to be used in combination.

Disclosing data  quality issues and limitations helps users make informed decisions about  whether and how to use the data. Disclosure of data quality issues and  limitations can include descriptions of the completeness, timeliness, and  accuracy of the data, such as an explanation of why certain data may not  be disseminated. For example, we observed that Connecticut\u2019s  \u201cOpenCheckbook\u201d website includes an \u201cAbout\u201d page explaining that some  information is excluded to protect privacy, or because it is not processed  through the state\u2019s financial system, such as the state\u2019s Airport Authority,  jury duty payments, and unclaimed property.", "Disclose data sources and timeliness. Disclosing where the data come  from and how frequently they are updated provides context that helps  users judge their quality and determine whether they can be appropriately  used for the intended purpose. Without this information, users may view,  download, or use data without full knowledge of the extent to which they  are timely, complete, or accurate, and therefore could inadvertently draw  inaccurate conclusions from the data.", "Metadata  Metadata provide descriptive information  about a dataset in a structured, machine- readable format.

In addition,  data should be clearly labeled and accompanied by structured metadata  so that users can easily find information about the dataset. Metadata  describe the characteristics of data in clearly defined, machine-readable  fields, which can include attributes such as the date the data were  created or modified, or the license used, among other things. Structuring  metadata in clearly defined fields makes it possible for search tools to  filter and match content pertaining to those fields.

Documentation for a dataset should also specify  what license applies to the data because a data license provides users  with information about how they may use the data, including whether  there are any restrictions, such as copyrights. An open license indicates  that there are few to no restrictions on how the data may be used. An  open license can encourage innovation, for example, by assuring users  that they are permitted to use the data to develop commercial  applications. To realize these benefits, licensing information should be  clearly communicated to users, ideally in machine-readable and human- readable formats. As shown in figure 7, metadata can be used to  communicate licensing information in a clear and structured way.  Including licensing information in metadata can help ensure that it is  machine readable\u2014which makes it easier to process and analyze\u2014as  well as help users discover the licensing information and compare it  across datasets."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Facilitate Data Discovery for All Users", "paragraphs": ["Data discovery is facilitated by presenting the data in a way that enables  users to easily explore them.

To facilitate data  discovery for all users, practitioners of open government data should  ensure that the data are provided on a website that is simple and intuitive  so that users can easily navigate it to find the information they need.  Obtaining user feedback and conducting usability testing can help  practitioners assess whether the website is easy to use, and identify any  aspects that do not work well for users. In addition, websites designed to  work on mobile devices, as well as mobile applications such as Ohio\u2019s  \u201cOhioCheckbook\u201d app (see figure 9), can allow users to access data on a  variety of devices, according to the state\u2019s website and our observations.", "Provide users with appropriate interpretations of the data, such as  visualizations or summaries. Summaries and visualizations can help  users explore data. For example, our review of Montgomery County,  Maryland\u2019s, \u201cspendingMontgomery\u201d website found that the website  provides summary data of the top five services, vendors, and expense  categories with the greatest amount of spending, as well as a chart of  annual spending along with historical averages, as shown in figure 10.  This summary information provides a starting point for users, who can  then navigate through the website to access more granular data.", "Ensure that the website\u2019s content is written in plain language. The  content of an open data website should also be written in a way that is  clear and direct, using plain language. Using commonly understood terms  rather than technical jargon can help users understand the information  provided. For example, to use well-understood terms when  communicating budget information, Kansas City officials told us they  participated in plain language training and applied that knowledge to the  city\u2019s open budget data website. In addition, we found that in cases where  it is necessary to use technical language, providing a glossary that  defines key terms can help make the information understandable to  users.", "Provide a search function that is optimized for easy and efficient  use. Open data websites should also include a search function that is  optimized for easy and efficient use so that users can find information that  is relevant to them. For example, Connecticut officials said that the  search function on the state\u2019s open spending data website is designed so  that users do not need to be familiar with the state government\u2019s structure  or terminology to find meaningful results. When a user enters a search  term, the search bar will return a list of items that include this term and a  description of what they are.

We identified the required FFATA  data elements from these awards, searched for these elements on  USAspending.gov in July 2018, recorded whether each search  successfully resulted in a matching award, and observed any other issues  that occurred during testing. Finally, we interviewed Treasury officials to  corroborate our observations on search functionality and other aspects of  the website, and discussed any planned improvements to the website.
