TVA has financed large capital investments mostly by issuing debt and is subject to a $30 billion debt ceiling imposed by the TVA Act. TVA is governed by a 9-member Board. Within an affirmation requirement for the TVA Board, the TVA Act recognizes that TVA's broad missions and objectives include being a national leader in technological innovation, low-cost power, and environmental stewardship. GAO was asked to examine (1) how TVA plans to meet future demand for electricity and how TVA's resource planning and forecasts compare to those from other sources, (2) TVA's efforts to use energy efficiency to meet demand for electricity, and (3) TVA's financial condition and how it affects TVA's ability to meet its operational and financial goals. GAO analyzed data from TVA and third parties, reviewed agency documents, and interviewed federal and state officials and industry stakeholders."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["According to its 2010 power supply plan, by 2029 TVA plans to meet electricity demand primarily by expanding natural gas-fired generating capacity, adding three nuclear reactors, and expanding energy efficiency programs. TVA also plans to retire some coal-fired capacity. These plans are informed by TVA's resource planning forecasts, which GAO determined were largely in line with plans and forecasts for the southeastern United States from other sources. For example, TVA forecasts that peak demand will grow at an average annual rate of about 1 percent for about the next 20 years, which is within the range of long-term forecasts for the Southeast from other sources, including the Department of Energy and a GAO nonprobability sample of five investor-owned utilities. TVA also plans to increase its generating capacity and total electricity generation by about 1 percent per year on average, both of which are within the range of plans and forecasts from other sources. While TVA plans to expand its energy efficiency efforts to meet future demand for electricity, TVA may not be fully considering this alternative. For example, TVA's plans may not reflect the full energy efficiency potential of its service area, since it has not yet completed a study of that potential. As a result, TVA cannot be sure that its current resource plans reflect the full scope and possible extent of energy efficiency programs or that the plans are realistic. In March 2011, TVA commissioned a study on the energy efficiency potential of its service area, which is scheduled to be completed by October 2011. In addition, TVA's use of energy efficiency is constrained by several factors, including TVA's planning approach, which did not allow for potentially more cost-effective levels of energy efficiency in its planning model. In addition, TVA is not subject to certain key mandates and incentives that apply to some other utilities, such as the requirement in California for utilities to consider energy efficiency before other resources. TVA's financial condition may hamper its ability to fund capital improvements. As of September 30, 2010, TVA's statutory debt was $23.6 billion, and TVA plans to spend almost $10 billion by fiscal year 2013 for various capital investment projects. Given the significant delays and cost overruns that TVA has historically experienced, these projects could potentially face similar issues. In addition, under a settlement with the Environmental Protection Agency, TVA agreed to invest $3 billion to $5 billion in the next 10 years on new and upgraded pollution controls on existing power plants. TVA also anticipates increases in operating costs. All of these factors could reduce the available funds TVA could use for its planned capital investments. TVA's financial condition leaves it with difficult decisions to make in order to meet electricity demand while keeping its debt within the statutory limit. TVA does not have a formal capital expenditure management plan that identifies assets to be acquired, their costs, and funding sources. The lack of such a plan may impede TVA's long range financial planning."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that TVA (1) use information from the energy efficiency study it commissioned to inform its future resource planning process and (2) develop a written capital expenditure plan that includes the full costs of the assets TVA plans to acquire and the sources of funding for acquiring those assets. TVA agreed with GAO's first recommendation and generally agreed with the second recommendation."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) is a unique, self-financing,  federally owned electric utility that provides electric power in a seven- state area in the southeastern United States. With more than nine million  customers, a generating capacity of more than 34,000 megawatts (MW),  and annual electricity revenues of about $11 billion, TVA is the largest  publicly owned utility in the United States. The electric utility industry is  among the most capital-intensive industries in the world and utilities often  must plan years in advance to build generating capacity to meet future  demand. For example, a nuclear power plant with a single 1,100 MW  reactor that could provide electricity to more than 600,000 homes can  cost billions of dollars and require long lead times to obtain regulatory  approval, perform engineering studies, and build the necessary  infrastructure, among other things. TVA has primarily financed large  capital investments, such as the construction of nuclear power plants, by  issuing debt in the form of bonds. TVA is subject to a statutorily-imposed  $30 billion debt ceiling imposed by the TVA Act of 1933, as amended,  and as of September 30, 2010, had about $23.6 billion in statutory debt  and about $2.2 billion in alternative financial arrangements. TVA\u2019s only  other source of funds for capital investments is its revenue from  operations.", "TVA currently faces a number of financial challenges associated with  environmental cleanup or protection. For example, in April 2011, TVA  settled with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), agreeing to  invest $3 billion to $5 billion in the next 10 years on new and upgraded  pollution controls on existing power plants, and according to the  settlement, plans to invest another $350 million to reduce pollution,  primarily through energy efficiency projects.

We  evaluated TVA\u2019s assumptions and variables for some of the underlying  determinants of its power supply plan, such as capital costs of electricity  generation alternatives, fuel costs, emissions-related costs, and costs of  energy efficiency programs. In addition, we interviewed TVA officials  familiar with the agency\u2019s resource planning process. We compared  TVA\u2019s forecasts with forecasts from other sources, including the  Department of Energy\u2019s Energy Information Administration (EIA) and  nongovernmental sources, such as IHS Global Insight. We also  compared TVA\u2019s forecasts and plans with those of five investor-owned  utilities operating in the southeastern United States, which we selected  using a nonprobability sample. We assessed the reliability of forecasts  received from TVA, regional and national electric utilities, and other  sources such as IHS Global Insight by interviewing knowledgeable  individuals and by evaluating the forecasts for consistency with one  another.

In  addition, we compared TVA\u2019s energy efficiency and renewable energy  programs and efforts to the sample of five southeastern investor-owned  utilities chosen for the first objective, as well as a sixth regional utility,  Georgia Power, because it also had sufficient data for comparisons. We  also compared TVA\u2019s programs and efforts to a nonprobability sample of  five additional utilities that we identified as national leaders in energy  efficiency to provide illustrative information. We identified these utilities  based on EIA data on energy efficiency program expenditures and energy  saved through these programs and by consulting with industry experts  and reviewing industry reports. These five leading utilities were Austin  Energy, Connecticut Power and Light, Northern States Power Company  (Xcel Energy\u2013Minnesota), Pacific Gas and Electric Company, and  Southern California Edison. In addition, we interviewed officials from  public service commissions, power associations, and energy sector  associations to gather information on energy efficiency and renewable  energy programs incentives, disincentives, and implementation  challenges.", "To address our third objective, we examined TVA\u2019s strategic planning and  budget documents, as well as independently audited TVA financial  information from the Securities and Exchange Commission. We also  interviewed TVA officials to discuss TVA\u2019s debt levels. We compared  TVA\u2019s financial condition and activities to those of the five southeastern  investor-owned utilities from the nonprobability sample, which are viewed  as having a comparable financial credit rating and are geographically  similar. For all three objectives, as applicable, we assessed the reliability  of historical data received from TVA by interviewing individuals familiar  with the processing and maintenance of the data; we judged these data  reliable for the purpose of comparing TVA\u2019s forecasts of key variables to  historical changes in the same variables.", "We conducted this performance audit from November 2009 through  October 2011 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

In addition to generating and  transmitting power, TVA also manages the nation\u2019s fifth-largest river  system to minimize flood risk, maintain navigation, provide recreational  opportunities, and protect water quality.", "TVA\u2019s power service area covers about 80,000 square miles in the  southeastern United States, an area that includes almost all of  Tennessee and parts of Mississippi, Kentucky, Alabama, Georgia, North  Carolina, and Virginia (see fig. 1) and has a total population of more than  nine million people.", "In fiscal year 2010, TVA sold more than 173 million megawatt-hours  (MWh) of electricity to customers. To meet this demand for electricity,  TVA generates electricity at 11 coal-fired plants, 11 natural gas-fired  plants, 3 nuclear plants, and a hydroelectric system that includes 29  hydroelectric dams and 1 pumped storage facility (see fig. 1). In fiscal  year 2010, TVA\u2019s coal-fired plants produced about 42 percent of TVA\u2019s  power, nuclear plants about 30 percent, the hydroelectric system about 8  percent, natural gas-fired plants about 3 percent, and nonhydropower  renewables of less than 1 percent. TVA also purchased about 16 percent  of its power needs from other suppliers. TVA owns and operates one of  the largest electric transmission systems in North America.", "Under the TVA Act, as amended, TVA has not been subject to many of  the regulatory oversight requirements that commercial utilities must  satisfy. Additionally, TVA is exempt from paying federal and state  taxes, and can borrow funds for investment in its power system at very  competitive interest rates as a result of its triple-A credit rating. This rating  is based on TVA\u2019s credit strengths: its ownership by the federal  government, the TVA Board\u2019s regulatory responsibility and statutory rate  setting mechanisms, and TVA\u2019s protected service territory.", "Unlike many utilities, TVA charges rates for its electric power and its  power resource decisions that are not subject to review and approval by  state public utility commissions. However, in setting TVA\u2019s rates, TVA\u2019s  Board must comply with the primary objectives of the TVA Act, including  the objective that power shall be sold at rates as low as are feasible.", "All authority to run and operate TVA is vested in TVA\u2019s nine-member  Board of Directors, including the sole authority to set wholesale electric  power rates and approve the retail rates charged by TVA\u2019s distributors.  Each board member is nominated by the President of the United States  and confirmed by the Senate. Under the TVA Act, in order to be eligible  for appointment as a member of TVA\u2019s Board of Directors, an individual  must, among other things, affirm support for the objectives and missions  of the TVA, including being a national leader in technological innovation,  low-cost power, and environmental stewardship.", "The TVA Act provides that the Board shall establish the broad goals,  objectives, and policies of the Corporation that are appropriate to carry  out the Act; develop long-range plans to guide the TVA in achieving its  goals, objectives, and policies; and ensure that those goals, objectives,  and policies are achieved. Within an affirmation requirement for the  Board, the TVA Act recognizes that TVA\u2019s broad missions and objectives  include being a national leader in technological innovation, low-cost  power, and environmental stewardship. In particular, eligibility for  membership on the TVA Board requires, among other things, that  potential members \u201caffirm support for the objectives and missions of  , including being a national leader in\u201d these three areas.

The strategic plan also  includes a number of strategic objectives and critical success factors,  including partnering with distributors and directly serving customers to  encourage conservation, promoting energy efficiency, and reducing peak  demand; continuing to reduce the impacts of TVA\u2019s operations on the  environment; and applying science and technological innovation to  improve operational performance. In discussing these objectives, the plan  states that TVA will strive to be a leader in energy-efficiency  improvements and that renewables will play an increasingly important role  in TVA\u2019s future generation. Moreover, in a July 21, 2009, resolution, the  TVA Board stated that it is committed to being a \u201cnational leader in  technological innovation, low cost power and environmental stewardship.\u201d  In addition, in August 2010, the Board adopted a \u201crenewed vision,\u201d stating  that TVA will serve the people of the Tennessee Valley by being (1) the  nation\u2019s leader in improving air quality, (2) the nation\u2019s leader in increased  nuclear production, and (3) the Southeast\u2019s leader in increased energy  efficiency.

Of  these, TVA\u2019s annual capacity expansion plan (or \u201cpower supply plan\u201d) is  the primary plan TVA uses to provide support for its resource decisions.", "TVA uses the power supply plan to examine options for expanding its  resources over the next 20 years in response to multiple scenarios. As  part of its power supply plan, TVA develops forecasts of demand for  electricity that help it make resource planning decisions, such as how  much and what kind of capacity to build, or how much power to buy from  other sources. Accurate forecasts can help utilities manage their costs  and reliability by anticipating the need to invest in and maintain  generating equipment that meets their customers\u2019 needs. If forecasts are  not accurate, a utility could end up with more or less generating capacity  than it needs to serve its customers reliably, or it could end up with a mix  of generating capacity that is not cost effective. These outcomes can  affect electricity rates as well as the utility\u2019s financial situation.", "TVA employs a set of econometric and other models to forecast the  demand for electricity in its service area for the next 20 or more years.  However, forecasting beyond a few years into the future involves great  uncertainty. Utilities deal with forecast uncertainty by producing a range of  forecasts based on factors believed to influence demand growth, such as  population growth and economic growth in a utility\u2019s service area, and by  maintaining excess generating resources, known as reserves. Models  help utilities choose the least-cost combinations of such generating  resources to meet expected demand. Models are also used to project the  amount of generation capacity that needs to be built to meet peak  demand.", "To meet demand, utilities can upgrade existing plants, construct new  plants, purchase power from others, and provide incentive programs to  customers to reduce and shift their demand for electricity, called energy  efficiency programs. TVA delivers its energy efficiency programs to end- use customers through its 155 distributors, which are municipal utilities  and electric cooperatives in TVA\u2019s service area. Energy efficiency  programs are intended to reduce the electricity used for a given task, and  can reduce a system\u2019s overall requirements to provide electricity.", "Utilities can also use renewable energy resources such as wind, solar,  biomass, and hydropower to meet electricity needs. A number of states  have emphasized renewable energy in recent years, especially through  the implementation of state renewable portfolio standards (RPS).  Designed to encourage the development of new renewable energy  resources, an RPS requires utilities to provide a certain proportion of their  electricity from renewable resources. As of June 2011, according to the  Department of Energy, 29 states and the District of Columbia have  mandatory RPSs, and 8 states have voluntary standards.", "Under the TVA Act, as amended, for its capital needs in excess of funds  generated from operations, TVA is authorized to borrow by issuing bonds  and notes; however, it is not authorized to issue equity securities such as  stock. TVA\u2019s authority to issue bonds and notes is set by Congress and  cannot exceed $30 billion outstanding at any given time, and its power  programs are required to be self-financing through revenues from the sale  of electricity.", "We have previously reported on TVA\u2019s management of its high levels of  debt, interest, and financing obligations. TVA has historically recognized  the need to reduce its debt and other financing obligations to increase its  financial flexibility and meet competitive challenges, but has not always  been successful in doing so. For example, in 1997, TVA issued a 10-year  business plan that called for TVA to reduce its debt by half over a 10-year  period to about $13.2 billion by increasing its electricity rates beginning in  1998, reducing certain expenses, and limiting capital expenditures;  however, TVA was unable to meet its 1997 debt reduction goal because it  used revenue to cover annual operating costs and had capital  expenditures that were higher than expected. TVA officials explained that  TVA had intended to meet demand by relying, in part, on purchased  power agreements and merchant-provided power. However, according to  these officials, some purchased power agreements failed due to default,  and merchant-provided power was not readily available. They added that,  as a result, TVA switched to an emphasis on constructing generating  assets which, in turn, limited TVA\u2019s ability to meet its debt reduction  goals.", "In fiscal year 2000, to obtain lower financing costs, TVA began entering  into alternative financial arrangements in the form of lease-leasebacks  and energy prepayments. In a June 2003 report, we stated that TVA\u2019s  lease-leaseback arrangements involved the refinancing of 24 combustion  turbine power generators. TVA leased the power generators to private  investors for 50 years and simultaneously leased them back for 20 years.  Under these lease-leaseback arrangements, TVA received cash from  private investors, but retains legal title to the assets. The investors  receive lease payments from TVA and obtain certain tax benefits, some  of which are passed on to TVA in the form of more favorable financing  rates. TVA also implemented energy prepayments that allowed its  customers to prepay for power in exchange for discounted rates in  advance of the period in which it is provided. In the 2003 report, we  suggested that Congress may want to consider amending the TVA Act to  clarify whether these arrangements should count toward the debt cap,  since they have the same impact on TVA\u2019s financial condition and  competitive position as traditional debt financing, but no such amendment  has been made to date.", "In 2004, with total financing obligations of almost $26 billion, TVA\u2019s board  adopted a strategic plan for reducing debt that called for increasing  revenue, controlling costs, and reducing the growth of capital  expenditures. In 2006, TVA prepared a budget proposal that set a debt  reduction goal of $7.1 billion, which included reducing its statutory debt by  $6.7 billion and alternative financing obligations by $400 million. However,  based on the direction of TVA\u2019s board and as reflected in its 2007  strategic plan, TVA shifted its focus from debt reduction to a broader  focus on financial management based on a set of financial guiding  principles. TVA stated that this strategy was developed in response to  the priorities of its Board of Directors; significant changes in the electric  utility marketplace since the 2004 strategic plan; and the Energy Policy  Act of 2005, which places more emphasis on reliability, renewable  energy, low-emission generation technologies, and energy efficiency and  conservation. Since the adoption of these principles, TVA\u2019s statutory debt  has surpassed the 2004 level, while total financial obligations have almost  returned to 2004 levels. On September 30, 2010, TVA reported having  $25.8 billion in financial obligations, including $23.6 billion in statutory  debt and about $2.2 billion in alternative financing arrangements. While  TVA\u2019s level of total financial obligations has fallen since fiscal year 2000  when it was almost $26.3 billion, the overall level of total financial  obligations has remained fairly constant for the past 10 years, as shown  in figure 2."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "TVA\u2019s Plans Focus on Building Natural Gas and Nuclear Capacity, and Its Forecasts Are Largely in Line with Others", "paragraphs": ["TVA plans to meet future electricity demand primarily by expanding  natural gas-fired and nuclear-powered generating capacity, reducing the  amount of coal-fired generating capacity, and expanding energy efficiency  programs.

TVA selected this goal based on a study it commissioned to  determine the level of savings necessary to become the Southeast\u2019s  energy efficiency leader among electric utilities. TVA\u2019s Board of Directors  approved $135 million in spending on energy efficiency programs in fiscal  year 2011, but TVA officials told us that it will need to add $414 million  more to future budgets to achieve its 3.5 percent energy efficiency goal in  2015. Although several experts said that TVA\u2019s projected level of savings  is aggressive for utilities lacking significant energy efficiency experience,  TVA officials said they considered the level of expected savings to be  reasonable based on their views of the technical feasibility of planned  efforts and the ability to work through TVA\u2019s distributors. Nonetheless,  TVA did not use studies of energy efficiency potential in its service area  as the primary basis for the goal. In March 2011, TVA signed a contract  commissioning a third party to study the energy efficiency potential of  TVA\u2019s service area, which is scheduled to be completed by October 2011.  Until this study is completed, TVA cannot be sure that its goal reflects the  full potential for cost-effective energy efficiency savings in its service  area, nor can it be sure that its goal is realistic.", "Compared with leading national utilities we identified, TVA and other  southeastern utilities have so far made smaller investments in energy  efficiency. Industry experts consider the level of investment a leading  factor in judging a utility\u2019s performance in energy efficiency. During the  period from 2005 through 2009, TVA averaged about $17 million per year  in spending on energy efficiency programs, or about 0.18 percent of its  revenues, as shown in figure 8. The southeastern utilities we reviewed in  our regional sample spent an average of 0.21 percent of revenues on  energy efficiency programs during the same period. In contrast, as  illustrated in figure 8, the five leading national utilities we identified spent  an average of 2.5 percent of revenues on energy efficiency programs,  about 14 times as much as TVA.", "Studies by industry experts have indicated that the South Census region  has the greatest potential for energy efficiency savings of any in the  country. Furthermore, a TVA official told us that the lack of investment  in energy efficiency programs in TVA\u2019s past means that there is a larg e  reservoir of attainable energy efficiency savings to be had in the future.  For example, TVA has done relatively little to target lighting efficiency, an  area in which some utilities have achieved as much as one-third of their  total efficiency savings.", "As a result of its smaller investments, TVA has realized less energy  savings from energy efficiency programs than the savings achieved by  leading utilities we examined. Energy that is saved through energy  efficiency programs reduces the amount of electricity that a utility must  generate itself or purchase from others. There are various ways to  measure and compare energy savings from energy efficiency programs,  but, according to industry experts, the most accepted way is to measure  savings in a given year based on efforts implemented during that year,  referred to as annual incremental savings. While TVA officials told us  that TVA has not established a goal for incremental energy savings, an  energy efficiency expert we contacted said that TVA\u2019s goal of 3.5 percent  cumulative energy savings in 2015 could translate into 1 percent  incremental savings in that year. As shown in figure 9, from 2005 through  2009, the incremental energy savings of TVA\u2019s energy efficiency  programs averaged 0.06 percent of retail energy sales. As illustrated in  figure 9, the sample of southeastern utilities we reviewed averaged about  0.02 percent, whereas leading national utilities we reviewed averaged 1.4  percent over this period, about 23 times as much as TVA.", "Several factors constrain TVA\u2019s energy efficiency efforts. Especially  significant is that, as of 2010, TVA\u2019s planning process constrained the  consideration of energy efficiency.", "Several elements of the process TVA used to establish its 2010 power  supply plan may have favored construction of new generating capacity  over energy efficiency. First, according to TVA officials, TVA did not use  its planning model to help identify the most cost-effective levels of energy  efficiency. Rather, the officials told us that they chose the energy  efficiency level based on what they judged was achievable at an  \u201cattractive\u201d cost, and then TVA developed the remainder of its plan  around these predetermined levels by letting its planning model identify  the most cost-effective levels of nuclear, natural gas, power purchases,  and other resources. Because of the predetermined levels, the model  was not allowed to select from different levels of energy efficiency. As a  result, TVA does not know whether the model would have identified other  potentially more cost-effective levels of energy efficiency resources. This  may be particularly problematic because TVA data indicate that it  generally costs less to save a unit of electric power through energy  efficiency programs than it does to generate a unit of electricity from a  newly-built nuclear or natural gas-fired plant.", "A second element that may favor new generating capacity is that TVA\u2019s  assumptions regarding contributions from energy efficiency programs  may have been too conservative in the long run. TVA\u2019s 2010 power  supply plan shows leveling off of energy efficiency program contributions,  especially after 2020 (see fig. 10). According to TVA officials, this leveling  off is due to the assumption that energy efficiency technology will remain  at existing levels and that there are finite opportunities for energy savings  among TVA\u2019s customer base. However, TVA\u2019s assumption that energy  efficiency technology will remain at existing levels is contrary to the  historic trend of improvements in energy efficiency in the United States,  as well as to future projections. For example, a study of Organization for  Economic Co-operation and Development member countries indicates  that overall improvement in energy efficiency in the United States  averaged 1.5 percent annually between 1990 and 2006 and that it was  driven by technological change. Experts expect technological advances to  continue providing opportunities for energy efficiency gains into the future.  For instance, advancements in the energy efficiency of windows and air  conditioners allow home-owners to reduce their electricity usage. TVA  officials said that they will review their assumptions affecting the potential  impact of energy efficiency programs in future planning, as well as the  results of the study TVA commissioned on the energy efficiency potential  for TVA\u2019s service area, which is expected to be completed in October  2011.", "A third element is TVA\u2019s method of accounting for the cost of energy  efficiency programs, which may introduce bias against energy efficiency.  TVA assigned the costs of energy efficiency programs to the years in  which the investments are made, instead of spreading these costs over  the years during which energy savings are realized. This practice  assumes that the majority of energy efficiency program costs must be  recovered from ratepayers during the early years of a program\u2019s useful  lifetime. While this treatment of energy efficiency programs is not unique  to TVA, it may make energy efficiency appear less desirable than it would  if costs were spread out over the projects\u2019 useful lives, according to  electric utility planning experts and a Lawrence Berkeley National  Laboratory study.", "TVA is not subject to certain significant mandates and incentives that  other utilities have to encourage energy efficiency. For example, TVA  lacks mandates to treat energy efficiency as a top-priority resource, and it  has chosen not to prioritize energy efficiency over other cost-effective  resources. In addition, some utilities are subject to an Energy Efficiency  Resource Standard, which requires a minimum level of energy efficiency  savings, and some states have established energy efficiency savings  goals for utilities and provided financial incentives to these utilities based  on the percentage of savings achieved. Additional examples of mandates  and incentives and other policies that encourage energy efficiency are  shown in appendix III.", "According to TVA officials, other factors challenge TVA\u2019s ability to achieve  its energy efficiency plans. Specifically:  \uf0b7  Numerous diverse distributors. TVA\u2019s distributors purchase power  from TVA and sell it to retail customers. According to TVA officials,  because distributors\u2019 abilities to implement energy efficiency programs  can vary widely and each one has a unique customer base, in many  cases energy efficiency programs must be tailored accordingly. To  address this challenge, TVA officials said that TVA must provide a  range of program options across all end-use customer classes and  allow for delivery by the distributor directly or by TVA staff and its  contract program administrators.  \uf0b7  Relatively low electricity rates. TVA has concerns that energy  efficiency programs could make it more difficult to keep rates as low  as feasible, as the TVA Act requires. TVA officials stated that energy  efficiency efforts will likely raise rates by less than 1 percent, but some  industry experts said that rate increase can be offset because a  consumer\u2019s overall electricity bill may be lower as total energy use  decreases.  \uf0b7  Rate structure. Before April 2011, TVA\u2019s distributor customers were  charged the same electricity rate regardless of the time of day or  season, so customers did not receive strong price signals that  encouraged them to save energy.53, 54 According to TVA officials,  beginning in April 2011, TVA started charging rates that vary by  season and depending on the time of the day for peak and off-peak  periods. TVA officials said that this could reduce distributor revenue  but also reduce growth in peak electricity demand, allowing TVA to  avoid or delay the construction of costly new generation and peak  power purchases from the market.  \uf0b7  Economic downturn. Significant technological improvements are  needed to support an energy efficiency infrastructure and achieve  TVA\u2019s stated energy efficiency goals, according to TVA officials. For  example, such improvements are most easily installed during  construction of new buildings, but poor economic conditions have  slowed new home construction, reducing opportunities for market  penetration by energy-efficient technologies.  \uf0b7  Measurement and verification of savings. TVA, like many utilities,  faces challenges measuring and verifying savings achieved through  energy efficiency. According to TVA officials, to address this challenge  TVA has contracted with a third party to provide a framework for  measurement and verification.", "TVA\u2019s end-use wholesale rate combines fixed and variable costs into one energy  charge, effectively removing demand charges and any incentive to reduce demand during  peak periods. Thus, if there is an increase in electricity demand, there is no change in the  price per kilowatt-hour at any time during the day.", "TVA\u2019s distributors are not-for-profit and must receive enough revenue from electricity  sales to cover fixed costs necessary to provide reliable electrical distribution. TVA\u2019s  distributors have raised concerns that energy efficiency programs could reduce their  revenues. TVA, its distributors, and the Tennessee Valley Public Power Association\u2014an  advocacy group serving more than 100 municipal electric systems and 50 electric  cooperatives in TVA\u2019s service area\u2014recently agreed on a time-of-use rate structure  intended to mitigate concerns about the impacts of increased rates, as well as give  distributors greater opportunities to manage their system during peak periods, for example  by promoting energy efficiency. participation, this could allow TVA to adopt energy efficiency measures  and increase rates more quickly and aggressively, if it were to decide this  is desirable."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "TVA\u2019s Financial Condition May Hamper Its Ability to Fund Capital Improvements", "paragraphs": ["TVA\u2019s financial condition may hamper its ability to fund planned capital  improvements over the next several years.

As part  of the settlement, TVA plans to invest $350 million on projects to reduce  pollution, save energy, and protect public health and the environment.  While TVA plans to spend $471 million in ash remediation capital costs  through 2013, total remediation costs are estimated to range from $1.5  billion to $2 billion over the next 10 years.", "According to senior TVA officials, including TVA\u2019s Senior Vice President  and Treasurer, TVA recognizes the need to manage the funding for its  planned capital investments, or expenditures; however, TVA does not  have a formal capital expenditure management plan.

Office of Management and Budget guidance identifies several potential  problems that could occur when an agency has no formal capital  expenditure management plan, including poor planning, acquisition of  assets not fully justified, higher acquisition costs, cancellation of major  investments, the loss of sunk costs (i.e., prior costs that cannot be  recovered), and inadequate funding to maintain and operate the assets.  Therefore, the lack of an effective plan may impede TVA\u2019s long-range  financial planning.", "TVA and other utilities have historically experienced significant delays or  cost overruns with nuclear plant construction projects, and could  potentially face similar issues in the future. During the 1990s, TVA\u2019s  nuclear plant construction projects experienced significant construction  delays and cost overruns. For example, as we reported in August 1995,  between 1990 and 1994, the construction costs of TVA\u2019s Watts Bar Unit  One and Browns Ferry Unit Three increased by a total of about $2.74  billion, about 45 percent of their combined cost, and the scheduled  completion dates slipped by more than 3 years. Other electric utilities  have experienced similar issues. For example, in 2007, Progress Energy  announced the construction of two proposed nuclear power units in Levy  County, Florida, which were initially estimated to cost $17.2 billion;  however, in April 2010, Progress Energy revised the cost estimate to  more than $22 billion, an increase of almost 28 percent. In September  2011, TVA officials clarified that in August 2011 TVA\u2019s Board decided that  the agency would complete Bellefonte Unit One at an estimated cost of  $4.9 billion in the time frame ranging from 2018 through 2020.  Furthermore, TVA is still studying the feasibility of Bellefonte Unit Two  completion and is unsure about the associated cost.60, 61 Given historical  trends in nuclear construction, TVA faces risks that its estimated  construction costs could increase. Leading credit-rating agencies in the  United States, such as Moody\u2019s and Standard and Poor\u2019s, cite  construction delays, cost overruns, shortages in engineering and  construction workers, and environmental and security uncertainties as  obstacles facing the industry in implementing and financing such projects.", "Previously, according to TVA officials and information from TVA\u2019s 2010 power supply  plan, TVA had planned to finish construction on two additional units\u2014Bellefonte Unit One  in 2018 and Unit Two in 2021\u2014at a total cost of $8.3 billion.", "Although TVA\u2019s power supply plan includes estimates of the potential costs of various  capacity expansion projects, it does not examine other planned capital expenditures, such  as transmission or environmental projects.

For example, during fiscal years 2011 through 2013,  TVA plans to issue new debt to finish the construction of two nuclear  power plants, as well as to upgrade three existing natural gas-fired plants  to extend their operational asset life. TVA officials stated that TVA\u2019s  statutory debt levels will remain within the $30 billion limit on bonds and  notes as long as that remains the legal limit.", "If the $28 billion planning threshold were to be exceeded, TVA\u2019s senior  officials said they would immediately begin to examine various options for  modifying the debt structure and adjusting TVA\u2019s capital investments. For  example, TVA plans to reduce its current existing debt and other  obligations and issue new debt as needed. TVA is also working to  balance the amount of its debt that matures in any given year, spreading  maturities over time in order to reduce exposure to interest rate volatility.  In addition, since interest rates are at historic lows, TVA, as of September  30, 2010, had 100 percent of its outstanding long-term debt in fixed-rate  securities. TVA has modified its debt structure and has sought opportune  times to refinance debt, in some cases doing so before the due dates at  advantageous rates. As a result, TVA maintains a relatively low cost of  capital. For example, TVA\u2019s financing expense as a percentage of  revenue decreased from approximately 25.7 percent in fiscal year 2000 to  11.3 percent in fiscal year 2009.", "Adjusted for inflation, TVA\u2019s operating expenses have increased from  about $8.7 billion in fiscal year 2005 to about $10 billion in fiscal year  2010\u2014an increase of about 15 percent.

TVA  officials said they expected operating expenses will continue to rise,  which would affect the amount of net income that TVA could use for  investing in planned new facilities. In 2011, TVA officials estimated that  nonfuel operating and maintenance costs would increase over the next 10  years\u2014from about $3.3 billion in fiscal year 2011, adjusted for inflation, to  about $3.9 billion in fiscal year 2021, adjusted for inflation\u2014an increase of  more than 19 percent. These officials said that they expect that fuel  costs and interest payments will also rise, although they said that the  amount of the increase is difficult to estimate or predict. If TVA starts  operating new facilities as planned, this would also increase maintenance  costs.", "TVA\u2019s gross revenues come primarily from the sale of electricity and are  used to fund TVA\u2019s annual operating expenses, including fuel and  purchased power, operating and maintenance costs, interest, and other  costs.

TVA can use its net  income to fund a variety of financial needs, such as paying down its debt  or covering unexpected costs. It could also use net income, along with  new debt, to help fund future capital investments. Although TVA\u2019s net  income increased from $96 million, adjusted for inflation, in fiscal year  2005 to $982 million, adjusted for inflation, in fiscal year 2010, TVA did  not significantly reduce its debt during this period.

Our  analysis of forecasts in TVA\u2019s 2010 power supply plan showed that TVA  expects the demand will continue to increase over the next decade due to  a number of factors, including increases in the population and levels of  employment throughout the region. However, future revenues will also be  affected by weather, the economy, and other factors. For example, the  economic downturn in fiscal year 2009 resulted in a decrease in the  demand for power, and TVA experienced a 6.7 percent decrease in  electricity sold in fiscal year 2009 compared to the prior year.", "A coal ash spill at TVA\u2019s Kingston power plant in 2008 also created  significant additional operating expenses. The collapse of a retaining wall  released more than 1.2 billion gallons of water and coal ash, covering  approximately 300 acres of adjoining property. TVA is conducting cleanup  and recovery efforts in conjunction with federal and state agencies and  estimates the work will be completed by the fourth quarter of fiscal year  2014. TVA estimates the total cost of the cleanup will be between $1.1  billion and $1.2 billion. However, actual amounts could exceed expected  costs if, among other things, TVA has to remove more ash than currently  anticipated, there are delays in the ash removal process, or the methods  of final remediation change. Consistent with its financial guiding  principles, TVA has deferred the cost of the Kingston power plant cleanup  as a regulatory asset, and plans to amortize such costs into operating  expenses over a 15-year period, which it began to do in 2010.", "TVA may also face additional operating expenses in the form of fines,  penalties, and regulatory actions stemming from the Kingston ash spill.  On June 14, 2010, the Tennessee Department of Environment and  Conservation fined TVA approximately $12 million for the spill, citing  violations of the Tennessee Solid Waste Disposal Act and the Tennessee  Water Quality Control Act. TVA has not included certain additional costs  in its estimates of the cleanup and recovery efforts, since it has  determined that the costs are not probable or reasonably estimable.  Specifically, it has not included other penalties, regulatory directives,  natural resources damages, outcomes of lawsuits, future claims, long- term environmental impact costs, final long-term disposition of the ash  processing area, costs associated with new laws and regulations, or costs  of remediating any mixed waste discovered during ash removal process.

TVA  faces difficult decisions as it plans for these investments and other  significant expenses related to environmental cleanup or protection. As of  September 30, 2010, TVA\u2019s statutory debt was $23.6 billion, and it plans to  spend about $10 billion through fiscal year 2013 for capital expenditures  related to new and upgraded nuclear, fossil fuel, and hydropower plants.  Moreover, pursuant to a settlement with EPA, TVA agreed to invest an  additional $3 billion to $5 billion in the next 10 years on pollution control  devices on existing power plants. Collectively, these expenditures could  cause TVA to exceed its statutory debt limit. TVA\u2019s options for addressing  its financial challenges include (1) raising rates to increase gross revenue,  (2) reducing operating expenditures, (3) delaying some capital investments,  and (4) modifying its debt structure. TVA\u2019s debt structure can be modified  by refinancing its debt, developing additional alternative financing  arrangements, or requesting an increase in its debt ceiling. Each of these  options involves trade-offs that complicate the agency\u2019s financial decision  making. For example, TVA could raise its rates, and with the additional  revenue generated, reduce its borrowing or pay down some of its existing  debt. However, the TVA Act also mandates that TVA keep rates as low as  feasible, and raising rates could affect the Tennessee Valley economy.", "Despite the many financial decisions it faces, TVA does not have a formal  capital expenditure management plan that lays out how it will fund the  significant capital investments it expects to make during the next 3 years.  Such a plan is important to help identify the assets in which TVA plans to  invest, the full costs of the assets, and the sources of funding for  acquiring those assets to ensure that adequate funding exists to maintain  and operate the assets. Without such a plan, TVA faces increased risk  that its planned capital investments are not sufficiently justified or that the  acquisition costs of these capital investments will rise, potentially leading  to the cancellation or delays of major investments and the loss of sunk  costs. Further, in the absence of a capital expenditure management plan,  TVA may also face challenges in achieving the full range of the Board\u2019s  stated objectives, including its commitment to be a \u201cnational leader in  technological innovation, low cost power and environmental stewardship.\u201d"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["Consistent with TVA\u2019s goals, objectives and policies, including TVA being  a national leader in technological innovation, low-cost power, and  environmental stewardship, and to better ensure that TVA has the  financial resources to accomplish the Board\u2019s broader objectives, we  recommend that TVA\u2019s Board:  \uf0b7  use information on the energy efficiency potential of TVA\u2019s service  area from its commissioned study to better ensure that TVA\u2019s future  resource planning process reflects the most cost-effective mix of  resources to meet the demand for electricity, and  \uf0b7  develop a written capital expenditure plan that includes the full costs  of the assets in which TVA plans to invest and the sources of funding  for acquiring those assets."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["TVA provided oral technical comments to our draft, and we incorporated  them as appropriate. In its written comments, TVA agreed with our first  recommendation, and while TVA did not expressly agree with our second  recommendation, it noted the importance of utility companies having a  written capital expenditure plan. TVA further stated that it is working to  refine and improve its long-term planning processes and intends to more  formally integrate them. We encourage TVA\u2019s efforts in this regard.  However, TVA\u2019s current planning processes do not address how its  planned capital investments will be funded. For example, TVA\u2019s vision  establishes broad agency priorities and goals and provides a structure for  TVA\u2019s budget cycle and capital expenditures, but the vision does not  address how these items will be funded. As we stated in the draft report,  several potential problems can occur when an agency does not describe  how capital expenditures will be funded, including poor planning,  acquisition of assets that have not been fully justified, higher acquisition  costs, cancellation of major investments, and inadequate funding to  maintain and operate the assets. TVA also remained silent on a critical  component of our second recommendation, which is to describe the  manner in which TVA will fund future investments, notably its planned  $9.9 billion in capital investments by the end of fiscal year 2013. As we  stated in our draft report, TVA\u2019s planned capital investments and financial  flexibility may be constrained by increased operating costs, existing debt  levels, and unexpected cost overruns.", "In its comments, TVA also noted its need for financial flexibility in the  funding of long-term assets. We acknowledge this need but believe that a  more detailed blueprint for the funding of planned capital expenditures,  including information on how TVA expects to manage its expenditures,  would better assist TVA in prudently making its capital investments and in  achieving greater financial flexibility and responsibility in the long-term.  Accordingly, we reiterate the importance of a formal capital expenditure  plan that not only identifies the assets that TVA intends to acquire or  develop, but includes the full costs of the assets in which TVA plans to  invest and the sources of funding for acquiring those assets.", "As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution of this report until 30  days from the report date.

As part of this analysis, we  identified key variables related to TVA\u2019s demand forecasts and its plans  to supply electricity. We also gathered information about alternative  supply resources that can affect the amount of power TVA would need to  generate from its own capacity, including TVA\u2019s plans to purchase power  and invest in energy efficiency and demand response programs.  Additionally, we interviewed TVA officials familiar with the agency\u2019s  resource planning process.", "We collected annual data from TVA on key demand forecasts and supply  plans used to develop its long-term plans. With respect to demand for  electricity, we looked at TVA\u2019s forecasts of its peak load and electricity sales.  We also examined several factors influencing the demand for electricity,  including forecasts of population, per capita income, and employment for  TVA\u2019s service region. With respect to supply for electricity, we reviewed  TVA\u2019s plans to expand its generating capacity and generate electricity.", "We compared TVA\u2019s forecasts and plans for these key variables to  relevant forecasts and plans from other sources, such as the Department  of Energy\u2019s Energy Information Administration (EIA), IHS Global Insight,  and a group of investor-owned electric utilities. The purpose of these  comparisons was to determine whether TVA\u2019s forecasts were markedly  different in any key areas.", "In our comparisons, we focused on annual forecasts and plans for  geographical regions similar to TVA\u2019s service region. We examined EIA\u2019s  forecasts related to electricity demand and supply for the East South  Central census region and for the Southeastern Electric Reliability  Council (SERC) Region. From IHS Global Insight we focused on  forecasts for the East South Central census region. We also examined  forecasts and plans for five electric utilities from either the SERC Region  or the southeastern United States, as the following describes.", "We selected a nonprobability sample of five utilities based on their  similarity to TVA across a variety of dimensions that are relevant to  forecasting, planning, and investment. We selected these regional utilities  through the following steps:  1.  We compiled a list of 13 large, investor-owned utilities in the SERC  Region or in the southeastern United States that did not have a legal  prohibition against nuclear generation. These utilities were: Alabama  Power, Duke Carolinas, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana,  Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Florida Power & Light,  Georgia Power, Progress Carolinas, Progress Florida, South Carolina  Electric & Gas, Union Electric, and Virginia Dominion Power.  2.  We scored each utility based on its similarity to TVA on each of the  capacity (a number was calculated to represent how close each  utility\u2019s generating capacity was to that of TVA),  \uf0b7  average age of coal plants (a number was calculated to represent  how similar the average age of each utility\u2019s coal plants was to  that of TVA),  \uf0b7  proportion of energy derived from coal (a number was calculated  to represent how close each utility was to TVA in its proportion of  energy derived from coal),  \uf0b7  proportion of energy derived from natural gas (a number was  calculated to represent how close each utility was to TVA in its  proportion of energy derived from natural gas),  \uf0b7  proportion of energy derived from nuclear power (a number was  calculated to represent how close each utility was to TVA in its  proportion of energy derived from nuclear power),  \uf0b7  proportion of energy sold to industrial customers (a number was  calculated to represent how close each utility was to TVA in its  proportion of energy sold to industrial customers), and  financial similarity (for each utility, we calculated the ratio of its  debt and equity to its revenues and then calculated a number to  represent the closeness of this ratio to an analogous ratio for  TVA).  3.  We combined these scores to yield an overall measure of each  utility\u2019s similarity to TVA. For each utility, this overall measure of  similarity was calculated as a weighted average of its scores on the  several dimensions described in step 2. We chose the weights based  on our judgment of the relative importance of each dimension to a  utility\u2019s forecasting, planning, and investment.  4.  The utilities were ranked according to their overall similarity to TVA.  5.  In order to check that the ranks were not heavily dependent on the  weights we chose in step 3, steps 3 and 4 were repeated using four  different distributions of weight over the seven dimensions. These four  different weighting schemes were designed to cover a reasonable  range of ways in which the dimensions (capacity, average age of coal  plants, etc.) might be important to forecasting, planning, and  investment. All four weightings yielded the same top-six-ranked  utilities with the exception that one of the weightings differed from the  others in which utilities were ranked 5 and 6.", "The five utilities with highest similarity to TVA were selected, except that  one utility, Alabama Power, was skipped to ensure that the final sample  not include two utilities from the same parent company (Georgia Power,  also owned by the Southern Company, had already been selected due to  its higher similarity to TVA). The final selection of utilities was Duke  Carolinas, Progress Carolinas, Virginia Dominion Power, Union Electric,  and Entergy Arkansas. The TVA Inspector General has also considered  these five utilities as comparable to TVA in terms of capacity and location  for benchmarking purposes.", "To gather information for the comparisons with TVA, we distributed a  questionnaire to each of the five utilities asking for historical and forecast  information on peak load; electricity sales; generation and generation  capacity, including renewable sources; demand and supply \u201cdrivers\u201d  (such as population, regional income, fuel prices, and capacity  construction costs); energy efficiency and demand response programs;  and related regulatory issues. We asked for such data on an annual  basis. This questionnaire was pretested to ensure that questions were  clear and answerable, by means of an extended interview with officials at  one of our selected utilities. The remaining four utilities received the  questionnaire only after it had been pretested and revised. We then  conducted follow-up interviews with the appropriate resource planning  officials at these utilities, as necessary, to clarify the information and to  ensure consistency of the data and information collected.", "To compare the information we collected from other sources to TVA\u2019s  long-term forecasts and plans, we computed the annual growth rate for  each data series describing a forecast or set of plans. We used two  methods to compute the growth rates, and they yielded similar results.  The first method estimates the annual growth rate from a least squares  regression of the natural logarithm of the data series on a constant and a  time trend. The second method calculates the compound annual growth  rate. The results for each method are summarized in appendix II.", "In some cases, we adjusted the data before computing the growth rates  to improve the comparisons. For example, we received fiscal year data on  forecasts of electricity sales and plans for electricity generation from TVA,  and we received calendar year data on similar forecasts from other  sources. To avoid comparing fiscal year data from TVA to calendar year  data from other sources, we interpolated calendar year values for TVA  based on the span of its fiscal year, from October 1 of one calendar year  to September 30 of the next calendar year. To compare real income  growth on a per capita basis, we used data on real income and population  to compute real income per person.", "We compared TVA\u2019s past performance to future projections, other  utilities, the opinions of industry experts, and data provided by  knowledgeable third-party sources to determine the extent, if at all, to  which TVA\u2019s forecasts and selection of values for key assumptions  deviated from what may be expected.", "To address our second objective, we reviewed TVA\u2019s most recent power  supply plan as well as historical data from EIA. We also reviewed TVA\u2019s  interim and final strategic planning documents, which provide information  on TVA\u2019s energy efficiency and renewable energy resources, planning  methods, policies, and goals. We interviewed TVA officials and reviewed  documents associated with TVA\u2019s load forecasts and resource plans to (1)  evaluate TVA\u2019s assumptions and goals associated with its use of energy  efficiency, renewable energy, and power purchases, and (2) determine the  extent to which these resources are included in TVA\u2019s power supply plan.", "We also compared TVA\u2019s energy efficiency and renewable energy  programs and efforts to those of 11 other utilities. These included the five  regional utilities that were chosen in the first objective, as well as a sixth  regional utility, Georgia Power, because it also had sufficient data for  comparisons. In addition, we selected five national utilities because they  were identified by industry sources and TVA as leaders in energy  efficiency or renewable energy, and because they were in the top 2  percent of utilities nationwide in total energy saved from energy efficiency  and total spending on energy efficiency programs. Including these  national utilities allowed us to examine differences between TVA\u2019s  programs and some of the highest-performing energy efficiency and  renewable energy programs in the country. We also informed our  selections through discussions with officials from nongovernmental  energy efficiency and renewable energy associations, including the  American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, the Southeast Energy  Efficiency Alliance, and the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy. Through  this process we selected Austin Energy, Connecticut Power and Light,  Southern California Edison, Pacific Gas & Electric Company, and  Northern States Power Company (Xcel Energy\u2013Minnesota).", "We provided a standard questionnaire to the 11 utilities addressing  operations, energy efficiency and renewable energy programs, and  incentives and disincentives relating to such programs. Ten out of the   11 utilities responded to our questionnaire. We conducted follow-up  interviews with utility officials, as necessary, to clarify the responses and  to ensure consistency of the data and information collected in order to  facilitate comparisons with TVA. We also collected data from TVA and  EIA in order to assess and compare energy efficiency and renewable  energy initiatives with those of TVA.", "To examine TVA\u2019s primary incentives or impediments to more energy  efficient or renewable energy practices, we interviewed officials from TVA  and the Tennessee Valley Public Power Association, which represents  TVA\u2019s distributors. In order to determine factors that encourage or  discourage energy efficiency and renewable energy practices, we  reviewed industry studies and interviewed or corresponded with officials  from four public service commissions (California, Connecticut, Maryland,  and Vermont), three energy sector associations (American Council for an  Energy-Efficient Economy, the Southeast Energy Efficiency Alliance, and  the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy), the Northwest Power and  Conservation Council, and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.  We also reviewed state laws and regulations that affect energy efficiency  and renewable energy programs. We then characterized the incentive  structures, regulatory policies, and governance systems associated with  leading energy efficiency and renewable energy programs, and compared  these to TVA\u2019s current policies and plans.", "To address our third objective, we examined TVA\u2019s most recent strategic  planning documents, including its 2007 strategic plan; debt management  policies; and anticipated capital expenditures. We interviewed TVA officials  to discuss the impact of its debt levels on its ability to implement its  missions and goals, including its current debt financing strategy, planned  capital investments, and nuclear decommissioning costs. We obtained and  reviewed readily available audited financial information from the Securities  and Exchange Commission for TVA to determine gross revenues, long- term debt, alternative financing arrangements, operating and maintenance  expenditures, interest expenditures, and environmental costs. We met with  auditors from TVA\u2019s Office of Inspector General and obtained and reviewed  copies of its audit reports on TVA\u2019s financial performance, operations, and  environmental stewardship. We also interviewed representatives of the  Nuclear Regulatory Commission to discuss the status of TVA\u2019s nuclear  decommissioning trust fund. We obtained and reviewed readily available  audited financial information from the Federal Energy Regulatory  Commission for five southeastern utilities to determine long term debt and  equity. We also obtained and examined EIA electricity capacity data for  TVA and the five southeastern utilities. We reviewed reports prepared by  the American Public Power Association, Congressional Budget Office, and  Congressional Research Service, and prior GAO reports related to TVA\u2019s  financial condition to identify significant issues and deficiencies at TVA and  any reportable conditions. We contacted TVA officials at field locations in  Chattanooga and Knoxville, Tennessee, as necessary.", "We conducted this performance audit from November 2009 through  October 2011 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.
