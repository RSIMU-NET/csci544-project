For example, DOD has established an enterprisewide IT investment board responsible for defining and implementing its business system investment governance process, documented policies and procedures for ensuring that systems support ongoing and future business needs, developed procedures for identifying and collecting information about these systems to support investment selection and control, and assigned responsibility to an individual or a group for managing the development and modification of the business system portfolio selection criteria. However, DOD has not fully documented business system investment policies and procedures for directing investment board operations, selecting new investments, reselecting ongoing investments, integrating the investment funding and the investment selection processes, and developing and maintaining a complete business system investment portfolio(s). Regarding project-level investment management practices, DOD officials said that these are performed at the component level, and that departmental policies and procedures established for overseeing components' execution of these practices are sufficient. For portfolio-level practices, however, these officials stated that they intend to improve departmental policies and procedures for business system investments by, for example, establishing a single governance structure, but plans or time frames for doing so have not been established. Until DOD fully defines departmentwide policies and procedures for both individual projects and portfolios of projects, it risks selecting and controlling these business system investments in an inconsistent, incomplete, and ad hoc manner, which in turn reduces the chances that these investments will meet mission needs in the most cost-effective manner."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["For decades, the Department of Defense (DOD) has been challenged in  modernizing its timeworn business systems.

To date, for fiscal year 2007, the department received appropriations of  about $501 billion. Organizationally, the department includes the Office of  the Secretary of Defense (OSD), the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,  the military departments, numerous defense agencies and field activities,  and various unified combatant commands that are responsible for either  specific geographic regions or specific functions.

As we have previously reported, the systems  environment that supports these business functions is overly complex and  error-prone, and is characterized by (1) little standardization across the  department, (2) multiple systems performing the same tasks, (3) the same  data stored in multiple systems, and (4) the need for data to be entered  manually into multiple systems. Moreover, according to DOD, this systems  environment is comprised of approximately 3,100 separate business  systems. For fiscal year 2007, Congress appropriated approximately $15.7  billion to DOD, and for fiscal year 2008, DOD has requested about $15.9  billion in appropriated funds to operate, maintain, and modernize these  business systems and the associated infrastructures.", "As we have previously reported, the department\u2019s nonintegrated and  duplicative systems impair DOD\u2019s ability to combat fraud, waste, and  abuse.

Eight of these areas are specific to DOD,  and the department shares responsibility for 7 other governmentwide high- risk areas. DOD\u2019s business systems modernization is one of the high-risk  areas, and it is an essential enabler to addressing many of the department\u2019s  other high-risk areas.

In response to the Clinger-Cohen  Act and other statutes, OMB has developed policy and issued guidance for  the planning, budgeting, acquisition, and management of federal capital  assets.

It is  not unusual for an organization to perform key practices from more than  one maturity stage at the same time. However, our research shows that  agency efforts to improve investment management capabilities should  focus on implementing all lower-stage practices before addressing higher- stage practices.", "In the ITIM framework, Stage 2 critical processes lay the foundation by  establishing successful, predictable, and repeatable investment control  processes at the project level. At this stage, the emphasis is on establishing  basic capabilities for selecting new IT projects; controlling projects so that  they finish predictably within the established cost, schedule, and  performance expectations; and identifying and mitigating exposure to risk.", "Stage 3 is where the agency moves from project-centric processes to  portfolio-based processes and evaluates potential investments according  to how well they support the agency\u2019s missions, strategies, and goals.

It also focuses on maintaining  mature, integrated selection (and reselection); control; and  postimplementation evaluation processes. This portfolio perspective  allows decision makers to consider the interaction among investments and  the contributions to organizational mission goals and strategies that could  be made by alternative portfolio selections, rather than to focus  exclusively on the balance between the costs and benefits of individual  investments.

As recently reported, the components start programming and  budgeting for addressing a JCIDS-identified capability gap or mission need  several years before actual product development under DAS begins, and  before OSD formally reviews the components\u2019 programming and  budgeting proposals (i.e., Program Objective Memorandums). Once  reviewed and approved, the financial details in the Program Objective  Memorandums become part of the President\u2019s budget request to Congress.

These five phases are  as follows: 1.  Concept Refinement: Intended to refine the initial JCIDS-validated  system solution (concept) and create a strategy for acquiring the  investment solution. A decision is made at the end of this phase  (milestone A decision) regarding whether to move to the next phase  (Technology Development).  2.  Technology Development: Intended to determine the appropriate set of  technologies to be integrated into the investment solution by  iteratively assessing the viability of various technologies while  simultaneously refining user requirements. Once the technology has  been demonstrated in a relevant environment, a decision is made at  the end of this phase (milestone B decision) regarding whether to  move to the next phase (System Development and Demonstration).  3.  System Development and Demonstration: Intended to develop a  system or a system increment and demonstrate through developer  testing that the system/system increment can function in its target  environment. A decision is made at the end of this phase (milestone C  decision) regarding whether to move to the next phase (Production  and Deployment).  4.

Specifically, DOD does not have  policies and procedures for defining the portfolio criteria or for creating  and evaluating the portfolio. In addition, while DOD has policies and  procedures for conducting postimplementation reviews as part of DAS,  these reviews do not address systems at all tier levels.

This means that DOD lacks an institutional capability  to ensure that it is investing in business systems that best support its  strategic needs, and that ongoing projects meet cost, schedule, and  performance expectations. Until DOD develops this capability, the  department will be impaired in its ability to optimize business mission area  performance and accountability."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To strengthen DOD\u2019s business system investment management capability  and address the weaknesses discussed in this report, we recommend that  the Secretary of Defense direct the Deputy Secretary of Defense, as the  chair of the DBSMC, to ensure that well-defined and disciplined business  system investment management policies and procedures are developed  and issued. At a minimum, this should include project-level management  policies and procedures that address the following five areas:  instituting the investment boards, including assigning the investment  boards responsibility, authority, and accountability for programs  throughout the investment life cycle and specifying how the business  investment management system is coordinated with JCIDS, PPBE, and  DAS;   selecting new investments, including specifying how cost, schedule, and  benefit data are to be used in making certification decisions; defining the  criteria used to select investments as enterprisewide; and establishing  consistent and effective guidance for BEA compliance;  reselecting ongoing investments, including specifying how cost, schedule,  and performance data are to be used in the annual review process and  providing for the reselection of investments that are in operations and  maintenance;   integrating funding with the process of selecting an investment, including  specifying how the DBSMC and the IRBs use funding information in  carrying out decisions on system certification and approvals; and    overseeing IT projects and systems, including providing sufficient  oversight and visibility into component-level investment management  activities.", "These well-defined and disciplined business system investment  management policies and procedures should also include portfolio-level  management policies and procedures that address the following four  areas:    creating and modifying IT portfolio selection criteria for business system    analyzing, selecting, and maintaining business system investment  reviewing, evaluating, and improving the performance of its portfolio(s) by  using project indicators, such as cost, schedule, and risk; and   conducting postimplementation reviews for all investment tiers and  directing the investment boards, which are accountable for corporate  business system investments, to consider the information gathered and to  develop lessons learned from these reviews."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In written comments on a draft of this report, signed by the Deputy Under  Secretary of Defense (Business Transformation) and reprinted in appendix  II, the department stated that it agreed with the report\u2019s overall  conclusions, and it described efforts under way and planned that it said  would address many of the gaps identified in the report. In this regard, the  department partially concurred with five of the report\u2019s recommendations,  adding that our recommendations and feedback are helpful in guiding  DOD\u2019s business transformation and related improvement efforts.  Nevertheless, the department disagreed with the remaining four  recommendations on the grounds that their intent had already been met  through DOD\u2019s existing business system investment management  structure and processes, or that they contradicted the tiered accountability  concept embedded in this structure and processes. The department\u2019s  comments relative to each of our project-level and portfolio-level  recommendations, along with our responses to its comments, are provided  below.", "With respect to our five project-level recommendations, the department  stated that it partially agreed with two and disagreed with three.", "DOD partially agreed with our recommendation to define and implement  policies and procedures that assign the investment boards responsibility  for programs throughout the investment life cycle and specify how the  business investment management system is coordinated with JCIDS,  PPBE, and DAS. In particular, it stated that under its tiered accountability  approach to business systems investment management, the components  are currently required to review all programs throughout their investment  life cycles. We do not question this requirement, and we recognize it in our  report. However, consistent with our ITIM framework, the corporate  investment boards should continue to review investments that meet the  defined threshold criteria throughout their life cycles (i.e., when they are  in operations and maintenance). In contrast, DOD\u2019s corporate boards  focus only on those investments that are in the  development/modernization stage. The department also stated that a  linkage is currently depicted in existing guidance among its investment  selection, acquisition, and funding processes. While we do not question  that this guidance contains an illustration depicting such a link, neither  this guidance nor supporting procedures define how this linkage is  executed (e.g., how investment funding decisions are in fact integrated  with investment selection decisions). DOD\u2019s comments appear to  acknowledge this point by stating that the department has begun to define  and implement a Business Capability Lifecycle concept, which is intended  to integrate the investment selection and acquisition management  processes for Tier 1 and enterprise systems into a single oversight process  that leverages the existing IRB and DBSMC oversight framework.", "DOD partially agreed with our recommendation to define and implement  policies and procedures that specify how cost, schedule, and benefit data  are to be used in making certification and annual review decisions; define  the criteria used to select investments as enterprisewide; and establish  consistent and effective guidance for BEA compliance. In particular, the  department agreed that additional criteria are required for selecting  enterprisewide investments, noting that initial criteria have been defined  and will be incorporated in the investment management process. However,  the department did not agree that cost, schedule, and BEA compliance  information are not sufficiently used for certification and annual review  decisions, adding that such information is required in its current policies.  We do not agree. Specifically, while we do not question whether  investment data are provided to the DBSMC and the IRBs, the  department\u2019s policies and procedures do not include specific decision  criteria that explain how these data are to be used to make consistent,  repeatable selection and reselection decisions across all investments. In  addition, while BEA compliance policies have been developed and are  being used, the guidance is not fully defined. For example, the guidance  allows programs to defer demonstrating full compliance with important  BEA artifacts until the final phases of the acquisition process, at which  time addressing instances of noncompliance would be more expensive and  difficult. Furthermore, the compliance criteria are not consistently  described in different guidance documentation. As a result, DOD risks  beginning system production and deployment before ensuring that a  system is sufficiently aligned to the BEA.", "DOD did not agree with our recommendation to define and implement  policies and procedures that provide for the reselection of investments  that are in operations and maintenance. According to DOD, components  are required by policy to annually review all business systems, including  investments for which there is no planned development or modernization  spending. We agree that the annual review process does require this.  However, consistent with our ITIM framework, the corporate investment  boards should continue to reselect investments that meet the defined  threshold criteria throughout their life cycles (i.e., when they are in  operations and maintenance). In contrast, DOD\u2019s corporate boards focus  only on reselecting those investments that are in the  development/modernization stage.", "DOD did not agree with our recommendation to define and implement  policies and procedures that specify how the corporate boards use funding  information in carrying out decisions on system certification and  approvals. In this regard, it stated that such information is required in its  current policies and considered during board deliberations. We do not  agree. Our recommendation does not address whether existing policies or  guidance provide for the collection of this information; our  recommendation addresses the definition of policy, guidance, and  supporting procedures that fall short of satisfying the best practices  embodied in our ITIM framework. Specifically, while we do not question  whether funding data are provided to investment decision-making bodies,  the department\u2019s policies and procedures do not include specific decision  criteria that explain how these data are to be used to make consistent,  repeatable selection and reselection decisions across all investments.", "DOD did not agree with our recommendation to define and implement  policies and procedures that provide for sufficient oversight and visibility  into component-level investment management activities. In particular, it  stated that this recommendation contradicts the department\u2019s \u201ctiered  accountability\u201d approach to investment management. We do not agree.  Under the department\u2019s current policies and guidance, most DOD  investments are not subject to corporate visibility and oversight, either  because they do not involve development/modernization (i.e., they are in  operations and maintenance) or because they do not exceed a certain  dollar threshold. Our framework recognizes that effective implementation  of a tiered accountability concept should include appropriate corporate  visibility into and oversight of investments, either through review and  approval of those investments that meet certain criteria or through  awareness of a subordinate board\u2019s investment management activities.  Moreover, this visibility and oversight should extend to the entire portfolio  of investments, including those that are in operations and maintenance. To  ensure that this occurs, applicable policies and procedures need to  explicitly cover all such investments and need to define how this is to be  accomplished.", "With respect to our four portfolio-level recommendations, the department  stated that it partially agreed with three and disagreed with one.", "DOD partially agreed with our recommendation to define and implement  policies and procedures for creating and modifying portfolio selection  criteria for business system investments.
