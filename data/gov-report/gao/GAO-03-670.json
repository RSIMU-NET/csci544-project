The threat of terrorism has altered some military operations. For example, as of September 11, 2001, the North American Aerospace Defense Command orders combat air patrols over U.S. cities to prevent terrorist attacks. The 1878 Posse Comitatus Act prohibits the direct use of federal military troops in domestic civilian law enforcement, except where authorized by the Constitution or acts of Congress. Congress has expressly authorized the use of the military in certain situations such as to assist with terrorist incidents involving weapons of mass destruction. DOD has established new organizations (such as U.S. Northern Command) and implemented a campaign plan for domestic military missions, but it has not evaluated or adjusted its force structure. GAO did not assess the adequacy of the new organizations or the campaign plan because the organizations were not yet fully operational, and the campaign plan was only recently completed. DOD's force structure is not well tailored to perform domestic military missions and may not be able to sustain the high pace of operations that preceded and followed the attacks on September 11, 2001. While on domestic military missions, combat units are unable to maintain proficiency because these missions provide less opportunity to practice the varied skills required for combat and consequently offer little training value. In addition, from September 2001 through December 2002, the number of servicemembers exceeding the established personnel tempo thresholds increased substantially, indicating that the present force structure may not be sufficient to address the increase in domestic and overseas military missions.

Table 1 provides more details on  the key differences.", "Military missions involve warfighting functions, such as campaigns,  engagements, or strikes, by one or more of the services\u2019 combat forces.  Operations Desert Storm in 1991 and Iraqi Freedom in 2003 are examples  of overseas military missions, and Operation Noble Eagle is a domestic  military mission started on September 11, 2001, and ongoing today. In the  latter mission, the President directed the Commander, North American  Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), to order combat air patrols to  identify and intercept suspect aircraft operating in the United States.  Because this is a military mission, DOD is the lead federal agency and is  prepared to apply its combat power, if needed.", "Requests for nonmilitary missions generally seek DOD support to help  after the impact of natural or man-made disasters, or assist indirectly with  law enforcement. These requests are evaluated against criteria contained  in DOD\u2019s Directive, Military Assistance to Civil Authorities. DOD\u2019s  directive specifies that requests for nonmilitary support be evaluated  against the following criteria:  legality (compliance with laws),  lethality (potential use of lethal force by or against DOD forces),  risk (safety of DOD forces),    cost (who pays, impact on the DOD budget),    appropriateness (whether it is in the interest of DOD to conduct the  requested mission), and  readiness (impact on DOD\u2019s ability to perform its primary mission).", "According to DOD, in fiscal years 2001 and 2002, it supported over  230 nonmilitary missions, in a variety of settings, such as assisting in  fighting wildfires, recovering from tropical storms, providing support for  national security special events (such as the presidential inauguration and  2002 Olympic Games), and for other purposes. According to DOD, during  this same period, it rejected several missions based on the above criteria.  For example, in November 2001, DOD declined a request from the  U.S. Capitol Police to provide military medical personnel; however, DOD  did not indicate which criteria were used to reach this decision."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Threat of Terrorism Altered Some Military Operations", "paragraphs": ["Since September 11, 2001, the threat of another catastrophic terrorist  event has altered some military operations. Before September 11, 2001,  DOD generally emphasized deterring and defeating adversaries through  overseas power projection, and still does. Since then, DOD has deployed  U.S. forces overseas to prosecute the war on terrorism in Afghanistan and  elsewhere. Moreover, The National Security Strategy of the United States  of America, published after September 11, 2001, emphasizes preventing  terrorist attacks against the United States. The strategy states that the  immediate focus of the United States will be those terrorist groups having  a global reach and any terrorist or nation that sponsors terrorism which  attempts to gain or use weapons of mass destruction. Such threats may  now be subject to a preemptive strike by U.S. military forces if necessary,  to prevent these threats from materializing or reaching the United States.", "Some operations associated with domestic military missions have  also changed to proactively respond to terrorist threats. Prior to  September 11, 2001, DOD\u2019s strategy defended air, land, and sea  approaches to U.S. territory from military adversaries presumed to  originate outside the United States. If necessary, DOD had planned to  deploy U.S. military forces within the United States to counter the military  threats. DOD still plans to do so should these threats emerge in the future.  However, the current defense strategy, published in the 2001 Quadrennial  Defense Review Report, states that the highest priority of the U.S. military  is to defend the homeland from attack by any enemy, which includes  terrorists. An example of how domestic military operations have changed  to meet terrorists\u2019 threats can be seen in NORAD operations. Before  September 11, 2001, NORAD primarily focused its attention on aircraft  approaching U.S. airspace and acted to prevent a hostile aircraft from  entering U.S. airspace. Since then, NORAD has expanded its focus so that  it now also monitors aircraft operating within the United States as well as  aircraft approaching U.S. airspace. Also, before September 11, 2001,  NORAD had planned to order Air Force units to intercept military  adversaries\u2019 bombers. NORAD still plans to do so if these threats emerge  in the future. However, as of September 11, 2001, NORAD also orders  combat air patrols over U.S. cities to prevent terrorist attacks. In another  example, before the attacks of 9-11, many federal installations operated at  a normal force protection condition or routine security posture that  allowed for open access to the installations, in many cases. However, since  then, DOD has used additional military personnel to enhance security by  verifying identification of all personnel and vehicles entering the  installation and conducting patrols of critical infrastructure on the  installation. Also, in April 2002, the President approved a revision to  DOD\u2019s Unified Command Plan, creating the new U.S. Northern Command,  which has responsibility to militarily defend the continental United States  and other nearby areas.

Domestic missions to date generally have required only  basic military skills and thus offered limited training value\u2014which can  have an adverse affect on unit readiness. In our review, we found that four  Army military police combat units guarding federal installations in the  United States could not train for battlefield conditions, as the Army  requires. Similarly, Air Force fighter units performing domestic combat air  patrols were inhibited from executing the full range of difficult, tactical  maneuvers with the frequency that the Air Force requires.

During  Operation Noble Eagle, DOD provided enhanced domestic installation  security and combat air patrols, both of which generally require only basic  military skills but offer little opportunity to practice the varied combat  skills needed for wartime proficiency. As a result, military readiness  may erode. According to Army and Air Force officials, because combat  skills for these units are perishable, to maintain or regain proficiency,  a resumption of normal combat training may be required before  subsequent overseas deployment.", "Army training focuses on combat mission performance that replicates  battlefield conditions. To acquire the skills necessary for combat, each  unit commander establishes a mission essential task list consisting of  critical tasks that the unit needs to be proficient on to perform its overseas  wartime mission. However, the four military police units that we reviewed  were often unable to train and, thus, they were unable to maintain  proficiency for their required mission essential tasks due to the long  Operation Noble Eagle deployments. For example, one unit could not  practice for two of its mission essential tasks\u2014to establish and sustain an  internment and resettlement facility, and process and account for  internees\u2014that it performs in combat. In another example, two military  police units could not practice their combat skills, which include providing  battlefield control of roads and logistical pipelines. Instead, the four Army  military police units from the active, reserve, and National Guard we  reviewed were generally guarding gates, checking identification,  inspecting vehicles, and conducting security patrols of critical installation  infrastructure, such as command and control centers, and housing,  shopping, and recreation areas.", "Moreover, we found that some Army servicemembers on Operation  Noble Eagle deployments used skills unrelated to their normal missions.  Consequently, their units\u2019 combat proficiency may be at risk. Specifically,  the Army provided over 8,100 Army National Guard personnel from about  100 units to provide installation security at domestic Air Force bases.  However, only one unit, a military police unit, had primary skills relevant  to the mission; the remaining units were comprised of field artillery,  engineer, and infantry personnel that have specialized combat skills such  as providing fire support to tactical combat units; rehabilitating the  combat zone to enhance lines of supply and communication; and  destroying or capturing the enemy or repelling enemy assaults by fire.  None of these units needed its combat skills on its Operation Noble Eagle  missions.", "Similarly, the domestic combat air patrol mission represents another  instance where servicemembers cannot always practice their primary  combat training for proficiency. To maintain their warfighting skills,  fighter pilots perform training sorties when not deployed abroad. Training  sorties involve the employment of tactical maneuvers, and the use of  weapons or weapons simulators against other aircraft or ground targets.  For example, an offensive counterair-training sortie is designed to train for  destroying, disrupting, or degrading enemy air and missile threats located  in enemy territory. When on a domestic combat air patrol, a pilot may gain  some training benefit by performing certain activities, such as an aerial  refueling or a night landing. However, according to several Air Force  officials, domestic combat air patrols do not constitute adequate training  for overseas combat missions. For example, one Air Force official said  that combat air patrols involve little more than making left turns flying in a  circle in contrast to the difficult, tactical, defensive, and offensive  maneuvers performed while on a training sortie or possibly on a  combat mission.", "Air Force fighter units performing domestic combat air patrols are  inhibited from executing the full range of difficult, tactical maneuvers  with the frequency that the Air Force requires to maintain proficiency for  their combat missions. For example, in one of the seven most heavily  tasked Air National Guard fighter wings, the average pilot was unable to  meet training requirements in 9 out of 13 months between September 2001  and September 2002. Another wing reported that Operation Noble Eagle  had resulted in a 5-month period when no training was performed. Even  a short-term tasking can inhibit training needed to maintain combat  proficiency. According to Air Force officials, three training sorties are  generally lost for every short-notice, 4-hour domestic combat air  patrol performed.", "To mitigate the impact on pilot readiness, the Air Force rotates the  units tasked to perform domestic combat air patrols when a continuous  airborne alert posture is required. In doing so, the Air Force has sought  to ensure that all fighter units are able to train sufficiently for overseas  combat missions, thereby preserving flexibility in the use of these units for  both domestic combat air patrols and for combat missions overseas.  However, it is unclear whether managing the force structure in this way  fully mitigates the impact on pilot training, particularly during periods of  frequently performed domestic combat air patrol missions. According to  one Air Force official, under the current force structure, domestic  combat air patrols operating at levels experienced in the months after  September 11, 2001, would not be sustainable for more than a few weeks  before the units began suffering severe training effects and thus an erosion  in military readiness.", "DOD is undertaking planned changes to the Defense Readiness Reporting  System, which are designed to assess the impact of homeland defense and  civil support missions on the readiness of forces to execute their  warfighting mission. In March 2003, we reported that as of January 2003,  DOD had not developed an implementation plan for the Defense  Readiness Reporting System that contained measurable performance  goals, identified resources, suggested performance indicators, or included  an evaluation plan to assess progress in developing this system. Even  though the new system may have the potential to improve readiness  reporting, without an implementation plan there is little assurance that the  new system will actually improve readiness assessments by the time of its  expected full capability, in 2007. Without such a plan, it will also remain  difficult to gauge progress toward meeting the 2007 target date. DOD did  not agree with the recommendations from our March 2003 report that it  (1) develop an implementation plan with, among other things,  performance goals that are objective, quantifiable, and measurable, and  (2) provide annual updates to Congress on the new readiness reporting  system\u2019s development.

Also,  as with the Army, Air Force servicemembers away 220 to 365 days had  risen from about 1,600 to over 22,100 (of which Air Force Reserve and Air  National Guard personnel represented about 70 percent), as shown in  figure 3.", "The number of Air Force personnel exceeding the third personnel tempo  threshold of 401 or more days away from home in the preceding 730-day  period also increased during the latter period of 2002, starting at about  3,700 in September 2002 and rising to more than 8,100 (of which Air Force  Reserve and Air National Guard personnel represented about 65 percent)  in December 2002.", "DOD believes that the potential exists for retention problems stemming  from high personnel tempo. To prevent servicemembers with key skills  from leaving the services, DOD issued 23 orders since September 11, 2001,  to prevent erosion in combat capabilities that may stem from attrition, an  action known as stop loss authority. These orders affected personnel  with designated individual job skills or, in some cases, all of the  individuals in specific types of units that were critical for overseas combat  and domestic military missions. However, many of the stop loss orders  had been terminated since September 11, 2001. For example, the Navy\u2019s  individual stop loss order went into effect on April 27, 2003, and  subsequently the Navy terminated this order in mid-May 2003. Table 2  shows the estimated number of personnel affected by the stop loss orders  in effect as of April 30, 2003.", "Officials from the four services who manage the implementation of these  orders cautioned that they are short-term tools designed to maintain  unit-level military readiness for overseas combat and domestic military  missions. Moreover, the officials added that the orders are not to be used  as a long-term solution to address mismatches or shortfalls in capabilities  and requirements, or as a substitute for the routine recruiting, induction,  and training of new servicemembers."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["DOD must balance domestic and overseas missions with a renewed  emphasis on homeland defense.

Complicating the situation is the fact that some units are not well  structured for their domestic missions, cannot practice the varied skills  needed to maintain combat proficiency while performing domestic  missions, and receive little training value from their assigned domestic  duties. Therefore, military force readiness may erode and future personnel  retention problems may develop, if action is not taken to address  these problems."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Secretary of Defense assess domestic military  mission requirements and determine if steps should be taken to structure  U.S. forces to better accomplish domestic military missions while  maintaining proficiency for overseas combat missions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In written comments on a draft of this report, DOD generally concurred  with the need to do an assessment that is expressed in our  recommendation. DOD stated that our draft report provides an accurate  assessment of DOD\u2019s need to balance its domestic and overseas mission  with a renewed emphasis on homeland defense. DOD added that our draft  report describes the stress that high operational tempo could have on  personnel. However, in its comments, DOD stated that it does not believe  that an independent force structure assessment is required to better match  force structure to perceived new domestic support requirements; rather,  DOD stated that force structure changes should be determined through the  ongoing force management processes that will culminate with the fiscal  year 2005 Quadrennial Defense Review. If DOD can incorporate a force  structure assessment as part of its ongoing force management processes,  then it would generally fulfill the intent or our recommendation.", "However, we believe that DOD should examine the merits of taking  actions to alleviate stress on the forces in the near term rather than wait  until the fiscal year 2005 Quadrennial Defense Review because the  missions causing the stress are continuing. Based on our analysis of  personnel tempo trends through December 2002 and on discussions with  officials conducting domestic military missions, we believe that U.S.  military force readiness may erode because of the poor match between the  types of forces needed for the domestic military missions we reviewed, the  forces available, and the limited training value derived from the missions.  Moreover, future personnel retention problems may develop in the  meantime due to the pace of operations, which consequently may become  unsustainable. Additionally, current operations in Iraq, which were not  considered in our analysis of military personnel tempo data, can be  expected to impact a significant portion of the military force structure for  the foreseeable future. Lastly, homeland defense missions are another  factor of military personnel tempo because these missions are ongoing.  Therefore, we believe our recommendation is valid as originally drafted.  DOD\u2019s comments are reprinted in appendix II, along with our evaluation of  them. In addition, DOD provided technical comments, which we  incorporated as appropriate.", "We conducted our review from July 2002 through April 2003 in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards.", "Unless you publicly announce its contents earlier, we plan no further  distribution of this report until 30 days from its issue date.

We visited and met with officials from  U.S. Northern Command, who also provided detailed responses to our  written questions, which we analyzed and used to continue a dialogue with  the officials. We also analyzed documents prepared by U.S. Northern  Command and the Joint Force Headquarters for Homeland Security. We  reviewed DOD directives that govern civil support missions, including  DOD Directive 3025.1 Military Support to Civil Authorities issued  January 15, 1993, and DOD Directive 3025.15 Military Assistance to Civil  Authorities issued February 18, 1997. Also, we analyzed Director of  Military Support data for fiscal years 2001 and 2002 to learn about the  types of nonmilitary support that DOD provided to federal agencies. To  better understand DOD\u2019s missions, we reviewed key documents such as  the Secretary of Defense\u2019s Annual Report to the President and the  Congress for 2002, the National Strategy for Homeland Security, The  National Security Strategy of the United States, the 2001 Quadrennial  Defense Review Report, and the defense strategy issued as part of the 2001  Quadrennial Defense Review Report.", "To more fully understand the legal context of DOD\u2019s civil support missions  in the United States, we reviewed laws and defense directives relevant to  DOD\u2019s civilian support activities. We also examined the 1878 Posse  Comitatus Act and its restrictions on direct DOD assistance to civilian law  enforcement. We identified and examined a series of statutory  exceptions to the Posse Comitatus Act. In addition, we reviewed  DOD\u2019s directives governing civil support missions and assistance to law  enforcement to identify DOD\u2019s criteria for accepting or rejecting requests  for such assistance.", "To assess whether DOD\u2019s organizations, plans, and force structure are  adequate to address domestic military missions, we identified DOD\u2019s new  organizations and responsibilities with DOD officials and visited the  U.S. Northern Command, reviewed plans, and compared the types of  domestic missions performed by the forces with their primary missions.  Specifically for DOD\u2019s organizations, we reviewed appropriate documents,  including the U.S. Northern Command Campaign Plan and the April 2002  revision to the Unified Command Plan, and we discussed organizational  changes with knowledgeable officials throughout DOD. We also attended  several congressional hearings that addressed the establishment of new  organizations and their roles and responsibilities. With respect to  understanding how plans address DOD\u2019s domestic missions, we reviewed  our prior audit work related to the review of the 2001 Quadrennial  Defense Review Report and risk management. Also, we discussed DOD\u2019s  planning process with an official at the Office of the Secretary of Defense  and at U.S. Northern Command and we discussed the development of the  campaign plan with U.S. Northern Command officials. To obtain an  understanding of whether forces performing domestic military missions  are tailored to perform these missions, we selected two Operation Noble  Eagle missions performed in the continental United States by DOD forces  since September 11, 2001. Specifically, we reviewed installation security  provided by Army military police units and combat air patrols flown by Air  Force fighter units. We selected these specific missions because: (1) Joint  Force Headquarters for Homeland Security officials indicated that Army  military police combat units were deploying at high rates due to the events  of September 11, 2001, and (2) the combat air patrol mission was the first  domestic military mission performed under Operation Noble Eagle.", "To understand installation security missions, we interviewed officials  at U.S. Forces Command; the U.S. Army Reserve Command; and the  U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command. We also visited and  interviewed officials at military police combat units that deployed for  these missions, including an Army active duty combat support  company, an Army Reserve internment and resettlement battalion, and  an Army National Guard guard company. We also conducted a 2-day  videoconference with command officials from an Army National Guard  combat support company. We analyzed documentation such as briefings,  mission orders, and training documents from the four units. We selected  these military police units judgmentally based on the deployment data  received from U.S. Forces Command, taking into consideration the  number of days the units had performed installation security; the number  of personnel deployed on the missions; the type of military police unit  involved; whether the unit was from the active Army, Army Reserve, or  Army National Guard; and whether the unit completed its mission or  would do so prior to the conclusion of our review. To better understand  whether the skills required for installation security were well matched to  the unit\u2019s primary wartime missions, we compared the required combat  training for these units to the types of duties they routinely performed for  enhanced installation security. Further, we reviewed Army training  regulations and manuals. We also analyzed data pertaining to the Army  National Guard deployments to Air Force installations in the continental  United States. We determined the types of units that deployed on these  missions, including those most frequently deployed, and we examined the  primary combat training requirements these units must perform to  maintain combat proficiency in their particular specialties.", "To gain first-hand information about the combat air patrols, we  interviewed officials at active duty Air Force and Air National Guard  units that performed combat air patrol missions, and analyzed extensive  operational, training, and maintenance data. To gain an understanding  about operational requirements and command and control issues for  combat air patrol missions, we interviewed officials at the Department of  the Air Force; the Air National Guard; the Air Force Reserve Command;  the Air Combat Command; the Continental United States Region,  North American Aerospace Defense Command; and North American  Aerospace Defense Command. We selected units to visit based on their  participation in combat air patrols since September 11, 2001. We obtained  and analyzed flying hours and sortie data for fiscal years 2001 and 2002 for  fighter (F15 and F16) wings from Air Combat Command, the Air  National Guard, and the Air Force Reserve Command. We also  obtained and reviewed Air Force training instructions and unit training  performance reports.", "To determine if military personnel experienced increases in time away  from home while performing official military duties, we reviewed data for  personnel tempo for each of the military services and their respective  reserve components for the period October 1, 2000, through December 31,  2002 (the latest data available). The services report their data to the  Defense Manpower Data Center under the direction of the Under  Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness. We obtained the  Army\u2019s data directly from the Army Personnel Command because at the  time of our review, the Defense Manpower Data Center did not have the  Army\u2019s recent data in its information management system. To gain further  insight into the personnel tempo data, we conducted in-depth interviews  with officials from the Office of the Secretary of Defense for Personnel  and Readiness, the Defense Manpower Data Center, and the Departments  of the Army and the Air Force. We also reviewed DOD\u2019s use of stop loss  authority by obtaining the stop loss orders and estimates of affected  personnel from officials in the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for  Military Personnel Policy, and each of the military services. We discussed  the estimates with the officials to determine the most appropriate way to  demonstrate the impacts of stop loss orders.", "We reviewed the data provided by the Army, Army Reserve, Army National  Guard, Air National Guard, Air Force, Defense Manpower Data Center,  and Army Personnel Command for completeness and reliability. For the  analysis of flying hours and military police deployments, we found and  corrected some errors in the data. Specifically, we found errors in the  Air Force\u2019s flying hour records and corrected the data by incorporating  data provided by the affected unit. For military police deployments we  found duplicate deployments in some cases and eliminated the duplicate  records.", "For the analysis of Air Force, Marine Corps, Army, and Navy personnel  tempo data, we found and corrected some errors where possible, and did  not use the data or specific fields where the data were unreliable or we  could not correct the problems. Specifically, for the Air Force data, we  eliminated duplicate records and deleted all records of personnel who had  overlapping duty dates. For all services, where the personnel tempo end  date was missing, we assumed the personnel were still away from home  and set the end date to a date after our analytic period. To the extent that  the missing date represents completed duties where the end date had not  been entered, we are overstating the number of personnel and the extent  of days away from home.", "Through corroborating evidence from comparisons with other DOD data  files and our corrections, we confirmed that the data we used present a  reliable depiction of the active Army, Army Reserve, Army National Guard,  active Air Force, and Air National Guard units involved in Operation Noble  Eagle activities; and Army, Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps personnel  deployments from October 1, 2000, to December 31, 2002."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": ["The following are GAO\u2019s comments on the Department of Defense\u2019s letter  dated June 30, 2003."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Comments", "paragraphs": ["1.  DOD stated that it is now studying and implementing significant  changes in the force structure to better support civil authorities during  domestic events. First, during our audit we were not presented with  evidence of such studies as they relate to either civil support or  homeland defense missions. Second, in our follow-up conversation  with a DOD official concerning this statement, the DOD official did not  provide specific information about the scope, content, or completion  dates of the studies. Finally, DOD stated that it has adjusted its  strategic and operational focus to encompass traditional military  threats from hostile states, asymmetric threats posed by terrorists, and  asymmetric threats posed by hostile states. Our draft report  acknowledged the shifts for traditional military threats and the  asymmetric threats posed by terrorists. Based on DOD\u2019s comment, we  added asymmetric threats posed by hostile states.  2.  DOD stated that it is important for the report to note that DOD military  forces are not first responders. Rather, DOD provides support as  directed by the President or Secretary of Defense using defense  capabilities to assist other federal, state, and local authorities in  response to their requests. Additionally, DOD stated that our report  fails to emphasize that DOD is not the long-term solution to the  nation\u2019s domestic prevention, response, and recovery requirements.  Our report clearly states that DOD assesses requests from civil  authorities based upon its own criteria from DOD Directive 3025.15,  Military Assistance to Civil Authorities, and that DOD has some  discretion to accept or reject these requests. Moreover, DOD suggested  that we use this opportunity to recommend a solution involving the  fostering of a more robust state and local response structure. We  disagree. We did not comment on such a solution in our draft report  because this type of assessment was outside the scope of our review.  Ultimately, the President and Congress will determine the future role  of DOD, if any, in domestic response missions.  3.  DOD commented that our draft report does not mention the planned  changes to the Defense Readiness Reporting System. According to  DOD, the system\u2019s changes are designed to assess the impact of  homeland defense and civil support missions on the readiness of  forces to execute their warfighting mission. At DOD\u2019s request, we have  incorporated information about this system on page 17. However, in  March 2003, we reported that as of January 2003, DOD had not  developed an implementation plan for the Defense Readiness  Reporting System that contained measurable performance goals,  identified resources, suggested performance indicators, or included an  evaluation plan to assess progress in developing this system.   4.  DOD commented that our draft report used non-standard terminology,  referring to military missions (what DOD calls homeland defense) and  nonmilitary missions (support to civil authorities). We added language  on page 1 (see footnote 1) to establish the meaning of the terms used  in our report.  5.  DOD stated that it believes it is not clear that homeland defense and  support to civil authorities missions are key factors in high personnel  tempo. On the contrary, our draft report acknowledges that overseas  missions as well as domestic missions contribute to high personnel  tempo. Indeed, current personnel tempo could be even higher than is  depicted in our draft report because the data displaying high personnel  tempo stemming from participation in homeland defense missions or  other deployments after December 2002, or from Operation Iraqi  Freedom, were not yet fully available at the time of our review. In  addition, the personnel tempo data we received from DOD did not  record a servicemember\u2019s assigned operation\u2014for example, Operation  Noble Eagle. However, we added a statement to footnote 28 in our  report that acknowledges this limitation in the personnel tempo data  we received.", "DOD also commented that since 9/11/01, increased requirements have  been driven more significantly by overseas operations in Afghanistan,  Iraq, and elsewhere in the war on terrorism. While DOD may be  correct, our report discussed personnel tempo, not requirements.  Personnel tempo refers to the amount of time during which a member  of the armed forces is engaged in official duties at a location that  makes it infeasible to spend off duty time at the servicemember\u2019s  home, homeport (for Navy servicemembers), or civilian residence  (for reserve components\u2019 personnel). Therefore, we stand by our  finding that high personnel tempo is an indicator that present force  structure may not be sufficient to address the increase in domestic and  overseas military missions and could lead to an erosion of unit  readiness.", "Lastly, because the assessment of rotating units to maintain combat  readiness was outside the scope of our review, we could not evaluate  DOD\u2019s statements.  6.  DOD commented that activities such as mobilization and  preparation for war would almost certainly have an impact on the  resources available to respond to homeland defense and support  to civil authorities missions. DOD added that our draft report leaves  the inaccurate impression that this situation is the norm. However,  DOD did not specifically point out where the report suggested such  an interpretation. We disagree that our report leaves an inaccurate  impression, because it does not have statements implying this cause  and effect. However, because servicemembers cannot be in both  domestic and overseas locations at the same time, we believe that  mobilization and preparation for any one mission, even including war,  will necessarily make them unavailable for other missions.", "DOD also commented that it is important to note that, even during  Operation Iraqi Freedom, over 200,000 soldiers and airmen were  still available after the mobilization. We agree that a significant number  of personnel have not been mobilized even during Operation Iraqi  Freedom, but it is unclear what DOD\u2019s figure means. DOD did not  provide evidence to support this figure, and we believe that, in any  case, it is tangential to our point\u2014that, in general, some forces are not  optimally suited to perform domestic military missions. We found that  some forces\u2019 skills are mismatched with the needs of domestic military  missions and that these forces lose critical training opportunities.  Thus, DOD\u2019s statement that 200,000 servicemembers were available  does not necessarily signify that these members are well suited for the  missions at hand.", "Lastly, we did not discuss overseas missions at length in this report,  because the report reviewed DOD\u2019s domestic military missions.  7.  DOD commented that when identifying Title 10 statutes that allow  federal forces to perform domestic law enforcement missions, the  report does not make clear that these missions are based on worst  case scenarios and are not the norm. We agree that the use of federal  forces to perform law enforcement missions is not the norm. As  suggested by each of the authorized uses of federal forces in domestic  law enforcement roles that we identified, such uses are in fact the  exception rather than the rule. DOD is correct when it states that it  undertakes missions to support civil authorities at the direction of the  President or the Secretary of Defense, and, as DOD has pointed out,  these missions may be undertaken upon requests for assistance from  civil authorities.  8.  DOD disagreed with our statement on page 14 that domestic military  missions to date have offered limited training value because these  missions generally have required only basic military skills. DOD stated  that basic military skills require practice, just as do the more  sophisticated skills. We agree that basic skills also need practice, and  our report made clear that, while performing Operation Noble Eagle  missions (such as domestic installation security and combat air  patrols), forces are able to employ basic military skills. However, our  discussions with service officials revealed that servicemembers were  inhibited from executing the full range of difficult tactical maneuvers  or from replicating battlefield conditions while deployed on Operation  Noble Eagle missions. Moreover, we reviewed DOD training  requirements for all the military skills of these forces, both basic and  advanced, as well as the DOD requirements for their frequency of  practice in order to ensure proficiency. Also, DOD asserts that there  will be ample opportunity to increase readiness prior to operational  employment. However, DOD did not explain how it could predict the  amount of time available to prepare for a future contingency. In any  case, based on DOD\u2019s requirements, we have concluded that overall  combat readiness may erode.", "In addition, based on the length or frequency for Operation Noble  Eagle deployments that we reviewed, we concluded that although  basic military skills have been frequently practiced, combat skills have  not generally been practiced. As a result, the combat proficiency of  many servicemembers could be jeopardized. Moreover, because DOD  did not provide specific criteria for what constitutes the limited scope  and duration of domestic missions, we cannot address these  comments. Finally, Operation Noble Eagle began on 9/11/01, is  continuing, and has no known end in sight, which raises questions  about whether this is a \u201climited duration\u201d mission. Therefore, we stand  by our report as originally drafted.  9.  In its comments, DOD pointed out that we concluded (now on p. 23)  that some units are not well structured for their domestic missions,  cannot practice the varied skills needed to maintain combat  proficiency while performing domestic missions, and receive little  training value from their assigned domestic missions. DOD then  asserts that a temporary reduction in a unit\u2019s effectiveness for its  primary mission due to homeland security or peacekeeping missions is  not necessarily a bad thing. A key DOD official explained to us that  effectiveness refers to the extent to which a unit was successful in  completing a mission to which it was assigned. However, we did not  evaluate the extent to which any military units were successful in  completing assigned missions, thus DOD\u2019s comment missed our point.  We believe that a unit\u2019s readiness may erode in the future from  performing a mission for which it was not designed. DOD also asserted  that the ability of units to prepare for and execute a variety of missions  with inherent capability adds flexibility. While DOD is apparently  asserting that the missions we reviewed are adding flexibility and  enhancing responsiveness, DOD did not explain how practicing the  basic skills of flying aircraft and standing guard adds flexibility.  Consequently, we stand by our conclusion.  10.  DOD commented that the report confused the interpretation and  application of the Posse Comitatus Act with regard to the use of the  military to enforce the laws of the United States. We disagree. Our  report identified and summarized laws associated with the 1878 Posse  Comitatus Act. We explained the laws\u2019 impact on requests for DOD  assistance in domestic law enforcement operations. We also reported  that DOD does not believe the act impedes the nature or timeliness of  its response.   11.  DOD commented that our report indicated that DOD did not complete  a congressionally directed legal review on the use of military forces in  the United States and any legal impediments affecting DOD\u2019s role in  supporting homeland security. We have updated our report to reflect  information that DOD has recently provided to us, although DOD did  not provide this report to us."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the person named above, Deborah Colantonio, Richard K.
