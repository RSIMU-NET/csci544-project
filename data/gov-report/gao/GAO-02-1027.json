Drawdowns give the President the ability to respond to U.S. foreign policy and national security objectives, such as counternarcotics efforts, peacekeeping needs, and unforeseen military and nonmilitary emergencies, by providing military assistance without first seeking additional legislative authority or appropriations from Congress. The Defense Security Cooperation Agency's reports to Congress on the costs and delivery status of drawdowns are inaccurate and incomplete. Two principal problems contribute to the agency's inability to meet the reporting requirements. First, its information system for recording drawdown data is outmoded and difficult to use--service drawdown reports are in different formats, and any conversion errors have to be manually corrected. Second, the services do not regularly provide updates to the agency on drawdown costs and deliveries, and available information sometimes does not get into the system. Drawdowns benefit the United States and foreign recipients primarily by providing the President the flexibility to address foreign policy and national security objectives quickly. Drawdowns also allow the President to provide defense articles and services to improve foreign recipients' capability to conduct military and police missions in support of U.S. foreign policy. Other benefits cited include improved military-to-military relations between the U.S. military services and the foreign recipients and expanded markets for U.S. defense firms. According to U.S. and foreign military officials, the use of drawdowns presents some concerns. Because drawdowns are used to quickly address U.S. national interests and emergencies, the costs associated with a drawdown, such as refurbishment and transportation, are not budgeted for by the services and are not reimbursed."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Since 1961, the President has had special statutory authority to order the  \u201cdrawdown\u201d of defense articles\u2014such as aircraft, vehicles, various  weapons, and spare parts\u2014and services or military education and training  from Department of Defense (DOD) and military service inventories and  transfer them to foreign countries or international organizations.

Before  exercising this authority, the President must report to the Congress that an  unforeseen emergency exists requiring immediate military assistance that  cannot be met under any other law.", "Section 506(a)(2) of the Foreign Assistance Act authorizes the President to  drawdown articles and services from the inventory and resources of any  U.S. government agency and provide them to foreign countries or  international organizations in a number of nonemergency situations. As  above, before exercising this authority, the President must first report to  the Congress that any such drawdown is in the national interests of the  United States. This special authority is broad in scope, allowing the  President to use drawdowns to assist with counternarcotics efforts,  provide international disaster assistance and migration and refugee  assistance, aid prisoner-of-war and missing-in-action efforts in Southeast  Asia, supplement peacekeeping missions, and support mid- to long-term  national interests in nonemergency situations.", "Section 552 of the Foreign Assistance Act authorizes the President to  provide assistance for peacekeeping operations and other programs  carried out in furtherance of U.S. national security interests. Specifically,  section 552(c)(2) authorizes the President to direct the drawdown of  commodities and services from the inventory and resources from any U.S.  agency if the President determines that an unforeseen emergency requires  the immediate provision of such assistance.", "At the discretion of the President, drawdown proposals are typically  developed in an interagency process that generally includes DOD, the  National Security Council, and State but may include other executive  branch agencies. Based on the estimated price and availability of the  defense articles and services, the agencies agree on the parameters of the  drawdown and State prepares a justification package, including the  presidential determination for the President\u2019s signature. Once the  presidential determination is approved, the Defense Security Cooperation  Agency (DSCA), a component of DOD, executes the drawdown by working  with the military services to determine what specific defense articles and  services will be provided and who will provide them. DSCA is also charged  with tracking and reporting on the drawdown status. A drawdown is  typically completed when the emergency or foreign policy goal has been  met or the dollar value of the authority has been reached.", "The excess defense articles program, which authorizes the President to  transfer defense articles excess to DOD\u2019s needs to eligible foreign countries  or international organizations, is sometimes used in conjunction with  drawdowns. Defense articles, including excess defense articles, that are  transferred under presidential determinations authorizing drawdowns  must be fully operational on delivery. The drawdown authority may be  used, if necessary, to refurbish defense articles to operational status.", "In the 27 years from 1963 through 1989, the President approved 20  determinations authorizing drawdowns valued at a total of about $1 billion.  In the 13 years since 1989, the President approved 70 determinations  authorizing drawdowns valued at about $2.3 billion (see app. I). Of the 90  total drawdowns, 58 totaling about $2.1 billion were authorized under  section 506 of the Foreign Assistance Act; 15 additional drawdowns valued  at about $141.7 million were authorized under section 552. As shown in  figure 1, drawdown authorizations as a percentage of total military  assistance provided by the United States have varied considerably over the  years (see also app. II).

The United States provided defense articles and  services to the Bosnian Federation within 6 months of a July 1996  presidential determination. According to DOD and State officials, the  drawdown allowed assistance to be provided more quickly and at less cost  than other security assistance programs would have. The United States  provided 116 fully operational 155mm howitzers as excess defense articles  to help ensure the Bosnian Federation Army\u2019s capacity to return indirect  fire if attacked, which they lacked during the conflict with the Bosnian  Serbs. The United States also provided 45 M60 tanks, 80 armored personnel  carriers, 15 UH-1H helicopters, and light arms including 46,100 M16 rifles.  These articles and related services met the force requirements for military  stabilization that were approved in the Dayton Peace Agreement and  enumerated in the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe  Agreement on Sub-Regional Arms Control.

During fiscal years 1996\u201399, the United States provided defense  articles and services through drawdowns to the Colombian and Mexican  military and national police to increase their ability to interdict the flow of  illicit narcotics to the United States. The United States provided the  Colombian Army and National Police with fully operational defense articles  including 7 C-26 aircraft, 12 UH-1H helicopters, and 9 patrol boats.  Similarly, the United States provided Mexico with 53 UH-1H helicopters  and 4 C-26 aircraft. According to State officials, although Colombia and  Mexico experienced difficulty in using these articles (Mexico eventually  returned the helicopters to the United States), the drawdown helped  improve their capability to conduct counternarcotics operations.

U.S. officials cited as evidence Jordan\u2019s participation in  peacekeeping operations in East Timor, Haiti, and Sierra Leone. More  recently in Afghanistan, the Jordanian Armed Forces participated in  demining operations and set up a field hospital that has treated over 30,000  patients, including U.S. soldiers.

Section 506(d) of the  Foreign Assistance Act authorizes the appropriation of funds to the  President to reimburse the services for the costs associated with executing  drawdowns. However, since 1979, the President has not requested such  reimbursements.", "The military services can incur six types of costs when executing a  drawdown\u2014(1) the value of the defense articles provided including  aircraft, vehicles, weapons and ammunition, or other major end items; (2)  the repair or refurbishment of these items; (3) spare parts and tools; (4)  training; (5) packing, crating, handling, and transportation; and (6)  administrative costs. The cost of defense articles charged against a  drawdown is a depreciated value and not necessarily the replacement cost.  The other costs of a drawdown are typically paid out of a service\u2019s  operations and maintenance account and are not budgeted or planned for  in advance. In effect, this means that the services have less operations and  maintenance funding for other items in their inventories.", "Information provided by the services shows that unreimbursed costs  associated with drawdowns have totaled about $724.2 million since 1993.  The Army reported about $557 million in unreimbursed costs, and the Air  Force and Navy reported $69.4 million and $97.8 million, respectively. Case  by case, unreimbursed costs ranged from less than $100 to approximately  $87.2 million. A large proportion of these costs were for refurbishing the  defense articles, providing spare parts and support equipment, and  transporting the articles. For example, the Army reported that it spent  approximately $31.4 million from its operations and maintenance account  to refurbish and deliver $55.8 million worth of articles for the 1996  drawdown to Bosnia. Similarly, the Army spent $23.8 million for spare parts  and transportation from its operations and maintenance account on  $51.5 million worth of articles for the 1996 drawdown to Jordan. However,  this figure did not include refurbishment.", "Numerous DOD and service officials stated that the unreimbursed costs  associated with a drawdown negatively affect the readiness of the U.S.  military services. However, these officials could not provide any examples  of programs forgone or specific deficiencies in unit readiness. In 1996, we  reported that Army operations and maintenance costs exceeded funding  for contingency operations as a result, in part, of Army expenditures on the  1996 drawdown to Bosnia. In addition,   A July 1996 memorandum from the Chief of Staff of the Army to the  Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff stated that drawdowns affect the  Army\u2019s ability to respond to contingencies. It also stated that defense  articles for future drawdowns would have to be taken from war reserve  stocks or from reserve components.", "In other documents since 1996, the Army characterized the unbudgeted  expenditures from operations and maintenance accounts in support of  drawdowns as a drain on its readiness, training, transformation  activities, and quality-of-life funds and as a long-term risk to the stability  of Army investments.", "Furthermore, in 2000, the military services reported to DSCA on the effect  on readiness of drawdowns for counternarcotics efforts. Generally, the  services characterized the effect as dollars spent on unplanned  contingencies and, therefore, not available to support other requirements.  In their responses to DSCA,  The Army stated that it expected readiness to be adversely affected by  the diversion of $8 million worth of Blackhawk helicopter spare parts  for Colombia, but it did not say whether any specific helicopter unit  would be affected. Subsequently, the Joint Staff directed the Army to  provide the parts to Colombia under a 1999 drawdown.", "The Air Force noted that it would need to replace several utility vehicles  transferred under drawdown authority, but it did not specify when or at  what cost these vehicles would be replaced or the effect on readiness of  no longer having the vehicles.", "In 1985, we reported that even if DOD and the military services were  reimbursed for the costs associated with drawdowns, full replacement was  unlikely, if not impossible.

In addition, because  defense articles delivered under drawdowns are often older articles, the  spare parts and tools needed to maintain them may not be readily available.  Consequently, the recipients\u2019 ability to conduct military or police missions  in support of U.S. foreign policy diminishes as vehicles and weapons break  down and as parts for these older defense articles become more difficult to  obtain.

For example, 2 months after  Colombia received 12 UH-1H helicopters, the Colombian National Police  reported that only 2 were operational. The U.S. embassy estimated the cost  of the repairs at about $1.2 million. As part of the same drawdown, the  United States transferred 5 C-26 aircraft to conduct counternarcotics  surveillance missions. According to U.S. embassy officials, the United  States spent at least an additional $3 million to modify each aircraft to  perform the surveillance missions, and it costs at least $1 million annually  to operate and maintain each aircraft.", "Mexico. In 1996 and 1997, the United States provided the Mexican military  with 73 UH-1H helicopters\u201420 from a 1996 excess defense articles transfer  and 53 from a 1997 drawdown\u2014and 2 years of spare parts to assist Mexico  in its counternarcotics efforts. As we reported in 1998, the usefulness of the  U.S.-provided helicopters was limited because the helicopters were  inappropriate for some counternarcotics missions and lacked adequate logistical support. At the time, U.S. embassy officials were concerned that  once the U.S.-provided support had been used, the Mexican military would  not provide the additional support\u2014estimated at $25 million per year for  the UH-1H fleet\u2014because of budgetary constraints. In March 1999, 72 UH-1H helicopters (one crashed) were grounded because of overuse and  airworthiness concerns. Shortly thereafter, Mexico transferred the 72  helicopters back to the United States for repair and ended its involvement  in the helicopter program.", "Jordan. Although Jordan has allocated $16 million of U.S. aid per year for  sustainment and modernization since 2000, it cannot fully use all of the  defense articles it has received through drawdowns.

In addition, Jordan does not have funds to  purchase additional munitions for some of the weapons it received from  the drawdowns. As a result, the Jordanian Army and Air Force have never  test fired the air-to-air missiles or the antitank missiles it received.  Furthermore, according to U.S. military officials in Jordan, the shelf life of  some of the other munitions and light weapons ammunition used for  training purposes may be expiring, and Jordan does not have the funds to  replace them."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Drawdowns give the President the ability to provide defense articles,  training, and services to foreign countries and international organizations  without first seeking specific appropriations from the Congress.
