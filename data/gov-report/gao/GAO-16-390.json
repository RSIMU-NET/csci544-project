Both courses of action have oversight implications. DOD has begun planning and funding significant new development work to add to the F-35's capabilities. Known as Block 4, the funding needed for this effort is projected to be nearly $3 billion over the next 6 years (see figure below), which would qualify it as a major defense acquisition program in its own right.", "DOD does not currently plan to manage Block 4 as a separate program with its own acquisition program baseline but rather as part of the existing baseline. As a result, Block 4 will not be subject to key statutory and regulatory oversight requirements, such as providing Congress with regular, formal reports on program cost and schedule performance. A similar approach was initially followed on the F-22 Raptor modernization program, making it difficult to separate the performance and cost of the modernization from the baseline program. Best practices recommend an incremental approach in which new development efforts are structured and managed as separate acquisition programs with their own requirements and acquisition program baselines. The F-22 eventually adopted this approach. If the Block 4 effort is not established as a separate acquisition program, transparency will be limited. Therefore, it will be difficult for Congress to hold it accountable for achieving its cost, schedule, and performance requirements."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["Congress should consider directing DOD to manage F-35 follow-on modernization, Block 4, as a separate and distinct acquisition program with its own baseline and regular cost, schedule and performance reporting.

Through this program, DOD is developing and fielding a family of next  generation strike fighter aircraft, integrating low observable (stealth)  technologies with advanced sensors and computer networking  capabilities for the United States Air Force, Marine Corps, and Navy as  well as eight international partners. The F-35 family is comprised of the  F-35A conventional takeoff and landing variant, the F-35B short takeoff  and vertical landing variant, and the F-35C carrier-suitable variant. The  program is approaching the end of development and will begin increasing  production rates significantly over the next few years. According to  current projections, the U.S. portion of the program will require acquisition  funding of $54 billion over the next five years as it approaches full rate  production and is expected to require about $12 billion a year, on  average, through 2038 to complete development and procure a total of  2,457 aircraft.

In addition, DOD\u2019s acquisition strategy  called for high levels of concurrency between development, testing, and  production. In our prior work, we identified the lack of knowledge and  high levels of concurrency as major drivers in the significant cost and  schedule growth as well as performance shortfalls that the program has  experienced since 2001. The program has been restructured three times  since it began: first in December 2003, again in March 2007, and most  recently in March 2012. The most recent restructuring was initiated in  early 2010 when the program\u2019s unit cost estimates exceeded critical  thresholds established by statute\u2014a condition known as a Nunn- McCurdy breach. DOD subsequently certified to Congress in June 2010  that the program was essential to national security and needed to  continue. DOD then began restructuring the program. The restructuring  continued through 2011 and into 2012, during which time the department  established a new acquisition program baseline reflecting increased  program cost estimates, extended test and delivery schedules, and  reduced near-term aircraft procurement quantities\u2014total procurement  quantities did not change.

The following year, DOD issued a memorandum stating  that the Marine Corps and Air Force were planning to field initial operating  capabilities in 2015 and 2016 respectively, and that the Navy planned to  field its initial operating capability in 2018. These new dates represented  a delay of 5 to 6 years from the program\u2019s initial baseline dates.

The F-35 is  still DOD\u2019s most costly acquisition program. As of December 2015, the  estimated total acquisition cost for the F-35 program is $379 billion, or  $12.1 billion less than DOD reported in 2014. The program will require an  average of $12 billion per year to complete the procurement of aircraft  through 2038. The program expects to reach peak production rates for  U.S. aircraft in 2022, at which point DOD expects to spend more than $14  billion a year on average for a decade (see figure 2). These affordability  challenges will compound as the program competes with other large  acquisition programs including the long range strike bomber and KC-46A  Tanker. At the same time, the number of operational F-35 aircraft that  DOD will have to support will be increasing. The total cost to operate and  support the F-35 fleet is still estimated to be more than $1 trillion. In  recent years, affordability challenges, in part, have forced the Air Force to  defer F-35 aircraft procurements to later years. Since 2014, the Air Force  deferred 45 aircraft between 2017 and 2021 to later years. This will likely  require the military service to make unplanned investments in extending  the service life of their current fighter aircraft.

Block 3F flight testing started later than  planned and program officials believe that the completion of 3F  developmental testing could be delayed by about 2 to 3 months. As of  December 2015, our analysis of program data indicated that Block 3F  testing could be delayed by as much as 6 months if the program performs  at the same rate it has in the past and is executed according to the  current plan with no additional test point growth.

As  the program conducts developmental testing it also continues to procure  more and more aircraft per year, increasing program concurrency and  cost risk. Through 2016 the program will have spent $56.1 billion to  procure 285 aircraft. Fixes to problems identified during testing have  required retrofits and rework to aircraft that had already been delivered.  To date, program officials have identified a total of $1.4 billion to fix  known issues and have forecasted an additional $369 million for retrofits  and rework related to issues that have yet to be discovered in testing  through 2016. Beyond 2016, the program will no longer track concurrency  costs in the same way because developmental testing is expected to be  complete and the program does not believe that much, if any,  concurrency risk will remain. However, developmental and initial  operational testing will continue beyond this period. By the time initial  operational testing is complete, currently planned for 2019, the program  will have procured 498 aircraft at a cost of $85.7 billion. DOD has taken  steps over the past few years to decrease the costs of concurrency. For  example, officials have tried to incorporate fixes into production earlier in  order to limit the number of fielded aircraft that require retrofits.

Officials stated the risk of injury is due to the rotation of the ejection  seat in combination with the thrust from the parachute deployment  during ejection. Officials noted that although the problem was  discovered during testing of the new helmet mounted display, the  helmet\u2019s weight was not the root cause.

Best practices recommend an  incremental approach in which new development efforts are structured  and managed as separate acquisition programs and that a business case  should match requirements with resources\u2014proven technologies,  sufficient engineering capabilities, time, and funding\u2014before undertaking  a new product development. Because DOD does not yet have approved  requirements and is not planning to hold a Milestone B review, its  approach for Block 4 modernization will not require the program to have  such important reporting and oversight mechanisms in place.", "We are concerned with DOD\u2019s approach largely because of a similar case  we reported on in March 2005. In that report we found that the Air Force  was managing its multi-billion dollar F-22 modernization efforts as part of  the program\u2019s existing acquisition baseline and had not established a  knowledge-based business case. We recommended that the Air Force  structure and manage F-22 modernization as a separate acquisition  program with its own business case\u2014matching requirements with  resources\u2014and acquisition program baseline. However, the F-22  baseline and schedule were not immediately adjusted to reflect the new  timeframes and additional costs and funding of the baseline development  and modernization effort were comingled. As a result, the content, scope,  and phasing of capabilities changed over time and it appeared that the F- 22 program was fraught with schedule delays and cost overruns. The  comingling of cost and schedule information reduced transparency and  Congress could not distinguish between increased costs associated with  the original baseline funding and increased costs associated with  modernization funding. As shown in table 2, the F-22 modernization  program was less complex than the proposed F-35 Block 4 development  but the F-22 program\u2019s approach still resulted in poor acquisition  outcomes. Eventually, the department separated the F-22 modernization  program from the baseline program with a Milestone B review, in line with  our recommendation, which increased transparency and better facilitated  oversight. The department has the opportunity to apply similar lessons  learned to the F-35 Block 4 program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Proposed Future Procurement Plan Has Benefits and Risks", "paragraphs": ["In an effort to reduce procurement costs, the F-35 program office has  begun exploring the potential benefits and risks of using what the  program has called a block buy contracting approach. Currently, the  program purchases aircraft under separate annual contracts that are  negotiated on an annual basis. Program officials stated they are  considering seeking specific legal authority from Congress that would  enable them to enter into a 3 year contract to purchase three lots of  aircraft, although funding would still be authorized and appropriated by  Congress annually.", "The F-35 block buy contracting approach under consideration does have  a number of potential benefits. For example, block buy contracting would  allow the program to purchase parts for all three lots of aircraft at the  same time, which could result in cost savings. By purchasing supplies in  economic quantities, Lockheed Martin and Pratt & Whitney estimate that  8 percent and 2.3 percent cost savings, respectively, could be achievable.  Program officials believe that block buy contracting can also enhance  program and supply chain stability by providing assurance that quantities  and the program\u2019s ramp-up is nearing and steady work will continue. This  stability could help address the supply base\u2019s delivery issues.", "While the F-35 block buy contracting approach could result in cost  savings and other benefits, it can present oversight challenges. Our  analysis of the Navy\u2019s block buy contract for the Littoral Combat Ship  (LCS) indicates that the contract could affect Congress\u2019s funding  flexibility. For example, the LCS contract states that a failure to fully fund  the purchase in a given year would mean that the contract is subject to  renegotiation. This could result in the government paying more for the  remaining ships. The F-35 block buy plan is still under consideration and  the specific terms and conditions of the contract are not yet defined, nor  has the specific statutory authority the program might seek been enacted.  However, if the F-35 block buy contract contains similar provisions to  those in the LCS contract, Congress\u2019s ability to make funding changes  could be similarly affected. Program officials noted that they are  examining prior block buys, like the LCS, to identify lessons learned and  looking for ways to reduce risk to the government.", "Reducing costs for a program of the F-35\u2019s size is clearly desirable.  However, adding an F-35 block buy to DOD\u2019s portfolio of contracts with  explicit or potential long-term commitments could further affect  Congress\u2019s funding flexibility. As can be seen in figure 11, long-term  contracts, such as block buys and multiyear contracts, will consume 30  percent of DOD\u2019s fiscal year 2016 budget and if the F-35 block buy  contract was included as a long-term agreement, such agreements would  comprise nearly half of DOD\u2019s budget."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The F-35 development program is nearing completion and aircraft  manufacturing continues to improve. While much of the remaining  developmental flight testing will be challenging, and some additional  discoveries are likely, the program has mitigated many of the technical  risks that we have reported on over the past several years. However, the  program is not without risks. Performance issues with ALIS and new  issues with the ejection seat and F-35C wing structures pose ongoing  risks. Going forward, the program will continue to experience affordability  and oversight challenges. DOD still expects that beginning in 2022 it will  need more than $14 billion a year on average for a decade to procure  aircraft. It is unlikely that the program will be able to receive and sustain  such a high level of funding over this extended period, especially given  DOD\u2019s competing resources such as the long range strike bomber and  KC-46A tanker. While a block buy can offer savings and stability, how the  contract terms are developed will be an important consideration so as not  to affect congressional funding flexibility, especially when considering that  nearly a third of DOD\u2019s acquisition budget is already covered by multiyear  commitments. Further congressional oversight challenges are presented  because of DOD\u2019s plan to manage Block 4 under the current acquisition  program baseline and because key reporting requirements and oversight  mechanisms will not be initiated. Best practices recommend an  incremental approach in which new development efforts are structured  and managed as separate acquisition programs with their own  requirements and acquisition program baselines. Without an acquisition  program baseline and regular reporting on progress, it will be difficult for  Congress to hold DOD accountable for achieving F-35 Block 4 cost,  schedule, and performance goals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Matter for Congressional Consideration", "paragraphs": ["To enhance program oversight and accountability given that DOD does  not plan to modify its acquisition strategy and hold a Milestone B decision  review for the F-35 follow-on modernization program, Congress should  consider directing the Secretary of Defense to hold a Milestone B review  and manage F-35 Block 4 as its own separate and distinct major defense  acquisition program with its own acquisition baseline and regular cost,  schedule, and performance report to Congress."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["In order to ensure that proper statutory and regulatory oversight  mechanisms are in place and to increase transparency into a major new  investment in the F-35 program, we recommend that the Secretary of  Defense hold a Milestone B review and manage F-35 Block 4 as a  separate and distinct Major Defense Acquisition Program with its own  acquisition program baseline and regular cost, schedule, and  performance reports to the Congress."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["DOD provided us with written comments on a draft of this report. DOD\u2019s  comments are reprinted in appendix II. DOD also provided technical  comments, which were incorporated as appropriate.", "DOD did not concur with our recommendation to hold a Milestone B  review and manage F-35 Block 4 follow-on modernization as a separate  and distinct major defense acquisition program. DOD stated that it views  Block 4 as a continuation of the existing F-35 acquisition program, which  it believes is the department\u2019s most closely managed system. DOD went  on to explain that it plans to use existing F-35 oversight mechanisms like  regularly scheduled high-level acquisition reviews to manage its Block 4  efforts. In addition, the department noted that it is exploring ways to  provide further transparency into the cost, schedule, and performance  progress of Block 4, like establishing separate Block 4 budget lines,  instituting contract cost performance reporting, and developing an  independent cost estimate.", "While we recognize that DOD policy provides flexibility to manage  programs in different ways, and we would encourage DOD to manage  Block 4 efficiently, the management approach should not sacrifice  transparency or oversight. As noted in this report, DOD is currently  conducting activities typical of a program preparing to begin system  development including requirements definition and preliminary design,  and expects to award a new development contract for Block 4 in fiscal  year 2018. DOD expects Block 4 modernization to develop and deliver 80  new capabilities and 17 weapons that were not part of the program\u2019s  original acquisition baseline. In its fiscal year 2017 budget request, DOD  has identified the need for nearly $3 billion over the next 6 years for  development of these new capabilities. We continue to believe that a  development effort of this magnitude should be established as a major  defense acquisition program\u2014as defined in statute and DOD policy\u2014with  a Milestone B review and a separate and distinct business case and  acquisition program baseline. This would make the new program subject  to key statutory oversight mechanisms\u2014including Nunn-McCurdy unit  cost growth thresholds\u2014and DOD would be required to provide regular  cost, schedule, and performance reports to Congress. If Block 4 is  managed as a distinct program with a separate baseline, it would be  easier for Congress and DOD decision makers to track program-specific  cost and schedule progress. A hypothetical $1 billion cost increase in  Block 4 illustrates the difference in cost reporting and oversight. While a  $1 billion cost increase is significant, it would represent growth of less  than 1 percent if tracked against the current F-35 program baseline,  which is currently about $400 billion. That same cost increase, if tracked  against the $3 billion funding estimate reflected in DOD\u2019s budget request  for Block 4, would be more visible, representing a 33 percent cost  increase. This is not the first time DOD has been faced with a decision  like this. As noted in this report, the Air Force\u2019s F-22 modernization  program began in a similar situation. However, the Air Force eventually  chose to hold a Milestone B review for F-22 modernization and manage it  as a separate and distinct acquisition program, which increased  transparency and better facilitated oversight. Therefore, we continue to  believe that our recommendation is valid and as such are making a  matter for congressional consideration.", "We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees, the Secretary of Defense, and Under Secretary of Defense  for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics.
