DOD officials attributed the decrease to a combination of reduced overseas contingency operations, a reduced annual average strength of the force, and a favorable recruiting climate. DOD does not collect and report complete S&I obligation data for the reserve components because, according to officials, there is no requirement to do so and the services would likely need to make changes to their financial and personnel systems to separately track the obligations. However, according to officials, DOD has not explored cost-effective approaches to collect and report this information, which would better position the department to know the full cost of its S&I pay programs.", "The military services largely applied key principles of effective human capital management in the design of their S&I pay programs for nuclear propulsion, aviation, and cybersecurity occupations. However, the application of these key principles varied by service and occupation. Only the Navy's S&I pay programs for nuclear propulsion and aviation fully addressed all seven principles; programs for other occupations and services generally exhibited a mixture of full and partial application. GAO found that, according to officials, DOD and the services had not taken steps to fully ensure consistent application of the principles. For example, DOD has not reviewed the extent to which its S&I pay programs have incorporated principles of effective human capital management and used resources efficiently. DOD also has not established related measures to ensure efficient use of resources. Without such measures, DOD and the services generally assess the effectiveness of S&I pay programs by the extent to which they achieve desired staffing targets. However, this approach does not ensure that S&I pay programs are using resources in the most efficient manner, as DOD guidance requires. Until DOD reviews the extent to which S&I pay programs have incorporated human capital management principles and used resources efficiently\u2014and develops related measures for efficient use of resources\u2014DOD and the services may lack assurance that S&I pay programs are effective and that resources are optimized for the greatest return on investment."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making five recommendations, including that DOD explore reporting reserve S&I pay program data, review the incorporation of human capital management principles and use of resources, and develop related measures.

Collectively, these pay programs aim  to help DOD compensate and incentivize servicemembers for  occupations that are dangerous, are less desirable, or require special  skills and training for which higher compensation is available in the  civilian labor market. In fiscal year 2015, DOD obligated more than $3.4  billion for S&I pays, representing about 3.3 percent of its budget for active  duty cash compensation.", "Cash compensation, which includes S&I pays and basic pay, is part of a  comprehensive compensation package that the department provides to  military personnel, which also includes noncash benefits such as health  care and deferred compensation such as retirement pensions. In its  budget request for fiscal year 2017, DOD noted that it must sustain a  robust pay and benefits package to retain the best warfighters to execute  the national defense strategy. However, DOD also noted the department  must ensure that its military personnel compensation requirements\u2014 which comprise about one-third of the current military budget\u2014do not  crowd out investments in the readiness and modernization portions of the  budget. In fiscal year 2008 Congress authorized a consolidation of the  existing 60 S&I pay authorities (legacy authorities) into 8 authorities  (consolidated authorities) based on broad categories of personnel and  activities. DOD is in the process of implementing the consolidated  authorities by revising existing pay programs in conformance with the new  authorities. Implementation of this change must be complete by January  28, 2018. For additional information on the status of DOD\u2019s  implementation efforts, see appendix I.", "We have issued multiple products and made many recommendations  related to DOD\u2019s efforts to effectively manage its military personnel  compensation incentives. Our March 2011 report on duplication and  opportunities for cost savings in government programs found that DOD  and Congress have expanded military pay and benefits using a  piecemeal approach rather than a total compensation approach that could  help to balance the appropriateness, affordability, and sustainability of  personnel-related costs. The report referenced our past  recommendations, including a 2007 recommendation that DOD should  establish a clear compensation strategy that includes performance  measures to evaluate the efficiency of compensation in meeting recruiting  and retention goals. DOD has taken some steps to evaluate the  effectiveness of specific pay and benefits included in military  compensation but has not comprehensively assessed the effectiveness of  its mix of pays and benefits and used the results to develop a  compensation strategy as we recommended. Most recently, in November  2015, we reported on the extent to which the Office of the Secretary of  Defense, Department of the Army, and the Army National Guard have  conducted their oversight responsibilities of the Army National Guard\u2019s  financial incentives programs. We found that, although Department of  the Army and National Guard regulations require evaluations of the  effectiveness of the Army National Guard financial incentives programs\u2014 including S&I pays such as enlistment and reenlistment bonuses\u2014the  Army and the Army National Guard had not evaluated and documented  the effectiveness of the programs. Further, we reported that DOD did not  include Reserve Component obligation data in required reports that are  used to help ensure that DOD is using the most efficient and cost- effective processes in the recruitment of new personnel. On the basis of  our findings, we recommended that the Secretary of the Army, in  conjunction with the Director, Army National Guard, exercise their  oversight responsibilities by evaluating and documenting the  effectiveness of the Army National Guard\u2019s incentives program in meeting  its goals. In addition, we recommended that DOD enforce its requirement  for the Reserve Components to submit information on the amounts of  incentives obligated and incorporate the required information in the  recruiting resources reports. DOD concurred with the recommendations,  and has taken action to implement the second recommendation. For  additional information on our prior work on military personnel  compensation incentives, see a list of related products at the end of this  report.", "A Senate Armed Services Committee report accompanying a bill for the  National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 includes a  provision for us to review the effectiveness of DOD\u2019s S&I pay programs.  This report assesses (1) trends in DOD obligations for S&I pay programs  for fiscal years 2005 through 2015, and the extent to which DOD reports  such obligations department-wide; and (2) the extent to which the military  services applied key principles of effective human capital management in  the design of S&I pay programs for recruitment and retention of  servicemembers in selected high-skill occupations for fiscal years 2010  through 2015.", "To address our first objective, we obtained and analyzed data on S&I pay  programs from the annual budget justification materials published by  DOD and the military services. We analyzed obligations for S&I pays from  their active and Reserve Component military personnel accounts for fiscal  years 2005 through 2015. We selected this timeframe to enable us to  evaluate trends over time, and fiscal year 2015 was the most recent year of available obligations data at the time of our review. To assess the  reliability of the data on S&I pays, we assessed the completeness of the  data and compared the data against other data sources. As a result of our  assessment and discussions with DOD officials, we determined that  obligation data for active component S&I pay programs were sufficiently  reliable. DOD\u2019s Financial Management Regulation, which provides a  uniform budget and accounting classification that is to be used for  preparing budget estimates, requires the Reserve Components to report  obligations for certain recruiting and retention bonuses but does not  require the services to report all Reserve Component S&I obligation data  separately from other types of compensation. As such, we requested data  on Reserve Component obligations for S&I pay programs from each of  the services. We determined that obligation data for Reserve Component  S&I pay programs\u2014other than those for the Marine Corps Reserve\u2014 were unreliable due to incompleteness or inconsistency, as discussed  later in this report. Further, we examined DOD policy, key statutes,  accounting standards, and federal internal control standards for  developing and reporting cost information to determine the extent to  which they were followed by DOD when reporting on S&I pay  obligations.", "To address our second objective, we selected a non-generalizable  sample of S&I pay programs associated with high-skill occupations from  across the military services to review in greater detail as case studies. In  selecting the case studies, we sought to include (1) a mix of S&I pay  programs associated with an occupation-specific pay authority and S&I  pay programs that apply authorities that are available across occupation  types; (2) programs containing pays in varying stages of implementation;  and (3) at least one emerging occupation. We selected the S&I pay  programs associated with the following three occupations, identified as  \u201chigh-skill\u201d in the congressional provision in Senate Report 114-49, for  focused study: aviation, cybersecurity, and nuclear propulsion. These  occupations were chosen because each service uses different  approaches to offering S&I pays to aviators; cybersecurity is an emerging  occupation for which there are no designated S&I pays; and while the  nuclear propulsion occupation is limited to one military service, it is a  relatively high-cost S&I pay program. While the findings of the case  studies cannot be generalized to all S&I pay programs across DOD, they  reflect a range of characteristics of such programs and are associated  with skills and missions deemed critical by the department. To identify  criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of S&I pay programs designed to  recruit and retain military servicemembers, we reviewed a compilation of  GAO\u2019s body of work on human capital management and DOD\u2019s human  capital guidance. Using these sources, we selected seven key principles  of effective human capital management that can be applied to assess the  effectiveness of the services\u2019 S&I pay programs\u2019 design. We applied  these seven key principles to DOD and service practices for designing  their S&I pay programs associated with the three case study occupations  we selected. In addition to using the key principles, we also compared  aspects of DOD\u2019s S&I pay program guidance with federal internal control  standards that emphasize the importance of establishing clear and  consistent agency objectives.

The 42 percent S&I pay obligation decrease from fiscal years  2005 through 2015 also coincided with a 12 percent decline in active duty  military average strengths. DOD officials attributed the decrease to a  combination of reduced overseas contingency operations, a reduced  annual average strength of the force, and a favorable recruiting climate.

Service officials attributed the increase to the Army and Marine  Corps Grow-the-Force initiative. After peaking in 2008, active duty S&I  pay obligations declined to $3.4 billion in fiscal year 2015.

For example, obligations for hazardous duty pay, which  consolidated legacy pays that traditionally operated as entitlement  authority and was paid to servicemembers performing hazardous duties  enumerated in statute, peaked in fiscal year 2008 to $1.2 billion due to  the operational tempo and steadily declined as a result of the drawdown  in forces to $259 million in fiscal year 2015 (by 79 percent).

This was because DOD\u2019s Financial Management  Regulation, which provides guidance for a uniform budget and  accounting classification that is to be used for preparing budget  estimates, including the budget justification materials we reviewed, does  not require the services to do so. For the active military personnel budget  materials, the regulation contains guidance and a framework that require  the services to separately report obligations for each S&I pay. In contrast,  the regulation requires the Reserve Components to list obligations for  certain bonuses but does not require them to report obligations for all S&I  pays separately; instead, it specifies that many Reserve Component S&I  pays be grouped together with other military personnel obligations under  a single budget activity. For example, in accordance with DOD  guidance, all the Reserve Components reported obligations for  accession, reenlistment, and enlistment bonuses for their administration  and support personnel. In addition to the bonuses, the Navy Reserve  separately identified obligations for aviation continuation pay and foreign  language proficiency pay in its annual budget materials for its  administration and support personnel. The Air Force Reserve also  separately identified obligations for foreign language proficiency pay in its  annual budget materials for its administration and support personnel.  However, for many of the other S&I pays, the services grouped S&I pay  obligations with other military personnel obligations under a single budget  activity, as is allowed under the regulation.", "We requested that the Reserve Components provide us with S&I pay  obligation data that were not contained in annual budget materials, but  the Marine Corps reserve was the only Reserve Component that was  able to provide obligations for each S&I pay for all the years included in  our review (fiscal years 2005 through 2015). Army, Navy, and Air Force  officials told us that their systems were not originally designed to collect  and report obligations for individual S&I pays for the Reserve  Components. As a result, the Army and the Air Force could not provide  additional data. The Navy provided some additional data, but we  determined that these data were not reliable because of inconsistencies  and incompleteness. For example, the Navy could not provide obligation  data for all S&I pays\u2014instead providing execution data. Further,  according to Navy officials, certain S&I pays are not consistently  categorized in their system, making it difficult to identify cost trends in  these S&I pays over time. Further, these services could not provide the  portion of their Reserve Components\u2019 military personnel budgets that S&I  pay obligations represent. S&I pay obligations for the Marine Corps  Reserve accounted for roughly 2 percent ($172 million) of its total military  personnel budget on average from fiscal years 2005 through 2015.  However, this percentage may not be representative of all the services\u2019  Reserve Components, as the services\u2019 reliance on S&I pays can vary, as  we observed variability among the active components. Similarly to active  duty S&I pay obligations, Marine Corps Reserve data also indicated that  obligations peaked in fiscal year 2009 due in part to an increased offering  of new enlistment bonuses.

In  support of DOD\u2019s policy to use the most efficient and cost-effective  processes in the military services\u2019 recruitment of new personnel, DOD  components are required to track and report all resource information  applicable to enlisted members and officers who join the military services,  including recruitment incentives.

The cost  information can also be used by program managers in making managerial  decisions to improve operating economy and efficiency.", "According to the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller),  there is no requirement to collect and report obligations separately for  each of the Reserve Component\u2019s S&I pays. For example, guidance such  as DOD\u2019s Financial Management Regulation for DOD\u2019s annual budget  justification materials does not require the Reserve Components to collect  and report such data. As a result, with the exception of the Marine Corps  Reserve, the Reserve Components have not collected and reported S&I  pay obligations separately. Furthermore, officials noted that there is no  requirement to collect this information because the Reserve Component  personnel generally accrue S&I pays at a much lower rate than do active  duty personnel. DOD officials told us that the services would likely need  to make programming changes to various financial and personnel systems in order to separately track and report Reserve Component S&I  pay obligations in their budget materials. However, DOD officials were  unable to provide estimates of the costs associated with making such  changes, and they told us that DOD has not explored other approaches  that may be cost-effective to collect and report such information.

Although S&I pay amounts provided to Reserve Component  servicemembers are most likely a fraction of what is paid to the active  component servicemembers, the total amounts could add to hundreds of  millions of dollars over time, on the basis of data provided by the Marine  Corps. Furthermore, according to Marine Corps officials, analysts were  able to obtain data on S&I obligations for the fiscal years under our review  using their financial pay systems without making any changes to these  systems.

Together, these practices align with the  principles of effective human capital management. For example, the  Navy\u2019s approach addresses key principle #2 by considering the high  replacement costs of its nuclear personnel\u2014up to $986,000 per trainee\u2014 in justifying a strategy that prioritizes investment in retention initiatives  over new accessions or recruits. In addition, the Navy sets optimal bonus  amounts for nuclear officers and enlisted personnel by monitoring civilian  nuclear salaries and employment demand (key principle #7), studying the  effects of changes to bonus amounts on retention behavior (key principle  #5), and making changes to bonus amounts as appropriate (key principle  #4). Moreover, the Navy makes informed decisions about its investments  in S&I pay programs for nuclear personnel by using both quantitative and  qualitative models for predicting numbers of personnel and retention rates  as accurately as possible (key principle #6). Finally, Navy officials perform  periodic personnel audits to ensure that recipients of its nuclear-related  S&I pays are continuing to meet eligibility criteria, thereby helping to  ensure that only qualified members are retained (key principle #3)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Aviation Occupation", "paragraphs": ["We found that the Navy fully addressed each of the seven key principles  of effective human capital management in managing its program to retain  pilots. The Army, the Marine Corps, and the Air Force largely applied the  principles, but we found that the extent to which the services addressed  the key principles varied (see figure 3). For example, all of the services  identified opportunities to improve their S&I pay programs, and  incorporate these changes into the next planning cycle (key principle #6).  The Navy and the Marine Corps addressed key principle #6 for their  Aviation Continuation Pay (ACP) program by (1) offering different pay  amounts to pilots by specific platform (the model of aircraft a pilot  operates) and (2) reducing or suspending the pay when staffing goals had  been achieved. In contrast, the Air Force offered ACP to broad categories  of pilots across multiple platforms, and it generally offered the maximum  amount allowed by law. Only the Navy and Marine Corps fully  incorporated quality measures into decisions to offer S&I pays to pilots  (key principle #3). For example, the Navy incorporated quality into its  ACP program by targeting the bonus to pilots on track for Department  Head positions and canceling bonus contracts for pilots who were not  promoted to Department Head. In contrast, the Air Force considered the  expected positive effect on retention as a factor for offering ACP, but did  not specifically consider the relative quality of pilots within a targeted  community as a factor for awarding an ACP contract.", "In addition, the services varied in how they incorporated a review of the  civilian aviation sector in their decisions to offer retention bonuses to  pilots (key principle #7). For example, the Army has not reviewed or  considered commercial aviation in the context of its S&I pay program for  pilots\u2014largely because the Army provided ACP only to special operations  pilots, and the skillset required for this mission does not have a clear  civilian-sector equivalent. The Navy fully addressed this principle by  specifically identifying comparable salary levels for commercial aviation  pilots. The Air Force and the Marine Corps partially addressed this  principle by considering the relationship between the compensation  offered to their pilots and to commercial aviation pilots, but they did not  specifically identify comparable salary levels and use them to determine  retention bonus amounts. In addition, the services reached different  conclusions about the extent to which the civilian aviation sector  competes with the military for pilots. Specifically, the Navy stated that  airline compensation would have to increase in order to have a significant  impact on the retention of Navy pilots, and the Marine Corps reported that  the potential increase in hiring by commercial airlines did not warrant the  offering of ACP bonuses in fiscal year 2013. In contrast, the Air Force\u2019s  reports endorsing aviator retention bonuses stated that civilian aviation  compensation factored into the Air Force\u2019s decision to keep bonus  amounts at the statutory limit of $25,000 per year. In February 2014, we  reported that commercial aviation compensation decreased by almost 10  percent in constant dollars from 2000 to 2012. In July 2016, DOD  reported to Congress on aviation-related S&I pays. DOD\u2019s report stated  that the military has experienced high levels of pilot retention as a result  of decreased civilian airline pilot salaries, significantly reduced civilian  airline pilot hiring, increased military pay and benefits, and an increased  sense of duty and patriotism after the events of September 11, 2001.  However, the report added that the department anticipated that increased  hiring by commercial airlines over the ensuing 5 to 7 years could  necessitate increasing bonus amounts from $25,000 per year to a range  of $38,500 to $62,500 per year. As such, DOD\u2019s report requested that  Congress consider increasing the rates of Aviation Career Incentive Pay,  and specifically increase the maximum authorized level of Aviation  Continuation Pay from $25,000 per year to $35,000 per year."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Cybersecurity Occupation", "paragraphs": ["Similar to our findings with regard to aviation-related S&I pay programs,  we found that the services are also not consistently applying the  principles of effective human capital management in implementing S&I  pay programs for their cybersecurity personnel. As shown in figure 3  above, our assessment found that although none of the services fully  addressed all seven principles for the cybersecurity occupation, they all  addressed each principle at least partially. Each service consistently  addressed three of the seven principles, including having clear and  consistently applied criteria (key principle #1), considering the  replacement cost of personnel (key principle #2), and identifying  opportunities for improvement and incorporating them in planning (key  principle #6). For example, the Army, the Navy, the Air Force and the  Marine Corps have all addressed several principles through their  development of criteria to guide their decisions to invest in SRBs for  cybersecurity personnel. Examples of those criteria include growing  requirements; personnel replacement costs (including training); and  mission criticality of the skill set. Service officials stated that they  considered replacement costs and noted that replacing these personnel  would be more costly than offering an SRB. According to service officials,  depending on the military occupational specialty, after initial military  training, specialized training may take from 8 months to 3 years. Service  officials cited costs to train their cyberforces as ranging from about $23,000 to over $500,000. We found that the Navy and the Marine Corps  have taken steps to implement their S&I pay programs in a way that  would help retain the most valuable personnel in the cybersecurity  occupation in terms of top performance (key principle #3). For example, in  order to retain the most qualified personnel, in fiscal year 2012 the Marine  Corps began to use a rating system that would help decision-makers to  differentiate Marines\u2019 performance during the reenlistment process.  According to Army and Air Force officials, the purpose of the SRB  program is to retain adequate numbers of qualified enlisted personnel  serving in critical skills, and the bonus generally was not designed to  target top performers. Further, we found that only the Army has tailored  its SRB program to target cybersecurity personnel within non-designated  cyber career fields (key principle #4). Specifically, the Army further targets  personnel in career fields by location and skill, which enables it to target  cybersecurity personnel in non-designated cyber career fields. The  Marine Corps and the Air Force do not target cybersecurity personnel in  non-designated cyber career fields. According to Navy officials, they do  not have designated cybersecurity career fields and do not directly target  cybersecurity personnel when offering bonuses. In addition, the services  varied in how they incorporated a review of the civilian cybersecurity  occupation in their decisions to offer S&I pays to cybersecurity personnel  (key principle #7). For example, as part of determining the amount to  offer, the Army and the Navy considered the wage of civilians in cyber- related career fields. The Navy noted in its justification for offering  selective reenlistment bonuses that sailors within cyber-related career  fields could qualify for positions in the civilian workforce with salaries  starting at $90,000 with a $5,000 to $10,000 sign-on bonus. According to  Marine Corps and Air Force officials, the Marine Corps and the Air Force  did not consider civilian wages in cyber-related career fields when  determining whether to offer a retention bonus."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOD And the Military Services Did Not Take Steps to Fully Ensure the Effectiveness of S&I Pay Programs\u2019 Design", "paragraphs": ["As noted above, the military services largely incorporated key principles  of effective human capital management into the S&I pay programs used  for nuclear propulsion, aviation, and cybersecurity occupations. However,  our review found that DOD and the services have not taken steps to fully  ensure consistent application of the principles in some S&I pay programs  for these selected occupations and to ensure effective program design.  First, although DOD reports have stated that S&I pays are used  efficiently, we found that DOD has not taken steps to support this  conclusion. Specifically, DOD has not reviewed whether its S&I pay  programs have incorporated the key principles of human capital  management that we identified, or whether they have used resources  efficiently because DOD officials told us that the services and different  occupations have unique needs that make comparison and assessment  difficult. DOD guidance pertaining to enumerated S&I pay programs  generally requires the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Personnel and  Readiness, using delegated authority, to monitor and propose revisions to  bonus and special pay programs. For example, DOD Directive 1304.21  directs the Principal Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel  and Readiness, acting under the Under Secretary of Defense for  Personnel and Readiness, to monitor bonus programs of the military  services and recommend measures required to attain the most efficient  use of resources devoted to programs on enlistment bonuses, accession  bonuses for new officers in critical skills, selective reenlistment bonuses,  and critical skills retention bonuses for active members. Consistent with  the policy, the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and  Readiness monitors the services\u2019 S&I pay programs, including bonuses.  However, on the basis of interviews with DOD officials, we found that  DOD has not systematically included in its monitoring efforts a review of  whether S&I pay programs have used resources efficiently, nor has it  developed measures required to attain efficient use of S&I pay program  resources. The officials stated that DOD has contracted with a research  organization to develop a quantitative modeling tool that would enable the  services to set cost-efficient bonus amounts. Such a tool may help the  services to consistently apply human capital management principle #3 in  instances where they are not already doing so in their S&I pay programs  for aviation and cybersecurity (see figure 3). This principle calls for  investment decisions to be based on expected improvement in agency  results and implemented in a manner that fosters top talent. Depending  on the inputs to the modeling tool, once developed, it could also help the  Army, the Marine Corps, and the Air Force to address principle #7 by  assessing civilian supply, demand, and wages and by updating their  plans as needed for their S&I pay programs. According to DOD officials,  however, progress on this effort has been slowed by competing  priorities\u2014that is, by the department\u2019s focus on adjusting the military  retirement system. In the absence of measures for ensuring efficiency in  S&I pay programs, DOD and the services generally assess their S&I pay  programs\u2019 effectiveness by the extent to which they achieve desired  staffing targets. However, this approach does not ensure that S&I pay  programs are using resources in the most efficient manner, as DOD  guidance requires. Until DOD reviews whether its S&I pay programs have  incorporated the key principles of human capital management that we  identified, reviews whether the programs have used resources efficiently,  and prioritizes and completes the establishment of measures for efficient  use of resources, DOD and the services may lack assurance that S&I pay  programs are effective and that resources are optimized for the greatest  return on investment.", "Secondly, on the basis of our interviews with DOD officials, we found that  the department has not assessed the extent to which its non-monetary  incentives could result in the retention of personnel at a lower cost than  S&I pays and with equal or better effectiveness. An assessment of this  kind would help the services to consistently apply human capital  principles #4 and #5 in its cybersecurity S&I pay programs (see figure 3).  Specifically, an assessment of non-monetary incentives would help  ensure that approaches are tailored to meet the services\u2019 needs by  identifying and evaluating unique staffing issues, and by collecting and  reviewing historical retention data to evaluate the effects and  performance of S&I pay programs. In our case study review of S&I pay  programs associated with the nuclear propulsion program, Navy officials  told us that changes to S&I pays provide only short-term solutions when  retention shortfalls are caused by servicemembers\u2019 quality-of-life  concerns about things like deployment lengths and geographic instability.  As a result, Navy officials told us that they use a variety of non-monetary  incentives to complement S&I pays for retention purposes, including  guarantees for shore duty and graduate education opportunities. We  found that DOD and the services also take steps to understand what non- monetary incentives improve servicemember satisfaction and retention.  For example, through its periodic Status of Forces surveys, DOD collects  information from servicemembers on their satisfaction with non-monetary  incentives and their plans to leave or stay in the military, among other  things. In addition, DOD officials told us that the services collect feedback  from servicemembers who are separating to understand their reasons for  leaving. However, according to DOD officials, they have not taken steps  to routinely leverage existing feedback mechanisms and evaluate  whether these non-monetary approaches can be expanded as less costly  alternatives to address retention challenges, because they believe that  S&I pay programs may be more efficient than non-monetary incentives.  Without conducting routine assessments of the impact of non-monetary  incentive approaches on retention behavior and on the necessary levels  of S&I pays, DOD and the services do not know whether they are using  the most efficient and effective combination of incentives for achieving  retention objectives at the lowest possible cost.", "Third, with regard to key principle #3, department-level guidance on S&I  pay programs does not explicitly incorporate personnel performance into  eligibility criteria or retention decisions as a way to foster top talent and  improve program results. For example, DOD guidance we reviewed on  critical skills retention bonuses does not include explicit provisions  addressing personnel performance that would ensure that monetary  incentives are targeted to top performers. At the service-level, some but  not all S&I pay programs for the three case study occupations included  direction for targeting pays to personnel based on their levels of  performance, consistent with principle #3. For example, the Navy  reported that they implement their program for awarding aviation retention  bonuses to pilots to explicitly connect the bonus contract to a pilot\u2019s  successful promotion to a department head position. If the pilot fails to be  promoted, the bonus contract is canceled. In addition, the Navy\u2019s  instruction on its nuclear officer incentive pay program considers  performance by excluding servicemembers who are undergoing  disciplinary actions, who failed to maintain nuclear qualifications, or who  failed to be selected for promotions, among other things. DOD officials  told us that S&I pay programs were not designed to target top performers  and that the services use other means to recognize performance, such as  promotions. Federal internal control standards emphasize the importance  of establishing clear and consistent agency objectives, which would apply  to DOD\u2019s determination about incorporating personnel performance into  eligibility criteria or retention decisions for its S&I pay programs. Until  the services clarify existing guidance for S&I pay programs regarding the  extent to which personnel performance should be incorporated into  retention decisions where appropriate, consistent with principle #3, the  application and understanding of the guidance may be inconsistent  among service officials responsible for managing S&I pay programs.", "Finally, with regard to key principle #4, which calls for tailoring  approaches for meeting organizational needs by evaluating unique  staffing issues, we found that the military services have awarded SRBs to  cybersecurity personnel in accordance with their broader military  occupational specialty rather than tailoring the awards toward the skill  sets within those specialties that have specific or unique staffing  shortfalls. According to information received from service officials, the  services have some cybersecurity specific career fields; however, each  military service continues to assign cybersecurity personnel to military  occupational specialties that include other types of personnel skill sets,  such as intelligence or information technology. However, the Army  recently began to tailor its SRB program to target cybersecurity  personnel. The Navy, the Marine Corps, and the Air Force\u2014unlike the  Army\u2014have not imposed other conditions by which to direct SRBs to  personnel with specific cybersecurity skill sets within a broader military  occupational specialty. According to service officials, cybersecurity is an  emerging occupation, and the services have not yet assigned all of their  cybersecurity personnel to cybersecurity-designated career fields. Marine  Corps officials told us, for example, that cybersecurity within the enlisted  community is often a secondary skill set associated with other primary  specialties. According to DOD officials, the Marine Corps has the ability to  target SRBs to a secondary skill; however according to Marine Corps  officials, the Marine Corps has not begun to do this for the cybersecurity  community. As a result, these services have not awarded SRBs to  personnel with cybersecurity skill sets without also awarding it to other  skill sets within the same occupational specialty that may not have the  same staffing needs. DOD\u2019s policy on the enlisted bonus program states  that the SRB may be used to obtain the reenlistment or voluntary  extension of an enlistment in exchange for a member\u2019s agreement to  serve for a specified period in at least one of the following reenlistment or  extension categories: a designated military skill, career field, unit, or  grade; or to meet some other condition or conditions imposed by the  Secretary of the Military Department concerned. Until the services  develop approaches to directly target SRBs to personnel with  cybersecurity skill sets, they may award SRBs to specialties that include  non-cybersecurity personnel for whom the SRB is unneeded. Further,  without consistently targeting their SRBs toward specific skill sets, the  services may not be using the SRBs as cost-effectively as possible."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Strategic management of S&I pay programs is important to support  DOD\u2019s ability to sustain its all-volunteer force, providing a suite of flexible  compensation approaches that can be used to address staffing issues  more efficiently than basic pay increases. In addition, the effective use of  S&I pay programs, like other components of military compensation, is  important for the efficient use of budgetary resources. As DOD officials  seek to efficiently manage the department\u2019s budget, S&I pay programs  are likely to be a continued area in which to find efficiencies and cost  savings. However, without exploring cost-effective approaches to collect  and report complete obligation data for each S&I pay program for the  Reserve Components, DOD may not know the full cost of its S&I pay  programs, may not be able to make fully informed decisions about  resource allocation, and may not be able to evaluate program  performance over time. According to DOD officials, DOD has also not  reviewed the extent to which the services\u2019 S&I pay programs incorporate  key principles of effective human capital management, or whether S&I  pay programs have used resources efficiently; nor has it prioritized and  completed the establishment of measures for ensuring the efficient use of  resources.

However, as noted in our report, each military  service has assigned cybersecurity personnel to military occupational  specialties that include other types of personnel skill sets, such as  intelligence or information technology.

DOD also noted that for many special pays, detailed  eligibility rules and precise payment amounts are set in statute and could  only be changed by congressional action. As a result, when staffing  needs or market conditions change, managers sometimes could not  adjust special and incentive (S&I) pay eligibility criteria or payment levels  in response to those changing circumstances. DOD recommended that  the more than 60 S&I pays be replaced with 8 broad categories.

We normalized S&I pay obligations  data to constant fiscal year 2015 dollars using the series of military  personnel deflators for fiscal years 2005 through 2015 published in  DOD\u2019s National Defense Budget Estimates for Fiscal Year 2015. To  analyze trends in S&I pay obligations over time across the active military  service components, we obtained obligations for the more than 60 S&I  pays across the services and grouped them into nine categories in  accordance with the consolidated pay categories authorized by Congress  in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008. We  compared each active component\u2019s total S&I pay obligations from fiscal  years 2005 through 2015 with each service\u2019s total military personnel  obligations. In addition, we obtained average strength numbers from the  annual budget justification materials and compared these data with the  services\u2019 S&I pay obligations and assessed any possible correlation. We  discussed with service officials the factors that may have contributed to  trends we identified in the S&I pay obligations data we reviewed. To  assess the reliability of the data on S&I pays, we assessed the  completeness of the data and compared the data against other data  sources. GAO has designated DOD\u2019s financial management area as high  risk due to long-standing deficiencies in DOD\u2019s systems, processes, and  internal controls. Since some of these systems provide the data used in  the budgeting process, there are limitations to the use of DOD budget  data. However, based on discussions with appropriate DOD officials and  our comparison of the trends in the budget data against other data  sources, we determined that the S&I pay obligation data for the active  component are sufficiently reliable for showing overall trends for S&I  pays. However, we determined that data for Reserve Component S&I  pays were unreliable due to incompleteness or inconsistency, as  described earlier in this report. We compared the available Reserve  Component data with guidance established in DOD\u2019s Financial  Management Regulation, which provides guidance for a uniform budget  and accounting classification that is to be used for preparing budget  estimates, including the budget justification materials we reviewed.  Further, we examined DOD policy, key statutes and accounting standards  for developing and reporting cost information to determine the extent to  which they were followed by DOD when reporting on S&I pay  obligations. We compared the available Reserve Component data with  guidance established in DOD\u2019s Financial Management Regulation and  with federal internal control standards to determine the extent to which  the guidance was followed.", "To address our second objective, we selected a non-generalizable  sample of three high-skill occupations from across the military services to  review in greater detail as case studies. For the purposes of this review,  we limited the scope and definition of \u201chigh-skill occupations\u201d to the six  occupations identified in Senate Report 114-49: nuclear maintenance and  engineering (i.e., nuclear propulsion), pilots (i.e., aviation), critical  language skills, information technology, cyber warfare (i.e.,  cybersecurity), and special operations. In selecting case studies from this  pool of occupations, we sought to include (1) a mix of S&I pay programs  associated with an occupation-specific pay authority and S&I pay  programs that apply authorities that are available across occupation  types; (2) programs containing pays in varying stages of implementing the  consolidation authorities established in the National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008; and (3) at least one emerging  occupation. On the basis of these three criteria, we selected nuclear  propulsion, aviation, and cybersecurity as case studies. We selected  nuclear because there are occupation-specific pays for nuclear personnel  and the consolidation special bonus and incentive pay authorities for  nuclear officers were completely implemented. We selected aviation  because there are occupation-specific pays for aviators and the  consolidation special aviation incentive pay and bonus authorities have  not been fully implemented. In addition, we selected aviation because of  the recent policy changes for aviation-related S&I pays involving remotely piloted aircraft pilots. Lastly, we selected cybersecurity because it is an  emerging career field.", "While the information obtained from the case studies is not generalizable  for all occupations across DOD, it enabled us to obtain the perspectives  of how the services use their S&I pay programs for the three high-skill  occupations we selected.", "To determine the extent to which the military services applied key  principles of effective human capital management in the design of their  S&I pay programs associated with our selected occupations, we reviewed  DOD and service policies and guidance on the special and incentive pays  used for the three occupations we selected. We analyzed available data  and reports from the military services on the eligibility criteria, pay  amounts, and numbers of recipients in each of the occupations, and we  discussed with cognizant officials the context for changes to the S&I pay  programs targeting these occupations. For our selected occupations, we  reviewed the services\u2019 retention, assignment, and officer accession S&I  pay obligations to analyze trends and to understand reasons for any  fluctuations we identified from fiscal years 2010 through 2015. To identify  key principles of effective human capital management, we reviewed a  compilation of GAO\u2019s body of work on human capital management,  DOD\u2019s Eleventh Quadrennial Review of Military Compensation, and the  DOD Diversity and Inclusion Strategic Plan 2012 - 2017. Using these  sources, we assembled a list of seven key principles of effective human  capital management. To identify the extent to which the services met  these key principles in the design of their S&I pay programs, we reviewed  the principles and compared them with service-provided documentation  on the S&I pay programs for our three case studies, including policies and  guidance, administrative messages, program proposals and justifications,  as well as with information obtained through interviews with service  officials. The analysts then used this comparison between the principles  and the service information to determine whether each service\u2019s  approach to the pay programs for our case studies was consistent with  each principle. Specifically, for each case study of S&I pay programs  associated with nuclear propulsion, aviation, and cyber operations, an  analyst independently assessed whether each service\u2019s processes for  planning, implementing, and monitoring the pay programs addressed,  partially addressed, or did not address the seven principles of human  capital management. By addressed, we mean the principle was applied  throughout the program and demonstrated through documentation and  testimonial information from interviews with service officials; by partially  addressed, we mean one or more parts of the principle, but not all parts,  were explicitly addressed (e.g., the principle is addressed for one or a few  pays within a program, but not for all; or the principle is demonstrated  through policy but not through implementation); and by not addressed, we  mean that no part of the principle was explicitly addressed from reviewing  program documentation or interviews with officials. Following the initial  case study assessments, a second analyst reviewed all available  documentation and testimonial evidence for each principle and each  service\u2019s programs and made an assessment about the extent to which  the principle was addressed. Where the two analysts disagreed, they  discussed the evidence and reached consensus on the extent to which  the principle in question was addressed. Once the assessment process  was completed, we reviewed our results with cognizant DOD and service  officials and incorporated their feedback or additional information where  appropriate. In addition to the key principles for effective human capital  management, we also compared aspects of DOD\u2019s application of S&I pay  program guidance with federal internal control standards that emphasize  the importance of establishing clear and consistent agency objectives.", "To determine DOD\u2019s progress in consolidating S&I pay programs from  legacy statutory authorities to new authorities established in the National  Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008, we met with cognizant  DOD officials and we obtained and reviewed documentation related to  DOD\u2019s implementation and status of the pay consolidation, such as  updated or new DOD instructions resulting from the consolidation effort.", "We interviewed officials or, where appropriate, obtained documentation at  the organizations listed below:  Office of the Secretary of Defense", "Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and", "Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, Comptroller", "Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Manpower and", "Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs", "Defense Manpower Data Center  Department of the Air Force", "Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Financial", "Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Manpower, Personnel and  Services (A1)", "Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff of the Army, G-1", "Army Human Resources Command", "Office of the Chief of the Army Reserve", "Office of the Director of the Army National Guard", "Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Manpower and", "Office of the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Manpower,  Personnel, Training, and Operations (N1)", "Office of the Deputy Commandant of the Marine Corps for Programs", "Office of the Deputy Commandant of the Marine Corps for Manpower  and Reserve Affairs  We conducted this performance audit from July 2015 to February 2017 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
