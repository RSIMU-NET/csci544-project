It is used to prevent terrorism, and provide border security and law enforcement, case management, and intelligence functions for multiple federal, state, and local agencies. It has become increasingly difficult and expensive to maintain because of technology obsolescence and its inability to support new mission requirements. Accordingly, in 2008, DHS began an effort to modernize the system. It is being managed as two separate programs working in parallel by CBP and ICE.", "GAO's objectives were to (1) determine the scope and status of the two TECS Mod programs, (2) assess selected CBP and ICE program management practices for TECS Mod, and (3) assess the extent to which DHS is executing effective executive oversight and governance of the two TECS Mod programs.", "To do so, GAO reviewed requirements documents and cost and schedule estimates, and determined the current scope, completion dates, and life cycle expenditures. GAO also reviewed risk management and requirements management plans, as well as governance bodies' meeting minutes."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has defined the scope for its TECS (not an acronym) modernization (TECS Mod) program, but its schedule and cost continue to change; while Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is overhauling the scope, schedule, and cost of its program after discovering that its initial solution is not technically viable. CBP's $724 million program intends to modernize the functionality, data, and aging infrastructure of legacy TECS and move it to DHS's data centers. CBP plans to develop, deploy, and implement these capabilities between 2008 and 2015. To date, CBP has deployed functionality to improve its secondary inspection processes to air and sea ports of entry and, more recently, to land ports of entry in 2013. However, CBP is in the process of revising its schedule baseline for the second time in under a year. Further, portions of CBP's schedule remain undefined and the program does not have a fully developed master schedule. These factors increase the risk of CBP not delivering TECS Mod by its 2015 deadline. Regarding ICE's $818 million TECS Mod program, it is redesigning and replanning its program, having determined in June 2013 that its initial solution was not viable and could not support ICE's needs. As a result, ICE halted development and is now assessing design alternatives and will revise its schedule and cost estimates. Program officials stated the revisions will be complete in December 2013. Until ICE completes the replanning effort, it is unclear what functionality it will deliver, when it will deliver it, or what it will cost to do so, thus putting it in jeopardy of not completing the modernization by its 2015 deadline.", "CBP and ICE have managed many risks in accordance with some leading practices, but they have had mixed results in managing requirements for their programs. In particular, neither program identified all known risks and escalated them for timely management review. Further, CBP's guidance defines key practices associated with effectively managing requirements, but important requirements development activities were underway before these practices were established. ICE, meanwhile, operated without requirements management guidance for years, and its requirements activities were mismanaged as a result. For example, ICE did not complete work on 2,600 requirements in its initial release, which caused testing failures and the deferral and deletion of about 70 percent of its original requirements. ICE issued requirements guidance in March 2013 that is consistent with leading practices, but it has not yet been implemented.", "The Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) governance bodies have taken actions to oversee the two TECS Mod programs that are generally aligned with leading practices. Specifically, DHS's governance bodies have monitored TECS Mod performance and progress and have ensured that corrective actions have been identified and tracked. However, the governance bodies' oversight has been based on sometimes incomplete or inaccurate data, and therefore the effectiveness of these efforts is limited. For example, one oversight body rated CBP's program as moderately low risk, based partially on the program's use of earned value management, even though program officials stated that neither they nor their contractor had this capability. Until these governance bodies base their performance reviews on timely, complete, and accurate data, they will be constrained in their ability to effectively provide oversight."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is recommending DHS improve its efforts to manage requirement and risk, as well as its governance of the TECS Mod programs.

Appendix IV provides additional information about these projects.", "However, the program is revising its schedule and cost baselines, making  its remaining commitments uncertain. Specifically, the program is revising  its acquisition program baseline for a second time in under a year. In  particular, CBP revised the program\u2019s initial acquisition program baseline  in November 2012, establishing new commitments for the program\u2019s cost  and schedule for each of the projects, as well as the program overall.  According to program officials in June 2013, CBP is in the process of  again revising its program baseline, and plans to do so by September  2013. Officials explained that this time, CBP is revising its commitments  to reflect actual cost and schedule data gathered since its last revision.", "The completion dates for each of CBP\u2019s five projects have changed over  time. Specifically, four of the projects are scheduled to be delivered later  than originally planned and one project\u2014Primary Inspection Processes\u2014 is scheduled to be completed ahead of the initial schedule. For example,  according to the October 2009 program plan, Secondary Inspection was  to be operational in September 2012. That operational date was then  modified in the program\u2019s acquisition program baseline (which was  approved in October 2010) to be June 2013 (9 months later than  originally scheduled). Then, in May 2011, CBP notified DHS that it was  going to miss the deadline for several of its schedule milestones,  including Secondary Inspection. As a result, CBP revised its schedule  baseline for TECS Mod in November 2012; the new operational date for  the project was to be March 2014. That date was reiterated in the CBP- ICE Joint Integration Process document, signed by CBP and ICE program  management, upon its release in April 2013. However, shortly  thereafter, the program again revised the operational date to be  September 2013. Figure 3 illustrates the changes to CBP\u2019s schedules for  the five projects over time.", "Exacerbating the rebaselining and the schedule changes over time is the  fact that CBP has not fully developed its master schedule to manage work  activities and to monitor the program\u2019s progress. Our research has  identified, among other things, that a key element associated with a  complete and useful schedule or roadmap for executing a program such  as TECS Mod is to logically sequence all work activities so that start and  finish dates of future activities, as well as key events based on the status  of completed and in-progress activities, can be reliably forecast. While  the program office has developed high-level schedules for each of its  projects, officials explained that the program has not fully defined and  documented all the linkages between work activities within the individual  project schedules, nor have they defined dependencies that exist  between projects in the master schedule. The program\u2019s master schedule  provided to us in May 2013 showed that approximately 65 percent of  CBP\u2019s remaining work activities were not linked with other associated  work activities. Without these linkages, activities that slip early in the  schedule do not transmit delays to activities that should depend on them,  and a critical path cannot be determined, which means that  management is unable to determine how a slip in the completion date of a  particular task may affect the overall project schedule. Moreover, as of  June 2013, the program had not yet developed a detailed schedule for  the last project, Primary Inspection Processes, nor had it completed a  detailed schedule for parts of the second project, High Performance  Primary Query. Instead of managing from a fully developed master  schedule, officials explained that they manage the program according to  the milestones in the program\u2019s acquisition program baseline, and do so  by sharing information about project and program dependencies at  meetings between project teams. However, the lack of a complete  schedule raises questions about the validity of the milestones in its  acquisition program baseline, and the certainty of the program\u2019s schedule  commitments.", "Furthermore, the program\u2019s current schedule assumes the concurrent  delivery of four of the five projects. As we have previously reported, the  concurrent development of system components (e.g., the five TECS  modernization projects) introduces risks that could adversely impact  program cost and schedule. Such risks include the contention for  limited resources. For the CBP TECS modernization program, these risks  may be realized. In particular, program officials told us that development  work for the Primary Inspection Processes was halted because of  anticipated funding shortfalls due to sequestration. However, when the  funding shortfalls were not realized, the program was unable to initiate  Primary Inspection Processes development because, according to the  Passenger Systems Program Office Executive Director, the program\u2019s  contractor resources had been diverted to other projects and shifting  those resources back to Primary Inspection Processes would affect work  on these projects. The Executive Director further stated that if work on  Primary Inspection did not begin by January 2014, the program would not  meet its operational date of September 2015.", "Program officials said that reasons for the schedule weaknesses include  a lack of appropriate and skilled resources. Specifically, program officials  stated that the program has only two staff members with skills needed to  develop and maintain the schedules, and that fully documenting all the  dependencies would be time consuming and not worth the effort because  in their view, the limitations in the integrated master schedule were not  sufficient to warrant the additional resources that would be necessary to  fix them. However, without a complete and integrated master schedule  that includes all program work activities and associated dependencies,  CBP is not in a position to accurately determine the amount of time  required to complete its TECS modernization effort and develop realistic  milestones. Moreover, the program does not have a basis for guiding the  projects\u2019 execution and measuring progress, thus increasing the agency\u2019s  risk of not meeting the program\u2019s completion dates.", "Similar to TECS Mod\u2019s schedule milestones, the program\u2019s cost  estimates have also changed as a result of rebaselining, and are currently  being revised. The program\u2019s current baselined life-cycle cost estimate  is approximately $724 million, including $31 million for planning  management, $212 million for development, and $481 million for  operations and maintenance. However, as previously stated, the program  is in the process of revising its estimate. As of August 2013, the program  reported that it had expended about $226 million\u2014approximately $170  million for planning/program management and development/acquisition,  and $56 million for operations and maintenance.", "While officials reaffirmed their intention to complete the whole program by  the 2015 deadline, the program faces the risk of not doing so because its  specific schedule milestones for each of the projects are based on  incomplete schedule information and concurrency among the projects has  resulted in competition for the same contracting resources.

Specific capabilities that were to be  provided include: basic electronic case management functions, including opening  cases, performing supervisory review of cases, and closing cases  within the system; development of reports for use as evidentiary material in court  proceedings arising from ICE agents\u2019 investigations; maintenance of records relating to the subjects of ICE  investigations; and audit capabilities to monitor system usage.", "Phase 2: Comprehensive Case Management: This phase was to  expand on the features delivered as part of phase one and to be  delivered in four increments starting in 2016, with an estimated  completion date in fiscal year 2017.", "Regarding costs, ICE\u2019s baselined life-cycle cost estimate is  approximately $818 million, including about $17 million for planning,  roughly $328 million for development and acquisition, and approximately  $473 million for operations and maintenance.", "However, in 2012 the program began to experience technical issues,  which resulted in a delay of approximately 7 months and the deferral or  removal of functionality from Release 1. Specifically, ICE decided in 2012  that Release 1 would only provide functionality for the \u201cperson\u201d type of  subject records; all the other types of subject records have been deferred  to future releases. Then, in October 2012, the agency conducted a  review of the program\u2019s remaining work for Release 1 to determine  whether, in light of increasing rates of program defects and a slowdown in  the program\u2019s overall progress, ICE was positioned to deliver Release 1  as planned. Based on the review results, the agency deferred or  eliminated approximately 3,000 out of the 4,300 in-scope requirements  (about 70 percent of the original total) in order for the program to meet its  planned schedule commitments. Such functionality includes the capability  to perform supervisory review of cases and certain electronic notifications  and alerts.", "Faced with continuing technical issues and related delays, ICE\u2019s program  manager said that the program initiated a second program review in  January 2013 at the direction of its executive steering committee and with  participation from the program office, the contractor, and Homeland  Security Investigations. Based on the review results, the program office  determined in June 2013 that the system under development was not  technically viable and would not be fielded as part of ICE\u2019s final solution  due to ongoing technical difficulties relative to the user interface, access  controls, and case-related data management. Instead of continuing with  the current technical solution, the program manager explained that, after  having spent approximately $19 million in acquisition/development costs  on the original solution, the program would seek alternatives and start  over. The program manager said ICE is now assessing such alternatives,  including a revised technical approach offered by the current  development contractor, as well as other off-the-shelf solutions in use at  other agencies. According to the program manager, significant portions of  the previous solution\u2019s data migration and infrastructure-related  components might be salvaged for reuse in whatever new solution is  chosen. But, depending on the approach selected, most of the user  interfaces, security components, and business rules that have been  developed for the program to date are unlikely to be reused.", "The program manager stated that the program intends to decide which  course it will pursue by October 2013, and based on that decision, it will  update the program\u2019s life-cycle cost estimate, schedule, and requirements  documents (as needed). Further, he stated that ICE intends to proactively  revise its May 2011 acquisition program baseline before it breaches at the  end of December 2013 and reaffirmed the agency\u2019s intention to deploy a  solution by the 2015 deadline. In the meantime, according to the program  manager, ICE has largely halted development work and it will be January  2014 at the earliest before any new development work begins. Given the  time lost in developing the current technical solution, as well as the  already reduced program scope, ICE cannot say what specific features it  will release to users, what its schedule for deploying this functionality will  be, or how much such efforts will cost.

The assessment results in a weighted score between 1  and 100 that is then converted to the five-level CIO risk rating  published on the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s IT Dashboard.

Further, the low-risk rating it issued for ICE is based, in part, on  PARM\u2019s Quarterly Program Accountability Report for April through  September 2012, which rated the program\u2019s cost performance with  the lowest possible risk score. Yet, during that same time period,  program documents show that cost and schedule performance was  declining and varied significantly from its baseline.

To assess the scope of each program, we  determined what functionality each program had committed to provide,  and analyzed pertinent documentation, such as program management  plans, mission needs statements, concept of operations documents, and  operational requirements documents (among others) to determine  whether those commitments had changed over time. We also compared  the schedule and cost commitments listed in the programs\u2019 initial  documentation with subsequent baselines to establish the degree to  which each program and its component subprojects had experienced  changes in their start dates, completion dates, and estimated costs.  Further, we corroborated statements made by CBP officials regarding the  lack of completeness in their program master schedules by reviewing the  completeness of their master schedule. Specifically, we examined the  relationships that CBP documented (defined) between work activities  within its master schedule for each project and the program overall. We  used spreadsheet formulas to calculate what percentage of work activities  linked to other work activities, and what percentage did not. We also  interviewed relevant DHS officials to clarify and/or confirm information in  the documents we reviewed and to more fully understand each program\u2019s  scope and status.", "To address our second objective, we examined program documentation,  such as risk management and requirements management plans and  processes, and compared them to relevant guidance from leading  practitioners.", "Risk management: We compared relevant documentation, such as  the CBP TECS Modernization Risk Management Plan and the ICE  TECS Modernization Risk Management Plan, to relevant risk  management guidance to identify any variances. We focused on the  extent to which: (1) a risk management strategy had been  established, (2) roles and responsibilities for risk management  activities had been defined and assigned, (3) a risk inventory has  been created that includes plans for mitigating risks, and (4) the status  of risks and mitigation efforts is regularly tracked. We also reviewed  lists of identified risks found in risk inventories, and minutes from  meetings at which risks were identified, monitored, and closed. We  compared risks identified by us during the course of our work to the  risks in the risk inventories to determine the extent to which all key  risks were being actively managed. We also reviewed briefings  provided at executive steering committee meetings to ascertain the  extent to which program risks were disclosed at these reviews.  Further, we discussed actions recently taken and planned to improve  risk management activities within both CBP and ICE. To assess the  reliability of the risk tools, we analyzed the nature and quality of  access controls for both the CBP and ICE risk inventories to ensure  that the data in the inventories were reliable for our purposes. To  assess the reliability of the information in the risk inventories we used  in this report, we interviewed knowledgeable agency officials about  the nature and quality of controls over both the CBP and ICE  inventories, and reviewed the information in the inventories to identify  missing or invalid data entries. We found that sufficient controls were  in place, and we therefore determined that the information is  sufficiently reliable.", "Requirements management: We compared relevant requirements  management documentation, such as the CBP TECS Mod  Requirements Management Plan, the Passenger Systems Program  Office\u2019s Change Management Process and Procedure, the ICE TECS  Modernization Requirements Management Plan, and the ICE Change  Control Board Standard Operating Procedure, to relevant  requirements development and management guidance to identify any  variances. We focused on the extent to which: (1) a process for  developing and managing requirements had been established; (2)  roles and responsibilities for requirements management practices had  been defined and assigned; (3) user needs had been elicited,  translated into requirements, and then analyzed to ensure that each  requirement was unique, unambiguous, and testable; and (4) a  change control process had been defined. We analyzed agency  documentation showing the implementation of these activities,  including evidence of requirements elicitation, analyses, review, and  approval, as well as examples of change request documents. We  interviewed program officials regarding the reasons for variances  between the guidance and documentation and the status of actions  recently taken and planned to improve requirements management  activities within both CBP and ICE.", "To address our third objective, we analyzed documentation including  executive steering committee meetings results, and reviewed program  assessments from DHS\u2019s Office of the Chief Information Officer and  DHS\u2019s Program Accountability and Risk Management office, and  compared the results to relevant guidance such as our Information  Technology Investment Management Framework to determine the extent  to which DHS is providing effective executive oversight and guidance to  the two TECS Mod programs. In addition, we compared the outputs of  these governance structures (such as briefing slides, meeting minutes,  and action items) to the ESC charters, and compared reports and  assessments prepared by DHS governance bodies to DHS\u2019s guidance for  conducting such assessments. We also interviewed relevant officials from  CBP, ICE, and DHS, as appropriate.", "We conducted this performance audit from December 2012 to September  2013 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
