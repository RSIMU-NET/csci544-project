In general, DHS has made more progress in its mission areas than in its management areas, reflecting an initial focus on protecting the homeland. While DHS has made progress in implementing its functions in each management and mission area, we identified challenges remaining in each of these areas. These challenges include providing appropriate oversight for contractors; improving financial management and controls; implementing a performance-based human capital management system; implementing information technology management controls; balancing trade facilitation and border security; improving enforcement of immigration laws, enhancing transportation security; and effectively coordinating the mitigation and response to all hazards. Key issues that have affected DHS's implementation efforts are agency transformation, strategic planning and results management, risk management, information sharing, partnerships and coordination, and accountability and transparency. For example, GAO designated DHS's implementation and transformation as high-risk. While DHS has made progress in transforming its component agencies into a fully functioning department, it has not yet addressed key elements of the transformation process, such as developing a comprehensive transformation strategy. The Homeland Security Act of 2002, as amended, requires DHS to develop a transition and succession plan to guide the transition of management functions to a new Administration; DHS is working to develop and implement its approach for managing the transition. DHS has begun to develop performance goals and measures in some areas in an effort to strengthen its ability to measure its progress in key areas. We commend DHS's efforts and have agreed to work with the department to provide input to help strengthen established measures. DHS also has not yet fully adopted and applied a risk management approach in implementing its mission functions. Although some DHS components have taken steps to do so, this approach has not yet been implemented departmentwide. DHS's 5-year anniversary provides an opportunity for the department to review how it has matured as an organization. As part of our broad range of work reviewing DHS's management and mission programs, GAO will continue to assess DHS's progress in addressing high-risk issues. In particular, GAO will continue to assess the progress made by the department in its transformation and information sharing efforts."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I appreciate the opportunity to appear today to discuss the Department of  Homeland Security\u2019s (DHS) efforts to implement its management and  mission functions. DHS began operations in March 2003 with missions that  include preventing terrorist attacks from occurring within the United  States, reducing U.S. vulnerability to terrorism, minimizing damages from  attacks that occur, and helping the nation recover from any attacks. The  department has initiated and continued the implementation of various  policies and programs to address these missions as well as its  nonhomeland security functions. DHS has also taken a number of actions  designed to integrate its management functions and to transform its  component agencies into an effective cabinet-level department. Prior to  the creation of DHS, we testified on whether the reorganization of  government agencies might better address the nation\u2019s homeland security  needs. At that time, we identified that the nation had a unique opportunity  to create an effective and performance-based organization to strengthen  the nation\u2019s ability to protect its borders and citizens. We noted that the  magnitude of the challenges that the new department would face would  require substantial time and effort to overcome and that the  implementation of the new department would be extremely complex.", "In 2003 we designated the implementation and transformation of DHS as  high-risk because it represented an enormous undertaking that would  require time to achieve in an effective and efficient manner. We further  identified that the components that became part of the department already  faced a wide array of existing challenges, and any failure to effectively  carry out its mission would expose the nation to potentially serious  consequences. In designating the implementation and transformation of  DHS as high-risk, we noted that building an effective department would  require consistent and sustained leadership from top management to  ensure the needed transformation of disparate agencies, programs, and  missions into an integrated organization. Our prior work on mergers and  acquisitions, undertaken before the creation of DHS, found that successful  transformations of large organizations, even those faced with less  strenuous reorganizations than DHS, can take at least 5 to 7 years to  achieve.", "Given our nation\u2019s current fiscal condition, it is critically important for  federal departments\u2014including DHS\u2014to operate as efficiently as possible  in carrying out their missions. I have spoken extensively about the fiscal  crisis our nation faces with the coming retirement of the baby boom  generation and the related growth in entitlement spending. The current  financial condition in the United States is worse than is widely understood  and is not sustainable. Meeting the long-term fiscal challenge will require  (1) significant entitlement reform; (2) reprioritizing, restructuring, and  constraining other spending programs; and (3) additional revenues\u2014such  as through a reformed tax system. These efforts will require bipartisan  cooperation and compromise.", "In August 2007, we reported on the progress DHS had made since its  inception in implementing its management and mission functions. We  identified specific actions that DHS was to achieve based on legislation,  homeland security presidential directives, DHS strategic planning  documents, and other sources, and reported on the progress the  department made in implementing these actions.", "My testimony addresses the progress made by DHS in implementing its  management and mission functions in the areas of acquisition, financial,  human capital, information technology, and real property management;  border security; immigration enforcement; immigration services; aviation,  surface transportation, and maritime security; emergency preparedness  and response; critical infrastructure and key resources protection; and  science and technology. My testimony also addresses key issues that have  affected the department\u2019s implementation efforts. These key issues  include agency transformation, strategic planning and results  management, risk management, information sharing, partnerships and  coordination, and accountability and transparency. My statement is based  on the results of our August 2007 report evaluating the extent to which  DHS has achieved congressional and Administration expectations set out  for DHS in its management and mission areas; selected products we issued  on DHS since July 2007; and our institutional knowledge of homeland  security and various government organizational and management issues.", "For our August 2007 report on DHS progress, we conducted our work  from September 2006 to July 2007. We updated this work with selected  reports in February 2008. We conducted our work in accordance with  generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards  require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate  evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained  provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our  audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["In July 2002 President Bush issued the National Strategy for Homeland  Security. The strategy set forth overall objectives to prevent terrorist  attacks within the United States, reduce America\u2019s vulnerability to  terrorism, and minimize the damage and assist in the recovery from  attacks that occur. The strategy further identified a plan to strengthen  homeland security through the cooperation and partnering of federal,  state, local, and private sector organizations on an array of functions. It  also specified a number of federal departments, as well as nonfederal  organizations, that have important roles in securing the homeland, with  DHS having key responsibilities in implementing established homeland  security mission areas. This strategy was updated and reissued in October  2007.", "In November 2002 the Homeland Security Act of 2002 was enacted into  law, creating DHS. The act defined the department\u2019s missions to include  preventing terrorist attacks within the United States; reducing U.S.  vulnerability to terrorism; and minimizing the damages and assisting in the  recovery from attacks that occur within the United States. The act further  specified major responsibilities for the department, including the analysis  of information and protection of infrastructure; development of  countermeasures against chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear,  and other emerging terrorist threats; securing U.S. borders and  transportation systems; and organizing emergency preparedness and  response efforts. DHS began operations in March 2003. Its establishment  represented a fusion of 22 federal agencies to coordinate and centralize  the leadership of many homeland security activities under a single  department.", "We have evaluated many of DHS\u2019s management functions and programs  since the department\u2019s establishment and have issued over 400 related  products. In particular, in August 2007 we reported on the progress DHS  had made since its inception in implementing its management and mission  functions. We also reported on broad themes that have underpinned  DHS\u2019s implementation efforts, such as agency transformation, strategic  planning, and risk management. Over the past 5 years, we have made  approximately 900 recommendations to DHS on ways to improve  operations and address key themes, such as to develop performance  measures and set milestones for key programs and implement internal  controls to help ensure program effectiveness. DHS has implemented  some of these recommendations, taken actions to address others, and  taken other steps to strengthen its mission activities and facilitate  management integration."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DHS Has Made Progress in Implementing Its Management and Mission Functions but Has Faced Challenges in Its Implementation Efforts", "paragraphs": ["DHS has made progress in implementing its management and mission  functions in the areas of acquisition, financial, human capital, information  technology, and real property management; border security; immigration  enforcement; immigration services; aviation, surface transportation, and  maritime security; emergency preparedness and response; critical  infrastructure and key resources protection; and science and technology.  Overall, DHS made more progress in implementing its mission functions  than its management functions, reflecting an initial focus on implementing  efforts to secure the homeland. DHS has had to undertake these critical  missions while also working to transform itself into a fully functioning  cabinet department\u2014a difficult undertaking for any organization and one  that can take, at a minimum, 5 to 7 years to complete even under less  daunting circumstances. As DHS continues to mature as an organization,  we have reported that it will be important that it works to strengthen its  management areas since the effectiveness of these functions will  ultimately impact its ability to fulfill its mission to protect the homeland."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Management Areas", "paragraphs": ["Acquisition Management. DHS\u2019s acquisition management efforts  include managing the use of contracts to acquire goods and services  needed to fulfill or support the agency\u2019s missions, such as information  systems, new technologies, aircraft, ships, and professional services.  Overall, DHS has made progress in implementing a strategic sourcing  program to increase the effectiveness of its buying power and in creating a  small business program. However, DHS\u2019s progress toward creating a  unified acquisition organization has been hampered by various policy  decisions. In September 2007 we reported on continued acquisition  oversight issues at DHS, identifying that the department had not fully  ensured proper oversight of its contractors providing services closely  supporting inherently government functions. For example, we found that  DHS program officials did not assess the risk that government decisions  may be influenced by, rather than independent from, contractor  judgments. Federal acquisitions policy requires enhanced oversight of  contractors providing professional and management support services that  can affect government decision making, support or influence policy  development, or affect program management. However, most of the DHS  program officials and contracting officers we spoke with were unaware of  this requirement, and, in general, did not believe that their professional  and management support service contracts required enhanced oversight.  We made several recommendations to DHS to address these issues,  including that DHS establish strategic-level guidance for determining the  appropriate mix of government and contractor employees to meet mission  needs; assess program office staff and expertise necessary to provide  sufficient oversight of selected contractor services; and review contracts  for selected services as part of the acquisition oversight program.", "Financial Management. DHS\u2019s financial management efforts include  consolidating or integrating component agencies\u2019 financial management  systems. In general, since its establishment, DHS has been unable to  obtain an unqualified or \u201cclean\u201d audit opinion on its financial statements.  For fiscal year 2007, the independent auditor issued a disclaimer on DHS\u2019s  financial statements and identified eight significant deficiencies in DHS\u2019s  internal controls over financial reporting, seven of which were so serious  that they qualified as material weaknesses. DHS has taken steps to prepare  corrective action plans for its internal control weaknesses by, for example,  developing and issuing a departmentwide strategic plan for the corrective  action plan process and holding workshops on corrective action plans.  Until these weaknesses are resolved, DHS will not be in a position to  provide reliable, timely, and useful financial data to support day-to-day  decision making.", "Human Capital Management. DHS\u2019s key human capital management  areas include pay, performance management, classification, labor  relations, adverse actions, employee appeals, and diversity management.  Congress provided DHS with significant flexibility to design a modern  human capital management system, and in October 2004 DHS issued its  human capital strategic plan. DHS and the Office of Personnel  Management jointly released the final regulations on DHS\u2019s new human  capital system in February 2005. Although DHS intended to implement the  new personnel system in the summer of 2005, court decisions enjoined the  department from implementing certain labor management portions of the  system. DHS has since taken actions to implement its human capital  system. In July 2005 DHS issued its first departmental training plan, and in  April 2007, it issued its Fiscal Year 2007 and 2008 Human Capital  Operational Plan. However, more work remains for DHS to fully  implement its human capital system, including developing a market-based  and performance-oriented pay system. corporate process for informed decision making by senior leadership  about competing information technology investment options; applying  system and software development and acquisition discipline and rigor  when defining, designing, developing, testing, deploying, and maintaining  systems; establishing a comprehensive, departmentwide information  security program to protect information and systems; having sufficient  people with the right knowledge, skills, and abilities to execute each of  these areas now and in the future; and centralizing leadership for  extending these disciplines throughout the organization with an  empowered Chief Information Officer. DHS has undertaken efforts to  establish and institutionalize the range of information technology  management controls and capabilities noted above that our research and  past work have shown are fundamental to any organization\u2019s ability to use  technology effectively to transform itself and accomplish mission goals.   However, the department has significantly more to do before each of its  management controls and capabilities is fully in place and is integral to  how each system investment is managed. For example, in September 2007  we reported on our assessment of DHS\u2019s information technology human  capital plan. We found that DHS\u2019s plan was largely consistent with federal  guidance and associated best practices. In particular, the plan fully  addressed 15 and partially addressed 12 of 27 practices set forth in the  Office of Personnel Management\u2019s human capital framework. However, we  reported that DHS\u2019s overall progress in implementing the plan had been  limited. We recommended, among other things, that roles and  responsibilities for implementing the information technology human  capital plan and all supporting plans be clearly defined and understood.  Moreover, DHS has not fully implemented a comprehensive information  security program. While it has taken actions to ensure that its certification  and accreditation activities are completed, the department has not shown  the extent to which it has strengthened incident detection, analysis, and  reporting and testing activities.", "Real Property Management. DHS\u2019s responsibilities for real property  management are specified in Executive Order 13327, \u201cFederal Real  Property Asset Management,\u201d and include the establishment of a Senior  Real Property Officer, development of an asset inventory, and  development and implementation of an asset management plan and  performance measures. In June 2006, the Office of Management and  Budget (OMB) upgraded DHS\u2019s Real Property Asset Management Score  from red to yellow after DHS developed an Asset Management Plan,  developed a generally complete real property data inventory, submitted  this inventory for inclusion in the governmentwide real property inventory  database, and established performance measures consistent with Federal  Real Property Council standards. DHS also designated a Senior Real  Property Officer."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Mission Areas", "paragraphs": ["Border Security. DHS\u2019s border security mission includes detecting and  preventing terrorists and terrorist weapons from entering the United  States; facilitating the orderly and efficient flow of legitimate trade and  travel; interdicting illegal drugs and other contraband; apprehending  individuals who are attempting to enter the United States illegally;  inspecting inbound and outbound people, vehicles, and cargo; and  enforcing laws of the United States at the border. DHS has made some  progress in, for example, refining the screening of foreign visitors to the  United States and providing training and personnel necessary to fulfill  border security missions. In particular, as of December 2006 DHS had a  pre-entry screening capability in place in overseas visa issuance offices  and an entry identification capability at 115 airports, 14 seaports, and 154  of 170 land ports of entry. Furthermore, in November 2007 we reported  on traveler inspections at ports of entry and found that U.S. Customs and  Border Protection (CBP) had some success in identifying inadmissible  aliens and other violators. However, we also identified weaknesses in  CBP\u2019s operations at ports of entry and have reported on challenges DHS  faced in implementing its comprehensive border protection system, called  SBInet, and in leveraging technology, personnel, and information to secure  the border. For example, in our November 2007 report on traveler  inspections, we identified weaknesses in CBP\u2019s operations, including not  verifying the nationality and admissibility of each traveler, which could  increase the potential that terrorists and inadmissible travelers could enter  the United States. In July 2007, CBP issued detailed procedures for  conducting inspections, including requiring field office managers to assess  compliance with these procedures. However, CBP had not established  internal controls to ensure that field office managers share their  assessments with CBP headquarters to help ensure that the new  procedures were consistently implemented across all ports of entry and  reduced the risk of failed traveler inspections. We recommended that DHS  implement internal controls to help ensure that field office directors  communicate to agency management the results of their monitoring and  assessment efforts and formalize a performance measure for the traveler  inspection program that identifies CBP\u2019s effectiveness in apprehending  inadmissible aliens and other violators.", "Immigration Enforcement. DHS\u2019s immigration enforcement mission  includes apprehending, detaining, and removing criminal and illegal aliens;  disrupting and dismantling organized smuggling of humans and  contraband as well as human trafficking; investigating and prosecuting  those who engage in benefit and document fraud; blocking and removing  employers\u2019 access to undocumented workers; and enforcing compliance  with programs to monitor visitors. Over the past several years, DHS has  strengthened some aspects of immigration enforcement. For example,  since fiscal year 2004 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)  has reported increases in the number of criminal arrests and indictments  for worksite enforcement violations. ICE also has begun to introduce  principles of risk management into the allocation of its investigative  resources. However, ICE has faced challenges in ensuring the removal of  criminal aliens from the United States. The agency has also lacked  outcome-based performance goals and measures for some its programs,  making it difficult for the agency and others to fully determine whether its  programs are achieving their desired outcomes.", "2007, we reported on USCIS\u2019s transformation efforts, noting that USCIS\u2019s  transformation plans partially or fully addressed most key practices for  organizational transformations. For example, USCIS had taken initial  steps in addressing problems identified during past efforts to modernize by  establishing a Transformation Program Office that reports directly to the  USCIS Deputy Director to ensure leadership commitment; dedicating  people and resources to the transformation; establishing a mission, vision,  and integrated strategic goals; focusing on a key set of priorities and  defining core values; and involving employees. However, we found that  more attention was needed in the areas of performance management,  strategic human capital management, communications, and information  technology management. We recommended that DHS document specific  performance measures and targets, increase focus on strategic human  capital management, complete a comprehensive communications strategy,  and continue developing sufficient information technology management  practices.", "Aviation Security. DHS\u2019s aviation security mission includes  strengthening airport security; providing and training a screening  workforce; prescreening passengers against terrorist watch lists; and  screening passengers, baggage, and cargo. Since the Transportation  Security Administration (TSA) was established in 2001, it has focused  much of its effort on aviation security and has developed and implemented  a variety of programs and procedures to secure commercial aviation. For  example, TSA has undertaken efforts to strengthen airport security; hire  and train a screening workforce; prescreen passengers against terrorist  watch lists; and screen passengers, baggage, and cargo. TSA has  implemented these efforts in part to meet numerous mandates for  strengthening aviation security placed on the agency following the  September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. However, DHS has faced challenges  in developing and implementing a program to match domestic airline  passenger information against terrorist watch lists; fielding needed  technologies to screen airline passengers for explosives; and fully  integrating risk-based decision making into some of its programs. In  November 2007, we reported that TSA continued to face challenges in  preventing unauthorized items from being taken through airport  checkpoints. Our independent testing identified that while in most cases  transportation security officers appeared to follow TSA\u2019s procedures and  used technology appropriately, weaknesses and other vulnerabilities  existed in TSA\u2019s screening procedures.", "Surface Transportation Security. DHS\u2019s surface transportation security  mission includes establishing security standards and conducting  assessments and inspections of surface transportation modes, including  passenger and freight rail, mass transit, highways, commercial vehicles,  and pipelines. Although TSA initially focused much of its effort and  resources on meeting legislative mandates to strengthen commercial  aviation security after September 11, 2001, TSA has more recently placed  additional focus on securing surface modes of transportation, including  establishing security standards and conducting assessments and  inspections of surface transportation modes such as passenger and freight  rail. However, more work remains for DHS in developing and issuing  security standards for all surface transportation modes and in more fully  defining the roles and missions of its inspectors in enforcing security  requirements.", "Maritime Security. DHS\u2019s maritime security responsibilities include port  and vessel security, maritime intelligence, and maritime supply chain  security. DHS has developed national and regional plans for maritime  security and response and a national plan for recovery, and it has ensured  the completion of vulnerability assessments and security plans for port  facilities and vessels. DHS has also developed programs for collecting  information on incoming ships and working with the private sector to  improve and validate supply chain security. However, DHS has faced  challenges in implementing certain maritime security responsibilities  including, for example, a program to control access to port secure areas  and to screen incoming cargo for radiation. In October 2007, we testified  on DHS\u2019s overall maritime security efforts as they related to the Security  and Accountability for Every (SAFE) Port Act of 2006. In that testimony  we noted that DHS had improved security efforts by establishing  committees to share information with local port stakeholders and taking  steps to establish interagency operations centers to monitor port activities,  conducting operations such as harbor patrols and vessel escorts, writing  port-level plans to prevent and respond to terrorist attacks, testing such  plans through exercises, and assessing security at foreign ports. We  further reported that DHS had strengthened the security of cargo  containers through enhancements to its system for identifying high-risk  cargo and expanding partnerships with other countries to screen  containers before they are shipped to the United States. However, we  reported on challenges faced by DHS in its cargo security efforts, such as  CBP\u2019s requirement to test and implement a new program to screen 100  percent of all incoming containers overseas\u2014a departure from its existing  risk-based programs. Among our recommendations were that DHS  develop strategic plans, better plan the use of its human capital, establish  performance measures, and otherwise improve program operations.", "Emergency Preparedness and Response. DHS\u2019s emergency  management mission, now primarily consolidated in the Federal  Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), includes prevention, mitigation,  preparedness for, response to, and immediate recovery from major  disasters and emergencies of all types, whether the result of nature or acts  of man. The goal is to minimize damage from major disasters and  emergencies by working with other federal agencies, state and local  governments, nongovernment organizations, and the private sector to  plan, equip, train, and practice needed skills and capabilities to build a  national, coordinated system of emergency management. The Post-Katrina  Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006 specifies a number of  responsibilities for FEMA and DHS in the area of emergency preparedness  and response designed to address many of the problems identified in the  various assessments of the preparation for and response to Hurricane  Katrina. It addresses such issues as roles and responsibilities, operational  planning, capabilities assessments, and exercises to test needed  capabilities. DHS has taken some actions intended to improve readiness  and response based on our work and the work of congressional  committees and the Administration. For example, in January 2008 DHS  issued a revised National Response Framework intended to further clarify  federal roles and responsibilities and relationships among federal, state,  and local governments and responders, among others. However, these  revisions have not yet been tested. DHS has also made structural changes  in response to the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act that,  among other things, are designed to strengthen FEMA. DHS has also  announced a number of other actions to improve readiness and response.  However, until states and first responders have an opportunity to train and  practice under some of these changes, it is unclear what impact, if any,  they will have on strengthening DHS\u2019s emergency preparedness and  response capabilities. stakeholders and information sharing and warning capabilities, and  identifying and reducing threats and vulnerabilities. DHS has developed a  national plan for critical infrastructure and key resources protection and  undertaken efforts to develop partnerships and to coordinate with other  federal, state, local and private sector stakeholders. DHS has also made  progress in identifying and assessing critical infrastructure threats and  vulnerabilities. For example, in July and October 2007 we reported on  critical infrastructure sectors\u2019 sector-specific plans. We reported that  although nine of the sector-specific plans we reviewed generally met  National Infrastructure Protection Plan requirements and DHS\u2019s sector- specific plan guidance, eight plans did not address incentives the sectors  would use to encourage owners to conduct risk assessments, and some  plans were more comprehensive than others when discussing their  physical, human, and cyber assets, systems, and functions. We  recommended that DHS better (1) define its critical infrastructure  information needs and (2) explain how the information will be used to  attract more users. We also reported that the extent to which the sectors  addressed aspects of cyber security in their sector-specific plans varied  and that none of the plans fully addressed all 30 cyber security-related  criteria. DHS officials said that the variance in the plans can primarily be  attributed to the levels of maturity and cultures of the sectors, with the  more mature sectors\u2014sectors with preexisting relationships and a history  of working together\u2014generally having more comprehensive and complete  plans than more newly established sectors without similar prior  relationships. Regarding cyber security, we recommended a September  2008 deadline for sector-specific agency plans to fully address cyber- related criteria. Although DHS has made progress in these areas, it has  faced challenges in sharing information and warnings on attacks, threats,  and vulnerabilities and in providing and coordinating incident response  and recovery planning efforts. For example, we identified a number of  challenges to DHS\u2019s Homeland Security Information Network, including its  coordination with state and local information sharing initiatives.", "Science and Technology. DHS\u2019s science and technology efforts include  coordinating the federal government\u2019s civilian efforts to identify and  develop countermeasures to chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear,  and other emerging terrorist threats. DHS has taken steps to coordinate  and share homeland security technologies with federal, state, local, and  private sector entities. However, DHS has faced challenges in assessing  threats and vulnerabilities and developing countermeasures to address  those threats. With regard to nuclear detection capabilities, in September  2007 we reported on DHS\u2019s testing of next generation radiation detection  equipment. In particular, we reported that the Domestic Nuclear  Detection Office (DNDO) used biased test methods that enhanced the  performance of the next generation equipment and that, in general, the  tests did not constitute an objective and rigorous assessment of this  equipment. We recommended that DNDO delay any purchase of this  equipment until all tests have been completed, evaluated, and validated."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Cross-cutting Issues Have Hindered DHS\u2019s Implementation Efforts", "paragraphs": ["Our work has identified cross-cutting issues that have hindered DHS\u2019s  progress in its management and mission areas. We have reported that  while it is important that DHS continue to work to strengthen each of its  core management and mission functions, it is equally important that these  key issues be addressed from a comprehensive, departmentwide  perspective to help ensure that the department has the structure and  processes in place to effectively address the threats and vulnerabilities  that face the nation. These issues are: (1) transforming and integrating  DHS\u2019s management functions; (2) engaging in effective strategic and  transition planning efforts and establishing baseline performance goals  and measures; (3) applying and improving a risk management approach  for implementing missions and making resource allocation decisions; (4)  sharing information with key stakeholders; and (5) coordinating and  partnering with federal, state, local, and private sector agencies entities. In  addition, accountability and transparency are critical to the department  effectively integrating its management functions and implementing its  mission responsibilities."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Agency Transformation", "paragraphs": ["DHS has faced an enormous management challenge in its transformation  efforts as it works to integrate 22 component agencies. Each component  agency brought differing missions, cultures, systems, and procedures that  the new department had to efficiently and effectively integrate into a  single, functioning unit. At the same time it has weathered these growing  pains, DHS has had to fulfill its various homeland security and other  missions. DHS has developed a strategic plan, is working to integrate some  management functions, and has continued to form necessary partnerships  to achieve mission success. Nevertheless, in 2007 we reported that DHS\u2019s  implementation and transformation remained high-risk because DHS had  not yet developed a comprehensive management integration strategy and  its management systems and functions\u23afespecially related to acquisition,  financial, human capital, and information management\u23afwere not yet fully  integrated and wholly operational. We identified that this array of  management and programmatic challenges continued to limit DHS\u2019s ability  to carry out its roles under the National Strategy for Homeland Security  in an effective, risk-based way.", "We have recommended, among other things, that agencies on the high-risk  list produce a corrective action plan that defines the root causes of  identified problems, identifies effective solutions to those problems, and  provides for substantially completing corrective measures in the near  term. Such a plan should include performance metrics and milestones, as  well as mechanisms to monitor progress. OMB has stressed to agencies  the need for corrective action plans for individual high-risk areas to  include specific goals and milestones. GAO has said that such a concerted  effort is critical and that our experience has shown that perseverance is  critical to resolving high-risk issues. In the spring of 2006, DHS provided  us with a draft corrective action plan that did not contain key elements we  have identified as necessary for an effective corrective action plan,  including specific actions to address identified objectives. As of February  2008, DHS had not yet completed a corrective action plan. According to  DHS, the department plans to use its revised strategic plan, which is at  OMB for final review, as the basis for its corrective action plan.", "The significant challenges DHS has experienced in integrating its disparate  organizational cultures and multiple management processes and systems  make it an appropriate candidate for a Chief Operating Officer/Chief  Management Officer (COO/CMO) as a second deputy position or  alternatively as a principal undersecretary for management position.  Designating the Undersecretary for Management at DHS as the CMO at an  Executive Level II is a step in the right direction, but this change does not  go far enough. A COO/CMO for DHS with a limited term that does not  transition across administrations will not help to ensure the continuity of  focus and attention needed to protect the security of our nation. A  COO/CMO at the appropriate organizational level at DHS, with a term  appointment, would provide the elevated senior leadership and concerted  and long-term attention required to marshal its transformation efforts.", "As part of its transformation efforts, it will be especially important for the  department to effectively manage the approaching transition between  administrations and sustain its transformation through this transition  period. Due to its mission\u2019s criticality and the increased risk of terror  attacks during changes in administration as witnessed in the United States  and other countries, it is important that DHS take steps to help ensure a  smooth transition to new leadership. According to the Homeland Security  Act of 2002, as amended, DHS is required to develop a transition and  succession plan to guide the transition of management functions to a new  Administration by December 2008. DHS is working to develop and  implement plans and initiatives for managing the transition. Moreover, the  Homeland Security Advisory Council issued a report in January 2008 on  the pending transition, making recommendations in the broad categories  of threat awareness, leadership, congressional oversight/action, policy,  operations, succession, and training. DHS is taking action to address some  challenges of the approaching transition period, including filling some  leadership positions traditionally held by political appointees with career  professionals. The department is also undertaking training and cross- training of senior career personnel that would address the council\u2019s  concerns for leadership and operational continuity. However, some other  Homeland Security Advisory Council recommendations, such as building a  consensus among current DHS officers regarding priority policy issues,  could prove more difficult for DHS to implement, particularly in light of  the need to clarify roles and responsibilities across the department and its  ongoing transformation efforts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Strategic Planning and Results Management", "paragraphs": ["Strategic planning is one of the critical factors necessary for the success of  new organizations. This is particularly true for DHS, given the breadth of  its responsibility and the need to clearly identify how stakeholders\u2019  responsibilities and activities align to address homeland security efforts.  However, DHS has not always implemented effective strategic planning  efforts and has not yet fully developed performance measures or put into  place structures to help ensure that the agency is managing for results.  DHS has developed performance goals and measures for some of its  programs and reports on these goals and measures in its Annual  Performance Report. However, some of DHS\u2019s components have not  developed adequate outcome-based performance measures or  comprehensive plans to monitor, assess, and independently evaluate the  effectiveness of their plans and performance. Since the issuance of our  August 2007 report, DHS has begun to develop performance goals and  measures for some areas in an effort to strengthen its ability to measures  its progress in key management and mission areas. We commend DHS\u2019s  efforts to measure its progress in these areas and have agreed to work  with the department to provide input to help strengthen established  measures."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Risk Management", "paragraphs": ["DHS cannot afford to protect everything against all possible threats. As a  result, the department must make choices about how to allocate its  resources to most effectively manage risk. Risk management has been  widely supported by the President and Congress as a management  approach for homeland security, and the Secretary of Homeland Security  has made it the centerpiece of departmental policy. A risk management  approach can help DHS make decisions more systematically and is  consistent with the National Strategy for Homeland Security and DHS\u2019s  strategic plan, which have all called for the use of risk-based decisions to  prioritize DHS\u2019s resource investments regarding homeland security-related  programs. DHS and several of its component agencies have taken steps  toward integrating risk-based principles into their decision-making  processes. On a component agency level, the Coast Guard, for example,  has developed security plans for seaports, facilities, and vessels based on  risk assessments. TSA has also incorporated risk-based decision making  into a number of its programs, such as programs for securing air cargo, but  has not yet completed these efforts. risk management to homeland security and suggested a number of ways to  use risk communication practices to better educate and inform the public.  The participants also proposed a number of steps that could be taken in  the near future to strengthen risk management practices and to stimulate  public discussion and awareness of risk management concepts. We are  working with the department to share ideas raised at the forum to assist  them as they work to strengthen their risk-based efforts. We will be issuing  a summary of this forum in the coming months."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Information Sharing", "paragraphs": ["In 2005, we designated information sharing for homeland security as high- risk and continued that designation in 2007. In doing so, we reported that  the nation had not implemented a set of governmentwide policies and  processes for sharing terrorism-related information but had issued a  strategy on how it would put in place the overall framework, policies, and  architecture for sharing with all critical partners\u2014actions that we and  others have recommended. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism  Prevention Act of 2004, as amended, requires that the President create an  \u201cinformation sharing environment\u201d to facilitate the sharing of terrorism- related information, yet this environment remains in the planning stage.  An implementation plan for the environment, which was released in  November 2006, defines key tasks and milestones for developing the  information sharing environment, including identifying barriers and ways  to resolve them, as we recommended. We have noted that completing the  information sharing environment is a complex task that will take multiple  years and long-term administration and congressional support and  oversight and will pose cultural, operational, and technical challenges that  will require a collaborated response.", "DHS has taken some steps to implement its information sharing  responsibilities and support other information sharing efforts. For  example, states and localities are creating their own information fusion  centers, some with DHS support. In October 2007 we reported that some  state and local fusion centers had DHS personnel assigned to them; access  to DHS\u2019s unclassified information networks or systems, such as the  Homeland Security Information Network; and support from DHS grant  programs. However, some state and local fusion centers reported  challenges to accessing DHS\u2019s information systems and identified issues in  understanding and using federal grant funds. To improve efforts to create  a national network of fusion centers, we recommended that the federal  government determine and articulate its role in, and whether it expects to  provide resources to, fusion centers over the long term to help ensure  their sustainability."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Partnerships and Coordination", "paragraphs": ["To secure the nation, DHS realizes it must form effective and sustained  partnerships among its component agencies and with a range of other  entities, including other federal agencies, state and local governments,  private and nonprofit sectors, and international partners. The National  Strategy for Homeland Security recognizes the importance of  partnerships as the foundation for establishing a shared responsibility for  homeland security among stakeholders. We have reported on difficulties  faced by DHS in its coordination efforts. For example, in September 2005  we reported that TSA did not effectively involve private sector  stakeholders in its decision-making process for developing security  standards for passenger rail assets. We recommended that DHS develop  security standards that reflect industry best practices and can be  measured, monitored, and enforced by TSA rail inspectors and, if  appropriate, rail asset owners. DHS agreed with these recommendations.  DHS has worked to strengthen partnerships and has undertaken a number  of coordination efforts with public and private-sector entities. These  include, for example, partnering with the Department of Transportation to  strengthen the security of surface modes of transportation, airlines to  improve aviation passenger and cargo screening, the maritime shipping  industry to facilitate containerized cargo inspection, and the chemical  industry to enhance critical infrastructure protection at such facilities. In  addition, FEMA has worked with other federal, state, and local entities to  improve planning for disaster response and recovery.

We have  encountered delays at DHS in obtaining access to needed information,  which has impacted our ability to conduct our work in a timely manner.  Since we highlighted this issue last year to this subcommittee, our access  to information at DHS has improved. For example, TSA has worked with  us to improve their process for providing us with access to  documentation. DHS also provided us with access to its national level  preparedness exercise. However, we continue to experience some delays  in obtaining information from DHS, and we continue to believe that DHS  needs to make systematic changes to its policies and procedures for how  DHS officials are to interact with GAO. We appreciate the Subcommittee\u2019s  assistance in helping us seek improved access to DHS information and  support the provision in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008, that  restricts a portion of DHS\u2019s funding until DHS reports on revisions to its  guidance for working with GAO and the DHS IG.
