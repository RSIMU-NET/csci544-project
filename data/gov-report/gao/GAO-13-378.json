Agencies closed 420 data centers by the end of December 2012, and have plans to close an additional 548 to reach 968 by December 2015--285 closures short of OMB's goal. OMB has not determined agencies' progress against its cost savings goal because, according to OMB staff, the agency has not determined a consistent and repeatable method for tracking cost savings. This lack of information makes it uncertain whether the $3 billion in savings is achievable by the end of 2015. Until OMB begins tracking and reporting on performance measures such as cost savings, it will be limited in its ability to oversee agencies' progress against key initiative goals.

As  previously mentioned, the memorandum describes OMB\u2019s responsibilities  for collecting agencies\u2019 information resources management strategic  plans, enterprise road maps, and integrated data collections, as well as  the Task Force\u2019s responsibility for developing data center performance  metrics for energy, facility, and labor, among other things. The  memorandum also states that GSA is still responsible for collecting  agencies\u2019 data center inventories in June 2013.", "However, several other important oversight responsibilities related to data  center consolidation are not addressed. For example, with the elimination  of the requirement to submit separate data center consolidation plans  under the new combined initiative, the memorandum does not discuss  whether either the Task Force or the GSA Program Management Office  will continue to be used in their same oversight roles for review of  agencies\u2019 documentation. In addition, while the memorandum discusses  OMB\u2019s responsibility for reviewing agencies\u2019 draft strategic plans, it does  not discuss the responsibility for approving these plans. In the absence of  defined oversight assignments and responsibilities, it cannot be  determined how OMB will have assurance that agencies\u2019 plans meet the  revised program requirements and, moving forward, whether these plans  support the goals of the combined initiative."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["After more than 3 years into FDCCI, agencies have made progress in  their efforts to close data centers. However, many key aspects of the  integration of FDCCI and PortfolioStat, including new data center  consolidation and cost savings goals, have not yet been defined. Further  compounding this lack of clarity, total cost savings to date from data  center consolidation efforts have not been determined, creating  uncertainty as to whether OMB will be able to meet its original cost  savings goal of $3 billion by the end of 2015. Additionally, even though  best practices promote the importance of establishing comprehensive  performance measures, OMB is not reporting on a key component of  consolidation progress, namely the size of facilities that are being closed,  and current agency consolidation progress indicates that additional time  will be needed beyond the original 2015 target in order to realize  anticipated cost savings. In the absence of tracking and reporting on key  performance measures, notably cost savings, and additional time for  agencies to achieve planned savings, OMB will be challenged in ensuring  that the initiative, under this new direction, is meeting its established  objectives.", "Recognizing the importance of effective oversight of major IT initiatives,  OMB directed that three oversight organizations\u2014the Task Force, the  GSA FDCCI Program Management Office, and OMB\u2014be responsible for  federal data center consolidation oversight activities. In establishing this  oversight structure, these organizations have established and fulfilled  responsibilities designed to better ensure that federal data center  consolidation meets its planned goals, including facilitating collaboration  among agencies and developing tools to assist agencies in their  consolidation efforts. However, other key oversight activities have not  been performed. Most notably, the lack of formal guidance for  consolidation plan peer reviews and approval increases the risk that  missing elements will continue to go undetected and that agencies\u2019 efforts  will not fully support OMB\u2019s goals. Further, while OMB has put in place  initiatives to track consolidation progress, consolidation inventories and  plans are not being reviewed for errors and cost savings are not being  tracked or reported. The collective importance of these activities to  federal data center consolidation success reinforces the need for  oversight responsibilities to be fulfilled in accordance with established  requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To better ensure that FDCCI achieves expected cost savings and to  improve executive-level oversight of the initiative, we are making three  recommendations to OMB. Specifically, we are recommending that the  Director of OMB direct the Federal CIO to  track and annually report on key data center consolidation  performance measures, such as the size of data centers being closed  and cost savings to date; extend the time frame for achieving cost savings related to data  center consolidation beyond the current 2015 horizon, to allow time to  meet the initiative\u2019s planned cost savings goal; and establish a mechanism to ensure that the established responsibilities  of designated data center consolidation oversight organizations are  fully executed, including responsibility for the documentation and  oversight of the peer review process, the review of agencies\u2019 updated  consolidation inventories and plans, and approval of updated  consolidation plans."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We received comments on a draft of our report from OMB and GSA.  Specifically, in written comments, the Federal CIO stated that the agency  concurred with the first and third recommendation. Regarding the second  recommendation, OMB neither agreed nor disagreed.

OMB\u2019s written  comments are provided in appendix II.", "GSA provided technical comments in which it stated that it disagreed with  our finding that the agency has not executed its responsibilities related to  analyzing agencies\u2019 inventories and plans. Specifically, GSA stated that  its FDCCI Program Management Office is not set up to perform audit or  in-depth review activities, that GSA\u2019s review requirements are not  specifically defined by OMB, and that accountability for the accuracy and  completeness of inventories and plans lies with agency CIOs. We agree  that agencies have a responsibility for ensuring the completeness of their  documentation, and we note in the report that agency CIOs are required  to attest to the completeness of their consolidation plans. However, as  also mentioned in this report, OMB documentation specifically states that  the GSA FDCCI Program Management Office is responsible for analyzing  agencies\u2019 inventories and plans. In addition, the report includes  information from GSA officials about their efforts to check these  documents for missing sections. Based on these facts, we stand by our  assessment that GSA has not fully executed its oversight responsibilities.", "Our draft report provided to OMB for comment included a  recommendation that OMB provide the FDCCI agencies with guidance on  how the initiative was to be integrated with PortfolioStat, including  direction on reporting requirements and the measurement of key  performance indicators. OMB\u2019s March 2013 memorandum provided  guidance on how FDCCI will be integrated with PortfolioStat. Among  other things, the memorandum included new reporting requirements and  provided initial direction on the measurement of key performance  indicators.

To assess the  reliability of these data, we reviewed related documentation, such as  OMB\u2019s reports to Congress on the status of information technology reform  efforts, checked for missing data or obvious errors, and interviewed OMB  staff from the Office of E-Government and Information Technology  regarding actions taken to verify the data. We determined that the data  were sufficiently reliable to report on agencies\u2019 progress towards OMB\u2019s  consolidation goals. In addition, we interviewed OMB staff about their  efforts to track consolidation cost savings. We also analyzed the  agencies\u2019 2011 consolidation plans to extract estimated cost savings  information. To assess the reliability of the data agencies provided in their  data center consolidation plans, we relied on actions performed as part of  our previous work to assess the reliability of the data, which included  reviewing the letters agencies were required to submit attesting to the  completeness and reliability of their plans, interviewing agency officials  about actions taken to verify their data, and reviewing the past  evaluations of agency plans. In the previous audit of FDCCI, we found  that the data were sufficiently reliable for reporting on the completeness  of agencies\u2019 plans but, in our assessment of the plans, noted that most  agencies did not fully report on their cost savings information. For this  review, we reviewed the results of our previous data reliability  assessment in the context of current objectives, and interviewed agency  officials about any additional actions taken to verify the data. We  concluded that the data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes, which  was to report on agencies\u2019 estimated cost savings information, but that  limitations existed related to the completeness of agencies\u2019 cost savings  information. As such, we identify the limitations of these data in the  finding sections of this report.", "To assess the extent to which the oversight organizations put in place by  OMB for FDCCI are adequately performing oversight of agency  consolidation efforts, we analyzed OMB memoranda,Center Consolidation Task Force Charter, and other related  documentation to determine the roles and responsibilities of key oversight  organizations, including OMB, the General Services Administration  FDCCI Program Management Office, and the Data Center Consolidation  Task Force. We then compared supporting documentation provided by  these organizations against their documented roles and responsibilities to  determine the extent to which these organizations were overseeing  agencies\u2019 consolidation efforts in a manner consistent with their assigned  responsibilities. In addition, we interviewed relevant OMB, General  Services Administration, and Data Center Consolidation Task Force  officials to determine the extent to which their oversight roles and  responsibilities were being executed, as well as the extent to which they  were providing oversight of agencies\u2019 efforts to meet established  consolidation and cost savings goals.", "We conducted this performance audit from October 2012 to April 2013 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
