In 2005, DHS established an oversight program to provide department-level insight into components' procurement of goods and services and to identify successful acquisition management approaches. DHS has also established specific initiatives, such as a strategic sourcing program in 2003 to reduce procurement costs and gain other efficiencies by consolidating requirements. GAO (1) assessed DHS's efforts to implement procurement oversight, and (2) identified DHS components' use of strategic sourcing to leverage their buying power. To do this, GAO reviewed procurement oversight policies and guidance, interviewed officials from OCPO and DHS components, reviewed prior GAO reports, reviewed on-site review findings and recommendations, and examined DHS and component documentation of oversight and strategic sourcing efforts."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Office of the Chief Procurement Officer (OCPO) continues to implement and has improved some aspects of its procurement oversight but has not sufficiently updated its guidance. OCPO's oversight has helped ensure that DHS components receive and address constructive assessments of their compliance with procurement regulations and policies. The oversight also has increased the Chief Procurement Officer's visibility into components' progress against procurement-related metrics. For example, OCPO establishes annual procurement goals for the components and tracks their progress in quarterly reports. OCPO has been less consistent in--but continues to hone its implementation of--other aspects of the program, such as self assessments and parts of its acquisition planning reviews. However, until GAO sent DHS a draft of this report recommending that DHS issue updated policy and guidance to reflect changes to the department's procurement oversight efforts, the department did not issue updated policy or guidance. This has led to a lack of clarity among components regarding what the oversight efforts entail. For example, some components did not complete a required self assessment in 2011. GAO's review of the revised policy and guidance found inconsistencies between the two and with current oversight efforts.", "DHS component officials stated that most of their efforts to leverage buying power are through the department's strategic sourcing program, which provides departmentwide contract vehicles for the purchase of specific items or services. According to DHS data, the department's spending through strategic sourcing contract vehicles has increased steadily from $1.8 billion in fiscal year 2008 to almost $3 billion in fiscal year 2011, representing about 20 percent of DHS's procurement spending for that year. The Office of Management and Budget has recognized some of DHS's strategic sourcing efforts as best practices. DHS policies encourage components to consider, but do not require, the use of strategic sourcing contract vehicles. The Chief Procurement Officer has identified increasing strategic sourcing as a departmentwide priority and OCPO encourages the utilization and development of strategic sourcing contract vehicles in a variety of ways, including hosting quarterly training sessions and posting contract information on the strategic sourcing web page. In addition, while components have leveraged contracts with other agencies, many found it more efficient to use DHS's strategic sourcing contract vehicles. DHS components generally do not use other components' contracts."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["Based on DHS's actions in response to the recommendation contained in the draft report, GAO recommends that the Secretary of Homeland Security direct the Chief Procurement Officer to review and ensure consistency between the new procurement oversight directive and guidebook and with the department's current procurement oversight efforts."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is a complex organization  responsible for a broad range of mission and management areas, such as  border security, immigration services, aviation security, maritime security,  and emergency preparedness and response.

The Office of Management and  Budget\u2019s Office of Federal Procurement Policy has cited DHS\u2019s efforts  among best practices for implementing federal strategic sourcing  initiatives. DHS has implemented 42 strategic sourcing efforts, including  indefinite-delivery indefinite-quantity contracts and blanket purchase  agreementsengineering services. The department also has several new initiatives  under development.   for goods and services ranging from ammunition to  DHS policies encourage components to consider, but do not require, the  use of departmentwide strategic sourcing contract vehicles. Usage of all  departmentwide contracts is \u201cmandatory for consideration\u201d unless  otherwise approved by the Under Secretary for Management, and  therefore must be considered by DHS components prior to awarding a  contract. Before pursuing their own procurements, components are to  review the DHS-wide intranet site that lists available strategic sourcing  contract vehicles. Some component officials said that their staff routinely  check that list to determine whether one of those vehicles can be used  before initiating a new procurement effort. Further, to encourage  increased establishment of strategic sourcing contract vehicles, the  HSAM requires the components to involve the strategic sourcing program  office to determine if the requirement lends itself to the establishment of a  departmentwide contract. If a DHS component makes a decision to  implement its own contract instead of a departmentwide contract, it must  document in the acquisition plan and contract file the rationale for doing  so and notify the Chief Procurement Officer for review and approval. DHS  is taking steps to strengthen the use of strategic sourcing at the  department and has drafted, but not yet issued, a management directive  that would make use of strategic sourcing contract vehicles mandatory  with exceptions.", "The Chief Procurement Officer has identified increasing strategic sourcing  as a departmentwide priority and OCPO encourages the utilization and  development of strategic sourcing vehicles in a variety of ways. OCPO  officials explained that they host quarterly meetings and training sessions  with the DHS Strategic Sourcing Working Group, meet with individual  component programs and procurement offices, and post all contract  information and ordering guides on the strategic sourcing web page.  OCPO includes metrics in its quarterly reports to track components\u2019  strategic sourcing contract vehicle utilization rates and savings, though it  has not established component-specific goals or targets to further  encourage use and development of strategic sourcing contract vehicles.  OCPO officials told us that they consider their strategic sourcing program  to be robust, and therefore do not currently think it would be worth the  additional effort to develop and track component-specific goals.

Some components cited economies of scale and  indicated that they thought prices had gone down in some areas.", "In addition to using the vehicles, DHS components are involved with the  program in a variety of ways. Component representatives serve on  working groups to help identify potential strategic sourcing opportunities  and develop shared requirements.

In another  example, the Coast Guard received price discounts for its HC-130J  aircraft starting in 2000 by leveraging an Air Force vehicle rather than  contracting directly with the manufacturer. However, most components  found it more efficient to use DHS\u2019s strategic sourcing vehicles than to  leverage contracts with other agencies.
