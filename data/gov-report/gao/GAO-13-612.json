Almost all of these funds went to the entire budgets of three existing research entities--the National Science Foundation (NSF), the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and the Department of Energy's (DOE) Office of Science (Science)--including all of the programs and activities the entities carry out. Appropriations for NSF, NIST, and Science generally increased under the acts but did not reach levels authorized by the acts. In addition to authorizing the budgets of these entities, COMPETES 2007 and COMPETES 2010 specifically authorized funding for 40 individual programs, including some programs within and some outside of these entities. Among those 40 programs, the 12 programs that existed before COMPETES 2007 received appropriations and continue to operate. Six of 28 newly authorized programs were also funded. Of these 6 programs, 1--DOE's Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy, set up to develop new energy technologies--is continuing operations, 3 were not funded in fiscal year 2012, and 2 were not fully implemented as of May 2013. For the 22 programs that were not funded, agency officials generally said that they did not request funding in their budget submissions; most often this was because agencies had similar programs under way or could pursue similar objectives within current programs. For example, Science said it did not request funding for the Discovery Science and Engineering Innovation Institutes because it would have duplicated other Science programs.", "For the fully implemented programs for which the COMPETES Acts specifically authorized funding, recent evaluations generally reported positive results, and some evaluations provided suggestions for improvements. Recent evaluations have been conducted for almost all of the programs that were implemented, or for aspects of those programs.

The resulting 2007 report, entitled  Rising above the Gathering Storm: Energizing and Employing America for  a Brighter Economic Future, recommended a number of specific actions  to address these goals.increasing federal investment in long-term basic and cross-disciplinary  scientific research, creating an agency within DOE to support  transformational energy research that might be high risk but could also  provide dramatic benefits for the nation, increasing the number and skills  of science and mathematics teachers in primary and secondary schools,  and investing in higher education with the goal of increasing the number  of undergraduate and graduate students with degrees in science,  engineering, and mathematics fields. The COMPETES Acts addressed  some of the actions in these areas. For example, COMPETES 2007  authorized creation of the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy in  DOE to overcome long-term and high-risk technological barriers in  developing energy technologies, and it authorized programs in Education  and NSF to train teachers in STEM fields.", "Among other things, the report advocated  Investments in scientific research have led to significant advances such  as the development of the Internet, satellites, aircraft, and the mapping of  the human genome, while investments in STEM education have provided  multiple forms of support for developing a highly qualified STEM  workforce.

In addition, the National Science and Technology  Committee on STEM Education within the Office of Science and  Technology Policy collects and maintains information on how investments  in STEM education are distributed across agencies, programs, and target  groups.

Commerce officials told us that the  department\u2019s Economic Development Administration implemented certain  aspects of the Regional Innovation Program (RIP) through the existing  Economic Adjustment Assistance program when RIP did not receive  appropriations. However, the officials also noted that by implementing  aspects of RIP in this manner they have reduced funding available to  other worthwhile aspects of the Economic Adjustment Assistance  program.
