In fiscal year 2002, DOE established a program focusing on improving the security of sealed sources in the former Soviet Union and has started to fund security upgrades in Russia and other former Soviet countries. The Departments of Defense and State and NRC also have programs to help countries strengthen controls over sealed sources. DOE plans to expand its program to other countries and regions in 2003 and is developing a plan to guide its efforts. However, the department has not fully coordinated its efforts with NRC and the Department of State to ensure that a government-wide strategy is established.

These sealed sources are used throughout the  United States and other countries in equipment designed to, among other  things, diagnose and treat illnesses, preserve food, detect flaws and other  failures in pipeline welds, and determine the moisture content of soil.   Depending on their use, sealed sources contain different types of  radioactive material, such as strontium-90, cobalt-60, cesium-137,  plutonium-238, and plutonium-239.  If these sealed sources fell into the  hands of terrorists, they could use them to produce a simple and crude, but  potentially dangerous, weapon by packaging explosives, such as dynamite,  with the radioactive material, which would be dispersed when the bomb  went off.  Depending on the type, amount, and form (powder or solid), the  dispersed radioactive material could cause radiation sickness for people  nearby and produce serious economic costs and psychological and social  disruption associated with the evacuation and subsequent cleanup of the  contaminated area.", "Given the concerns about the security of sealed sources worldwide, you  asked us to determine, to the extent possible (1) the number of sealed  sources worldwide and how many are reported lost, stolen, or abandoned;  (2) the controls, both legislative and regulatory, used by countries that  possess sealed sources; and (3) the assistance provided by the Department  of Energy (DOE) and other U.S. federal agencies to strengthen other  countries\u2019 control over sealed sources and the extent to which these efforts  are believed to be effectively implemented.  To address these objectives,  we distributed a survey to 127 International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)  member states to determine, among other things, how countries control  sealed sources.  Appendix I presents our scope and methodology,   appendix II presents the results of the survey, and appendix III contains a  list of the countries we sent the survey to, including those that responded  to it.  We also met with or had discussions with officials from several  countries to learn more about how they regulate and control sealed sources  and met with officials from international organizations, such as IAEA and  the European Commission, to obtain their views on the problem of  uncontrolled sealed sources.

Because of the varied  characteristics of the radioactive material\u2014physical structure (metal,  ceramic, or powder), activity level, half-life, and type of radiation emitted,  some materials pose a greater risk to people, property, and the  environment than others.  According to IAEA,  the level of protection  provided to users of the radioactive material should be commensurate with  the safety and security risks that it presents if improperly used.  For  example, radioactive materials used for certain diagnostic purposes have  low levels of activity and do not present a significant safety or security risk.   However, powerful sealed sources, such as those used in radiotherapy  (cancer treatment) that use cobalt-60, cesium-137, or iridium-192, could  pose a greater threat to the public and the environment and would also  pose a potentially more significant security risk, particularly if acquired to  produce a dirty bomb.", "The small size, portability, and potential value of sealed sources make them  vulnerable to misuse, improper disposal, and theft.  According to IAEA,  illicit trafficking in or smuggling of nuclear material, including sealed  sources, has increased worldwide in recent years:  IAEA reported 272 cases  of illicit trafficking in these sources from 1993 to the end of 2002.  (See   app. IV for more information about illicit trafficking incidents.)  While no  dirty bombs have been detonated, in the mid-1990s Chechen separatists  placed a canister containing cesium-137 in a Moscow park.  Although the  device was not detonated and no radioactive material was dispersed, the  incident demonstrated that terrorists have the capability and willingness to  use sealed sources as weapons of terror.", "U.S. and international experts have noted that some accidents involving  sealed sources can provide a measure of understanding of what the  possible impacts of a dirty bomb might be.  In 1987, an accident involving a  cesium-137 sealed source in Brazil killed four people, injured many more,  and caused about $36 million in damages to the local economy.  This  accident had such an enormous psychological impact on the local  population that the atomic symbol was added to the region\u2019s flag as a  lasting reminder of the accident\u2019s consequences.

Approximately 2 million licensed sealed sources are in use in the United  States, according to the NRC.  In addition, according to the European  Commission, approximately 500,000 sealed sources have been supplied to  operators in the 15 member states of the European Union, of which about  110,000 are currently in use.  The European Commission also estimated in  1999 that approximately 840,000 sealed sources exist in Russia, although  Russian officials believe the total number is significantly higher.", "The 49 countries that responded to our survey reported a total of about   7.8 million sealed sources that are in use within their countries.  These  sealed sources are used in various applications, such as industrial  radiography and therapeutic medicine.  Table 1 summarizes the responses  received from the countries surveyed regarding the number of sealed  sources in use and their major applications.", "Several factors contribute to the lack of comprehensive information about  the number of sealed sources worldwide.  According to IAEA, many  countries do not maintain accurate or complete inventories of sealed  sources in use or registries of users of sources.  In response to our survey,  28 of the 49 countries said they had an inventory of sealed sources.  In  addition, 17 countries said they were in the process of developing an  inventory.  However, several countries that reported they had inventories  indicated that the number of sources was estimated rather than actual.  A  few countries, including a European nation, indicated that they did not  have the resources necessary to develop a national registry of sources and  users.", "An additional factor contributing to countries\u2019 limited or incomplete  inventories is that sealed sources have been imported and exported by  distributors and governments without consistent monitoring or tracking by  the suppliers, the recipients of the sources, or the appropriate regulatory  authority.  Appendix VI provides information on the major producers of  sealed sources worldwide.", "The Chairman of NRC noted in March 2003 that international commerce in  these sources is extensive and that existing controls on imports and  exports are minimal.  For example, most U.S.-origin sealed sources are  exported under a general license.  This means that in most instances,  sealed sources are exported without NRC knowing the type, amount, or  activity level of the sources, or their destination.  (See app. VII for more  information about NRC\u2019s export regulations.)", "Sealed sources have also been distributed worldwide by a variety of means  other than commercial trade without adequate monitoring and oversight.   As a result, the sealed sources have not always been properly accounted  for and accurately inventoried.  For example, sealed sources have been   (1) distributed by corporations working in developing countries without  formal clearance from or approval by the recipient country\u2019s regulatory  authority, (2) donated by medical practitioners and nonprofit  organizations, and (3) provided through international technical  cooperation programs.  IAEA has reported that international  corporations\u2014such as oil companies\u2014have brought sealed sources used  in oil exploration into developing countries.  In some cases, there was no  competent authority in the country to register or license the sealed  sources, and existing national rules were regarded as too complicated or  difficult for the corporations to follow.  One African country reported in  response to our survey that its inventory of sealed sources was incomplete  because foreign construction companies had not notified the country\u2019s  regulatory authority when it imported sealed sources.", "According to IAEA, medical practitioners have brought sealed sources into  developing countries for the purpose of establishing health clinics and  hospitals and a number of sources were not properly accounted for.  IAEA  reported that hospitals in many developed countries donated large  amounts of surplus radium-226 to hospitals in developing countries in the  1960s.  One African country responding to our survey noted that according  to old records, radium had been imported into the country but could not be  located.  Nonprofit organizations have also provided medical equipment  using sealed sources to foreign countries.  For example, the American  International Health Alliance, operating under a series of cooperative  agreements with USAID and DOE, has donated medical supplies,  pharmaceuticals, and equipment, including those containing sealed  sources, to countries in the former Soviet Union and Central and Eastern  Europe since 1992. According to an official from the American  International Health Alliance, DOD also donated medical equipment  containing sealed sources from field facilities to several countries in the  former Soviet Union under the auspices of Operation Provide Hope.  Since  1992, over 500 airlift deliveries by DOD to Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus,  Georgia, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan occurred, but the exact  number of sealed source devices donated is unknown.", "IAEA has supplied sealed sources to many countries through its technical  cooperation program.  In 1991, IAEA estimated that it had provided many  developing countries with 565 sources since 1957.  IAEA officials told us  that IAEA had provided developing member states with over 1,000 devices  containing sealed sources since 1996.  Most of these sealed sources are not  considered a security risk by IAEA because of their low radioactivity.   However, officials did note that about 125 of the 1,000 devices contained  sources that could pose security risks if acquired by terrorists.  These  include (1) teletherapy machines with cobalt-60 sources of activity  between 5,000 and 7,000 curies, (2) brachytherapy machines with cesium- 137 sources of activity between 0.5 and 1 curie and iridium-192 sources of   10 curies, (3) irradiators with cobalt-60 sources with activity in the range of  12,000 to 200,000 curies, and (4) calibrators with activity around 4,000  curies.  IAEA officials said that they were uncertain, however, the extent to  which the sealed sources have been included in countries\u2019 inventories.", "While it is the responsibility of each country\u2014and not IAEA\u2014to maintain  accurate inventories of the sources, IAEA has encouraged many of its  member states to establish and/or strengthen their radiation and waste  safety infrastructures via the model project program.  In addition, IAEA  policy does not allow for the approval of any technical cooperation  projects involving the use of significant sealed sources unless the member  state in question has, among other things, an effective regulatory  framework that includes a system of notification, authorization, and  control of sealed sources together with an inventory of sources.  IAEA\u2019s  model project program is discussed on pages  22 and 23 of this report.", "DOE has provided countries with sealed sources under the Atoms for  Peace Program.  According to a March 2002 DOE Inspector General report,  Accounting for Sealed Sources of Nuclear Material Provided to Foreign  Countries, DOE could not fully account for sealed sources loaned to  foreign countries and no longer maintained an accounting and tracking  system for sealed sources.  The report noted that DOE and its predecessor  agencies provided 33 countries, including Iran, Pakistan, India, Malaysia,  and Vietnam, with 536 sealed sources, which contained plutonium, from  the 1950s through the 1970s.  Initially, these materials were loaned to  foreign facilities, and the U.S. government maintained ownership.   However, in the 1960s, the U.S. government began transferring ownership  through direct sale or donation, but it still retained title to much of the  sealed sources provided to foreign entities.  The report concluded that   (1) the oversight of sealed sources was inadequate and that inaccurate  inventory records limit DOE\u2019s ability to protect nuclear materials from loss,  theft, or other diversion, and (2) DOE should work with IAEA to establish  adequate regulatory oversight of sealed sources in foreign countries.  In its  response to the report, DOE stated that it is not the current policy of the  U.S. government to track sealed sources once they are in the control of  foreign entities and that to track loaned sealed sources would require a  change in policy and international agreements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Limited Information Exists about the Number of Lost, Stolen, or Abandoned Sealed Sources", "paragraphs": ["Because many countries cannot account for their sealed sources, there is  limited information on the number of sealed sources that are lost, stolen, or  abandoned\u2014referred to as \u201corphan sources.\u201d  According to the Director  General of IAEA, orphan sources are a widespread phenomenon, and 34 of  the 49 countries responding to our survey indicated that orphan sources  pose problems in their country.  In the European Union, up to 70 sealed  sources are lost among its member states annually. According to NRC,  about 250 sealed sources or devices are lost or stolen in the United States  annually, but the majority of the sources have been recovered.  NRC said  that the European Union does not report sources as being lost unless they  are at a certain activity level that exceeds the NRC threshold for tracking  purposes.  As a result, NRC typically reports a greater number of lost sealed  sources than the European Union does.", "The problem of orphan sources is most significant in the countries of the  former Soviet Union, where the collapse of the centralized Soviet  government structure over a decade ago led to a loss of records and  regulatory oversight over sealed sources.

Four of the 14  countries were located in Africa.", "Six countries indicated that there were disincentives to finding orphaned  sources.  In particular, they noted that an individual who reports finding a  source might be held responsible for paying for its disposal.

They noted that the units have a design service life of 10 to  15 years and that no repair or maintenance has been done on any of these  units since 1991.  However, Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy (MINATOM)  officials said that the generators are technically sound and should not be  completely removed from service without adequate replacement power.   MINATOM officials said they are considering extending the life of the  generators in order to keep them in service significantly longer than  originally planned.  Table 3 shows the estimated number of radioisotope  thermoelectric generators located in the countries of the former Soviet  Union.", "There have been numerous attempts to steal the sealed sources from these  generators.  For example, in recent years there have been six attempts to  disassemble the generators in Kazakhstan and a number of similar events  in Georgia and Russia.  Some of the strontium-90 sealed sources from the  generators have been found in residential areas.  In a few instances, people  who have stolen the sealed sources have used them for heating and  cooking, and officials have speculated that the metal shielding might have  been used to make bullets.  In 2001, three woodsmen in Georgia who found  the strontium-90 sealed source from an abandoned and dismantled  generator used it as a heat source and suffered severe radiation burns.   IAEA and DOE officials told us that other devices containing sealed  sources, such as seed irradiators that were used in the former Soviet Union,  pose significant security risks.  Seed irradiators were mounted on trucks  and used to irradiate seeds in order to kill fungus and inhibit germination.

A congressional  report instructs DOE to use a portion of its fiscal year 2002 supplemental  appropriation to address the threat posed by dirty bombs.  In response to  the congressional requirement, the National Nuclear Security  Administration\u2019s Office of International Material Protection and  Cooperation established the Radiological Threat Reduction program in  January 2002, budgeting $20.6 million for the program in fiscal year 2002,  and received an additional $16.3 million appropriation in fiscal year 2003.   The program is expected to receive an additional $22 million in  supplemental appropriations in fiscal year 2003, including $5 million to  secure nuclear material in Iraq.", "Initially, DOE evaluated the threat to national security from radioactive  materials and determined that sealed sources pose a greater threat than  other radioactive materials, such as radioactive waste and nuclear fuel,  because of their availability; radioactivity; and other physical  characteristics, such as half-life.  DOE did further studies of the dirty bomb  threat, including (1) narrowing the list of sealed sources that are a high  priority because of their characteristics and availability, (2) analyzing  possible scenarios in which a radiological dispersion device could be used,  and (3) determining what the economic consequences of a dirty bomb  attack in the United States would be.  The former assistant deputy  administrator of the Office of International Material Protection and  Cooperation told us that it would be impossible to secure all sealed sources  but that by determining which sources pose the greatest risk, DOE could  prioritize its efforts.", "DOE has focused on securing sealed sources in the countries of the former  Soviet Union because DOE officials have determined that is where the  greatest number of vulnerable sealed sources is located.  In April 2002 the  Radiological Threat Reduction program initiated its first security upgrade  project at the Moscow Radon, a regional facility involved with collecting,  transporting, processing, and disposing of sealed sources and low- and  intermediate-level radioactive waste.  There are 35 Radon facilities in the  former Soviet Union, but the Moscow Radon is by far the largest and  collects almost 80 percent of the institutional, industrial, and medical  radioactive wastes in Russia from almost 2,000 enterprises in the city of  Moscow, the Moscow region, and nine neighboring regions.  During our  visit to the Moscow Radon in October 2002, Radon officials showed us the  building for which most of the DOE-funded upgrades are planned. (See   fig. 4.)  Planned upgrades at the site include surveillance cameras, motion  detectors, vehicles, building upgrades, and a security facility where guards  can monitor the building where most high-activity sources are stored.   Although there have been no known attempts at theft of materials at the  site, Radon officials told us that upgrades are needed because existing  security is inadequate.", "The program has also secured sealed sources in Uzbekistan and the  Republic of Georgia.  In Uzbekistan, DOE has funded security upgrades at  research and irradiation facilities and the construction of a national  repository for sealed sources, and plans to fund increased physical security  upgrades at a dozen regional cancer treatment facilities.  In the Republic of  Georgia, DOE funded security upgrades at a facility where radioisotope  thermoelectric generators and other high-activity sealed sources are  stored.  Upgrades in both countries included bricking up windows;  reinforcing doors; improving or replacing roofs; upgrading storage vaults;  installing motion detectors and alarm systems; and other low-cost,   \u201clow-tech\u201d measures.  Figure 5 shows an example of the security upgrades  funded by DOE.", "In June 2002 DOE launched two additional efforts\u2014a bilateral initiative  with MINATOM to secure sealed sources at Russian facilities identified by  MINATOM, and a Tripartite Initiative with MINATOM and IAEA.  The  objective of the Tripartite Initiative is to improve the security of sealed  sources in former Soviet states by developing inventories of sealed  sources, locating the sealed sources, recovering the sealed sources, storing  recovered sealed sources in a secure manner, and disposing of the sources.", "Ultimately, DOE hopes that Russia will play a key role in recovering sealed  sources in other former Soviet states because many of these sealed sources  were manufactured in and distributed from Russia.  In July 2002 MINATOM  provided DOE with a number of priority projects for funding in Russia.   These projects included recovering and securing radioisotope  thermoelectric generators, and recovering orphan sources at 45 sites in  Russia.  According to DOE, the sites will be prioritized according to the  type and activity level of the radioactive material present.", "DOE has completed site assessments at four Radon sites in Russia.   Upgrades at these facilities are expected to be completed by the end of  fiscal year 2004.  A key criterion for deciding if the site requires upgrades is  an inventory of the sealed sources stored there\u2014if the inventory includes  sealed sources that DOE has determined to be high risk, security upgrades  will be implemented.", "Under the Tripartite Initiative, 19 additional Radon sites in other former  Soviet states will be assessed.  These Radon sites are located in Armenia,  Azerbaijan, Belarus, Estonia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Lithuania,  Moldova, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan.  DOE also  plans to perform site assessments and security upgrades at medical,  industrial, and research facilities throughout the former Soviet Union,  similar to those done in Uzbekistan and Georgia.  DOE, IAEA, and  MINATOM officials visited Moldova in the fall of 2002 to conduct a physical  security evaluation, implement the upgrades at the Moldova Radon, and  identify other sites where further work is needed to improve security.  DOE  and IAEA officials conducted a similar trip to Tajikistan in December 2002.   Work in both countries is expected to be complete in the summer of 2003,  and DOE plans to initiate projects in Ukraine, Kazakhstan, the Baltics, and  possibly Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Kyrgyzstan in fiscal year 2003.", "In March 2003 the Secretary of Energy announced a new initiative to  broaden the Tripartite Initiative to other countries needing assistance to  secure high-risk vulnerable sources.

As part of this expanded effort, DOE expects to initiate work in  Serbia and Indonesia this year.", "Finally, DOE also has a program designed to strengthen other countries\u2019  controls over sealed sources managed by the Office of International  Nuclear Safety within the National Nuclear Security Administration.  The  office is working with IAEA, other international organizations, NRC, and  the State Department to develop a management program for sealed  sources.  The purpose of this program is to protect the health and safety of  the public and people who work with sealed sources by developing  literature and training programs.  The program also contributed assistance  for the international effort to recover orphan sources in the Republic of  Georgia, including providing technical assistance, detection and personnel  protection equipment, training, and software.  In Armenia, this program is  providing training, equipment, and other technical assistance to enhance  the safety and security of sealed sources.

The manager of  the program told us that although sealed sources are not traditionally  considered to be weapons of mass destruction, DOD undertook this project  because the Kazakhstan government asked for assistance and the quantity  and types of sealed sources posed a security threat.  The program began in  fiscal year 2001, prior to the establishment of DOE\u2019s program to secure  sealed sources, and DOD does not expect to engage in any further projects  to secure sources in the former Soviet Union countries.  The $1.7 million  project is expected to be completed by the end of fiscal year 2003.", "The State Department is also funding various projects to strengthen  controls.  For example, State provided IAEA with $1 million in fiscal year  2002 to support the agency\u2019s projects related to the safety and security of  radioactive sources.  Additionally, State allocated $120,000 in fiscal year  2002 from the Nonproliferation and Disarmament Fund for a pilot project  to develop and improve radiation safety programs in developing countries,  including controls over sealed sources.  The project was initially developed  by the Health Physics Society and proposed by State\u2019s Office of the Senior  Coordinator for Nuclear Safety.  Health Physics Society members volunteer  their time, and State Department funding is used for travel, per diem, the  cost of shipping donated equipment to the host countries, and evaluation of  the project\u2014about $3,000 spent to date.  Four countries\u2014Costa Rica,  Ecuador, Jamaica, and Panama\u2014were chosen for the pilot; however, work  has been initiated in only two countries.  The project was recently  reactivated after a suspension of several months because of State  Department concerns about program management, security, and liability  issues.", "The State Department has also contracted with Sandia National Laboratory  for a $100,000 study to assess the current laws and procedures governing  intercountry transfers of sealed sources.  Specifically, the study is looking  at six countries that are either major exporters or importers of sealed  sources and will provide information on, among other things, the number  of sources that is imported and exported, and whether exporters are  required to verify whether the countries they are exporting to have controls  in place to ensure the safety and security of sealed sources.", "In addition, NRC has a program to strengthen controls that focuses on  Armenia.  NRC has spent $62,000 in Freedom Support Act funds transferred  from USAID to assist Armenia.  Initially, NRC will help Armenia develop a  registry of sealed sources, including identifying the information required;  develop the database; and help Armenia gather, assess, develop, and verify  existing data on sources.  Currently, Armenian regulations on sealed  sources and other radioactive materials are spread across different  ministries and departments, and many have not been changed since the fall  of the Soviet Union.  NRC plans to assist Armenia with reviewing existing  regulations and developing consolidated regulations on, among other  things, licensing and inspections of radioactive sources, which will apply  governmentwide and meet international standards.  In addition, NRC  provided Russia and Ukraine with guidance and training on the licensing  and regulation of sealed sources in the mid-1990s.  NRC has also started  working with Canada and Mexico to share information about controls over  sealed sources in each country and improve cross-border controls and has  provided cost-free experts to help IAEA update its Categorization of  Radioactive Sources and Code of Conduct.", "Finally, DOE and State are providing funds to support IAEA efforts to  strengthen controls over sealed sources.

This fund was established after the  terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, in conjunction with IAEA\u2019s action  plan to improve nuclear security worldwide.  The State Department has  directed $1 million of its contribution specifically toward activities to  improve the controls over sealed sources, and DOE\u2019s $3 million  contribution is entirely directed to these efforts.  Planned activities to  improve the security of sealed sources in member states include, among  other things, enhancing ongoing activities to improve controls of sealed  sources; developing standards, guidelines, and recommendations on the  security of radioactive sources; establishing security standards for the  transport of radioactive material; and locating and securing orphan  sources.", "Table 4 summarizes the amounts that the Departments of Energy, State,  and Defense, and NRC have received, obligated, and spent to help other  countries strengthen their controls over sealed sources as of January 31,  2003."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOE Efforts Have Not Been Well Planned and Coordinated with Those of Other U.S. Agencies", "paragraphs": ["DOE is in the process of developing a plan to guide its efforts to help other  countries secure sealed sources.

In the absence of a plan, DOE officials told us that the program has  modeled its work in Russia on previous DOE projects to secure fissile  materials in Russia through its Material Protection, Control, and  Accounting program.  The director of the program told us that while the  initial approach to securing sealed sources in Russia\u2014focusing on  improving physical security at Radon sites\u2014was a good idea, it hindered  DOE from setting priorities among other sites in Russia.  He further noted  that the program is now focusing on improving the security of the most  vulnerable high-risk sources first.", "DOE officials told us that they recognize that the development of a plan is  essential.  DOE\u2019s draft plan has established short- and long-term program  elements, including consolidating and securing dangerous materials in  vulnerable locations; leveraging critical partnerships, such as continuing to  work with IAEA on key efforts such as the model projects program and the  code of conduct; and continuing to help countries detect smuggled  radioactive materials through its Second Line of Defense program.  In  addition to the plan, DOE officials said they are also developing a more  detailed action plan; radioactivity thresholds for vulnerable high-risk  radioactive materials; and guidelines for describing the actions that should  be taken by DOE when sources are found to exceed those radioactivity  thresholds.  As part of its overall effort, DOE officials told us that more  detailed planning and analysis will be needed to, among other things,   (1) determine which countries present the greatest security risk and most  urgently require assistance, (2) identify future funding requirements, and  (3) develop performance measures to gauge program success.", "Despite these recent initiatives to improve program planning, officials from  Gosatomnadzor, the Russian agency responsible for regulating sealed  sources in use at almost 8,000 facilities in Russia, told us that beyond an  initial meeting, DOE had not consulted with them in the selection or  prioritization of sites for physical security upgrades.  In particular,  Gosatomnadzor officials were surprised that DOE was focusing so much  attention on improving security at the Radon facilities in Russia where they  believed the probability that sealed sources will be stolen is low.  They said  that it would be preferable to begin securing sealed sources from other  vulnerable sites near Moscow, for example, out-of-service irradiation and  research facilities.  A systematic approach is required to assess needs,  identify priorities, and develop a comprehensive approach to securing  sealed sources.  In their view, DOE\u2019s initial approach had the potential to be  superficial.", "DOE officials told us that they are now working more closely with  Gosatomnadzor.  In a March 31, 2003, letter from DOE\u2019s Acting Deputy  Assistant Secretary for International Material Protection and Cooperation  to Gosatomnadzor\u2019s First Deputy Chairman, the DOE official noted the  need for regulatory oversight of the Russian radiological industry and  suggested that a proposal be formulated jointly with NRC to work  cooperatively in this area.", "DOE is also seeking to improve planning and coordination of the Tripartite  Initiative.  According to an IAEA official, DOE coordinated its efforts with  IAEA and Russia on the Moldova visit that contributed to a successful start  of the Tripartite Initiative.  The participants jointly developed and  implemented a common approach for securing some vulnerable sealed  sources, and arrangements were made to construct a facility to store these  sources.  However, the IAEA official told us that the Tajikistan assessment  was not well coordinated.  He noted that DOE was not flexible in  scheduling the preliminary assessment visit and that Russia did not  participate in the visit.  Because of the timing of the visit, IAEA\u2019s  representative to the Tripartite Initiative was unable to participate in the  visit, however, an official from IAEA\u2019s Department of Technical  Cooperation did accompany the DOE team.", "DOE officials told us that they were unable to make changes to their  existing itinerary because they would have incurred significant delays if  travel dates were changed due to country clearance restrictions for U.S.  government travel in Tajikistan.  Furthermore, they noted that because of  the different roles that DOE, MINATOM, and IAEA play under the Tripartite  Initiative, it is not necessary that representatives of each organization be  present on each visit.  As currently envisioned, the Russian and IAEA  participants will act as an advance team, gathering information about  which sealed sources exist in a given country and their current level of  vulnerability.  Subsequently, the U.S. team will visit the country and  negotiate contracts to improve security at the vulnerable sites.", "IAEA\u2019s official also told us that, overall, the Tripartite Initiative has not been  well planned.  Initial efforts have been ad-hoc, and a more systematic  approach is needed as the program continues.  He said that improved  planning is essential particularly because the Tripartite Initiative will be  used as a model to guide future efforts as the program expands worldwide.   DOE officials agreed that improved coordination is needed.  DOE,  MINATOM, and IAEA are working to finalize a \u201cTerms of Reference\u201d  document that defines the objectives, scope, roles, operational framework,  and procedures to be followed for implementing projects under the  Initiative.

These officials told us  that DOE needs their input to ensure that a comprehensive  governmentwide strategy is taken to, among other things, leverage  program resources, maximize available expertise, avoid possible  duplication of effort, and help ensure long-term success.  DOE has not  systematically undertaken the kind of comprehensive planning that would  foster better coordination with the other agencies and could also lead to  better coordination with other countries\u2019 nuclear organizations.  For  example, DOE did not adequately consult NRC or State when developing  the Radiological Threat Reduction program or developing the Tripartite  Initiative with MINATOM and IAEA.

These  sealed sources are in virtually every country of the world and are often  inadequately secured or accounted for.  The central question is, What can  the United States and the world community do to confront this problem,  given the likely vast and unknown number of sources that exist and  continue to be manufactured and distributed globally?", "DOE appears to be well suited to help countries secure sealed sources  because of its long history in securing weapons grade material in the  former Soviet Union.  Further, DOE\u2019s efforts to develop a plan to guide its  efforts is a step in the right direction.  However, additional planning and  detailed analyses will be needed to, among other things, systematically  identify and prioritize countries that require assistance, establish realistic  time frames and resources necessary to accomplish these tasks, and  develop meaningful performance measurements.  The elements of such a  plan assumed greater importance in light of the Secretary of Energy\u2019s  recent announcement that DOE\u2019s program will expand beyond the  countries of the former Soviet Union.  For this reason alone, it is imperative  that a comprehensive plan be established and implemented before  significant amounts of appropriated funds are spent to improve  international controls over sealed sources.  Regarding program  expenditures, we agree with DOE\u2019s objective to maximize program  resources in the recipient countries.  To date, the national laboratories have  spent the majority of the program funds in United States and we believe  that this trend needs to be reversed as the program evolves.

Further, DOE believes that it is  important to place the report\u2019s findings in context since the program is in  its startup phase.  Regarding DOE\u2019s point about coordination, we had been  told several times during the course of our review by NRC and State  Department officials that DOE had not systematically included these  agencies in the development of a comprehensive strategy to strengthen  other countries\u2019 controls over sealed sources.  In fact, we raised this issue  with DOE program officials during our review and these officials  acknowledged that DOE needed to do a better job in coordinating its  program with other U.S. agencies.

First, NRC believed that our report should have  focused more attention on high-risk radioactive sources rather than on  radioactive sources of all types.  NRC stated that the vast majority of  radioactive sources in use in the United States and abroad are not useful to  a terrorist and that it has been working with DOE and IAEA to finalize  IAEA\u2019s revised Code of Conduct on Safety and Security of Radioactive  Sources and the revised Categorization of Sources.  In addition, NRC noted  that only a few of the radioactive sources that are lost or stolen in the  United States are high-risk and that a majority of the sources reported lost  or stolen involve small or short-lived sources which are not useful as a  radiological dispersion device.  Second, NRC identified various efforts that  it has undertaken to improve the security of high-risk sources in the United  States.

We did not, however, survey all IAEA member states.   Specifically, we did not distribute questionnaires to Afghanistan, Cuba,  Iran, Iraq, Ivory Coast, Libya, Sudan, Syria, and the Holy See.  The State  Department recommended that we not correspond with the first eight  countries listed.  We determined from discussions with IAEA that the Holy  See did not have any sealed sources.  We did not include the United States  because it is being treated separately in another GAO report.", "IAEA provided us with a list of the appropriate contacts for most of the  countries we planned to survey.  These officials were primarily from  member countries\u2019 regulatory authorities.  We pretested the survey with the  U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and with representatives from  Brazil, Poland, the United Kingdom, Uganda, and Uzbekistan.  After  revising the survey to reflect the comments of these officials, we  distributed it in December 2002 via E-mail and fax, and through countries\u2019  embassies in Washington, D.C., and Vienna, Austria, where IAEA is located.   As a follow-up for nonrespondents, we also distributed questionnaires  directly to many countries\u2019 representatives who were attending an  international conference in Vienna, Austria, on the security of radioactive  sources.  We also sent out periodic reminders to the countries from January  through March 2003 requesting their assistance to complete the survey in a  timely fashion.  We received responses from 49 IAEA member states (39  percent), including countries from Asia, North and South America, the  former Soviet Union, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.  According to  IAEA officials, the response rate was consistent with the rate it achieves  when it sends out similar types of questionnaires to member states.  In  addition we were told by IAEA officials and others that there is an inherent  difficulty associated with trying to obtain these types of data from  countries owing to the sensitive nature of some of the questions and  countries\u2019 concerns about ensuring the confidentiality of their responses.   Our survey results were used without attempting to project the information  to the universe of IAEA members.  We did not assume that nonrespondent  countries would have had similar answers to our survey.  Regarding the  matter of confidentiality, we notified the countries that the results from the  survey would be reported in aggregate and that individual responses would  not be disclosed.", "We supplemented the results obtained from the survey with interviews with  officials from several countries, including Brazil, France, Kazakhstan, the  Republic of Georgia, Russia, the United Kingdom, and Uzbekistan to learn  more about how they regulate and control sealed sources.  We also met  with officials from IAEA and the European Commission to obtain their  views on the security problems and challenges associated with sealed  sources.  In addition, we also interviewed and obtained pertinent  documents from officials of several U.S. government agencies, including  the Departments of Defense, Energy, and State, and NRC.", "We attended two DOE-sponsored conferences related to the security of  sealed sources.  The first conference, held in London, United Kingdom,  during September-October 2002, focused on international approaches to  nuclear and radiological security.

IAEA is encouraging  countries to provide more details about all trafficking incidents involving  radioactive materials so that better information can be developed and more  accurate assessments and analysis can be performed.", "Since the early 1990s, there have been numerous reports of illicit  trafficking in, or smuggling of, radioactive material worldwide, including  sealed sources.  According to IAEA, sealed sources, such as cesium-137,  cobalt-60, strontium-90, and iridium-192 are considered to pose the greatest  security risk.  In 1993, IAEA established a database to record incidents  involving illicit trafficking in nuclear and radioactive materials.  Seventy  countries, or about one-half of IAEA\u2019s member states, currently participate  in the database.  As of December 31, 2002, IAEA listed 272 confirmed  incidents involving the illicit trafficking of radioactive materials, including  sealed sources.  According to IAEA, a confirmed incident is one in which  the information has been verified to IAEA through official points of contact  from the reporting country.  Of the 272 confirmed illicit trafficking  incidents reported by IAEA, there were 179 incidents with potentially high  risk sealed sources that pose the greatest security risks.  More than two- thirds of the 179 incidents involving these sources occurred after 1997.

Several other incidents  reported, however, do not reflect criminal intent but have resulted from,  among other things, the inadvertent transportation of contaminated  scrap metal.  The unregulated scrap metal industry throughout the  former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe poses potential security and  safety risks nonetheless because many radioactive sources are stolen  for the metal shielding, leaving the source exposed and potentially very  dangerous.", "Since the mid-1990s, the trafficking of radioactive materials has  generally increased.  The increase in illicit trafficking cases may be due,  in part, to the increased reporting of these incidents by countries and/or  improved radiation detection systems placed at countries\u2019 border  crossings.", "From 1993 through 1998, trafficking incidents involving radioactive  material were primarily reported in Russia, Germany, and Estonia.  In  the past few years, there appears to have been an increase in trafficking  through Ukraine, Bulgaria, and Romania.", "According to the illicit trafficking incidents reported by IAEA, high-risk  sealed sources are more likely to be trafficked than weapons-grade  fissile material, such as highly-enriched uranium.  This is because such  sources have numerous beneficial applications and are not as tightly  controlled as fissile materials.", "IAEA and DOE officials told us that the actual number of trafficking cases  involving sealed sources is larger than what is currently being reported  because many trafficking incidents are never detected by authorities and  many countries are not always willing to share sensitive trafficking  information.  Another factor that affects the number of confirmed cases  reported is the credibility of the information.  According to DOE, a  significant amount of time and expertise is required to assess a particular  incident before it can be deemed credible.   Despite difficulties in drawing  conclusions from illicit trafficking data, the threat posed by illicit  trafficking is a real and growing problem.  The Director of IAEA\u2019s Office of  Nuclear Security also told us that every reported case should be taken  seriously.

A general license, provided by regulation, grants authority to a person for  certain activities, in this case, the export of sealed sources, and is effective  without filing an application with NRC or the issuance of a licensing  document to the person or organization exporting the sealed source.  NRC  has placed most sealed sources for export under a general license for  several reasons, including the following: (1) subject to NRC or Agreement  State oversight, the United States is  responsible only for ensuring the safe  use and control of radioactive materials used to manufacture sealed  sources within U.S. territory; (2) foreign countries have the sovereign  responsibility for ensuring appropriate regulatory controls over radioactive  material, including such material imported from other countries; and   (3) control over radioactive material would not be enhanced by requiring  specific licenses for material exported from the United States.  A specific  license would not ensure that the exported materials would be subject to  controls and regulatory oversight in a foreign country because the license  does not ensure that the recipient country has adequate regulatory controls  over the material that is exported from the United States.  Under a specific  license, the export request must be reviewed and approved by NRC in  consultation with other appropriate agencies, including the Departments of  Commerce, State, Defense, and Energy.", "NRC officials told us that they are required only to maintain a database of  exports of sealed sources that are issued under a specific license and  certain other exports of  concern, such as americium-241 and neptunium- 237.

As a result, the  conference encouraged countries to  conduct public outreach and awareness programs to foster a better  understanding of radiological threats and the appropriate response in  the event of a radiological emergency in order to minimize social and  economic disruption;  educate the public regarding the nature of radioactivity, the  consequences of the malevolent uses of high-risk radioactive sources,  and the procedures for mitigating those consequences in order to  reduce the psychological impact of radiological terrorism;  strengthen their education and training programs as a means to promote  confidence building within the public; and   assume greater responsibility for gaining the trust of the media and  informing them about the potential threat of radiological terrorism to  help ensure that the media will communicate information accurately in  a nonsensational manner to avoid fueling public fear and panic."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Information on IAEA\u2019s Revised Categorization of Radioactive Sources", "paragraphs": ["The purpose of IAEA\u2019s Categorization of Radioactive Sources is to provide  a fundamental and internationally harmonized basis for risk-informed  decision making. The draft document provides a categorization for  radioactive sources used in industry, medicine, agriculture, research, and  education.  The principles of the categorization can be equally applied to  radioactive sources, such as radioisotope thermoelectric generators that  may be under military control.  The categorization does not apply to  radiation-generating devices such as X-ray machines and particle  accelerators, although it may be applied to radioactive sources produced  by, or used as, target material in such devices.  The revised categorization  divides sources into five categories, according to their potential to cause  harmful health effects, should the source not be managed safely and  securely.  The categories are defined as follows:  Category 1 sources are considered extremely dangerous.  If not safely  managed safely, the radioactive material would likely cause permanent  injury to a person who handled it or were otherwise in contact with it  for more than a few minutes.  It would probably be fatal to be close to  this amount of unshielded material for a period of a few minutes to an  hour.  Furthermore, the amount of radioactive material, if dispersed by  fire or explosion, could possibly\u2014but would be unlikely to\u2014 permanently injure persons in the immediate vicinity or be life  threatening to them.  There would be little or no risk of immediate heath  effects to persons beyond a few hundred meters.  It would be highly  unlikely for a category 1 source to contaminate a public water supply to  dangerous levels, even if the radioactive material were highly soluble in  water.", "Category 2 sources are also considered personally dangerous.  If not  safely managed or securely protected, the radioactive material could  cause permanent injury to a person who handled it or were otherwise in  contact with it for a short time (minutes to hours).  It could possibly be  fatal to be close to this amount of unshielded radioactive material for a  period of hours to days.  The amount of radioactive material, if  dispersed by fire or explosion, could possibly\u2014but would be very  unlikely to\u2014permanently injure or be life threatening to persons in the  immediate vicinity.  It would be virtually impossible for a category 2  source to contaminate a public water supply to dangerous levels, even if  the radioactive material were highly soluble in water.", "Category 3 sources are also considered to be dangerous.

It would be virtually impossible for  a category 3 source to contaminate a public water supply to dangerous  levels, even if the radioactive material were highly soluble in water.", "Category 4 sources are unlikely to be dangerous.  It is very unlikely that  anyone would be permanently injured by this amount of radioactive  material.  This amount of radioactive material, if dispersed by fire or  explosion, could not permanently injure persons.", "Category 5 sources are not considered dangerous.  No one could be  permanently injured by this amount of radioactive material.   Furthermore, this amount of radioactive material, if dispersed by fire or  explosion, could not permanently injure persons.", "IAEA has developed a list on the basis of practices (such as irradiators,  industrial radiography, and teletherapy) as part of its relative ranking of  sealed sources.

Distributors of devices containing sealed sources  must be authorized to market such devices and must send monthly  accounts of the movement of sources to the French government agency  responsible for regulating sealed sources.  End users must have a license  covering each site where the sources are used, and the maximum duration  of a license is 5 years.  For items such as smoke detectors, the end user is  not required to have a license, but the distributor must be licensed.   Approximately 30,000 sources in use in France are tracked by the  government, and there are nearly 5,000 licensees.  This number does not  include very small sources like iodine grains used for medical purposes  (there are about 80,000 such sources) and smoke detectors (for 400,000  buildings), which are exempt from licensing requirements for end users.", "Sealed sources are subject to an annual inspection, and the end user pays  for the inspections.  The fee is a function of the number of sealed sources  owned by the licensee.  The inspection is designed to confirm that the  sealed sources are properly accounted for, adequately secured, and safely  used.  In order to renew a license, the licensing agency must be provided  with documentation of the annual inspections.  If the end user is not  inspected, it is subject to fines and may also be fined if the inspection  shows that it is not adequately protecting devices containing sealed  sources.  Fines are based on health and safety infractions\u2014not security  violations\u2014and the fines can be as high as about $15,000.", "France has also established a system to control orphan sources that has  three main components.", "End users are required to remove any source from service not more than  10 years after it was purchased.", "The company supplying the source to the end user is required to include  disposal costs within the purchase price.", "All other companies in the supply chain agree contractually to take back  the source after 10 years. guarantee is made either through an annual fee paid to an association of  source distributors or by providing France\u2019s national waste management  agency with a deposit.  The association represents 99 percent of all  distributors of devices containing sealed sources in France.  About 50  distributors are members of the association.  Typically, the distributor  makes an initial deposit of about $1,000 and then pays an annual fee on the  basis of the total activity of sources it has distributed, the technology that  the sealed sources are used for, and the value of the source. French  officials responsible for administering the system told us that, initially,  distributors did not like it because of the excessive amount of paper work  involved.  However, companies now see the value of the system.", "Distributors also have the option of contracting with France\u2019s radioactive  waste management agency for disposal of the sources if they do not want  to join the association.  Typically, the smaller distributors who choose this  option do so because they may only supply one or two sources per year and  do not want to share the risk of joining the larger association, where costs  are spread among many distributors.   Distributors who choose this option  are required to deposit funds with the agency to guarantee that disposal  costs will be covered.  The deposit ranges from about $1,000 to several  thousand dollars.  When a source is returned, the agency returns the  deposit (less an administrative fee) to the distributor.  According to French  officials, only 1 percent of the distributors of sources in France use this  option because they believe it is more expensive than belonging to the  association, which spreads the financial risk among all of its members.  In  addition, the cost determined by the waste management agency is based on  the entire cost of disposal and takes into account inflation and other  economic factors.   To date, the waste management agency has not had to  use the fund to dispose of any disused sealed sources.  The agency has  always been able to locate a source\u2019s manufacturer to take back the source  or find another manufacturer willing to accept it.", "According to French officials, when the system was first put into place, it  posed a difficulty for distributors, who had to pass the cost of the financial  guarantee to the end user.  However, now that the system has been in place  for many years, the additional costs are accepted, and users are pleased not  to have to deal with disposing of the sources on their own.  We were told  that the process works well and has contributed to the reduction in the  number of lost, stolen, or abandoned sealed sources.
