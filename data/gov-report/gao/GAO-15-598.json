However, some states reported that they do not assess whether TPPs are low-performing, as required by federal law. To receive funding under the Higher Education Act, states are required to conduct an assessment to identify TPPs that are low-performing. Seven states reported to GAO that they do not have a process to do so. State officials who reported not having a process in GAO\u2019s survey cited several reasons including that they believed other oversight procedures were sufficient to ensure quality. Education officials told GAO they have not verified states\u2019 processes to identify low-performing TPPs. In accordance with federal internal control standards, Education should provide reasonable assurance of compliance with applicable laws. If states fail to assess whether TPPs are low-performing, potential teaching candidates may have difficulty identifying low-performing TPPs. This could result in teachers who are not fully prepared to educate children.", "Officials in most surveyed states and all 14 of the TPPs GAO interviewed reported making changes to prepare teaching candidates for new state K-12 standards. Thirty-seven states reported providing TPPs with guidance about the new standards and a similar number of states reported adjusting their process for approving TPPs. Most states also required prospective teachers to pass licensing tests that have been modified in response to the new standards. Officials from all of the 14 TPPs GAO interviewed reported making changes that generally fell within the following three categories: (1) increasing subject-matter knowledge of teachers, (2) modifying coursework related to teaching techniques, and (3) using classroom training to provide real world experience.", "Education missed opportunities to share information about TPP quality internally and with state oversight entities. Federal internal controls standards highlight the value of effective information-sharing with internal and external stakeholders. However, Education does not have mechanisms in place to promote regular, sustained information-sharing among its various program offices that support TPP quality because the workgroup that used to facilitate such information-sharing was discontinued. Without such a mechanism, Education cannot fully leverage information about TPP quality gathered by its various programs. Furthermore, Education's current efforts to share information about TPP quality with states only reach about a third of states, according to GAO's survey, although about half of all states reported that they wanted more of such information. Gaps in the agency's efforts to disseminate information result from information-sharing being left to individual offices' initiative rather than an agency-wide mechanism. Education officials acknowledged that more could be done to share information with states and other stakeholders. Without such efforts, Education may miss opportunities to support state efforts to improve TPP quality. For example, states may be unaware of good practices identified by Education that could assist them in their oversight."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["Among other things, GAO recommends that Education monitor states to ensure their compliance with requirements to assess whether any TPPs are low-performing and develop mechanisms to share information about TPP quality within the agency and with states.

To obtain more detailed examples  about states\u2019 and TPPs\u2019 actions and experiences, we conducted case  studies of five states: Arizona, California, Maine, Tennessee and Virginia.  We selected these states because they represent a variety of sizes (i.e.,  numbers of TPPs operating in the state) and approaches to overseeing  TPPs (including how they use data about graduate effectiveness to  evaluate TPP performance), and to reflect different types of college- and  career-ready K-12 standards. For each case study state, we reviewed  documents and interviewed officials from the state agency or agencies  that oversee TPPs, two to three TPPs, and at least one K-12 school  district. In total, we interviewed 14 TPPs in our 5 case study states. We  ensured that this non-generalizable sample varied in a number of ways,  including whether they were located within or outside colleges and  universities; were alternative route or traditional; and offered in-person or  online coursework.

For  example, one TPP that made a number of modifications to its program  recently surveyed faculty and administrators to evaluate its efforts and  identify any ongoing needs. In addition, many states are beginning to  adopt assessments to measure K-12 students\u2019 performance on the new  standards, and officials from five TPPs said it will be important to  incorporate information about these assessments into their programs."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Education Missed Opportunities to Support TPP Improvement through Its Data Reporting and Information- Sharing", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Some Title II Data Have Not Been Useful to States and TPPs, but Education Has Not Assessed Whether Less Useful Elements Should be Eliminated", "paragraphs": ["The current Title II data requirements may be of limited use in helping to  improve the quality of TPPs and Education has not taken steps to  evaluate whether any of them should be eliminated. Each state collects  Title II information from colleges and universities that offer TPPs in the  state and submits information about TPPs and some information about  state oversight processes to Education annually. For example, they report  the number and demographics of teaching candidates enrolled in and  completing TPPs. As described below, states, TPPs, and other  stakeholders often reported to us that, while they may use some data  elements, others are not useful. This difference between the Title II  information states and colleges and universities are required to report  about TPPs and the information they and other stakeholders ultimately  use to make decisions is contrary to leading practices for data-driven  management, which state that measures should be selected based on  their relevance and ability to inform decisions by key stakeholders.", "Moreover, state oversight entities are important potential users of the Title  II data, but they reported mixed views about whether the data were useful  for their oversight, even though it takes a relatively large number of staff  hours to prepare the data. In our survey, states most frequently reported  spending between 21-100 staff hours completing the annual Title II state- level reports and another 21-100 hours assisting with institution and  program-level Title II reports.

Very few states reported using the data to inform state  funding decisions or to provide information to school districts that are  hiring teachers from TPPs. Nearly every state reported some cases  where certain requirements may not be helpful. For example, less than  half the states told us that they use the goals and assurances section of  the Title II reports, which includes information about institutions\u2019 progress  toward their goals for addressing teacher shortage areas. Further, 48  states told us either that they are not using some sections of the Title II  reports or that they already collect most of the useful Title II data  elements through other mechanisms. These results suggest that, even  among states that find the Title II data generally useful, states are  frequently required to complete some reporting requirements that they  report are not contributing to their oversight activities.", "Most of the TPPs and K-12 districts and several other stakeholders with  whom we spoke questioned the usefulness of some Title II data to  themselves and other stakeholders. Officials from 6 of the 14 TPPs with  whom we spoke reported spending at least a month completing the  annual Title II reports. Yet, 8 of the 14 TPPs told us that very little of the  Title II data was useful to them for assessing the performance of their  own programs. Officials from several TPPs also expressed confusion  about the overarching goal of the Title II reporting requirements. The TPP  officials said they have not seen any indication that other stakeholders,  such as state and federal regulators or prospective teaching candidates,  were using the Title II data to inform decisions. Further, none of the  officials in the six K-12 school districts we spoke with said they use the  Title II data when comparing TPP performance or recruiting new  teachers. Similarly, seven researchers and stakeholder organizations we  spoke with questioned the usefulness of some of the Title II data for  research purposes.", "Education officials said they have to continue to collect the current data,  due to statutory requirements. According to Education officials, the  agency can require states to submit new Title II data elements, but they  do not have authority to remove existing data elements that are required  by statute. Education described some benefits to the existing data,  including that it provides a robust picture of the demographics of teaching  candidates in each state, as well as the number of individuals who  complete a program. However, Education also noted in the preamble to  its December 2014 proposed rule that \u201cdata that are collected and  reported have not led to an identification of significant improvements in  teacher preparation program performance in part because the data are  not based on meaningful indicators of program effectiveness.\u201d  Education officials told us they have not conducted a study to inform  Congress or the agency about whether any current reporting  requirements are not useful. Therefore, Education has an incomplete  picture of the usefulness of various data fields and states and colleges  and universities will continue submitting data that are time-consuming to  gather and may not be contributing to state oversight, TPP improvement,  or the public\u2019s knowledge about TPPs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Education Has Not Identified and Publicized Key Limitations in How Data Should Be Interpreted", "paragraphs": ["Education permits states to report some Title II data in different ways to  account for their differing approaches to overseeing TPPs and the  differing structures of the TPPs themselves.

Education officials said  that such decisions are within the states\u2019 authority, but have  repercussions for the consistency of national Title II data.", "Teaching candidate enrollment: TPPs define when a teaching  candidate is formally enrolled and these definitions may range from  when a teaching candidate first takes a course to after they have  completed other requirements such as a certain sequence of courses.  Moreover, one large online TPP defines most of its teaching  candidates as enrolled in the state where the TPP is headquartered,  even though they live throughout the country and most likely plan to  teach in other states. Consequently, the Title II report lists that state  as one of the nation\u2019s top teacher-producing states, while state  officials told us that in fact the state faces teacher shortages.", "Program Completers: Education\u2019s Title II guidance defines a TPP  completer as someone who has met all the educational or training  requirements in a state-approved course of study for initial teacher  certification or licensure. However, this definition allows for states or  TPPs to choose whether they require their students to take and pass  all state licensing tests before they can complete all of those  educational or training requirements. As a result, different definitions  of completer can lead to inconsistent data and make it difficult to  make comparisons across TPPs or obtain a national picture regarding  TPP completers.", "These varying ways of calculating and reporting key Title II data have  persisted despite Education\u2019s efforts to clarify guidance and improve  reporting tools. Such efforts, according to Education and its Title II  contractor, have included clarified definitions, new guidance documents,  some on-site technical assistance visits, and additional data checks in the  online Title II reporting system. Several states and TPPs with whom we  spoke praised Education\u2019s efforts to facilitate the Title II submission  process, noting particularly that they have received excellent technical  assistance when they have questions about the process. However, states  and TPPs also noted remaining challenges, such as how to interpret the  Title II requirements within the context of each state or TPP\u2019s specific  circumstances.", "Education identified some potential data inconsistencies, such as  differences in state definitions of alternate route TPPs, in its most recent  Title II annual report, which presented information about the 2009-2010  academic year. However, it has not provided similar information about  limitations of data it has disseminated since then. In more recent Title II  data in published spreadsheets and on its website, Education does not  include clarifications about potentially inconsistent data elements, such as  alternative route TPPs or definitions of enrollees and completers.  Education officials told us they did not include such explanatory material  in these other formats because they considered the explanations in the  previous annual report to be sufficient. However, these officials also noted  that the agency may consider adding such material in the future. By not  providing the explanatory material, the data may be potentially misleading  and make it difficult for users to compare across states or programs. In  addition, by not providing these explanations, Education\u2019s approach is not  consistent with federal internal control standards, which require that  pertinent information should be identified, captured, and distributed in a  form that permits users to perform their duties efficiently."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Education Has Taken Few Steps to Share Information about Teacher Preparation Program Quality Internally and with States", "paragraphs": ["Education has made few efforts to share expertise about TPP quality  among its offices. Various offices and programs within Education  influence TPP quality, including the Office of Postsecondary Education,  which administers Higher Education Act Title II reporting requirements,  and several offices that administer competitive grants. However, the  agency does not have mechanisms in place to promote regular, sustained  information-sharing among these offices. Education officials said the  agency and its Title II contractor occasionally create custom Title II data  runs for Education program offices, but there is no systematic effort to  share Title II data within the agency. Further, Education officials in one  office that administers competitive grants related to TPP quality described  discussing grant results internally, but did not systematically discuss TPP  quality with staff in other offices and programs. Education formerly  convened a teacher quality workgroup on a regular basis that included  opportunities to share information across the agency regarding issues  related to TPP quality. Education officials noted that such workgroups,  particularly when operating out of high-level offices in the agency, have  been very helpful for systematically sharing information across offices.  However, the teacher quality workgroup has been inactive since the office  in which it was housed reorganized in the fall of 2014 and the agency has  not subsequently resumed these information-sharing efforts. This  represents a missed opportunity to use relevant information to bolster the  effectiveness of several Education programs, such as Race to the Top  and Supporting Effective Educator Development, which fund TPP  improvements, among other priorities. Federal internal controls standards  emphasize that effective information-sharing efforts are those that flow  broadly across an agency in a form that is helpful for those who need it to  carry out their responsibilities. Without such mechanisms to promote  information-sharing, programs and offices within Education may not have  access to clear and useful information about TPP quality.", "Furthermore, Education\u2019s efforts to support or enhance TPP quality reach  a limited number of states. For example, according to Education officials,  several technical assistance and research entities and the office that  administers competitive grants such as the Teacher Quality Partnership  Grant Program have recently undertaken research or disseminated good  practices about teacher preparation. However, in our survey, only about  one third of states reported receiving information from Education about  TPP oversight or enhancing TPP quality, and about half of all states said  they would like additional support from Education on this topic. This  suggests that Education is also missing opportunities to support states  that could use relevant research and assistance from Education to  enhance TPP quality. Additionally, 15 states reported in our survey that  they oversee TPPs through an independent standards board, oversee the  licensing of new teachers through such boards, or both. Among the eight  such states that responded to our follow-up inquires, officials from four  expressed concern about their access to Education resources for TPP  improvements because they are independent from the primary state  educational agency that has formalized relationships with Education\u2019s  technical assistance providers. Gaps in the agency\u2019s efforts to  disseminate information result from information- sharing being left to  individual offices\u2019 initiative rather than an agency-wide mechanism, and  Education officials noted that more could be done to share information  with states and other stakeholders. Education officials also noted that  sharing information with states can be challenging for some competitive  grant programs, because program funds are not always available for  Education to use for national activities, including providing technical  assistance to non-grantees. However, this also underscores the  importance of Education systematically leveraging existing resources to  disseminate knowledge about enhancing TPP quality. Federal internal  controls standards emphasize the importance of agencies ensuring  adequate information-sharing with key stakeholders. Without such an  approach, Education may be missing opportunities to support state efforts  to enhance TPP quality.

However,  unless Education ensures that all states assess whether TPPs are low- performing as required by the Higher Education Act, low-performing TPPs  may not be identified, potentially resulting in new teachers being ill- prepared to teach K-12 students. Further, if Higher Education Act Title II  reports include data elements that are not useful, states and colleges and  universities that offer TPPs will expend unnecessary effort on collecting  information that is unlikely to improve TPP quality. Among reporting  requirements that are useful, if Title II reports do not include important  limitations on how the data should be used, policymakers and  practitioners could draw incorrect conclusions based on the data.
