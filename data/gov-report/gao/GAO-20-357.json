In particular, during fiscal years 2012 through 2019, NNSA carried out a multiyear, $150-million effort at Sandia to replace or refurbish infrastructure and equipment in its primary microelectronics production facility to ensure continued operations through 2025. While NNSA was working with Sandia to sustain current facilities, the agency also began identifying and evaluating options for producing microelectronics after 2025, including constructing a new multi-billion dollar production facility at Sandia. However, because of changes to key assumptions, including longer-term viability of existing facilities, NNSA decided in November 2018 not to pursue any of the identified alternatives and instead stated that the agency was going to assess options to sustain its current capability at Sandia.", "NNSA's ongoing approach to managing its strategic radiation-hardened microelectronics activities includes two key efforts. First, the agency decided in October 2019 to invest about $1 billion over the next 20 years to upgrade and sustain its microelectronics capability at Sandia through 2040. Specifically, NNSA plans to upgrade its production process as well as complete identified infrastructure (such as electrical distribution) and equipment projects. Second, in November 2019 NNSA created and filled a new full-time microelectronics coordinator position that, among other things, will have responsibility for certain aspects of the agency's microelectronics activities, according to agency officials. However, NNSA's approach does not fully incorporate key management controls that NNSA applies to other important activities. For example, DOE and NNSA require their programs and projects to establish an overarching management plan that describes the procedures to define, execute, and monitor a program or project as well as establishing specific requirements in a variety of areas such as cost estimating and performance management. NNSA has not established a similar management plan to oversee and coordinate its microelectronics activities. By incorporating these key management controls, NNSA would have increased assurance that its planned microelectronics activities are clearly defined, efficiently executed, and effectively monitored."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that NNSA incorporate additional management controls, such as developing an overarching management plan, to better oversee and coordinate its microelectronics activities.

These unique electronics are referred to as \u201cstrategic  radiation-hardened\u201d microelectronics, reflecting their ability to function  properly in environments with extremely high levels of radiation (such as  gamma rays or x-rays). Strategic radiation-hardened microelectronics  are essential components of a nuclear weapon\u2019s arming, fuzing, and firing  system, which provides the signals that initiate the nuclear explosive  chain.

However, trends in the global commercial microelectronics  industry increasingly limit NNSA\u2019s ability to partner with industry to  meet its microelectronics needs, according to NNSA officials and  Sandia contractor representatives. For example, the commercial  industry is focused on producing microelectronics for consumer and  \u201csmart\u201d devices using the latest technologies with a high volume of  production, which means that technologies are rapidly replaced and  commercial microelectronics have a relatively limited lifespan. In  contrast, NNSA requires a much lower quantity of microelectronics  with unique requirements (such as strategic radiation hardening) for  which there is no commercial demand. In addition, because the  United States must sustain its nuclear weapons for decades, NNSA  generally requires its microelectronics to remain functional for much  longer than consumer devices are designed to, according to NNSA  officials.", "According to NNSA documentation, the nuclear weapons supply chain  must be trusted to protect against potential sabotage, among other  things. However, production of commercial microelectronics has  increasingly moved offshore\u2014primarily to Asia\u2014while a number of  domestic producers have been acquired by foreign entities.

To further support our analysis of  this documentation, we interviewed NNSA officials and contractor  representatives from Sandia who either authored or were responsible for  reviewing and approving key documents. We also interviewed  representatives of NNSA\u2019s third-party independent contractor who  authored one study on sustaining existing facilities and two studies on  identifying alternatives for its capability. Because NNSA\u2019s evaluation of  future alternatives included coordination with the Department of Defense  (DOD), which also requires the microelectronics contained in some of its  national security systems to properly function in certain environments  (such as space) that have increased radiation levels, we reviewed DOD  documents such as the department\u2019s plan to accelerate implementation of  its trusted microelectronics strategy and roadmap.

NNSA pursued  this effort in response to a 2010 study conducted by Sandia that identified  the need for millions of dollars in funding to sustain the SiFab Facility  through 2025. NNSA\u2019s sustainment efforts focused on the following two  areas:  Infrastructure. NNSA spent about $27 million to complete  approximately 25 infrastructure projects that support microelectronics  production. For example, NNSA installed two new 20,000-gallon tanks  for water storage to improve the facility\u2019s deionized water system,  which provides ultra-high purity water for use in certain processing  steps.

In fiscal year 2018, Sandia refurbished existing equipment and purchased  new equipment that is more automated and is intended to increase  process reliability. In addition, according to Sandia documentation,  Sandia needed to convert its production process to use 8-inch silicon  wafers because the commercial sector had increasingly limited  maintenance support and service for equipment that processed 6-inch  wafers.", "While NNSA was working with Sandia to sustain the SiFab Facility  through 2025, the agency also began identifying and evaluating options  for producing microelectronics after 2025, such as constructing a new  multibillion-dollar production facility at Sandia. However, because of  changes to key assumptions, NNSA decided in November 2018 not to  pursue any of the identified alternatives and instead stated that the  agency was going to assess options to sustain its current capability at  Sandia beyond 2025. See figure 4 for a summary of NNSA\u2019s actions to  sustain the SiFab facility and consider alternatives.", "More specifically, NNSA took the following actions during the past decade  to identify alternatives for producing microelectronics beyond 2025:  In 2011, NNSA\u2019s Deputy Administrator for Defense Programs  requested proposals from the agency\u2019s three nuclear weapons  laboratories for flagship experimental science, technology, and  engineering facilities to help ensure that NNSA will have the  capabilities to address future national security needs. In response,  Sandia submitted a proposal to NNSA in 2012 to construct a new,  multibillion-dollar microelectronics production facility, called the Center  for Heterogeneous Integration, Packaging, and Processes (CHIP2).  The Sandia proposal estimated that CHIP2 would take 14 years to  design and build at an estimated cost of $2.5 billion. The proposal  indicated that the facility would increase microelectronics functionality  and trustworthiness by creating a trusted supply chain into the future  for design, fabrication, testing, and packaging activities. As a result of  the time needed to design and construct CHIP2, investment would still  be needed to sustain the MESA SiFab Facility through 2025.", "NNSA commissioned two studies by The Aerospace Corporation, a  federally funded research and development center sponsored by the  Air Force, to help the agency evaluate Sandia\u2019s CHIP2 proposal  against other potential alternatives, such as contracting with  commercial entities to produce microelectronics. These studies,  completed in August and September 2014, generally ranked the  CHIP2 proposal at or near the top of the alternatives but also stated  that CHIP2 did not stand out as a decidedly better option.  Nonetheless, in early 2015, NNSA\u2019s Deputy Administrator for Defense  Programs issued a memorandum recommending that NNSA pursue  the CHIP2 proposal as a formal capital asset project, subject to DOE\u2019s  project management order on acquisition of capital assets.", "In 2016, in accordance with DOE\u2019s project management order, NNSA  developed two key documents during the initiation phase of its capital  asset project supporting the CHIP2 proposal, which NNSA referred to  as the Trusted Microelectronics Capability (TMC) project.", "NNSA first developed a mission need statement, which is a formal  document that identifies a credible performance gap between  current capabilities and those needed to achieve the goals stated  in the agency\u2019s strategic plan. The mission need should be  stated in a way that is solution-neutral. The project\u2019s mission need  statement stated that, among other things, after 2025 the SiFab  Facility faced a severe risk of equipment and facility failures that  could have detrimental impacts on future microelectronics  production schedules. The statement noted that continued  refurbishment of the SiFab Facility beyond 2025 could result in  significant downtime during critical weapon development and  production cycles, as the facility was constructed in the 1980s and  was not sized for modern microelectronics production equipment  and supporting infrastructure.", "NNSA next developed a requirements document, which describes  the ultimate goals the project must satisfy while also identifying  key assumptions and constraints. The requirements document  identified several key requirements, including that the TMC project  must be able to provide NNSA with trusted access to produce  microelectronics in support of the agency\u2019s nuclear weapons  mission.", "Between 2016 and 2017, in accordance with DOE\u2019s project  management order, NNSA conducted an analysis of alternatives for  the TMC project based on achieving NNSA\u2019s mission need statement.  Such an analysis identifies, analyzes, and selects a preferred  alternative to best meet the mission need by comparing the  operational effectiveness, costs, and risks of potential alternatives,  according to DOE documentation. During this process, NNSA  considered 21 alternatives for meeting the mission need statement,  among them the CHIP2 proposal as well as several alternatives that  included partnerships with commercial industry and other government  production facilities. The final TMC analysis of alternatives report,  dated January 2018, did not identify the CHIP2 proposal as a  preferred alternative because of the proposal\u2019s high life-cycle costs,  high total project cost, and long project schedule. Instead, the report  identified two preferred alternatives as best meeting NNSA\u2019s needs:  (1) partnering with an existing, government-owned, contractor- operated production facility other than Sandia; and (2) entering into  an interagency agreement with DOD and at least one member of the  intelligence community, as well as a commercial entity, to design,  build, and operate a state-of-the-art production facility.", "Ultimately, NNSA decided not to pursue either preferred alternative  because of changing assumptions. For example, one of NNSA\u2019s key  assumptions for the TMC analysis of alternatives was that the SiFab  Facility could not remain operational beyond 2025. However, NNSA  tasked The Aerospace Corporation to validate this assumption, and in  January 2018, The Aerospace Corporation completed a study concluding  that the SiFab Facility could remain viable until 2040 with prioritized and  well-planned infrastructure repairs and equipment replacements.  Another example of changing assumptions concerned the preferred  alternative under which NNSA would enter into an interagency agreement  with DOD and at least one member of the intelligence community to  design, build, and operate a state-of-the-art production facility. This  preferred alternative assumed that DOD, the intelligence community, or  both, would pay to develop and build the production facility (estimated to  cost from $350 million up to $1.2 billion), while NNSA would pay to equip  its portion of the production process. The TMC analysis of alternatives  report stated that commitment from DOD and the intelligence community  would be vital, and that this alternative carried significant execution risks.  In January 2018, NNSA documentation stated that this interagency  alternative was no longer viable because other agencies stated they were  no longer interested in a potential partnership.", "Partly as a result of these changes in key assumptions, in November  2018, NNSA wrote in a letter to Congress that it was no longer requesting  funding for the TMC and was assessing what investments were needed  to extend the operational life of the SiFab Facility to 2040."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NNSA Has Decided to Upgrade and Sustain Its Microelectronics Capability at Sandia through 2040, but Its Management Approach Does Not Fully Incorporate Key Controls", "paragraphs": ["As part of NNSA\u2019s ongoing approach to managing its strategic radiation- hardened microelectronics activities, the agency plans to upgrade and  sustain its microelectronics capability at Sandia through 2040, which it  estimates will cost about $1 billion over the next 20 years.

This upgraded process, called CMOS8, contains some  features of the currently employed CMOS7 process, but is a more  advanced technology node that also includes many new features,  according to Sandia documentation. Second, NNSA approved plans to  produce and integrate into future nuclear weapons a more advanced type  of microelectronics component called a field programmable gate array  (FPGA). According to Sandia documentation, strategic radiation- hardened FPGAs can be produced using the CMOS8 process but not the  CMOS7 process. Third, Sandia developed and NNSA approved a plan to  identify, prioritize, and provide budget estimates to sustain Sandia\u2019s  microelectronics infrastructure and equipment at the MESA Complex over  the next 20 years. This plan incorporates NNSA\u2019s decisions to develop  the CMOS8 process and produce FPGAs.", "According to NNSA and Sandia documents, the rationale behind and  expected benefits of these three key decisions are as follows:", "The CMOS8 process will allow Sandia to produce microelectronics at  a smaller, more advanced technology node (180nm) compared with  the current CMOS7 technology node (350nm). NNSA documentation  states that, among other things, the CMOS8 process is expected to  produce microelectronics that have twice the processing speed  compared with those produced using the CMOS7 process. Such  advances are needed to help ensure that future nuclear weapons  remain safe, secure, and reliable while operating in increasingly  hostile threat environments and that the weapons meet increased  performance requirements, according to Sandia documentation.  According to NNSA officials, the agency agreed with Sandia\u2019s  assessment on implementing the CMOS8 production process based,  in part, on findings and recommendations contained in an  independent study commissioned by NNSA and completed by  multiple entities including The Aerospace Corporation.", "According to Sandia documentation, while FPGAs have never been  used before in a nuclear weapon, they may significantly reduce the  cycle time for microelectronics research, development, and production  compared with cycle times for ASICs used in nuclear weapons. This  reduction may be possible because the ASICs currently used in  nuclear weapons are uniquely designed and produced to carry out  specific functions, whereas FPGAs can be produced using a common  design and then programmed after production (but before insertion  into a nuclear weapon) to carry out different functions, according to  NNSA officials. Reduced cycle time from FPGAs could alleviate  schedule pressure on future weapon modernization programs  because cycle times for designing and producing ASICs for LEPs  have historically been about 10 years before production of the first  weapon, according to Sandia documentation.", "Sandia\u2019s plan will provide NNSA with the basis for the investment  profile needed to sustain the MESA Complex\u2019s infrastructure and  equipment through 2040. Because the sustainment effort will last at  least 20 years, NNSA officials said that having a long-term planning  document that provides a current baseline for the condition of  Sandia\u2019s microelectronics infrastructure and equipment, identifies  challenges, and recommends specific sustainment activities will be a  useful management tool.", "The plan for extending the life of the MESA Complex at Sandia provides  cost and schedule estimates related to sustainment of existing facilities  and equipment, as well as installation of new equipment for CMOS8 and  development and maturation of the FPGA technology. Overall, the plan  calls for spending about $1 billion over the next 20 years. Specifically, the  plan identifies spending for the following activities:", "Sustainment of existing facilities and equipment. The plan  identifies about $900 million in spending from fiscal years 2020  through 2040\u2014or about $45 million a year for the next 20 years\u2014to  complete identified infrastructure and equipment projects. The plan  calls for spending roughly half of the $900 million on projects to  upgrade existing infrastructure within the MESA Complex. In  particular, Sandia plans to spend about $120 million from fiscal years  2020 through 2024 on projects to improve or upgrade infrastructure  within the SiFab Facility that is considered to be in \u201cpoor condition\u201d  based on information contained in NNSA\u2019s infrastructure condition  database. The SiFab Facility is to be the physical location for the  majority of production tools for CMOS8. Two of these projects would  replace electrical power and distribution equipment at an estimated  cost of about $50 million, while another project would replace the  facility\u2019s chemical distribution system at an estimated cost of about $5  million. Sandia plans to spend the other half of the $900 million on  equipment-related projects. For example, Sandia plans to spend  about $85 million from fiscal years 2021 through 2026 on projects to  support existing, non-CMOS8 production processes\u2014such as  producing transistors in the Micro Fabrication Facility\u2014as well as  activities that support microelectronics production, such as laboratory  analysis, testing, and packaging. For example, Sandia plans to spend  $1.5 million on a computerized tomography machine to support  microelectronics testing.", "Development of CMOS8 and production of FPGAs. The MESA  Complex extended life plan identifies about $170 million in spending  from fiscal years 2020 through 2027 related to developing, maturing,  installing, and implementing the CMOS8 process and the FPGA  technology. Sandia contractor representatives told us that the CMOS8  process relies on newer and more advanced equipment to complete  critical individual processing steps compared with the current CMOS7  process. As a result, the plan identifies about $70 million (out of the  $170 million total) to acquire approximately 30 pieces of equipment,  which Sandia will need to install and then qualify their performance. In  addition, the plan identifies almost $90 million (out of the $170 million  total) for developing and maturing the CMOS8 production process and  the FPGA technology. According to Sandia documentation, Sandia  plans to begin using the CMOS8 process to produce FPGAs for  integration into a future nuclear weapon program at the end of fiscal  year 2027.", "In addition to upgrading and sustaining Sandia\u2019s microelectronics  capabilities through 2040, NNSA is in the preliminary stages of identifying  and evaluating options to ensure a continued microelectronics capability  beyond 2040, according to NNSA officials and documentation. In  particular, NNSA has identified the following two key options:", "NNSA is in the initial stages of identifying and evaluating options to  construct a new facility for producing microelectronics by 2040 and  beyond. In December 2019, NNSA officials provided us with  documentation stating that the agency plans to begin evaluating  options for a new microelectronics facility in 2021 with the goal of  completing construction in 2030, installing needed equipment in the  completed facility by 2033, and qualifying the production process and  begin producing microelectronics for integration into nuclear weapons  no later than 2035. In NNSA\u2019s fiscal year 2021 budget request, which  was released in February 2020, the agency requested funds to begin  evaluation and early planning activities for this new microelectronics  facility.", "NNSA is also evaluating whether the agency might be able to  leverage a recent investment by DOD in a U.S. commercial  microelectronics production facility to help meet NNSA\u2019s  microelectronics production needs after 2040. Specifically, DOD  announced in October 2019 that it had awarded a contract to a U.S.- owned-and-operated microelectronics commercial production facility  to, among other things, enhance its radiation-hardened  microelectronics production process to meet DOD\u2019s microelectronic  needs for systems (such as satellites) that operate in environments  with increased radiation levels. Over the next two years, the U.S.  commercial microelectronics production facility plans to adapt its  current production process and develop a new process that will  produce microelectronics at a smaller node, according to DOD  documentation. According to NNSA officials we interviewed in  February 2020, NNSA and DOD are in preliminary discussions to  determine if NNSA could make additional investments in this same  facility to potentially produce strategic radiation-hardened  microelectronics for integration into nuclear weapons. NNSA officials  said that there was no firm timeframe for making an investment  decision because such a decision would need to be made after the  microelectronics facility begins producing microelectronics at the  smaller node."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NNSA Is Starting to Implementing a Revised Microelectronics Management Approach, but This Approach Does Not Fully Incorporate Key Management Controls", "paragraphs": ["NNSA is starting to implement a revised approach to managing its  microelectronics activities. During our initial interviews with NNSA officials  in early 2019, they stated that NNSA had not established a formal  management structure to oversee the agency\u2019s microelectronics  activities. Instead, they said that NNSA had delegated primary  responsible for overseeing such activities to two officials within NNSA\u2019s  Office of Defense Programs, who both served in multiple positions and  had other duties within the office. According to these officials, once NNSA  formally canceled the TMC project in November 2018, management  efforts were focused on making initial determinations on the actions and  budget estimates needed to sustain NNSA\u2019s existing microelectronics  capability at Sandia until 2040. These efforts included coordinating with  multiple NNSA offices\u2014such as the Office of Safety, Infrastructure and  Operations\u2014to understand their future microelectronics needs and  requirements and to review draft MESA Complex sustainment  documentation prepared by Sandia.", "However, officials from NNSA\u2019s Office of Defense Programs told us that  in late 2019 they determined that a more coordinated management  approach would better position NNSA to oversee microelectronics  activities and make informed budgetary and programmatic decisions.  Specifically, NNSA officials stated that in November 2019 the Office of  Defense Programs created and filled a new full-time microelectronics  coordinator position within a sub-office, the Office of Research,  Development, Test, and Evaluation. The microelectronics coordinator told  us that NNSA has not yet finalized an official position description for the coordinator role. However, the coordinator said that the position will  primarily be responsible for developing the CMOS8 process and the  FPGA technology and integrating the research and development activities  of the Office of Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation with  another sub-office, the Office of Production Modernization.", "In addition, officials from NNSA\u2019s Office of Defense Programs and Office  of Safety, Infrastructure and Operations told us that they continue to use  other existing processes to manage microelectronics activities at Sandia.  For example, these officials said that they use the annual planning,  programming, budgeting, and evaluation process, along with the annual  work authorization process, to coordinate across NNSA offices on  budgetary matters and work activities associated with microelectronics  activities at Sandia. As part of these processes, agency officials told us  that they issue annual implementation plans to direct the work of Sandia  contractors related to microelectronics activities. NNSA officials then  monitor the contractors\u2019 progress toward completing the identified scope  of work and work activities. For example, NNSA officials said that they  conduct monthly meetings with contractor representatives to review  status and financial reports. They also said that they hold mid-year and  end-of-year program reviews with contractor representatives.", "To help management achieve desired results\u2014such as ensuring a  continued microelectronics capability\u2014federal agencies design,  implement, and operate internal controls, which comprise the plans,  methods, policies, and procedures used to fulfill an entity\u2019s mission,  goals, and objectives. Federal standards for internal control state that  management should, among other things: design control activities, such as by developing policies, procedures,  techniques, and mechanisms that enforce management\u2019s directives,  to achieve objectives and respond to risk; and establish an organizational structure, assign responsibility, and  delegate authority to achieve the entity\u2019s objectives.", "NNSA has implemented internal controls at the agency level, in part, by  developing and implementing directives that provide an organizational  structure for the agency to plan, execute, control, and assess its  programs and projects while also assigning responsibility and delegating  authority for key management roles. For example, one purpose of  NNSA\u2019s 2019 program management directives is to increase  management efficiency and effectiveness by, among other things, clearly  defining management responsibilities and authorities. In addition, DOE\u2019s  project management order for the acquisition of capital assets lists  principles for successful project execution such as disciplined, up-front  planning; line management accountability; and effective implementation  of all management systems (such as risk and performance management)  supporting the project.", "In particular and as applicable to front-end planning, NNSA\u2019s and DOE\u2019s  directives related to program and project management both include the  following controls:", "Appointment of a federal manager, who is vested with the authority to  carry out assigned responsibilities to meet program or project  milestones on schedule and on budget, who manages the  coordination of deliverables between the multiple entities (such as  different program offices) involved, and who is responsible and  accountable for planning, implementing, and executing a program or  project, which includes responsibility for developing an overarching  management plan;", "An overarching management plan, which establishes the procedures  to define, execute, and monitor a program or project, as well as  establishing specific requirements in a variety of areas\u2014such as cost  estimating, an integrated schedule, performance management, and  risk management\u2014to use to develop a baseline and against which to  measure and monitor;", "A mission need statement, which identifies a credible gap between  current capabilities and those needed to achieve the goals stated in  the strategic plan; and", "A requirements document that describes the ultimate goals the  program or project must satisfy while also identifying key assumptions  and constraints.", "However, while some in NNSA and at Sandia have recognized the need  to coordinate microelectronics activities to effectively carry them out and  meet specific goals by specific dates, as evidenced by the hiring of a  coordinator, Office of Defense Programs leadership have not fully  developed controls to better manage and coordinate its microelectronics  activities.

Moreover, in May 2020, NNSA  stated that senior leadership within the Office of Defense Programs  have not endorsed the formal role of a microelectronics coordinator  and that the coordinator\u2019s role and responsibilities are currently under  review. NNSA also stated that the coordinator has not been given  authority to manage an annual budget for microelectronics activities  and that it was unlikely that such authority would be granted.  This  statement stands in contrast to earlier statements made to us that the  coordinator would have responsibility for an annual budget of about  $50 million, subject to future appropriations.", "Management plan. NNSA has not developed an overarching  management plan to guide and coordinate the agency\u2019s  microelectronics activities. Instead, NNSA officials from the Office of  Defense Programs and the Office of Safety, Infrastructure and  Operations told us that the agency is in the very early stages of  developing a NNSA plan that will incorporate key decisions and  approaches outlined in the Sandia\u2019s 20-year MESA sustainment plan,  among other things. While NNSA officials are still evaluating the  specific contents of this plan, they said that the plan may outline  specific roles and responsibilities for each NNSA office involved in  microelectronics, describe how these offices will interact with the  microelectronics coordinator, and provide options for future  microelectronics technology development efforts. However, it is  unclear whether the document will define the planning approach,  procedures, and processes that NNSA will use to ensure coordinated  management in multiple areas and across multiple offices, such as  developing cost estimates, an integrated schedule, and performance  metrics.

For example, as we reported in June 2019, while  NNSA historically managed its high-explosive capability without a formal  mechanism to coordinate activities across multiple programs, it recently  implemented a more robust set of management controls to oversee its  high-explosive activities. Specifically, in 2018 NNSA appointed an  enterprise manager to help coordinate these activities. NNSA also  encouraged the enterprise manager to adopt, where appropriate, the  program management controls contained in an NNSA directive on  managing nuclear weapon life extension and strategic materials  programs. Subsequently, the enterprise manager issued a strategic plan  that provided an organizational structure for the agency\u2019s high explosives  capability.
