Nothing came to GAO's attention that raised concerns regarding the adequacy of the Navy's documentation beyond those the IPA identified and determined to be immaterial.", "Both the IPA's examination and the Navy's assertion and validation efforts identified additional risks to the Navy's future audit readiness. For example, the IPA found that 14 of 34 military pay controls it examined were either not designed effectively or not operating effectively. Further, the Navy limited the scope of the IPA's examination to focus on 1 month of activity to address any deficiencies identified prior to the audit of its fiscal year 2015 Statement of Budgetary Activity, which is currently under way. However, because of the volume of transactions during a 12-month period, obtaining supporting documentation may be more challenging than supporting transactions limited to a 1-month period. In addition, the Navy identified extensive deficiencies in six personnel and other key systems it relies on to process and report military pay activity. Navy officials acknowledge that additional efforts are needed to fully address these deficiencies. Questions also exist regarding the audit readiness of certain related activities beyond the scope of the Navy's military pay activities\u2014such as financial reporting controls related to reconciling the Navy's Fund Balance with Treasury\u2014because of extensive deficiencies or because they have not been independently examined. Achieving audit readiness also requires coordination with the IPA, the Department of Defense (DOD) Office of Inspector General, and service providers; however, the Navy did not always effectively coordinate these activities. For example, GAO found that the Navy did not (1) establish milestones to assess the effectiveness of certain of its controls associated with payroll services provided by the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) and (2) effectively coordinate efforts to ensure that the required management representation letter was provided to the IPA in a timely manner.", "The audit of the Navy's fiscal year 2015 Schedule of Budgetary Activity, of which military pay activity represents a significant portion of reported obligations and outlays, is intended to help identify areas for additional focus, and facilitate efforts to achieve DOD's goal of financial statement auditability department-wide by September 30, 2017. However, without reliable controls and systems, auditors will likely need to perform additional, more costly procedures to obtain assurance in future audits, and the reliability of financial information for day-to-day decision making will remain at risk. GAO continues to stress the importance of addressing fundamental systems and control deficiencies, which will lead to lasting financial management improvements and, as a result, provide greater assurance of future audit readiness."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the Navy establish (1) milestones for assessing and implementing certain controls associated with payroll services provided by DFAS and (2) a policy to coordinate with auditors on providing required management representation letters in a timely manner.

Since 1995,  GAO has designated DOD financial management as high risk because of  pervasive weaknesses in its financial and business management  systems, as well as control deficiencies that have adversely affected its  ability to (1) control costs; (2) ensure basic accountability; (3) anticipate  future costs and claims on the budget; (4) measure performance;   (5) maintain funds control; (6) prevent and detect fraud, waste, and  abuse; (7) address pressing management issues; and (8) prepare  auditable financial statements. As part of DOD\u2019s ongoing financial  management reform efforts, in March 2013, the Navy asserted audit  readiness of its military payroll activity. An independent public  accountant (IPA) performed a validation examination of the Navy\u2019s  assertion; the IPA\u2019s work focused, in part, on a 1-month schedule of  military pay activity for April 2013. The IPA reported that in its opinion the  Navy\u2019s assertion was fairly stated.", "In 2012, we reported that the U.S. Army could not readily provide a  complete and valid population of its active duty military payroll and lacked  supporting documentation for its military pay activity. Because the Navy  uses a similar pay system and has numerous systems for pay-related  data, you asked us to assess whether the Navy is effectively addressing  audit readiness issues similar to those experienced by the Army. This  report examines the extent to which (1) the Navy was able to provide  sufficient documentation to support a complete and valid population of  detailed transactions reconcilable to its schedule of military pay activity for  April 2013 and (2) the Navy\u2019s military pay assertion and validation efforts,  which include the IPA\u2019s examination, contribute to future audit readiness.  To address our objectives, we reviewed the IPA\u2019s audit documentation  and analyzed the documentation that the Navy provided to the IPA to  assess the sufficiency of evidence to support the completeness and  validity of transactions on its 1-month schedule of military pay activity for  April 2013. We reviewed documentation on identified military pay control  deficiencies, the status of the Navy\u2019s actions to address those  deficiencies, and audit readiness efforts of other assessable units  involving military pay-related activity.

The NDAA for  Fiscal Year 2013 required that the FIAR Plan state the specific actions to  be taken and the costs associated with validating the audit readiness of  DOD\u2019s Statement of Budgetary Resources (SBR) no later than  September 30, 2014. However, DOD acknowledged in its November  2014 FIAR Plan Status Report that it did not meet this date and, in  response to difficulties in preparing for an SBR audit, reduced the scope  of initial audits to focus only on current year budget activity to be reported  on a Schedule of Budgetary Activity beginning in fiscal year 2015.

According to its assertion, the Navy placed  additional reliance on testing of supporting documentation to meet  financial reporting objectives in instances where controls were not  operating effectively. In addition, based on limited tests performed prior to  its assertion, the Navy identified extensive control deficiencies associated  with certain key systems. For purposes of asserting audit readiness, the  Navy determined that risks associated with these deficiencies were  mitigated based on the results of substantive tests, reconciliations, and  other tests performed in connection with its assertion efforts.

As specified in its contract with the Navy, the IPA was  required to perform an audit readiness validation examination to  determine (1) if adequate supporting documentation exists to address all  relevant financial statement assertions for all material transactions and  account balances reflected on the Navy\u2019s schedule of military pay for April  2013 and (2) if business processes and internal control activities are  designed and operating effectively to limit the risk of material  misstatement of the financial statements by meeting applicable financial  reporting objectives. With regard to the Navy\u2019s internal controls, the IPA  assessed 34 controls supporting the Navy\u2019s assertion and determined  that, although certain controls for each financial reporting objective were  effective, 14 controls associated with these objectives were either not  designed effectively or not operating effectively. As a result, the IPA relied  primarily on substantive tests to assess whether amounts reported on the  Navy\u2019s schedule of military pay activity for April 2013 were adequately  supported by sufficient evidence.", "The Navy\u2019s schedule of military pay activity for April 2013 reflected  obligations of $2.25 billion and outlays of $2.19 billion associated with  activities included in the scope of the Navy\u2019s assertion; these obligations  and outlays were recorded in the Navy\u2019s general ledger and included  activity related to basic pay and entitlements for allowances for officers,  enlisted personnel, and midshipmen, as well as certain other military  personnel costs. The schedule of military pay activity included  obligations associated with servicemembers\u2019 gross pay and related  payroll taxes and associated outlays disbursed in April 2013.

Rather than extending the period of activity to a longer period of time to  more closely approximate future audits of Schedules of Budgetary  Activity, Navy officials told us that they limited the scope to 1 month to  provide the time necessary to address any deficiencies that might be  identified by the IPA prior to the fiscal year 2015 Schedule of Budgetary  Activity examination, which began in December 2014. However,  according to a FIAR Directorate official, assertion examinations should  generally cover at least a 3-month period and would provide a greater  level of audit readiness assurance than an examination focused on a 1- month period of activity. Further, because of the volume of transactions  during a 12-month period of activity, obtaining supporting documentation  may be more challenging than supporting transactions limited to a 1- month period of time.

For example, preparing financial statements  involves additional financial reporting processes, such as reconciling the  Navy\u2019s Fund Balance with Treasury, performing funds receipt and  distribution activities, and recording certain journal vouchers. However,  the Navy\u2019s assurance regarding the audit readiness of these other key  processes is limited. For example, although the Navy asserted the audit  readiness of its Fund Balance with Treasury reconciliation process in April  2013, the DOD OIG reported that the Navy\u2019s process did not provide  reasonable assurance to support the accuracy, timeliness, and  completeness of the account\u2019s auditability. The DOD OIG identified  issues affecting the Navy\u2019s audit readiness, including the lack of detailed  support for amounts used in reconciling Navy\u2019s Fund Balance with  Treasury account with Treasury\u2019s accounts and significant information  system control deficiencies.", "Additionally, the Navy has not asserted or undergone an examination for  processes specifically related to the audit readiness of its financial  statement and compilation activities. In December 2014, the Navy  reported extensive deficiencies in controls associated with these  activities. For example, key reconciliations were not always adequately  performed or documented to identify and resolve differences between  balances recorded in the Navy\u2019s general ledger system and other Navy  financial systems and balances recorded in the Defense Departmental  Reporting System (DDRS). Further, amounts in DDRS are adjusted to  resolve out-of-balance amounts imported from the Navy\u2019s systems  through the creation of journal vouchers without transaction-level  documentation to support them. Although the Navy indicated that  corrective action plans have been established to address these  deficiencies, it could not provide us with information on when efforts to  resolve them were expected to be completed.", "In addition, according to its military pay reconciliations, the Navy incurred  obligations of $225 million in April 2013 associated with its military  personnel appropriations that were excluded from its military pay  assessable unit. Approximately $203 million, or 90 percent, of these  obligations were associated with three types of activity: permanent  change of station travel ($104 million), supply-related requisitions   ($52 million), and reimbursable work orders ($47 million). However,  independent examinations to assess these activities have not been  performed or have identified significant concerns about the audit  readiness of such activities. Specifically, Navy officials stated that  permanent change of station travel was not addressed in other audit  readiness assertions or IPA examinations and, as a result, will be tested  during the Navy\u2019s fiscal year 2015 Schedule of Budgetary Activity audit. In  addition, although the Navy asserted audit readiness of its supply  requisition-related activity in December 2013, officials indicated that a  separate independent examination to validate this assertion will not be  performed. Further, in April 2013, the Navy asserted that its reimbursable  work orders assessable unit was audit ready. However, an IPA reported  in January 2015 that the Navy\u2019s schedules of reimbursable work order  activity examined by the IPA were materially misstated because the Navy  was unable to isolate reimbursable work order transactions from the rest  of its financial transactions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Navy Coordination with the IPA, OIG, and DFAS Was Not Always Effective", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Management Representation Letter", "paragraphs": ["Although the IPA completed its fieldwork in September 2014, its  examination report was not issued until January 2015, in part because of  the lack of effective coordination between the Navy and the IPA to ensure  that adequate management representations were provided to the IPA in a  timely manner. Specifically, the Navy did not provide a signed  management representation letter consistent with auditing standards until  more than 3 months after the IPA requested it.", "The FAM requires auditors to obtain representation letters from  appropriate management officials. In addition, auditing standards list the  specific representations that management must make, which include, for  example, management\u2019s responsibility for providing to the auditor all  financial records and related data and its responsibility for disclosing to  the auditors any known or suspected fraud. Such representations are  considered part of the evidence supporting the auditor\u2019s opinion and are  to be provided prior to issuing the examination report. Further, the DOD  Financial Management Regulation (FMR) requires responsible senior  managers to prepare and submit management representation letters to  auditors prior to the conclusion of audits and requires that the date of the  letter should generally be the issuance date of the audit report. The  DOD FMR further states that coordinating these dates is essential and  that active cooperation and interaction between auditors and  management is expected so that the management representation letter  reaches the auditors in a timely manner.", "However, according to Navy officials, the Navy does not have a policy to  ensure that these requirements are met. Rather, it relied on its standard  process for the review and approval for official correspondence, which  requires a minimum of 21 days to complete. In addition, the lack of  effective coordination concerning the date of this letter contributed  significantly to the amount of time required to provide the IPA with  acceptable management representations. Specifically, although the IPA  provided a properly dated draft management representation letter (to  coincide with the end of its fieldwork on September 26, 2014), the Navy  incorrectly dated its letter November 19, 2014. After noting this  discrepancy, the IPA requested that the Navy revise the date on the letter  to September 26, 2014, as originally indicated on the draft letter provided  to the Navy. As shown in figure 3, this resulted in another delay, and a  total of over 3 months elapsed before the Navy provided an accurate,  signed management representation letter to the IPA.", "Without a policy that addresses the need to effectively coordinate with  auditors concerning the dates of management representation letters and  when they need to be provided to the auditors, the Navy remains at risk  that appropriate management representations required for future audits  may not be provided in a timely manner.

Specifically, the Navy  did not effectively coordinate with the IPA to identify sample leave and  earning statements requiring classified documentation support within a  time frame needed for the DOD OIG and the IPA to coordinate  appropriate security procedures to access and assess the documentation  at affected classified environments prior to the IPA\u2019s cutoff date for  testing.", "Navy officials acknowledged that challenges affecting the Navy\u2019s ability to  obtain and assess such documentation could be a significant roadblock in  future audits. To address this issue, the Navy developed a corrective  action plan to establish an effective process for addressing audit  coordination of classified documentation and is working to develop new  procedures requiring budget submitting offices to coordinate with the  DOD OIG and the IPA to determine appropriate security procedures for  accessing and obtaining required documentation supporting military pay  transactions selected for testing."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Complementary Controls", "paragraphs": ["DFAS processes military pay for the Navy and other DOD reporting  entities and has established control objectives and control activities to  provide reasonable assurance on the effectiveness of its military pay  operations.

DOD\u2019s FIAR Guidance requires that  user entities coordinate with service providers, such as DFAS, to  understand service provider user control assumptions and test those  controls to ensure that they are operating effectively.", "The Navy linked many of the complementary controls identified by DFAS  to relevant Navy control activities; however, it determined that it was not  responsible for the effectiveness of certain complementary controls for  approving and monitoring Navy personnel access to the Defense Joint  Military Pay System (DJMS) because DFAS subsequently approves and  grants DJMS access and Navy personnel have \u201cview only\u201d access.  Although Navy personnel access to DJMS may be limited, \u201cview only\u201d  access enables users to see and produce documentation from DJMS  containing certain personally identifiable information associated with Navy  servicemembers. According to Navy officials, in making its determination,  the Navy had not considered how such access increases the risk of  unauthorized disclosure of such information or could potentially lead to its  use for unintended purposes. We shared these concerns with Navy  officials, and they agreed that additional efforts were needed to further  assess these risks and the need for complementary controls to address  them. They also indicated that considerations of these controls will be  incorporated into their strategy to work with relevant Navy and DFAS  stakeholders to assess the controls and develop and implement  corrective action plans to address any identified deficiencies.

Although the Navy has taken steps to improve  military pay auditability, the extent to which it has effectively addressed  deficiencies associated with key controls and selected financial systems  identified through its assertion and validation efforts, including the IPA  examination, remains unclear. Without effective internal controls and  systems, auditors will likely be required to perform additional, more costly  procedures to obtain required assurance in future financial statement  audits, and the Navy\u2019s ability to consistently produce timely, reliable  financial information will remain at risk. In addition, the Navy\u2019s effective  coordination with the IPA, the DOD OIG, and service providers is  essential for achieving audit readiness. However, the Navy did not  effectively coordinate certain important tasks\u2014such as providing its  management representation letter to the IPA in a timely manner and  assessing and implementing certain complementary controls identified by  DFAS\u2014that could hamper its ability to meet this goal. An audit of the  Navy\u2019s fiscal year 2015 Schedule of Budgetary Activity, for which military  pay activity represents a significant portion of obligations and outlays, is  currently under way and is expected to provide feedback on efforts  necessary to achieve DOD\u2019s goal of financial statement auditability  department-wide by September 30, 2017.

We also analyzed IPA and Navy documentation supporting  the Navy\u2019s schedule of military pay activity for April 2013, including  reconciliations of reported amounts to relevant documentation produced  by payroll, personnel, and disbursement systems and results of IPA  procedures, to assess the sufficiency of evidence the Navy provided the  IPA to support a complete and valid population of military payroll  transactions to support its schedule of military pay activity for April 2013.  In addition, we recalculated the reconciliations, traced selected amounts  to supporting documentation, and assessed the appropriateness of  selected reconciling items.", "In addition, we reviewed the IPA\u2019s plan, testing, projections, and  conclusions for whether the Navy provided sufficient documentation to  support the accuracy of transactions reflected in its schedule of military  pay activity for April 2013.

We randomly  selected a 5 percent nongeneralizable sample of 21 leave and earnings  statements from the IPA\u2019s sample of 405 and re-performed the IPA  procedures to assess the reliability of its work. We examined Navy  documentation supporting pay and entitlement transactions included on  the 21 leave and earning statements sample items we tested and re- performed the pay and entitlement calculations. We also re-performed the  IPA\u2019s error projection calculations. We used the Department of Defense  (DOD) Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness guidance to assess  whether documentation supporting pay and entitlement transactions met  established requirements. We also interviewed IPA officials to understand  test case results.
