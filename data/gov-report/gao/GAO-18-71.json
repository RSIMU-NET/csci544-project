Ensuring sufficient spectrum to support commercial demand is one way FCC pursues its strategic goal of promoting economic growth. FCC has made additional spectrum publicly available at least four times since 2015 by repurposing over 11 gigahertz of spectrum. However, FCC does not track the growth of IoT devices in two areas that pose the greatest risk to IoT\u2019s growth\u2014high bandwidth and unlicensed-spectrum devices. In 2014, FCC\u2019s Technical Advisory Council (TAC) recommended that FCC monitor high-bandwidth IoT devices and make sufficient unlicensed spectrum available. FCC officials said that FCC monitors spectrum use broadly and makes spectrum available as needed. However, since the process of reallocating spectrum is lengthy, FCC may not have adequate time to take actions to avoid a shortage, possibly hindering IoT\u2019s growth and associated economic growth.", "Spectrum planners in four leading countries\u2014France, Germany, the Netherlands, and South Korea\u2014have taken steps similar to those taken by the United States in preparation for IoT\u2019s expansion, including taking a technology-neutral approach that stakeholders believe encourages innovation. Unlike the United States, officials from two leading countries said they are concerned about spectrum congestion from the growth of IoT devices, but only one is actively monitoring congestion.

These  connected devices are integrated into the daily activities of consumers,  businesses, and government. For example, wearable IoT devices enable  users to track information about their health and fitness activities. In  agriculture, IoT technology can analyze soil quality and harvest yield to  automatically deposit seed in fertile parts of a field. Further, some cities  now use connected traffic sensors to monitor traffic flow and air quality.  These devices may connect to networks through a wired connection, but  the trend in new technology is increasingly to connect wirelessly.  Connected wireless devices use radio frequency spectrum (spectrum) to  communicate. Wireless communications allow devices to remain  connected while mobile but also allow connected devices in locations  where a wire may not be possible. While specific estimates vary, wireless  IoT devices are expected to grow exponentially and this means many  more devices using spectrum. Some experts forecast 25\u201350 billion  devices will be competing for spectrum by 2025. Continued growth in the  number of connected devices could require more spectrum be made  available or more efficient ways of using available spectrum, more  spectrum sharing, or a combination of all three.", "The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA)  within the Department of Commerce and the Federal Communications  Commission (FCC) are responsible for managing spectrum within the  United States. FCC manages spectrum used for consumer, commercial,  and state and local public safety purposes, and NTIA oversees spectrum  used by the federal government. Both are responsible for planning ways  to meet increasing demands for spectrum created by IoT and other  wireless devices. You asked us to examine the challenges facing federal  spectrum managers and the steps they are taking to address those  challenges. In this report we discuss: (1) the spectrum-related challenges  selected stakeholders identified due to the anticipated growth of IoT, (2)  steps the federal government is taking to plan for the anticipated growth  in the demand for spectrum as a result of IoT, and (3) efforts that selected  leading countries are undertaking to plan for IoT\u2019s spectrum needs and  ways that these efforts compare with those of the United States.", "To identify the spectrum-related challenges stemming from the expected  growth of IoT, we conducted interviews and reviewed relevant hearings,  reports and literature. We identified relevant stakeholders (1) by  reviewing comments submitted to NTIA in response to its request for  comment on the government\u2019s role in planning for IoT growth, (2) by  reviewing records of three congressional hearings related to IoT growth,  and (3) by conducting a review of literature on topics that encompassed  academic articles, government reports, and trade journals. We conducted  24 telephone, and in-person interviews with stakeholders, including  industrial and commercial users of IoT, nonprofit groups, subject matter  experts, manufacturers, and telecommunications companies and FCC  and NTIA regarding the spectrum-related challenges presented by the  anticipated growth in IoT. The views of these stakeholders are not  generalizable to those of all IoT stakeholders in the United States;  however, we believe that these interviews provide a balanced and  informed perspective on the topics discussed. We then analyzed the  results of these interviews and related documents to identify the main  themes and develop summary findings. To characterize the views  captured during the interviews, we defined the terminology used to  quantify the views as follows:  \u201cmost\u201d users represents 18 to 24 users,  \u201ca majority of\u201d users represents 11 to 17 users,  \u201cseveral\u201d users represents 6 to 10 users, and  \u201csome\u201d users represents 3 to 5 users.\u201d", "Further, we reviewed the previously mentioned hearings, reports, and  journals for additional insight on the spectrum challenges related to IoT  and to understand the projected growth of IoT devices. We also reviewed  literature concerning the growth of wireless devices, such as smart  phones, to determine if there are any lessons learned from the demand  these devices placed on spectrum that could be applied to the expected  growth of IoT. To identify the steps FCC and NTIA are taking to plan for  the anticipated growth in the demand for spectrum as a result of IoT, we  interviewed FCC and NTIA officials and reviewed relevant agency  documents including reports and plans. We compared FCC\u2019s and NTIA\u2019s  efforts against their strategic goals and federal internal control standards  for identifying, analyzing, and responding to risks to achieving agency  objectives.", "To identify the efforts that selected leading countries are undertaking to  plan for IoT\u2019s spectrum needs and ways that these efforts compare with  those of the United States, we identified leading countries by reviewing  trade journals, industry publications, foreign governments\u2019 websites and  publications, and asking the stakeholders identified above. Through this  process, we identified seven countries of potential interest, all of which  have conducted spectrum planning in support of IoT: China, France,  Germany, Netherlands, Japan, Singapore, and South Korea. We selected  four of these countries\u2014France, Germany, the Netherlands, and South  Korea\u2014as having similarities to the United States and being leaders in  IoT development, based on additional criteria including the level of their  economic development, the maturity of their telecommunications  infrastructures, and the comparability of their governments to the United  States and the accessibility of their spectrum planning information. We  reviewed documents and conducted telephone and written interviews with  officials from the spectrum management agencies in each of these four  countries. We also conducted eight telephone and written interviews with  officials from telecommunications companies in these four countries, with  IoT manufacturers, and with officials from international spectrum planning  groups to gather information about IoT development, challenges, and  responses to these challenges in the leading countries that we contacted.

Businesses and consumers use  spectrum for a variety of wireless services including mobile voice and  data, WiFi- and Bluetooth-enabled devices, broadcast television, radio,  and satellite services. Federal, state, and local governments\u2019 uses of  spectrum include national defense, law enforcement communication, air- traffic control, weather services, military radar, and first responder  communications. IoT applications that rely on spectrum are highly diverse  and include connected vehicles, devices in the home, and personal  mobile devices. IoT devices communicate using wireless networks,  including wide area networks that use cellular networks to cover large  areas (e.g., cellular transmission), local area networks that cover about  100 meters (e.g., Wi-Fi within a house), and personal networks covering  about 10 meters (e.g., Bluetooth inside a room) (see fig. 1).", "Each of these wireless devices, like other wireless IoT devices,  communicates using spectrum, and the number of connected devices is  expected to increase. In 2013, the number of devices connected to the  internet globally was estimated to be over 9 billion. In 2015, the  Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)  estimated that a family of four had an average of 10 devices connected to  the Internet in their household, and that this average will increase to 50  devices by 2022. As companies bring new IoT technologies and services  to market and government users develop new mission needs, the  demand for spectrum will increase.", "The frequencies, or frequency bands, of spectrum have different  characteristics that make them more or less suitable for specific  purposes, depending on the specific band (see fig. 2). These bands have  different levels of ability to penetrate physical obstacles and cover  distances, known as \u201cpropagation,\u201d and different limits to the amount of  information that they can carry, known as data capacity, and are used for  different communication purposes. Low frequency bands are  characterized by strong propagation, and are used by numerous IoT  devices, some of which may only transmit small amounts of information  such as temperature, location, or activity status. The strong propagation  of low bands means they can transmit over long distances. Mid-band  frequencies have higher data capacity than low bands (because, in part,  frequency allocations in higher bands are larger, allowing wider  channels), as well as, stronger propagation qualities than higher bands.  The bands above 30 GHz have high data capacity but relatively poor  propagation, to the point that bands at the highest frequencies can be  easily obstructed. This spectrum is currently used by a variety of services,  including satellite, fixed microwave, and radio astronomy, and is expected  to be important for the next generation wireless technology (5G).", "FCC is the federal agency responsible for allocating spectrum for various  consumer and commercial purposes, assigning spectrum licenses, and  making spectrum available for use by unlicensed devices. Licensing  assigns frequencies of spectrum, in a specific area, to a specific entity,  such as a telecommunications company that operates a network using  licensed spectrum. We refer to these bands as licensed spectrum. In  some frequency bands, FCC authorizes unlicensed use of spectrum  bands\u2014generally referred to as unlicensed spectrum\u2014that is, users do  not need to obtain a license to use spectrum. Rather, users of unlicensed  devices can share frequencies on a non-interference basis, such as with  home wireless networks, cordless phones, and garage door openers. In  addition, FCC supports federal emergency-communications activities.", "NTIA is responsible for establishing policy on regulating federal spectrum  use, assigning spectrum bands to government agencies, and maintaining  spectrum use databases. Additionally, like FCC, NTIA participates in  federal emergency communications activities. NTIA also determines what  spectrum bands reserved for the federal government can be made  available for commercial use.", "In managing spectrum, one factor that FCC and NTIA consider is the  potential for interference. Harmful interference occurs when two  communication signals are either at the same frequencies or close to the  same frequencies in the same vicinity, a situation that may lead to  degradation of a device\u2019s operation or service. Co-channel interference  occurs when two communications systems operate on the same  frequency assignment in the same vicinity. Adjacent band interference  occurs between two communication systems operating on different, but  adjacent frequencies in the same geographic area. Another source of  interference can be signals on adjacent spectrum bands leaking into  another band.", "FCC and NTIA work to make more efficient use of spectrum that has  been assigned. One means of more efficiently using spectrum is to share  it, between and among both federal users and commercial users. In 2017,  FCC and NTIA continued oversight of the development of a new- spectrum sharing mechanism called the Spectrum Access System (SAS)  in the 3.5 GHz band. Among other things, the SAS allows multiple users  access to the same band at different times or places. Within this spectrum  band the SAS establishes a three-tiered system of access priority, with  federal and non-federal incumbent users having first priority, new non- federal users who have paid for licensed access as second priority, and  other users as third priority. This system relies on the SAS to assign  frequencies by determining if a frequency is in use by a higher priority  user before assigning it to a lower priority user."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Selected Stakeholders Identified Spectrum Availability and Managing Interference as Challenges Affecting IoT Devices", "paragraphs": ["Stakeholders representing IoT network providers, device manufacturers,  users, and federal regulators consistently identified two spectrum-related  challenges to the continued growth and development of IoT 1) ensuring  the availability of sufficient spectrum and 2) managing the harmful  interference from the increasing number of IoT devices."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Spectrum Availability", "paragraphs": ["While not currently a crisis, the stakeholders we spoke to agreed that  ensuring the availability of sufficient amounts and the right kinds of  spectrum is a key challenge for supporting the growth of IoT. Specifically,  stakeholders cited three dimensions of the spectrum availability  challenge: the amount, the balance between licensed and unlicensed,  and the variety of spectrum bands available. According to some reports,  incorrectly anticipating industry needs in any of these areas could weaken  IoT growth and development in the United States.", "Amount of spectrum: The amount of spectrum needed for IoT devices is  expected to increase with their growth. According to a majority of  stakeholders we interviewed, FCC will need to continue to make  additional spectrum commercially available in order to meet the demand  from expected rapid growth in wireless devices, including IoT devices.  FCC officials told us the current amount of available spectrum will be  sufficient for the growth of IoT unless devices that use a disproportionally  large amount of spectrum become more prevalent. Such devices, like  those that stream video, could lead to a spectrum shortage that  negatively impacts IoT growth. According to several stakeholders  spectrum availability will become an issue as use of these devices  increases. FCC officials said that cellular providers experienced similar  issues when they introduced smart phones, spurring rapid, exponential  growth in consumer demand to send and receive wireless data. Despite  the potential for a shortage of spectrum for IoT devices, most of the  stakeholders agreed that there should not be specific spectrum set aside  for IoT devices; rather, some noted spectrum policies should remain  flexible, allowing licensees to determine the best use.", "Licensed and unlicensed spectrum: A majority of stakeholders said that  the spectrum availability challenge includes making both licensed and  unlicensed spectrum available. According to FCC staff, FCC is  responsible for ensuring sufficient spectrum exists for commercial  purposes and will continue to identify new spectrum that can be used for  a variety of uses, including by IoT and other wireless devices. This  identification of new spectrum includes making spectrum available on  both a licensed and unlicensed basis to meet the needs of IoT and other  wireless devices. For example, some devices may need to send a signal  over a long distance and with a high quality of service to ensure a signal  will go through, such as a fire alarm, something licensed spectrum can  provide. However, for other devices, cost is a more important  consideration. Licensed spectrum has costs that can come from  purchasing the license or accessing the spectrum. For example, an  official from a supply-chain automation company that develops radio- frequency identification tags told us the lack of inexpensive, low power  networks that provide broad coverage is a challenge for their business.  With such a network, the company\u2019s tags could send out small amounts  of data at intervals to help manufacturers track their goods. However, the  cost of such a service is important if these tags are to attach to all size  packages because paying for GPS or a wireless connections for each  would make it unfeasible. According to several stakeholders, the correct  balance between licensed and unlicensed spectrum is difficult to know.", "Spectrum bands: Several stakeholders indicated that the need to make  various spectrum bands available for IoT devices contributes to the  spectrum management challenge. As previously described, each band of  spectrum has different characteristics, such as the ability to carry data  long distances and penetrate obstacles. IoT devices have diverse  spectrum needs, such as needing to send a signal over a distance or  send a constant stream of information. For example, in the package  delivery industry there could be IoT devices, sending signals over a  distance, that read the location of the vehicle and direct the driver on a  different route based on traffic and deliveries. In addition, there are IoT  devices that can monitor containers being delivered including their  location, temperature within the container, and other characteristics. In  both these examples, the devices can send signals over long distances to  systems that can monitor the information."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Spectrum Interference", "paragraphs": ["Some stakeholders and FCC staff also agreed that managing interference  caused by the increasing number of IoT devices will challenge the  continued growth of IoT. As previously stated, interference occurs when  signals in the same vicinity attempt to access the same spectrum bands  or bands close to each other, causing the signals to degrade. This can  lead to intermittent access, poor reception, or no reception. As the  number of wireless IoT devices grows, the chances of harmful  interference increases. The number of IoT devices is predicted to grow so  fast the instances of harmful interference could be difficult to track.  Furthermore, according to one stakeholder, with devices being made by  more manufacturers, not all devices are created of equal quality,  potentially further increasing the chance that such devices will cause  interference. A recently issued GAO report found that according to FCC  staff, the expansion in wireless services and devices, not just IoT, has  contributed to interference becoming more of a challenge for FCC. FCC  staff agreed that managing interference is becoming more challenging as  the number of wireless IoT devices grows. However, according to FCC  staff, relatively few complaints pertaining to licensed services involve  devices that are compliant with FCC regulations and operating properly.", "Managing interference may be particularly difficult in homes where many  devices rely on unlicensed spectrum. The FCC Technical Advisory  Council\u2019s (TAC) report from 2014, expressed concerns that the rapid  growth of IoT could exacerbate interference issues in the home.  Particularly, the growing reliance on unlicensed spectrum for many  consumer IoT devices has contributed to this concern. For example,  many IoT devices using unlicensed spectrum, such as digital assistants  or wireless speaker systems, use Wi-Fi, Bluetooth or similar technology to  transmit a short distance to a smart phone or Wi-Fi router. Not all agree  however, that this use is an issue. One spectrum expert we interviewed  for a recently-issued report said that interference among consumer  devices is less likely to be an issue because they only transmit for short  durations and over short distances. If the devices only transmit a short  distance then many devices can transmit on the same spectrum.  Similarly, if devices only transmit for short durations then they can take  turns transmitting over the same spectrum."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The Federal Government Has Plans to Meet Spectrum Needs but Does Not Track IoT Devices That Could Cause Congestion", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "FCC Spectrum Planning", "paragraphs": ["To plan for spectrum needs, FCC has repurposed spectrum by making  additional spectrum available for commercial purposes and, according to  FCC officials, the agency is continuing to look for additional opportunities  to do so.

This particular rulemaking from FCC opened up a total of  10.85 GHz of spectrum, 3.85 GHz for licensed mobile use and 7 GHz for  unlicensed use. According to FCC, this order follows a technology  neutral approach to planning by allowing spectrum users to develop  technologies for the spectrum and not have FCC dictate its specific use.  Advances in technology that now allow use of spectrum above 24 GHz for  high-speed mobile services led the FCC to initiate the proceeding  resulting in this order. Previously, this spectrum was best suited for  various satellite or fixed microwave applications.

In 2017, the FCC issued a Notice of Inquiry  seeking input on potential opportunities for additional flexibility,  particularly for wireless broadband services, in spectrum bands between  3.7 and 24 GHz. However, according to FCC staff, the process of  identifying and freeing up new spectrum can take a significant amount of  time as FCC must complete a rulemaking and either relocate existing  users or define sharing arrangements between the existing users and  new users. FCC has also proposed sharing mechanisms it hopes will  allow some bands to be used by existing users as well as additional uses  in the future. Other efforts to make additional spectrum commercially  available have included examining the potential for sharing the 5.9 GHz  band that FCC designated for transportation safety. This band was  allocated over 15 years ago and designated exclusively for safety  communication between vehicles and between vehicles and  infrastructure. In recent years, FCC has worked with the automobile  industry and Department of Transportation to assess whether all or a  portion of that spectrum could be shared. FCC is also monitoring  development of specifications to support 5G\u2014the next generation of  wireless networks. According to FCC, the 5G technologies that providers  develop are projected to bring wireless networks lower latency, better  coverage, faster Internet connections, and allow for more connections  than the existing cellular network, all of which may enable more IoT  devices to be connected.

For  example, all the commercial, industrial, and personal devices that  connect using WiFi and Bluetooth networks use unlicensed spectrum.  In 2014, the TAC indicated that the majority of wireless IoT devices  will rely on unlicensed spectrum and recommended FCC make  sufficient unlicensed spectrum available for devices operating on local  and personal area networks, like WiFi and Bluetooth. However, FCC  may not have enough information to determine when the amount of  unlicensed spectrum is sufficient. While network providers can  manage the number of devices on their own licensed networks, this  approach does not work for devices that use unlicensed spectrum,  and FCC does not track unlicensed spectrum utilization. It does not  track use of unlicensed spectrum because congestion of unlicensed  spectrum is geographically and technically challenging to track.  Specifically, it is geographically challenging because network  congestion and demand can vary over very short distances and  technically challenging because there are so many bands of spectrum  that would have to be tracked at one time and unlicensed spectrum  typically propagates over relatively short distances.

These LPWANs use the 800 and 900 MHz bands to  transmit data from wireless IoT devices such as sensors and location  trackers. Signals in these bands can be transmitted over long distances  and can penetrate obstacles. According to one LPWAN provider, the  distance served by a LPWAN site is greater than a single cellular network  site. However, according to the same LPWAN operator, the bands used  for LPWAN networks have limited data capacity compared to those used  by cellular networks. According to officials and telecommunications  industry stakeholders in these countries, LPWANs offer several potential  benefits including low barriers to entry, low costs, and broad coverage.", "According to a Dutch telecommunications industry stakeholder most  devices that use LPWANs transmit only small amounts of data. A  telecommunications industry stakeholder in France told us that the long  range and strong propagation of these LPWANs make them useful for  utility metering data and South Korean official told us that LPWANs are  used to transmit location or temperature data. For example, in the  Netherlands, LPWANs are used to monitor water depth and quality,  manage street lighting, and to track the location of business inventory and  personal property. In France, LPWANs are used for similar tracking as  well as smoke detectors. Other uses for the LPWANs are currently in  development. For example, a representative of a Dutch  telecommunications company told us that in the Netherlands, IoT devices  operating on the nationwide LPWAN are being tested at an airport for use  in logistical processes such as baggage handling. Additionally, a Dutch  railway station is experimenting with IoT technology that monitors rail  switches using the LPWAN, and depth sounders at the port of Rotterdam  have been fitted with devices to connect them to the network. South  Korean officials said that the LPWAN in their country also provides  specialized location-tracking services."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Selected Leading Countries Face International Coordination and Potential Spectrum Congestion Challenges", "paragraphs": ["Selected leading countries take many similar approaches to each other  and the United States to managing spectrum in order to address related  challenges (see table 4). Like the United States, spectrum-planning  officials in France, Germany, and the Netherlands told us that it was  necessary to coordinate spectrum planning with other countries on their  borders. Officials in each of these countries told us that European  spectrum planning is complicated by the number of countries that share  borders. Germany, for example, borders nine other countries. As each  country is responsible for its own spectrum planning, if their plans are not  closely coordinated, there is a potential for cross-border interference. This  coordination is complicated by the fact that European countries have  legacy spectrum allocations, and these must be accommodated in  spectrum planning. The United States, by contrast, shares its border with  only Mexico and Canada. According to FCC officials, both of these  countries generally align their spectrum plans to those of the United  States, reducing interference issues.", "In order to facilitate international coordination of spectrum planning, each  of the four selected leading countries, like the United States, belongs to a  regional spectrum-planning association that works to harmonize spectrum  planning among member states. Officials of regional groups we spoke  with told us that harmonizing can reduce interference issues across  borders and facilitate interoperability of devices across different countries.  Officials from the manufacturing and telecommunications industries told  us that this interoperability creates a larger potential market for IoT  devices, thereby improving the economies of scale for the manufacture of  IoT devices and reducing production costs. Regional planning  associations are also taking steps to prepare their member countries for  the spectrum needs of IoT. For example, an official of one association,  the Inter-American Telecommunication Commission, told us that in 2016  it held a workshop on \u201cmachine-to-machine\u201d technologies that brought  together spectrum planners and stakeholders from IoT-related  industries. Regional-planning associations also represent their member  countries at World Radiocommunications Conferences (WRC). An  official from one association told us that due to the diverse nature of IoT  devices and applications it is unnecessary for IoT to be explicitly  addressed as an agenda item at WRCs. However, the official further  stated that the spectrum needs of specific IoT applications\u2014 including  low power sensors, robotics, and connected vehicles\u2014are included on  the agenda. For example, the next WRC is scheduled for 2019 and  includes an agenda item addressing connected vehicles, which are  closely linked to IoT.", "Spectrum-planning officials in each of the selected leading countries told  us they are concerned about the potential for spectrum congestion, due to  growth in the number of IoT devices. However, like FCC in the United  States, these officials do not currently believe such congestion presents  an immediate problem. Representatives of the four countries we spoke  with told us that one way that they address the potential challenge of  spectrum congestion is through the use of spectrum-sharing  arrangements. Representatives from Germany specifically stressed the  importance of finding additional sharing arrangements in response to the  expected spectrum needs for IoT. In 2016, both France and the  Netherlands initiated pilot programs for spectrum sharing in which  multiple users\u2019 access the same bands while prioritizing use by the  licensee. These pilot programs are similar to the dynamic-sharing model  that FCC adopted in 2015, as described previously. However, whereas  the model adopted by FCC has three tiers of users, the model used by  France and the Netherlands has only two, and lacks the third tier of  general access users.", "Unlike the United States, officials from Germany and France told us that  they directly monitor spectrum congestion. For example, German officials  told us that there are spectrum-monitoring services at six locations  around the country, and that they perform mobile measurements of  spectrum congestion. FCC officials told us that their primary means of  tracking congestion is to communicate with spectrum licensees.  According to officials from the Netherlands, the Dutch spectrum  management agency takes a similar approach and has struck an  agreement with a group of telecommunications companies to share  information concerning IoT\u2019s interference and congestion issues. Officials  also told us that it is easier to monitor spectrum congestion in smaller  countries, as there is simply less geographical space to monitor.  Nevertheless, officials in France, Germany, and the Netherlands told us  that monitoring spectrum is a challenging task, as it is difficult to  determine how many wireless devices are active at any given time."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["FCC has a strategic goal to promote economic growth and effective  spectrum management represents a key way that FCC can support  meeting that goal. To that end, FCC officials said that the agency  continuously seeks to make additional spectrum available and broadly  tracks spectrum demand. However, stakeholders and FCC\u2019s own  technical advisors have identified rapid, unexpected growth in both high- bandwidth devices and unlicensed spectrum as risks to effective  spectrum management. By overwhelming existing networks before FCC  can make more spectrum available, rapid growth in spectrum demand  could slow or halt IoT\u2019s potential to facilitate economic growth. Absent  additional efforts to assess the risks to effective spectrum management  by focusing on high-bandwidth and unlicensed-spectrum devices,  spectrum congestion and interference could slow IoT growth."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["We are making the following two recommendations to the Chairman of  FCC.", "The Chairman of FCC should track the growth in high bandwidth IoT  devices, such as video-streaming devices and optical sensors.

FCC noted that it continues  to believe that the best approach to track growth of devices is by  monitoring overall traffic statistics and forecasts and how these devices  affect aggregate spectrum requirements for all applications and services.  However, FCC noted that it would task the Technological Advisory  Council (TAC) to periodically review the state of the IoT ecosystem to  ensure that the planned communications infrastructure is sufficient to  support the needs of the growing sector and advise on any actions the  FCC should take. We continue to believe that tracking the growth of high- bandwidth devices is necessary to avoid the potential spectrum shortage  and that the TAC may be able to help FCC accomplish that.", "FCC did not concur with our recommendation to track IoT devices that  rely on unlicensed spectrum. FCC noted that it may not be practical to  determine which devices qualify as IoT or quantify their effect on  spectrum utilization. As a result, FCC said that the best way to monitor  growth in unlicensed IoT devices is to continue to monitor published  papers and conferences and work with industry. However, since most of  the projected IoT growth is expected to occur in unlicensed bands that  are not protected from interference, we continue to believe that FCC  should place a greater focus on tracking IoT devices in these bands. For  example, the TAC may also be well positioned to help FCC track  unlicensed IoT devices.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.

In  this report we discuss: (1) the spectrum-related challenges stakeholders  identified due to the anticipated growth of IoT, (2) steps FCC and NTIA  are taking to plan for the anticipated growth in the demand for spectrum  as a result of IoT, and (3) efforts that selected leading countries are  undertaking to plan for IoT\u2019s spectrum needs and ways that these efforts  compare with those of the United States.", "To identify the spectrum-related challenges stemming from the expected  growth of IoT, we reviewed documents from the Federal Communications  Commission (FCC) and the National Telecommunications and  Information Administration (NTIA), the two federal agencies that have  direct authority over spectrum planning. Further, in order to identify  relevant literature for review, we (1) conducted a key word search of data  bases; (2) searched IoT and spectrum related websites, such as those of  cellular carriers, telecommunications industry groups, and nonprofit  organizations; (3) reviewed prior GAO reports on IoT and spectrum  issues; and (4) asked FCC and NTIA officials, researchers, and non-profit  organizations to identify relevant documents. Through our literature  search, we identified a number of documents, including academic reports,  government reports, congressional committee hearings, and trade  journals addressing the projected growth of IoT to understand the number  of devices that would be relying on the spectrum in the coming years. We  also reviewed literature concerning the growth of other wireless devices,  such as smart phones, and the burden they place on the spectrum, to  assess if there are any lessons learned from the demand these devices  placed on the spectrum that could be applied to the expected growth of  IoT.", "In addition, we interviewed FCC and NTIA officials, and conducted 24  telephone and in-person interviews with officials from industry  associations, industrial and commercial users of IoT, nonprofit groups,  subject matter experts, manufacturers, and telecommunications  companies to obtain their perspectives on the challenges presented by  the expected growth of IoT. The experiences of the stakeholders are not  generalizable to those of all IoT stakeholders in the United States;  however, we believe that the information we gathered from selected  stakeholders provides a balanced and informed perspective on the topics  discussed. We identified relevant stakeholders by reviewing comments  submitted to NTIA in response to its request for comment on the  government\u2019s role in planning for IoT growth, reviewing congressional  hearings, and conducting a literature review encompassing academic  articles, government reports, and trade journals. We interviewed officials  from businesses that manufacture Internet-connected devices or  equipment that would be considered part of IoT, including agriculture,  telecommunications, and manufacturing. We spoke with these officials to  gather information about the spectrum challenges they face as  businesses working with and developing IoT devices. We then analyzed  the results of these interviews and related documents to identify the main  themes and develop summary findings. To characterize the views  captured during the interviews, we defined the terms to quantify the views  as follows:  \u201cmost\u201d users represents 18 to 24 users,  \u201ca majority of\u201d users represents 11 to 17 users,  \u201cseveral\u201d users represents 6 to 10 users, and  \u201csome\u201d users represents 3 to 5 users.\u201d", "To identify the steps FCC and NTIA are taking to plan for the anticipated  growth in the demand for spectrum as a result of IoT, we interviewed FCC  and NTIA officials and reviewed agency reports and documents. We  interviewed officials to understand any agency plans to address spectrum  needs for IoT devices and how these plans aligned with the spectrum  planning for other wireless devices. We reviewed agency reports and  documents on spectrum planning, IoT planning, and the role of the  federal government in planning for IoT. Specifically, we reviewed  comments submitted in response to NTIA\u2019s request for comment and the  final report developed in response to the comments received on the role  of the federal government. To identify other relevant reports and literature  from FCC and NTIA, we asked officials at the meetings and conducted a  literature search. We also compared those planning efforts against FCC\u2019s  and NTIA\u2019s strategic goals and the federal internal control standards  related to risk management. Specifically, we compared FCC\u2019s planning  against its strategic goal to promote economic growth and national  leadership in telecommunications, and NTIA\u2019s efforts against its mission  to expand the use of spectrum by all users and to ensure that the Internet  remains an engine for continued innovation and economic growth. We  also assessed the efforts of both agencies against leading practices that  we previously developed for identifying, analyzing, and responding to  risks related to achieving agency objectives.", "To identify the efforts that selected foreign governments are taking to plan  for the expected spectrum needs of IoT and ways their efforts compare  with those of the United States, we surveyed trade journals, industry  publications, and foreign governments\u2019 websites and publications.  Through this survey, we identified seven countries of potential interest, all  of which have conducted spectrum planning in support of IoT: China,  France, Germany, Netherlands, Japan, Singapore, and South Korea. We  selected four of these countries\u2014France, Germany, the Netherlands, and  South Korea\u2014as being like the United States and leaders in IoT  development based on additional criteria including the level of their  economic development, the maturity of their telecommunications  infrastructures, the comparability of their governments to the United  States, and the accessibility of their spectrum-planning information. We  categorized a country\u2019s economy as fully developed if the United Nations  Statistics Division categorized it in 2016 as existing in a developed  economic region. When determining the maturity of a country\u2019s  telecommunications infrastructure, we followed the United Nation\u2019s  International Telecommunication Union (ITU) in categorizing a country\u2019s  telecom infrastructure as mature if it was included in the top quartile of the  175 countries ranked in ITU\u2019s 2016 Information and Communications  Technology Development Index.
