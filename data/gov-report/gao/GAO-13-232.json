Through this initiative, HRSA expanded its existing training programs by requiring grantees to include training specific to autism. It also established new autism research grants and funded new state grants to improve services for children with autism. HRSA awards its autism grants under the authority of the CAA. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) continued their autism activities--some of which were undertaken in response to the Children's Health Act of 2000--but did not create new programs as a direct result of the CAA. NIH continued to fund, expand, and coordinate autism research through its Autism Centers of Excellence and autism-specific grants and contracts. CDC continued to fund its regional centers of excellence for autism epidemiology and other activities, such as an awareness campaign. HHS's Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee (IACC)--reauthorized by the CAA--assumed additional responsibilities to coordinate autism efforts within HHS and restructured its membership to include more nonfederal members. NIH created the Office of Autism Research Coordination to coordinate and manage the IACC. The CAA did not appropriate funds to any HHS agency. Nevertheless, overall spending on HRSA, NIH, CDC, and IACC autism activities increased from approximately $143.6 million in fiscal year 2006 to approximately $240.4 million in fiscal year 2011.", "HRSA, the only HHS agency that has awarded grants specifically as a result of the CAA, regularly collects and reviews information from grantees to oversee individual CAA grantees and programs. HRSA awarded approximately $164 million in grants to 110 CAA grantees from fiscal years 2008 to 2011; though, some of these grantees were already receiving funds prior to the CAA. To oversee these grantees, HRSA requires they regularly submit progress reports and financial reports. The agency also requires grantees to obtain prior approval before making certain changes to their projects. GAO reviewed documentation for an unbiased random sample of 22 grantees, which were representative of the 110 CAA grantees. GAO found that CAA grantees submitted all required reports. Many grantees submitted prior-approval requests for changes to their projects. Most frequently, grantees requested to carry over unobligated funds from the current year to the next budget period. GAO found that HRSA staff routinely collected and reviewed information submitted by the grantees and appropriately documented their review and approval of these submissions. HRSA also conducted site visits and provided technical assistance as a means of overseeing grantees. HRSA conducted site visits with 9 of the grantees in our sample during the period of our review, while only 2 of these were required sites visits. Besides overseeing grantees, HRSA monitors its overall CAA programs by regularly collecting performance reports from grantees.

Generally, grantees submitted required  reports and HRSA staff documented their review of these reports.  Specifically, the 22 grantees in our unbiased random sample submitted  all of the 106 reports they were required to submit and most of these  reports were submitted on time.

First, it conducts site visits in  person or by means of the web. During a site visit, HRSA staff may collect  information on preliminary research findings, data and analysis, and any  challenges the grantee is facing. Site visits are only required of certain  research grantees, although HRSA may conduct site visits with other  grantees, depending on available resources. HRSA officials target site visits for CAA grantees on the basis of six criteria: (1) the grantee is new,  (2) there has been a change in the grantee\u2019s project director, (3) there  has been a change in the grantee\u2019s scope of work, (4) there are  budgetary issues or the grantee has not made adequate progress on the  project goals, (5) the grantee has requested technical assistance, or   (6) there has been a change in the project officer overseeing the grantee.  HRSA uses a site-visit report to document the visit and has guidance on  what should be included in the report. For example, for training grants,  the report should include a narrative summary of the visit including  highlights, performance measure progress, strengths and challenges, and  any technical assistance needed by the grantee. Second, HRSA officials  stated that HRSA project officers provide routine technical assistance to  certain grantees and others on an as-needed basis. For example, all  research grantees have either a monthly, biweekly, or mid-project  telephone call with HRSA project officers.", "Our review confirmed that HRSA has conducted a number of site visits to  monitor CAA grantees. For example, nine of the grantees in our review  had documentation indicating that a site visit had been conducted, with  only two of these being required site visits. While none of the site-visit  reports identified major issues that required corrective action, some did  record challenges the grantees were facing or made suggestions. For  example, one report stated that the grantee may encounter challenges in  the recruitment of trainees. We identified documentation related to  technical assistance that HRSA staff provided to some grantees but not  all. For example, we did not always see documentation of routine  telephone calls with research grantees that HRSA officials say occur on a  regular basis. In response, HRSA officials stated that not all technical  assistance is recorded in the EHB; only when a significant issue arises is  the telephone call, e-mail, or other assistance recorded.", "Besides overseeing specific grantees, HRSA monitors its CAA activities  at the program level by regularly collecting performance reports from  grantees. The 22 CAA grantees in our sample submitted all the required  performance reports. According to HRSA officials, the primary purpose of  performance reports is to gauge program performance. For example, data  in performance reports is currently being used by a HRSA contractor to  prepare a report on the progress of the CAA programs for Congress. In  addition, according to HRSA officials, performance data can be used to  modify program performance measures over time. While performance  reports are used to monitor CAA programs\u2014as opposed to grantees\u2014 HRSA officials stated that some performance information is also included  in annual progress reports, which are used to oversee specific grantees.  For example, progress reports require grantees to include information on  whether they are having problems meeting their performance measures.  Finally, to further help oversee CAA programs and consolidate  information on its monitoring approach for these programs, in December  2012 HRSA released a grant-management operations manual to outline  its overall approach for monitoring these programs.

According to officials within the National Institutes of  Health Office of Autism Research Coordination (OARC), the agencies and organizations  in these reports have been identified by the IACC and OARC as being involved in autism  research and have agreed to participate. According to the IACC, the intent of these  analysis reports is to better inform the IACC and interested stakeholders about the  funding landscape for a particular year. Additionally, the analysis examines the extent to  which a particular year\u2019s funding and research topics align with the IACC\u2019s most recent  Strategic Plan. The IACC reports that the Portfolio Analysis may also be used by federal  agencies and private research organizations to help guide future funding priorities by  outlining current gaps and opportunities in autism research, as well as serving to highlight  current activities and research progress.

The CAA requires that the IACC produce  the Summary of Advances annually.", "As reported by the IACC, this report describes several key aspects of worldwide autism  research publications, which may be used to inform planning and strategic funding  decisions for future autism research. Autism-related research articles published between  1980 and 2010 were analyzed to identify historical trends and publication outputs across  the seven questions and research areas of the 2011 IACC Strategic Plan. Information  found in research publications was also used to assess the institutions conducting autism  research, funding organizations supporting the research publications, and the extent of  collaboration between authors from different countries and research institutions.  Additionally, measures, such as citation counts, were used as an assessment of the  impact of the published research. OARC officials told us that there are no plans to update  this report annually.", "In 2008 and 2010, OARC, National Institute of Mental Health, prepared this report on behalf of the  IACC.
