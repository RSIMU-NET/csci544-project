Most taxpayers file their returns between January 1 and April 15, the deadline for filing individual income tax returns. However, a large number of taxpayers get extensions from IRS that allow them to delay filing their returns until as late as October 15.", "IRS provides various services in an effort to help taxpayers file correct returns. For example, taxpayers can (1) call IRS toll-free to get answers to tax law questions and order tax forms and publications; (2) get information or help in preparing their returns at IRS walk-in sites; (3) get their returns prepared at volunteer tax assistance sites sponsored by IRS; and get information, including answers to tax law questions, through IRS\u2019 Web site. \u201cdesigned to eliminate barriers, provide incentives, and use competitive market forces to make significant progress toward: (1) the overriding goal of 80 percent of all tax and information returns being filed electronically by the year 2007, and (2) the interim goal that, to the extent practicable, all returns prepared electronically should be filed electronically for taxable years beginning after 2001.\u201d", "The 80-percent goal cited in IRS\u2019 plan derives from a requirement in the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998.", "One benefit of electronic filing is that IRS can bypass its labor-intensive and error-prone paper processing system. For the 1999 filing season, IRS introduced a new processing system called the Integrated Submission and Remittance Processing System. The return and remittance processing systems that the new system replaced were old and could not be made year 2000 compliant.", "Several new tax credits and deductions took effect in tax year 1998 (the tax year for which returns are filed in 1999). Those new credits and deductions included a maximum $400 tax credit for each qualifying child, an additional child tax credit that was designed to benefit taxpayers with three or more children, and various education-related deductions and credits.", "One tax credit that has been around for several years is the EIC, which is a refundable tax credit established by Congress in 1975 to offset the impact of Social Security taxes and to encourage low-income workers to seek employment rather than welfare. Because of concerns about significant levels of noncompliance associated with the EIC, Congress, in fiscal year 1998, began appropriating funds to IRS that were specifically targeted at EIC noncompliance. With those funds, IRS has initiated various assistance and enforcement efforts focused on reducing that noncompliance. Also, in 1999, IRS implemented new procedures, as mandated by the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 (TRA97), that require certain taxpayers to document their eligibility for the EIC before IRS approves their claim."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Objective, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["Our objective was to assess IRS\u2019 performance during the 1999 filing season, with particular emphasis on several areas identified in the Subcommittee\u2019s request.

Those measures relate to timeliness, such as the number of days needed to process and issue refunds; quality, such as the accuracy of notices sent to taxpayers and answers to taxpayers\u2019 questions; and service accessibility, such as the extent to which taxpayers with tax-related questions were able to reach IRS by telephone.", "In 1999, according to IRS\u2019 own data, it met or exceeded its performance goals for five measures, came close to its goals for two measures, and fell short of its goals for two measures (i.e., quality of responses to tax law questions and level of access to the taxpayer service telephone system).As shown in table 2.1, there were four other measures for which IRS had no goal in 1999. IRS\u2019 accomplishment in one of those areas, that is, timeliness of refunds for paper returns, raised some questions that IRS did not have the necessary data to answer."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Many Taxpayers Received Inaccurate Responses to Their Tax Law Questions", "paragraphs": ["From 1989 to 1998, IRS measured the quality of assistance to taxpayers who called with tax law questions by making structured test calls to IRS assistors. This method was phased out after the 1998 filing season. During the 1998 filing season, besides making test calls, IRS also measured the quality of its tax law assistance by monitoring a sample of actual calls. In monitoring the calls, IRS assessed whether telephone assistors gave accurate responses and followed correct procedures when responding to taxpayers\u2019 questions. IRS used the results of that monitoring (an 83.2- percent accuracy rate) as a baseline for setting its 85-percent accuracy goal for the 1999 filing season. IRS also changed the name of this measure from \u201caccuracy of tax law assistance\u201d to \u201ctax law quality.\u201d", "Results of IRS\u2019 call monitoring during the 1999 filing season showed that IRS achieved an accuracy rate of 72.5 percent\u201412.5 percentage points below the goal and 10.7 percentage points below the achievement in 1998. IRS told us that one reason for the lower accuracy rate was the broader skill level each assistor needed in 1999. An IRS official explained that in 1998 an assistor may have needed expertise in only one or two topics. However, due to IRS\u2019 change in the equipment used to route telephone calls, as discussed later in this report, an assistor may have been required to answer questions on several more topics in 1999. The official told us that even though the assistors received training on the additional topics, they may not have used the training in several years or received complete training in all areas of a topic. Therefore, with the increase in the number of topics an assistor was responsible for and dated and/or limited training in the topics, the assistors were not always able to answer taxpayers\u2019 questions accurately.", "IRS also noted that, in some instances, the assistor may have provided a correct answer to a taxpayer\u2019s question, but the call was scored as incorrect because the assistor failed to follow correct procedures. For example, the assistor may have failed to provide his or her employee identification number or inform the taxpayer which form or schedule to use when filing the return. During the filing season, IRS did not capture the data needed to determine the extent to which calls were inaccurate because the assistor provided an incorrect response versus failed to follow prescribed procedures. As of the end of June 1999, IRS began gathering that kind of data. IRS said that it would use the data to help focus training for assistors, which it planned to provide before the 2000 filing season.", "We reviewed the method that IRS used to score the overall accuracy of its responses to tax law questions, that is, its decision to score the call as inaccurate if any part of the answer was incorrect.  This scoring method is one of several analytical approaches for measuring accuracy and is more conservative than most other options because it tends to produce a lower accuracy rate than might result if other scoring methods were used.", "We also reviewed IRS\u2019 sampling plan for assessing tax law quality and noted that IRS\u2019 results for the filing season were based on telephone calls monitored for 8 hours a day, Monday through Friday, even though IRS provided telephone service 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The effect on IRS\u2019 accuracy measure, had the measure been based on 24-hours-a-day, 7- days-a-week monitoring, would depend on the extent to which taxpayers called during the nonmonitored hours and the difference, if any, between the accuracy of assistors who answered calls during the monitored hours versus the accuracy of those who answered calls during the nonmonitored hours.", "As discussed later in this report, IRS could not readily provide data on the number of calls received during the nonmonitored hours, and several IRS officials expressed concern about the skill level of assistors who worked during nonmonitored hours. According to cognizant IRS officials, IRS limited its monitoring to 8 hours a day, Monday through Friday, during the 1999 filing season because it did not have enough adequately trained staff to do more monitoring. That situation improved after the filing season, and, in May 1999, IRS began monitoring calls Monday through Saturday, 16 hours a day. IRS plans to continue that schedule during the 2000 filing season.", "We also noted the following regarding IRS\u2019 sampling plan:", "The sampling plan includes a sample of the hours during which calls were monitored and then a sample of telephone calls on various subject matters within those hours. While the sample of hours is essentially random, the sample of telephone calls is a cluster sample within those hours. The effect of a cluster sample could impact the precision estimates by understating them, meaning that IRS\u2019 estimates could be less precise. After discussions with responsible IRS officials, they agreed to examine the effect of cluster sampling on the precision of IRS estimates.", "The sampling plan called for monitoring about 4,300 calls during the filing season; however, IRS monitored 2,960 calls\u201431 percent less than the plan. The planned sample size was based on assumptions about the number of incoming telephone calls per hour and estimates of the number of work hours available to monitor calls. IRS did not monitor as many calls as it had planned. There is concern that the use of assumptions and estimates that are not achieved may weaken the precision of the question the monitoring was intended to answer\u2014how accurate are the responses to taxpayers\u2019 questions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Taxpayers\u2019 Ability to Access IRS\u2019 Telephone System Declined", "paragraphs": ["Each year, millions of taxpayers call IRS to ask questions about the tax law, inquire about their refunds, resolve account-related issues, and order forms. To assess how well it is serving these taxpayers, IRS measures the \u201clevel of access\u201d and \u201clevel of service\u201d provided by its telephone system.", "Level of access indicates the extent to which taxpayers are able to access IRS\u2019 system (i.e., not get a busy signal). However, it does not take into account the extent to which taxpayers get into IRS\u2019 system but are put on hold and abandon their calls before an assistor comes on the line. In effect, level of access considers abandoned calls as successful call attempts. Level of service, on the other hand, considers abandoned calls as unsuccessful call attempts and, thus, measures the extent to which taxpayers are successful in reaching an assistor.", "As noted in its budget request for fiscal year 2000, IRS has identified level of access as one of its Servicewide performance measures. As we discussed in our testimony on that budget request, we believe that level of service would be the more appropriate Servicewide measure because it indicates the extent to which taxpayers were successful in actually talking to someone in IRS. The Department of the Treasury and IRS have recently expressed agreement with that position.", "During the 1999 filing season, IRS reported its level of access at 69 percent and its level of service at 55 percent. These accomplishments were well below the 91-percent level of access and the 74-percent level of service IRS reported for the 1998 filing season.

IRS takes separate samples of returns filed on paper and returns filed electronically.", "In the past, IRS measured its timeliness in terms of the average number of days it took taxpayers to receive a refund. In 1998, for example, it determined that filers of paper returns received their refunds within an average of 34.1 days while filers of electronic returns received their refunds within an average of 15.1 days. In 1999, IRS used the same sampling methodology but changed the way it measured timeliness. Instead of computing average refund time, IRS computed the percentage of refunds processed within a certain time frame\u201440 days or less for paper returns and less than 21 days for electronic returns. We agree with this change in methodology. Showing a percentage of refunds that met IRS\u2019 timeliness goal seems more informative than just showing the average number of days it took for taxpayers to receive a refund.", "As of the end of April 1999, IRS\u2019 refund test results showed that 84.7 percent of the refunds for individual income tax returns filed on paper had been processed within 40 days, and that 99.6 percent of the refunds for returns filed electronically had been processed in less than 21 days. The result for electronic returns exceeded IRS\u2019 goal for 1999 (98 percent) and IRS\u2019 performance in 1998 (98.3 percent). IRS did not set a goal for paper returns. However, IRS\u2019 reported accomplishment in 1999 (84.7 percent) was below its reported accomplishment in 1998 (88.1 percent).", "Although IRS\u2019 accomplishment in 1999 was close to its accomplishment in 1998, about 15 percent of the taxpayers who had filed paper returns and had claimed a refund did not receive those refunds within 40 days. IRS could not tell us how many days beyond 40 these taxpayers had to wait before receiving their refunds, so the significance of IRS\u2019 untimeliness is unclear. Some of the untimeliness may be due to delays caused by taxpayers. For example, one official told us that some of the delays were because taxpayers who were entitled to the new child tax credit did not claim it. As discussed later in this report, IRS corrected those returns to include the credit, thus adding to its processing time and increasing the amount of the refund.", "Because the samples for IRS\u2019 refund timeliness measure included returns with errors, such as math errors and errors associated with the child tax credit, we asked IRS what its sample results showed for returns that were error free. We wanted to compare those results to IRS\u2019 customer service standard, which promises a refund within 6 weeks if a taxpayer files a complete and accurate return.

We saw evidence of (1) assumptions and decisions that appeared to be based on inadequate data or that seemed to ignore existing data, (2) a failure to appropriately time the training of assistors and coordinate the timing of union negotiations that would directly affect productivity and the development of work schedules, (3) inadequate testing and contingency planning with respect to new call routing technology, and (4) the absence of data that management would need to adequately assess what happened in 1999 and provide a basis for making appropriate changes for the 2000 filing season."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "IRS Made Several Changes in an Attempt to Improve Telephone Service in 1999", "paragraphs": ["In an effort to improve its telephone service in 1999, IRS, among other things, extended its hours of operation and began managing its telephone operations centrally, which included implementation of new call routing technology."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Extended Hours of Operation", "paragraphs": ["In 1998, IRS\u2019 customer service representatives were available 16 hours a day, 6 days a week (7 a.m. to 11 p.m., Monday through Saturday), to answer questions from taxpayers about the tax law, their accounts, or their refunds. For the 1999 filing season, IRS expanded that service to 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. IRS officials said that they believed that around-the- clock service would level the demand for service. For example, there has traditionally been heavier demand for telephone service on Mondays. IRS officials speculated that many taxpayers worked on their tax returns during the weekends and tended to call at the first opportunity for assistance on Monday. IRS hoped to reduce such peak demand times and distribute demand more evenly by making assistance available at any time.", "Although IRS\u2019 customer service representatives were available all night and on weekends, it is uncertain to what extent they were able to assist taxpayers who called during those times. For example, some taxpayers who called to resolve account issues during the night and on weekends did not receive the assistance they needed because normal maintenance requirements caused IRS\u2019 main taxpayer data computer system, known as the Integrated Data Retrieval System (IDRS), to be unavailable, mainly in the early morning hours on weekdays, 8 hours on Saturdays, and all day on Sundays.", "IRS offered around-the-clock service for account-related issues in 1999 even though it knew that IDRS would not always be available. IRS believed that assistors would be able to serve many taxpayers who called during IDRS downtime by accessing another information system that, according to IRS, was available virtually anytime. However, that other system was insufficient in many cases. According to IRS\u2019 review of a sample of telephone calls to selected service centers on four Sundays during the filing season, 20 percent of the taxpayers were told to call back during the week when IDRS would be available."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Central Management and Call Routing", "paragraphs": ["In 1999, IRS began managing its telephone operations centrally through its Customer Service Operations Center in Atlanta.

The router was intended to lessen disparities in the level of service taxpayers receive by sending each call to the first available assistor nationwide who had the necessary skills to answer the taxpayer\u2019s question. To do this the router was to do use real-time information about (1) the nature of each taxpayer\u2019s question and (2) the availability of qualified telephone assistors nationwide.

However, according to IRS officials and data, productivity actually decreased in 1999 as compared to 1998.", "IRS officials cited several factors that might have led to lower-than- expected productivity, including the following:", "To staff its around-the-clock service, IRS offered experienced seasonal employees permanent positions if they agreed to work the off-hours.According to some officials, the movement of these productive, skilled seasonal employees left a gap during the core hours when most taxpayers seek assistance\u2014from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. IRS filled the core hours with newly hired, less skilled seasonal employees. Other officials said that there was a skill gap during the off-hours, especially during the overnight shift. However, IRS only had to move staff at a few sites.

During the 1999 filing season, pursuant to an agreement with the National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU), assistors were placed in a waiting status after each call and remained in that status until they pressed a keyboard button that put them in an available status.IRS officials said that, by definition, this practice added some amount of time to each call, causing other calls to receive busy signals and, thus, lowering accessibility.", "Changes that required new procedures, new responsibilities, and training for assistors affected productivity. For example, the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998 required that assistors provide their name and employee identification number at the beginning of each call, which added a little time to each call. Also, according to a cognizant official, the need to train all staff on various provisions of the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998 and train those assistors who, in accordance with the NTEU agreement, had accepted broader responsibilities in exchange for increased pay grade led to a shortage of assistors who were available to answer the telephone during the early part of the filing season."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Demand Leveling Did Not Occur as Expected", "paragraphs": ["IRS expected that around-the-clock service would level demand by enabling some taxpayers to call during off-hours, thereby reducing the number of calls coming in during peak times.

After we requested these data, IRS compiled information on the number of calls received on Sundays but was unable to provide data on the number of calls it received during the overnight hours of 11 p.m. to 7 a.m. The information IRS compiled showed that about 2.3 million calls were received on Sundays over IRS\u2019 three main tax law and account telephone lines\u2014about 4 percent of the 57.3 million calls received on those three lines during the filing season.", "IRS\u2019 expectation that around-the-clock service would level demand and reduce peak demand times may have been unrealistic considering its experience in 1998.

The agreement stipulates that IRS must first seek volunteers before requiring assistors to change their work hours to meet staffing shortages at a site. A cognizant official said that IRS had to quickly redo work schedules to accommodate the volunteer provision, which resulted in significant staff shortages in relation to projected call volumes and, thus, schedules that were not as sound as they should have been.", "The timing of the completion of the work schedules also presented a problem. IRS\u2019 negotiations with NTEU took longer than IRS expected, and the agreement was not completed until October 1998. IRS officials said the schedules were not made available until December 1998, just a few weeks before the beginning of the filing season. In responding to a survey of IRS call sites by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, several call site officials said that the timing of the schedules did not allow adequate time to hire and train staff, and that, during the filing season, schedules were changed frequently with little advance notice and did not allow for adequate planning."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Discontinued Voice Messaging Adversely Affected Telephone Service", "paragraphs": ["One result of IRS\u2019 unrealistic assumptions was a decision, before the filing season began, to discontinue a procedure that IRS had used in 1997 and 1998 to handle the more complex calls from taxpayers.

As a result, IRS revised its procedures so that, in 1997 and 1998, callers with questions in complex areas were automatically connected to a voice messaging system. Taxpayers were asked to leave their name, telephone number, and address and the best time to reach them so that their call could be returned within 2 to 3 business days. IRS\u2019 Examination function supported the Customer Service function by detailing staff to return taxpayer calls from the voice messaging system. According to IRS, routing these potentially lengthy, complex calls to a recording freed up assistors to handle shorter, less complex calls.", "According to cognizant IRS officials, IRS decided not to use voice messaging for the 1999 filing season because IRS believed that (1) requiring taxpayers to leave messages and then calling them back days later was not the best possible customer service and (2) there would be adequate customer service staff to handle the expected volume of calls as the calls came in. IRS based the expectation that it would have adequate staff on the assumptions that (1) productivity would increase through improved call routing and (2) demand would be leveled through around- the-clock service. However, IRS\u2019 expectations about productivity and demand leveling were not realized, as previously discussed. Therefore, attempting to answer these more complex, lengthy calls with \u201clive\u201d assistors contributed to longer on-hold times and busy signals for other taxpayers.", "A cognizant official said that the decision to discontinue voice messaging in 1999 was a mistake, considering that these complex calls take longer to resolve.

However, at various times, IRS had to limit its use of the call router because of various problems, such as a lack of standardized programming among call site computers. Also, at the time we completed our audit work, IRS had not reviewed the performance of the call router and, therefore, could not determine if the desired results were achieved or what impact the equipment had on taxpayer access to the telephone system.", "Before the 1999 filing season, calls were routed to a call site by area code or on the basis of the percentage of the total available staff the site had scheduled to work (known as the staff allocation-based routing system). These methods could have caused service disparities for taxpayers. Calls routed to a busy site might have had long on-hold times or received busy signals, while another site might have had low demand and provided immediate assistance. Calls could not easily be rerouted. Historically, IRS call sites operated with a great degree of independence; there were no comprehensive, uniform standards as to how taxpayer calls would be handled. Therefore, taxpayers could experience a different quality of service depending on where their calls were answered.", "IRS\u2019 new call router was designed to remedy any disparities by performing \u201cintelligent\u201d routing in two stages. First-stage intelligent routing was to send the call to the site that, on the basis of assistor availability and expected on-hold times, appeared to be the site that would most quickly answer the taxpayer\u2019s call. Second-stage intelligent routing was to be done after the call had been routed to a site and the taxpayer had responded to IRS\u2019 automated telephone service menu, thus indicating the nature of his or her call. If an assistor who was qualified to handle that type of call was not immediately available at that site, the call router was to query real-time accessibility data on computers at all of the call sites. The call would then be routed to the qualified assistor who, on the basis of accessibility data, would be able to answer the call most quickly no matter where the assistor was located.", "However, at various times during the filing season, problems kept IRS from using intelligent routing. During the first weeks of the 1999 filing season, IRS only did limited second-stage intelligent routing as it tested the system and corrected errors in site computer programming. According to IRS officials, programming at the call sites had to be standardized to accurately route calls. Without correct programming, a call could be routed to a site that actually did not have an assistor available for that type of call. IRS officials said that the programming errors had not surfaced during pre- filing season testing of the system because the volume of calls was not great enough to reveal the errors. IRS corrected these errors and began using second-stage intelligent routing regularly on February 17, 1999.", "IRS also had to limit its use of first-stage intelligent routing during the 1999 filing season. In response to the low accessibility rate, IRS began using a feature known as selected expanded access (SEA) in early February. When the queue for speaking to an assistor is full, SEA gives taxpayers the option to access automated, interactive telephone services and TeleTax;otherwise, the taxpayers would have received a busy signal. Because IRS did not expect to use SEA, the call router had not been programmed with the capability to centrally determine when a taxpayer should be given access to the automated services. The use of SEA resulted in disparities in access when intelligent routing was used because the programming for sites was not uniform as to when SEA was to be offered. Therefore, IRS discontinued first-stage intelligent routing after it started using SEA. Until the router could be programmed for SEA, IRS switched to the staff allocation-based routing system it used in the 1998 filing season. Once a call was routed to a site under that system, second-stage intelligent routing could still be used to send the call to a specific assistor.", "IRS staff monitored accessibility data among sites and rerouted calls in case of disparities among sites. After the call router was reprogrammed and tested for SEA, IRS reinstated first-stage intelligent routing on its toll- free line for tax law questions on April 9, 1999. SEA programming for the account and refund lines was completed, tested, and implemented soon after the April 15 filing date.", "IRS officials had varying views on the impact of the call router problems on accessibility. One official said that some of the early problems with the router decreased accessibility because site computer programming errors caused calls to be sent to sites that did not have assistors available and this caused increased wait times. Another official maintained that routing worked properly at this stage. Still another official characterized the problems with the router as having caused IRS to miss opportunities to improve access, rather than actually causing decreased accessibility.", "IRS did not do a systematic review of the router\u2019s performance in 1999. According to the IRS project manager, multiple changes to IRS\u2019 telephone operations in 1999 made it impossible to isolate the impact of the router on such things as accessibility and productivity.

Even with the increase in monitoring hours, IRS\u2019 measure of quality might still provide different results than it would if all hours were monitored.", "Besides expanding the availability of walk-in services in 1999, IRS did a better job of measuring customer satisfaction with those services. However, it made little progress in measuring service quality and timeliness. Without meaningful nationwide performance data, IRS cannot determine if the walk-in program is meeting its objectives and goals, and thus whether it is an effective method of providing service.", "IRS also increased the information and services it provides through various other methods, such as its Web site. However, the substantial increase in use of the Web site\u2019s E-mail service strained resources and apparently contributed to inaccurate responses and slow response times. Due to the way IRS tracked response times (calendar days v. business days), it could not actually determine how close it came to meeting its timeliness goal. We are not making any recommendations in this area because IRS told us that it plans to (1) change the response-time tracking system to align it with the way the goal is stated and (2) provide assistors with additional training on the E-mail topics with the highest error rates.", "IRS data strongly suggest that the continuing emphasis on EIC noncompliance has produced significant results. IRS identified many erroneous claims by validating SSNs and scrutinizing certain EIC claims. In addition, the many taxpayers who had their EIC denied for tax year 1997 and did not claim the EIC for tax year 1998 would seem to indicate that the new recertification procedures had a positive effect. However, it is possible that some of those taxpayers who did not claim the EIC for tax year 1998 may have been entitled to the credit but did not understand the recertification process or found it too burdensome. IRS has agreed to make some changes in that regard in response to our July 1999 letter.", "In addition to those changes, we believe that the form taxpayers are required to submit to be \u201crecertified\u201d (Form 8862) may mislead them to believe that the information they provide in response to the questions on the form will be sufficient for recertification. Taxpayers may become discouraged and confused when they realize that the information is not sufficient and, instead, that submission of Form 8862 leads to still another IRS request for documents. Taxpayers might rightfully wonder why, if the documents required by later correspondence are essential for recertification, IRS did not tell them that those documents were required when it first notified them about the need to recertify. In addition, even though there was national guidance on the recertification process that service centers were to follow, the guidance was not being followed consistently, which could result in disparate treatment of taxpayers.", "Tax law changes dealing with the new child tax credit seem to have added complexity to filing a tax return, as evidenced by the numerous errors and increased processing workload for IRS. IRS is planning to revise the tax package instructions for tax year 1999 (filing year 2000) in an attempt to reduce taxpayer confusion.", "Our analysis of various performance data indicated that IRS successfully implemented a new processing system. One piece of evidence that we initially thought might indicate some problem with the new system was that IRS took longer than 40 days to issue about 15 percent of the refunds on paper returns. Further inquiry indicated, however, that IRS\u2019 performance in 1999 was close to its performance in 1998. However, we are still concerned that IRS took more than 40 days to issue so many refunds. There may be valid reasons, but IRS was unable to provide us with the kind of data needed to make that determination. Such data are important if IRS wants to identify ways that it might improve its performance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Commissioner of Internal Revenue direct the appropriate officials to take the following steps:", "Analyze the effect of not achieving the planned sample size for monitoring the accuracy of responses to tax law calls and use the results of that analysis to design the sample used in future monitoring.", "Implement a program for assessing the performance of IRS\u2019 walk-in sites.", "As part of that program, require that quality reviews be done, provide sufficient guidance to ensure that the reviews are done consistently and address appropriate issues, and require that data on the results of quality reviews and wait-time monitoring (whether done automatically or manually) be reported to a central location for analysis.", "If IRS does not rely on Form 8862 for recertification purposes, discontinue its use.", "If IRS continues using Form 8862 for recertification purposes, redesign the form to include reference to the documentation listed on Form 886-H and any other documentation that IRS thinks is necessary for recertification so that taxpayers who are required to recertify know as early as possible what documentation is required for recertification.", "Ensure that all service centers implement the recertification procedures according to national guidelines to avoid possible disparate treatment of taxpayers.", "Analyze the results of the refund timeliness tests to determine, among other things, why about 15 percent of the refunds took longer than 40 days to issue and what the test results showed for returns that were filed error- free."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We requested comments on a draft of this report from IRS. We obtained IRS\u2019 written comments in a December 3, 1999, letter from the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (see app. II). On December 3, 1999, we also met with various representatives from the office of IRS\u2019 Chief Operations Officer, which is responsible for the various programs we reviewed, to discuss IRS\u2019 comments. In his letter, the Commissioner said that (1) our draft report provided a fair and balanced assessment of IRS\u2019 efforts to improve processing while providing taxpayers with top quality service and (2) IRS would make every effort to resolve the issues noted in the draft report.", "Regarding our recommendation to analyze the effect of not achieving the planned sample size for monitoring the accuracy of responses to tax law calls, the Commissioner said that IRS has completed such an analysis and is in the process of filling 20 additional monitoring positions. He said that with the additional staff, IRS will be able to meet the desired sampling plan for tax law and other telephone calls. IRS\u2019 actions appear responsive to our recommendation.", "IRS agreed with our recommendation regarding the implementation of a program for assessing the performance of IRS\u2019 walk-in sites. The Commissioner said that, in fiscal year 2000, IRS will implement a quality review program to measure the quality and timeliness of services at walk- in sites. According to IRS, training was conducted in October 1999 to ensure consistency among the quality reviewers, and quality review results and wait-time monitoring results will be reported to the National Office for analysis. These actions, if effectively implemented, will meet the intent of our recommendation.", "In responding to our two recommendations dealing with Form 8862, the Commissioner said that (1) IRS relies on Form 8862 to \u201cidentify the type of action to be taken for taxpayers required to recertify\u201d and (2) any modifications to Form 8862 will be made after assessing the results of the recertification process in 1999 and after completion of an ongoing IRS research project on recertification. At the December 3, 1999, meeting, IRS officials confirmed that IRS\u2019 intent is to defer any decision on either discontinuing or modifying Form 8862 until after the assessment and research project referred to by the Commissioner are completed.", "We believe that it would be useful to await the results of IRS\u2019 assessment and research project before deciding on changes to the recertification process in general and the use of Form 8862 in particular. We encourage the Commissioner to ensure timely completion of those efforts so that any changes can be implemented in time for the 2001 filing season. We will be checking on the results of IRS\u2019 assessment and research project as part of our review of the 2000 tax filing season.", "The Commissioner also noted that redesigning Form 8862 to include references to documentation that might be needed for recertification may be counterproductive to IRS\u2019 efforts to reduce taxpayer burden. He explained that such a change, for example, could cause some taxpayers to submit unnecessary documentation with their returns.", "We agree with the Commissioner about the need to reduce taxpayer burden, and that is the intent of our recommendation. We believe that the current process could mislead taxpayers into believing that the information they provide on Form 8862 will be sufficient for recertification and that their refund is being processed. When taxpayers subsequently receive the notice that their refund is being delayed and that additional documents are necessary for recertification, they may feel burdened by the delayed refund and by the fact that IRS waited until after they filed to tell them what information they had to provide to prove their eligibility for the EIC. We also believe that IRS can mitigate any risk that adoption of our recommendation will cause some taxpayers to provide unnecessary documentation by making it clear, in the notice sent to taxpayers, when submission of the documentation is required.", "IRS agreed with our recommendation that all service centers implement the recertification procedures according to the national guidelines. According to the Commissioner, (1) the guidelines have been incorporated into the Internal Revenue Manual, (2) adherence to procedures in the manual is mandatory, and (3) special reviews will be done during fiscal year 2000 to assess conformance to the procedures.", "IRS also agreed with our recommendation that it analyze the results of the refund timeliness tests to determine why some refunds took longer than 40 days to issue and what the test results showed for returns that were filed error-free. The Commissioner said that IRS will be doing an initial analysis that will provide some of the information called for in our recommendation. Depending on the results of that analysis, which is to be completed by February 1, 2000, IRS said that it might conduct a more extensive analysis. We will be following up on the results of IRS\u2019 analysis as part of our assessment of the 2000 tax filing season.", "IRS also provided various technical comments, which we incorporated in the body of this report where appropriate."], "subsections": []}]}]}], "fastfact": []}
