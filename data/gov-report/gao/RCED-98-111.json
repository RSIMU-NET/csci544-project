Farm production levels can vary significantly from year to year, primarily because farmers operate at the mercy of nature and frequently are subjected to weather-related and other natural disasters. Farm operators can also experience wide swings in the prices they receive for the commodities they grow, depending on total domestic and international production and demand.", "Over the years, the federal government has played an active role in helping to mitigate the effects of risk on farm income. On the production side, the government has subsidized the federal multiple-peril crop insurance program, allowing covered farmers to receive an indemnity payment when production falls below a certain level. To help mitigate price risk, the government administered price and income support programs for farmers of major field crops such as wheat, feed grains, cotton, and rice. However, the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996, commonly known as the 1996 farm bill, terminated the previous income support programs and replaced them with fixed but declining 7-year annual payments. Because these payments are not tied to market prices, farmers now have to take greater responsibility for managing their risk.", "To help farmers manage their risk, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), has introduced a new risk management tool, revenue insurance. Unlike the traditional multiple-peril crop insurance program, which insures against losses in the level of crop production, revenue insurance plans insure against losses in revenue. The plans protect the farmer from the effects of either declines in crop prices or declines in crop yields. The guarantees are based on market prices and on the historical yields associated with the insured acreage. As it does for traditional crop insurance, USDA shares in the cost of these plans by (1) subsidizing the premiums farmers pay, (2) paying private insurance companies to sell the insurance and process claims, and (3) paying a large portion of the plans\u2019 underwriting losses (the difference between premiums and claims)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Federally Subsidized Multiple-Peril Crop Insurance Protects Farmers From Production Losses", "paragraphs": ["Since the 1930s, federally subsidized multiple-peril crop insurance has been a principal means of managing the risk associated with crop losses. The Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) administers the crop insurance program. Over time, this program has grown from covering a few crops and areas to covering most crops and areas. In addition, the Congress has periodically appropriated funds for disaster assistance to farmers when farming areas have suffered widespread crop losses because of weather conditions, such as drought or flooding.", "Between 1980 and 1998, USDA expanded the availability of crop insurance from 30 to 67 crops and from about one-half of the nation\u2019s counties to virtually all areas of the country. Participation, measured in terms of the percent of eligible acres insured, rose from about 10 percent in 1980 to about 40 percent in the early 1990s. Under the Federal Crop Insurance Reform and Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 1994, the Congress required farmers wishing to participate in other USDA farm programs to purchase a minimum amount of crop insurance. This requirement helped increase participation to over 70 percent of eligible acres.", "As the crop insurance program was expanded, federal costs (in constant 1997 dollars) averaged over $1.1 billion annually during the 1990s. As shown in table 1.1, the government\u2019s costs for crop insurance totaled about $8.9 billion from 1990 through 1997.", "Several types of government costs are associated with the traditional crop insurance program. For every dollar of premium established, the government pays an average of 40 cents and the farmer pays 60 cents. The government\u2019s portion of the premiums totaled $3.9 billion from 1990 through 1997. In addition, for every dollar of premium, the government pays the participating insurance companies another 27 cents for the administrative costs of selling and servicing the policies. These administrative expense reimbursements to the private insurance companies totaled $2.8 billion from 1990 through 1997. Furthermore, the government paid a portion of program losses (the difference between premiums and claims). Over the years, the established premiums have not been sufficient to pay the claims on the policies. Under the 1994 reform act, USDA is required to achieve a loss ratio of 1.10\u2014that is, for every dollar in premiums taken in, the claims paid would be expected to average no more than $1.10. For 1981 through 1996, the claims paid have averaged $1.26 per $1 of premium, but the increases in premium rates in recent years by the Risk Management Agency are now expected to lower the loss ratio to about 1.10. Under the government\u2019s standard reinsurance agreements with the companies, the companies share a limited portion of any program losses, but the government absorbs the vast majority of them, totaling $1.4 billion over the period. Finally, the government paid $747 million for FCIC\u2019s own operating costs.", "In 1993, we reported the high costs associated with crop insurance through the years, and we pointed out that the insurability problems faced by the program hindered its actuarial soundness. Unlike insurers in other insurance industries, such as property and casualty, crop insurers cannot minimize their risk of loss by pooling participants with different levels of risk in their insurance program. In these other industries, the losses for one insured are independent of the losses for another insured. For the agriculture sector, however, losses are not generally independent of each other. For example, weather conditions, such as widespread drought, can cause production losses for many of the farmers in the same insurance pool.", "Furthermore, as we pointed out in the 1993 report, the crop insurance program is subject to conditions known as adverse selection and moral hazard. Because FCIC does not have sufficient farm-level information to differentiate among farmers\u2019 risks, it may charge similar premiums to both high-risk and low-risk farmers. Consequently, high-risk farmers are more likely to find premiums attractive and therefore participate in the program in greater numbers than do low-risk farmers\u2014a situation referred to as adverse selection. The report also noted that FCIC lacks sufficient information about individual farmers to detect moral hazard\u2014when an insured farmer\u2019s actions increase the chance for or the extent of loss. For example, when insurance payments seem to offer a better financial return than marketing a partial crop, a farmer may reduce inputs, such as fertilizer or pesticides, thereby increasing the risk of a production loss."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Income and Price Support Programs Mitigated Price Risks", "paragraphs": ["The federal government also used income and price support programs in an effort to protect farmers\u2019 incomes. Prior to 1996, USDA administered programs known as deficiency payment programs for several major crops\u2014wheat, feed grains, cotton, and rice. These programs were designed to protect farmers\u2019 incomes against declines in prices through a complicated array of pricing mechanisms. In return for participating in these programs, farmers agreed to limits on the number of acres they placed into production. Unlike the deficiency payment programs, which were not reauthorized by the 1996 farm bill, a number of price support programs, such as the marketing loan program, are still in place. Marketing loan programs are designed, among other things, to help farmers in periods of severely low prices.", "Under the 1996 farm act, farmers\u2019 were encouraged to produce in response to market forces alone, rather than to the expectation of federal payments. As part of this new direction in policy, the 1996 act replaced the previous income support programs with \u201cproduction flexibility contracts\u201d\u2014agreements between the federal government and participating farmers that provide for fixed but declining 7-year annual payments through 2002. These annual payments are not tied to market prices. Farmers who signed these agreements are not restricted to the type or amount of any crop they plant. USDA estimates that the production flexibility contracts will cost a total of $35.6 billion over the 7-year period."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Ways Farmers Manage Risk of Price Fluctuation", "paragraphs": ["Many farmers also use crop insurance in combination with nongovernmental strategies to manage the risk to their income resulting from price fluctuations. A common strategy is forward contracting. With this technique, farmers contract to sell the crop, well before it is actually harvested, and thus are able to establish a pre-harvest selling price and guarantee an outlet for the crop. Additionally, some farmers use hedging\u2014a process whereby the farmer directly uses the commodity futures markets to establish a pre-harvest price for the crop. The farmers using these techniques to manage their price risk generally continue to use traditional multiple-peril crop insurance to manage the risk of crop loss."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "New Federally Subsidized Crop Revenue Insurance Plans Protect Farmers From Both Price and Yield Declines", "paragraphs": ["As an alternative to buying crop insurance and separately forward contracting or hedging, three new government-supported revenue insurance plans\u2014Crop Revenue Coverage, Revenue Assurance, and Income Protection\u2014provide farmers with a single policy that protects against both production and price risk. Crop Revenue Coverage and Revenue Assurance were developed by private insurance companies that requested and received federal reinsurance for the plans, whereas FCIC developed Income Protection as a pilot project under the terms of the 1994 crop insurance reform act, which called for a risk protection plan based on the cost of production.", "Income Protection and Revenue Assurance are similar in that each plan pays indemnities when the income from crop production is less than the revenue guaranteed at planting. Crop Revenue Coverage adds an additional dimension that allows the farmer to receive a larger payment if market prices have increased in the intervening period. For all three plans, market prices are tied to the futures prices on the commodity exchanges, such as the Chicago Board of Trade. Premiums for Crop Revenue Coverage are established as surcharges to the traditional multiple-peril crop insurance rates, whereas Income Protection and Revenue Assurance use methods to establish new rates that are independent of the traditional rate.", "USDA shares in the cost of these new plans in a manner similar to the method used to support traditional multiple-peril crop insurance. First, just as with traditional multiple-peril crop insurance, USDA subsidizes the premiums farmers pay. The subsidy, which averages 40 percent of premiums for multiple-peril crop insurance, is limited, in the case of the new revenue plans, to the same dollar amount that would apply to the comparable multiple-peril insurance policy. Second, just as with traditional multiple-peril crop insurance, USDA pays private insurance companies a reimbursement for administrative expenses to sell the revenue insurance policies and process claims. This administrative reimbursement is a preestablished percentage of the premiums paid by the farmers. In 1998, USDA will pay the companies 27 percent of premiums to sell and service the multiple-peril, Income Protection, and Revenue Assurance policies. Because the premiums are significantly higher for Crop Revenue Coverage policies, USDA has limited the administrative payment on these policies to 23.25 percent of premiums. Finally, just as with multiple-peril crop insurance, USDA pays a large portion of any underwriting losses that may result if premiums are not high enough to pay all claims arising under the revenue policies. For 1998, USDA increased the portion of these losses that the companies must absorb, but the government continues to absorb most of the losses. Conversely, if underwriting gains occur\u2014when premiums are higher than claims\u2014the insurance companies and the federal government share in the gains."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["In light of the rapid expansion of, and the government\u2019s significant financial participation in, the new crop revenue plans, the Ranking Minority Member of the House Committee on Agriculture asked us to (1) identify the differences between the three new revenue insurance plans, (2) report on the plans\u2019 sales and claims experience, and (3) analyze the methodologies used to set the plans\u2019 premium rates.", "We identified the differences in the various revenue insurance plans by reviewing USDA\u2019s documentation for each plan as provided by the plans\u2019 developers and comparing the plans\u2019 features and protection levels.

We identified national sales and claims information for each plan and analyzed this information, controlling for the differences in availability because of location, crop, and level of protection. We also examined the characteristics of Crop Revenue Coverage policies by measuring average acres insured, variability of year-to-year crop yields, and average yields per insured policy unit and comparing this information with the characteristics of multiple-peril crop insurance policies. Because Income Protection\u2019s and Revenue Assurance\u2019s sales were limited, we could not analyze their risk characteristics.", "To analyze the methods used to set premium rates and to identify uncertainties pertaining to premium rates, we reviewed academic literature on setting insurance rates and agricultural economics literature on crop revenue insurance and other issues such as the correlation between local crop yields and national prices. We also interviewed officials at USDA\u2019s Economic Research Service, Office of the Chief Economist, and Risk Management Agency; the academic consultants on the plans at Kansas State University, Iowa State University, and Montana State University; and agricultural economists at several other universities who have performed research on crop and/or revenue insurance issues. In order to examine each revenue insurance plan, we interviewed the developers of the plans and reviewed the documentation they had provided to USDA as well as additional information they provided to us. We also evaluated each plan in light of our economic analysis, our discussions with the experts in these fields, and our review of the pertinent insurance and agricultural economics literature. We discussed our analysis with the developers of the plans and several independent reviewers.", "We conducted our review from July 1997 through March 1998 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

But they differ in how that guarantee is determined.", "For both Income Protection and Revenue Assurance, the farmer\u2019s revenue guarantee is established when crops are planted. To determine that guarantee, the insurer multiplies the farmer\u2019s expected production by a price established at planting. If the farmer\u2019s revenue at harvest is below that expected preseason income, the farmer receives an insurance payment. Farmers whose revenue is at or above the guaranteed level do not receive a payment. Total revenue from the crop is the determining characteristic, not the level of production or the price alone. No payment would be made if a price decline is sufficiently offset by an increase in production or if a loss in production is offset by a sufficient increase in price.", "In contrast, the calculation of the amount of revenue guaranteed under Crop Revenue Coverage is more complicated. Crop Revenue Coverage guarantees a minimum revenue at planting that is determined by multiplying the prevailing futures market price at planting by the farmer\u2019s historical production per acre. At harvest, the revenue guarantee is revisited, and the final guarantee is determined by multiplying the farmer\u2019s historical production by the price at planting or at harvest, whichever price is higher. If the price has increased in the period between planting and harvest, the farmer receives a payment for any lost production at the higher harvest price. This upward price protection feature assures the farmer that any lost production will be replaced at the prevailing market price, thus facilitating forward contracting by the farmer. If, however, the harvest price is lower, the original guarantee is in force.

The starting point for determining revenue is the futures prices for a particular commodity on its commodity exchange. However, each plan adjusts those prices somewhat differently. The differences center around how the national price prevailing on a commodity exchange is adjusted for local conditions. Generally, prices in local markets are a few cents per bushel less than the national price on the board of trade. These local differences are generally greater in the areas more distant from major market centers, and the differences decline nearer to the market centers. Income Protection and Crop Revenue Coverage do not adjust for this factor, while Revenue Assurance makes a county-by-county adjustment. Table 2.1 shows the revenue guarantee features of the three plans.", "As the table shows, Income Protection makes no adjustment for the difference in prices that occur from county to county. Instead, the plan uses one national price for all policies in all counties. For corn, the price used to determine the revenue guarantee for all policies is the Chicago Board of Trade\u2019s average corn futures price in February for the December contract. Similarly, Income Protection determines actual revenue for all policyholders by multiplying the farmer\u2019s actual production by the Chicago Board of Trade\u2019s corn futures average price in November for the December contract.", "In contrast, Revenue Assurance determines the revenue guarantee for each farmer using the Chicago Board of Trade\u2019s February prices for the December corn contract, adjusted by a county-specific factor. Revenue Assurance establishes this adjustment on the basis of the historical relationship of local harvest prices in each county to the Chicago Board of Trade\u2019s prices in the harvest month. To determine the value of the harvested crop, Revenue Assurance departs from the Chicago Board of Trade\u2019s prices. Instead, it uses a price USDA establishes for other purposes in each county\u2014referred to as the posted county price.", "During 1996 and 1997, Crop Revenue Coverage calculated each farmer\u2019s revenue guarantee using the higher of (1) 95 percent of the average corn futures price on the Chicago Board of Trade in February for the December contract, or (2) 95 percent of the average corn price on the Chicago Board of Trade in November for the December contract. To determine the crop\u2019s harvested value, Crop Revenue Coverage used 95 percent of the average corn price on the Chicago Board of Trade in November for the December contract.

Four land configuration arrangements are available to farmers: (1) whole farm (combining coverage on all fields for all combinations of covered crops in the county in which the farmer has a share in the crops produced); (2) enterprise unit (combining each of the fields in which the farmer owns or has a share of the crop produced in the county, regardless of ownership arrangement); (3) basic unit (combining each of the fields of a crop under a single type of ownership arrangement); and (4) optional unit (essentially, insuring on a field-by-field basis). In general, the more a farmer\u2019s land is consolidated, the less likely it is that the farmer will have a loss large enough to trigger an insurance payment. This is because a farmer\u2019s production, for insurance purposes, is averaged across all the insured fields.", "Income Protection is available only on the basis of the enterprise unit. In contrast, for Revenue Assurance, farmers can choose to configure their farm with any type of units. Initially, Revenue Assurance establishes the premium rate for those choosing the basic unit. If the farmer wants to further divide the basic unit into optional units, the policy imposes a surcharge. However, if the farmer elects to consolidate coverage on the basis of an enterprise unit, the policy offers a discount from the initial basic unit rate. The policy provides an additional discount for the farmer who chooses whole farm coverage. Finally, Crop Revenue Coverage allowed basic and optional coverage in 1996 and 1997 and received approval from FCIC to add enterprise coverage for 1998.

Second, Revenue Assurance assumes that the interrelationship between crop prices and yields is the same in all production areas. This is not the case. That is, the link between yield declines and price increases or yield increases and price declines is much stronger in some areas than others. By using the same estimate of the interrelationship for all areas, the resulting estimate of claims may be too high in some areas and too low in others. As a result, there is no assurance that the plan\u2019s premiums are appropriate for all farmers and will actually cover all claims over time.", "With respect to Income Protection, the plan\u2019s major shortcoming is that it bases its estimate of future price increases or decreases on the way that prices moved in the past.

Developers of the Income Protection plan believe that because of the effect of previous farm programs, historical data sets may underestimate the variances in future farm prices. This would mean that premium rates would be too low to accommodate future price fluctuations and therefore future losses. In order to account for this effect, a 20-percent loading factor was added to the premium."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Comments From the U.S. Department of Agriculture", "paragraphs": ["The following are GAO\u2019s comments on the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s letter dated April 6, 1998."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO\u2019s Comments", "paragraphs": ["1. We disagree. While we do not state in this report, nor do we believe, that the plans contain \u201cfatal flaws,\u201d we believe that the shortcomings we identified in all three revenue insurance plans are serious enough to warrant a reevaluation of the methods and data used to set premium rates to ensure that each plan is based on the most actuarially sound foundation. In particular, as we reported, the rating method for Crop Revenue Coverage is especially problematic because it does not take into account the relationship between crop prices and yields. 2. Contrary to the agency\u2019s assertion, we do not assume that the premium rates for revenue coverage (without replacement coverage) are always lower than the premium rates charged for yield coverage. We agree with the agency that the rates for these revenue plans can be higher than those for yield coverage when both yields and prices decline. For this reason, throughout the report, we say that a decline in yield is \u201coften\u201d accompanied by an increase in prices. 3. In using the term \u201cactuarial soundness,\u201d we mean that the premiums established for each plan are sufficient over the long term to cover the indemnities paid, and that individual premiums are appropriate to the risk each farmer presents. We have revised the report to clarify our use of this term. 4. We have removed the word \u201cmechanical\u201d from the report. 5. We disagree. Estimates of future price volatility based on historical prices and estimates of price volatility based on current market expectations are not equally appropriate. Crop Revenue Coverage and Income Protection base their estimates of future price increases or decreases on the way that prices moved in the past, when certain farm programs were in place that set a price floor. This situation has changed. Under current policy, when prices are tied to market conditions, we continue to believe that the market\u2019s expectation of price volatility is the best barometer of intra-year price changes. 6. In the executive summary, we have modified the language to reflect the partially offsetting effects of Crop Revenue Coverage\u2019s higher premiums. Our discussion in chapter 2 already reflected this point. Nevertheless, when crop prices are higher at harvest than at planting, claims payments for Crop Revenue Coverage will exceed those paid for multiple-peril crop insurance. 7. We have modified our report to reflect the fact that in recent years the agency has improved its expected loss ratio for traditional multiple-peril crop insurance to achieve the current legislatively mandated 1.10 loss ratio. 8. See comment 1. In addition, we believe that as shortcomings in the methods used to establish premium rates are identified, the Risk Management Agency should take action to correct the deficiencies to the extent possible. 9. We agree that the agency must continually evaluate all rate-making methodologies. However, when this evaluation reveals shortcomings, as we point out in this report, then evaluations should be translated into actions to ensure that each plan is based on the most actuarially sound foundation. 10. We have modified our report to reflect the agency\u2019s authority to approve expansion of Crop Revenue Coverage. 11. The Risk Management Agency\u2019s senior actuary informed us that the premium rates for Crop Revenue Coverage average about 30 percent higher than comparable premium rates for traditional multiple-peril crop insurance. Because administrative expense reimbursements are based on fixed percentage of premiums, higher premiums for Crop Revenue Coverage will result in higher administrative costs to the government. A judgment on whether the reimbursement is adequate to cover expenses was beyond the scope of our work."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Major Contributors to This Report", "paragraphs": ["Robert C.
