Navy guidance to the fleet emphasizes that these  assessments performed by independent experts are valuable in  supporting impartial results and providing quality information for  analysis.", "According to Navy documentation, the Navy also used the 2018  competency assessments to help validate its new Junior Officer of the  Deck and Officer of the Deck training curriculum. Specifically, Surface  Warfare Officers School Command used the same Officer of the Deck  competency assessment criteria to assess six officers in May 2018 and  12 in July 2018 that completed a pilot version of the Junior Officer of the  Deck course. Surface Warfare Officer School Command found that the  students with no at-sea experience that had completed a pilot of the new  Junior Officer of the Deck training course in some cases outperformed  qualified Officers of the Deck that had over a year of at-sea experience.  According to Navy officials, the ability to compare ship-driving proficiency  among populations and with earlier baselines using these competency  assessments was valuable to the Navy in identifying the effects of  changes to training, and could also be valuable in the future, as well.", "However, when we visited Surface Warfare Officers School Command in  February 2019, officials told us they did not plan to conduct additional  competency assessments until 2020. In meetings with Surface Warfare  Officers School Command and senior Navy leaders, we noted that  delaying additional assessments could limit visibility over ship driving  proficiency trends and that small sample sizes could affect the Navy\u2019s  ability to make comparisons over time. In response, the Navy accelerated  and expanded additional competency assessments. According to Navy  officials, in spring 2019, Surface Warfare Officers School Command  began to assess a sample of Division Officers using the Officer of the  Deck competency assessment at the beginning of each Advanced  Division Officer Course to collect and analyze performance data and  refine training curriculum. Further, as of July 2019, the Navy had  assessed 38 SWOs from three courses and found that the proficiency  level of the SWOs assessed had not improved from the proficiency levels  seen in the 2018 assessments.", "Senior Navy officials we met with as part of this review stated that they  recognize the value in implementing periodic ship-driving competency  assessments by independent inspectors to identify trends in ship-driving  proficiency over time. However, we also found that the Navy has not  planned to routinely conduct these assessments in the future.  Specifically, in July 2019, Navy officials stated that they do not plan to  complete these Officer of the Deck competency assessments beyond  2021 and plan to replace them with a different assessment at the end of  the planned Officer of the Deck Phase II course. However, our analysis  shows that mid-fiscal year 2024 is the first time Officer of the Deck Phase  I course graduates will have completed their first at-sea assignment and  be available to have their ship-driving training assessed, resulting in a  multi-year gap in planned competency assessments. In order to measure  the effectiveness of the full complement of Navy\u2019s new and enhanced  ship-driving training, the independent Navy inspectors will need to  continue administering the Officer of the Deck competency assessments  beyond 2021. In addition, an assessment performed at the end of  training, such as the planned Officer of the Deck Phase II assessment,  indicates the SWOs\u2019 proficiency after additional training and may give a  less accurate indication of prior at-sea proficiency. According to federal  government internal control standards, management should use quality  information and monitoring activities to ensure the entity\u2019s objectives are  achieved. Moreover, our prior work on assessing training efforts in the  federal government states that an agency should evaluate the  effectiveness of its training and development efforts, to include assessing  competency and analyzing relevant data. Without routinely conducting  Officer of the Deck competency assessments across the fleet using  samples of sufficient size and selection methods, the Navy will be  hindered in its ability to gauge fleet-wide ship driving proficiency trends  and determine the effectiveness of the changes made to training, and the  Navy may not know whether additional changes are needed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Navy Lacks Standard Criteria for Informing the Qualification of Officer of the Deck Candidates", "paragraphs": ["We found that the Navy has not provided standard criteria to ship  Commanding Officers on fleet-wide ship driving proficiency expectations  to inform the qualification of Officer of the Deck candidates. Instead, the  Navy has determined that ship Commanding Officers should use their  individual judgment in granting this qualification based on a set of  required officer experiences, which the Navy refers to as Personnel  Qualification Standards. Following the 2017 collisions, Surface Warfare  Officers School Command developed proficiency standards to measure  and test Officer of the Deck ship-driving proficiency to implement the  Officer of the Deck competency assessments described above. The  proficiency standards require an Officer of the Deck to demonstrate  knowledge of navigation systems, rules of the road, and effective bridge  resource management and to demonstrate the ability to successfully  navigate high-traffic environments.", "However, the varying at-sea experiences of officers and subjective nature  of some requirements have led to different experiences for SWO  candidates working to qualify as Officer of the Deck. SWOs must  complete a standard series of requirements in ship-driving and other  experience before they are eligible to qualify as Officer of the Deck, with  Commanding Officers granting qualification after their assessment of the  SWO\u2019s performance and fitness. However, when we held group  discussions with SWOs on ships in the fleet, SWOs in nine of 12 group  discussions with Division Officers, eight of 12 group discussions with  Department Heads, and three of 12 interviews with Commanding Officers  and Executive Officers identified significant differences in opportunities,  experiences, and assessments that Division Officers experience in  earning their qualification as Officers of the Deck during their first Division  Officer assignment. For example:  In one group discussion, Division Officers reported being qualified as  Officers of the Deck without ever having stood watch at sea, with the  Commanding Officer granting qualifications based on their classroom  and simulator experience alone.", "In five of 12 group discussions with Division Officers, Division Officers  stated that SWOs on ships in maintenance had few opportunities to  stand watch on the bridge at sea to build proficiency in difficult ship- driving operations, but still received their qualifications.", "SWOs in 17 of 24 group discussions stated that some Division  Officers get more ship driving experience than others before earning  their Officer of the Deck qualifications. For example, Division Officers  assigned to ships with more time at sea or fewer Division Officers get  more experience to practice ship driving than those on ships with little  time at sea or that must divide ship-driving opportunities among  numerous Division Officers.", "Commanding Officers in three of 12 interviews reported that they had  to temporarily place their Division Officers on other ships to gain  qualifying experience, and had to rely on the judgment of the other  ships\u2019 Commanding Officers in determining their qualifications as  Officers of the Deck.", "According to Navy officials, the Navy has not provided Officer of the Deck  assessment criteria based on the developed proficiency standards to ship  Commanding Officers, out of deference to their judgment in interpreting  an officer\u2019s preparedness to drive their ship. Navy officials emphasized  the importance of allowing ship Commanding Officers to make their own  determination of an officer\u2019s preparedness to drive a ship, due to their  knowledge of the ship\u2019s operating conditions. Navy officials also stated  that they considered the Officer of the Deck assessment standards to be  a resource for use by Surface Warfare Officer Schools Command in  assessing training curriculum and had not considered using the standards  in the fleet for other purposes. However, the Navy\u2019s 2018 and 2019  Officer of the Deck competency assessments identified significant  variance in the ship-driving competency levels of recently qualified  Officers of the Deck.", "Since the Navy has developed fleet-wide standards for assessing Officer  of the Deck proficiency, the Navy could use these to provide standard  Officer of the Deck assessment criteria in guidance to ship Commanding  Officers. Federal government internal control standards state that  management should internally communicate the necessary quality  information to achieve the entity\u2019s objectives and ensure decisions are  made based on consistent standards. A SWO\u2019s assigned ship,  Commanding Officer, and operating conditions may change during a  career, so a standard set of criteria would help Commanding Officers to  determine what is expected of Officers of the Deck elsewhere in the fleet  as they determine a junior officer\u2019s qualification. Without providing  standard Officer of the Deck assessment criteria and incorporating them  into surface fleet guidance to Commanding Officers, the Navy risks  creating uncertainty in Officer of the Deck qualification expectations\u2014 which can contribute to variations in ship-driving proficiency among  SWOs that could jeopardize safe operations at sea."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Navy Has Not Determined How to Analyze and Use Surface Warfare Mariner Skills Logbook Data", "paragraphs": ["In September 2018, the Commander, Naval Surface Forces, U.S. Pacific  Fleet and Commander, Naval Surface Forces Atlantic, began requiring  SWOs to document their ship-driving and related experience in a  handwritten logbook. The logbook\u2014referred to as the Surface Warfare  Mariner Skills Logbook (see fig. 6)\u2014captures an officer\u2019s experience  gained during each watch aboard a ship, special evolution (e.g.,  underway replenishment, flight operations, and sea and anchor duty), and  simulator training session.", "During our ship discussion groups, SWOs at the Division Officer and  Department Head levels reported that they had begun filling out their  logbooks and having them reviewed as required, but some acknowledged  that they are inconsistently filling them out or that they were not entering  any information in them. Specifically, SWOs in five of 24 discussion  groups reported that logbooks are completed with inconsistent quality or  not completed at all. Additionally, SWOs in four of 24 discussion groups  reported that they are unaware of any plans to use the logbook  information to identify any additional training needs and provide  opportunities for SWOs to improve their ship-driving proficiency. Navy  Personnel Command officials told us that, as of July 2019, they had  received 174 summaries of Surface Warfare Mariner Skills Logbook data from Commanding Officers. Navy officials stated that over time, as they  gather these data, they intend to examine the link between ship-driving  proficiency and SWO experience. However, officials did not have any  specific, measurable plans to analyze and use these data or to assess  the completeness of these data.", "Federal internal control standards state that management should obtain  relevant data from reliable sources and process those data into quality  information to aid decision-making. Furthermore, Naval Surface Forces  guidance states that the surface warfare community should analyze and  use logbook data to link SWO experience with ship-driving proficiency.  Despite this guidance, the Navy does not yet have a plan that includes  specific steps to analyze and use logbook information to link SWO  experience with ship-driving proficiency. According to senior Navy  officials, while the Surface Warfare Mariner Skills Logbook is still  relatively new, developing a plan to use the information would be a logical  next step. Without a plan for analyzing and using Surface Warfare  Mariner Skills Logbook data, the Navy cannot determine the relationship  between SWO experience and ship-driving proficiency or use these data  to aid decision-making."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["SWOs play a critical role in Navy surface fleet readiness, as they are  responsible for safely driving ships at sea and successfully leading ships  in Navy operations across the world. The Navy is making numerous  changes and investments to enhance Surface Warfare Officer ship- driving training following the 2017 collisions at sea\u2014with plans to triple  initial training hours and spend nearly half a billion dollars to build  simulator capacity to deliver this training. The Navy\u2019s oversight of these  efforts is centered on a series of added checks throughout SWOs\u2019  careers to ensure that they have basic ship-driving and other skills. These  checks are steps in the right direction but may not provide adequate  assessment mechanisms in the near term and might lead to missed  opportunities going forward. For example, the Navy is expanding its ship- driving training but is not planning to collect fleet-wide feedback on  classroom, simulator, and at-sea training received. In addition, the Navy  developed standards for conducting spot checks on ship-driving  competency but is planning to stop those checks in 2021, missing an  opportunity for an outside assessment and to evaluate how well new and  updated training is working. Moreover, ship commanders are expected to  qualify SWOs on ship driving but have not been provided standard  guidance for how to do this, which can contribute to wide variations in  SWO competence. Finally, the Navy has developed detailed logbooks for  SWOs to track their experiences but the Navy has not developed a  specific plan to analyze and use the logbook data. Without actions to  address these challenges, the Navy cannot fully assess in the near term if  the significant investments it is making to expand and enhance SWO  ship-driving training are effective; further adjustments are necessary; and,  ultimately, Navy ships are being operated safely at sea."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making the following four recommendations to the Department of  Navy:  We recommend that the Secretary of the Navy ensure that the  Commander, Naval Surface Forces, in coordination with Surface Warfare  Officers School Command, develop a method to regularly collect  feedback from SWOs across the fleet, such as in a survey, regarding the  quality of their classroom, simulator, and at-sea training on Division  Officer performance; and evaluates trends in the feedback received for  the purpose of improving SWO training. (Recommendation 1)", "We recommend that the Secretary of the Navy ensure that the  Commander, Naval Surface Forces, routinely conduct regular Officer of  the Deck competency assessments using samples of sufficient size and  using selection methods to gauge the level of fleet-wide ship-driving  proficiency trends following the implementation of the planned ship- driving training programs. (Recommendation 2)", "We recommend that the Secretary of the Navy ensure that the  Commander, Naval Surface Forces, in coordination with Surface Warfare  Officers School Command, provide Commanding Officers with standard  criteria to inform their evaluation of candidates for their Officer of the Deck  qualification and incorporates these criteria into surface fleet guidance.

In  written comments provided by the Navy through DOD (reprinted in their  entirety in appendix V), the Navy concurred with all four of our  recommendations and identified actions it plans to take to evaluate the  effectiveness of changes to SWO training. The Navy also provided  additional information and context in its comments and provided technical  comments, which we incorporated as appropriate.", "The Navy concurred with our first recommendation that the Commander,  Naval Surface Forces, in coordination with Surface Warfare Officers  School Command, develop a method to regularly collect feedback from  SWOs across the fleet, such as in a survey, regarding the quality of their  classroom, simulator, and at-sea training on Division Officer performance;  and evaluate trends in the feedback received for the purpose of improving  SWO training. The Navy stated that it plans to explore additional means  of garnering holistic SWO feedback regarding newly-implemented SWO  training and assessments as well as gathering additional targeted  feedback. However, the Navy stated that the use of performance data will  remain the primary focus of surface force training improvement efforts.  While using performance data is valuable, it will be important that the  Navy follow through to develop a holistic means of collecting feedback,  such as in a survey of SWOs across the fleet, on the effectiveness of  Division Officer training on SWO performance to ensure a variety of  perspectives are considered.", "In its comments, the Navy noted that the SWOs who participated in our  ship visits and discussion groups had not experienced the changes made  or planned to SWO training. We agree that our ship visits did not include  officers who had experienced the expanded Division Officer training  courses, as they were first introduced to the fleet in June 2019, after we  had completed the majority of our work. While our discussion groups pre- date the implementation of new SWO training courses, the discussion  groups we conducted with over 200 SWOs reinforced the our finding that  the Navy needs to develop a method to regularly collect feedback from  SWOs across the fleet.  Also, the Navy plans to more than triple initial  training, so routinely soliciting and analyzing feedback from SWOs on  Division Officer training will be needed to determine the effectiveness of  the Navy\u2019s investments in these training programs and inform the Navy\u2019s  decisions on whether further adjustments are necessary.", "The Navy acknowledged that only officers participating in the Surface  Warfare Officers School Command\u2019s Board of Visitors provide direct  feedback on the training curriculum. The Navy noted, however, that all  available Surface Warfare units are invited to participate in Surface  Warfare Officer School Board of Visitors events and so could provide  feedback then. In addition, the Navy noted that Surface Warfare Officer  School Command also solicits feedback through visits to fleet  concentration areas and through semiannual symposiums of ship  Commanding Officers. While such targeted means of collecting  feedback may provide valuable information, officers may not be able to  participate due to their deployment status, position on shore duty, timing  of events during other personal responsibilities, or other factors. We  believe that developing a method to regularly collect feedback from  SWOs across the fleet would provide decision makers with valuable  information that could help them assess the effects of training on SWO  performance.", "The Navy concurred with our second recommendation that the  Commander, Naval Surface Forces, routinely conduct regular Officer of  the Deck competency assessments using samples of sufficient size and  using selection methods to gauge the level of fleet-wide ship-driving  proficiency trends following the implementation of the planned ship- driving training programs. The Navy stated that it plans to routinely collect  and analyze standardized mariner skills performance data across an  officer\u2019s career path. However, the Navy stated it will use training checks,  rather than the current Officer of the Deck competency assessment, to  evaluate SWO performance after 2020. This presents two problems in  meeting the intent of our recommendation. First, the Navy will need to  ensure that the training checks are sufficiently rigorous to assess  competency. Second, the Navy will not have valid data to compare the  effects of training changes on competency if it changes its assessment  approach.", "In 2018, the Navy used the Officer of the Deck competency assessment  to establish a baseline of SWO ship-driving proficiency. We found that the  2018 competency assessments showed significant variation in ship- driving proficiency and the 2019 follow up assessments found that  competency had not improved. In currently documented plans, the Officer  of the Deck Phase II check after a Division Officer\u2019s first assignment will  occur at the end of the course. Even if the Navy changes the Officer of  the Deck Phase II check to occur at the beginning of training as stated in  its comments, performance data from this check cannot be directly  compared with the results of the current competency assessment.  Differences in assessment content or difficulty, remediation attempts, and  the fact that the new check may have career implications for SWOs as a  go/no-go assessment may affect proficiency measurements and pass  rates. Due to these factors, we believe that a comparison between the  current Officer of the Deck competency assessment and the planned  Officer of the Deck Phase II check or another standard should not be  considered as valid means for demonstrating changes in ship-driving  proficiency over time. That is, adopting a new standard may affect the  Navy\u2019s ability to determine the impact of training on ship-driving  proficiency compared with the 2018 baseline results.", "The Navy also stated in its comments that the SWO training and  assessment continuum is designed to provide training and evaluation at  all career milestone levels. The planned system of additional skills checks  will provide the Navy with more insight into SWO proficiency levels over  the course of an officer\u2019s career and help the Navy to understand the  effects of changes to training. As we stated in the report, we believe these  checks are significant steps in the right direction but may not provide  adequate assessment mechanisms in the near term. The more robust  Officer of the Deck competency assessments are necessary to gauge the  level of fleet-wide ship-driving proficiency trends following the  implementation of the planned ship-driving training programs.", "Further, the Navy stated in its comments that while numerous means of  assessing SWO mariner skills proficiency at various milestone levels are  in place, the ultimate SWO career path goal is to develop the most  proficient, experienced, and confident Commanding Officers, which  occurs approximately 16 years into the SWO career path. While the  quality of ship Commanding Officers is a vital component of Navy  readiness and capability, the majority of SWOs do not remain in the Navy  long enough to advance beyond the position of Division Officer, according  to Navy documentation. Similarly few advance to the position of  Commanding Officer during their career as a SWO. Since Division  Officers constitute over one third of the SWO workforce and by design of  the SWO career path do most of the ship-driving, it is of utmost  importance to build and evaluate fundamental ship-driving skills for all  Division Officers to support excellence in the ship-driving proficiency  across the Navy.", "Finally, the Navy stated in its comments that our report language implies  an absence of any Officer of the Deck assessments from 2021 through  2024. We acknowledge that the Navy will conduct assessments of  Officers of the Deck during this time period in line with its planned system  of ten checks over a SWO\u2019s career. However, without maintaining the  current Officer of the Deck competency assessments through at least  2024, the Navy will be unable to demonstrate any proficiency  improvement, compared with the 2018 baseline, resulting from its new  training programs.  Further, the Navy stated in its comments that it is  important to clarify that the SWOs who received competency checks in  2019 had not benefitted from the new and expanded ship-driving training  courses. Our ship visits did not include officers who had experienced the  expanded Division Officer training courses, as they were first introduced  to the fleet in June 2019. Nonetheless, it is concerning that SWO  competency had not improved in the 2 years since the 2017 collisions  despite the fleet-wide attention to improving ship-driving skills.", "The Navy concurred with our third recommendation that the Commander,  Naval Surface Forces, in coordination with Surface Warfare Officers  School Command, provide Commanding Officers with standard criteria to  inform their evaluation of candidates for their Officer of the Deck  qualification and incorporate these criteria into surface fleet guidance.  However, the Navy stated that such criteria are already in place.  Specifically, the Navy noted that existing Personnel Qualification  Standards provide the standard evaluation criteria for the Officer of the  Deck qualification. We agree that the Personnel Qualification Standards  are in place, but disagree that Qualification Standards provide standard  evaluation criteria. Unless the Navy provides additional guidance for  Commanding Officers to measure proficiency in addition to the list of  required experiences present in the Personnel Qualification Standards,  the actions the Navy identified as addressing our recommendation will not  meet the intent of our recommendation.", "The Navy\u2019s Officer of the Deck Personnel Qualification Standards provide  a list of required experiences; however, the 2018 and 2019 competency  assessments indicate that these existing criteria have not resulted in high  levels of proficiency among Officers of the Deck. The Navy\u2019s Personnel  Qualification Standards do not require SWOs to demonstrate a standard  level of proficiency, but rather that SWOs participate in a required number  of ship-driving experiences at a level determined by his or her  Commanding Officer. The absence of a common proficiency standard  across the Navy may contribute to inconsistency in ship-driving skills  among SWOs. Since the Officer of the Deck competency assessment  provides a means to measure proficiency, communicating appropriate  standards in line with those used in the current assessments as  qualification criteria would help ensure a common understanding of  proficiency expectations.", "In comments, the Navy stated that for junior officers whose ships  experience maintenance periods, it is an historic surface force-wide  practice for Commanding Officers to temporarily assign those officers to  similar ships whose operational schedule better support qualification. This  practice is understandable and may contribute to SWO career  development, but can lead to significant differences in opportunities,  experiences, and assessments that SWOs receive during their first  Division Officer assignment. For example, as noted in our report, some  Commanding Officers stated because of this temporary assignment, they  had to rely on the judgment of the other ships\u2019 Commanding Officers to  determine their SWOs\u2019 qualifications as Officers of the Deck.", "The Navy concurred with our fourth recommendation that Commander,  Naval Surface Forces, in coordination with Surface Warfare Officer  School Command, develop a plan to analyze and use Mariner Skills  Logbook information to inform decision-making. The Navy noted that it  would comprehensively evaluate performance data relative to Mariner  Skills Logbook data in order to refine mariner skill milestone performance  and proficiency criteria. If Navy efforts result in a plan that includes  specific and measurable steps for analyzing and using Mariner Skills  Logbook data, the efforts will meet the intent of our recommendation.", "In its comments the Navy stated that during the time we conducted our  group discussions (i.e. January through April 2019), Mariner Skills  Logbooks were still being introduced to the Fleet and recording practices  were still being established. While at the time of our discussion groups  the Mariner Skills Logbooks were relatively new, in September 2018, the  Navy issued an instruction that established guidance for the  implementation and use of the logbooks.
