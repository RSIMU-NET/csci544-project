It also identifies individual project risks through a project review process, and considers tradeoffs inherent in different project scenarios. USPS's processes also allow it to respond to these uncertainties and risks. Specifically, USPS sets a capital-spending budget in its overall financial plan, to help ensure that spending is in line with expected resources.

According  to USPS officials, USPS decided a number of years ago to defer  purchasing new delivery vehicles and instead continued using and  maintaining its existing fleet. Because USPS started acquiring most of its  existing delivery fleet in 1987, the majority of its delivery vehicles are  several decades old. USPS officials said these vehicles incur high  maintenance costs, averaging about $4,500 per vehicle annually.", "In acquiring new vehicles, USPS plans to take a number of steps to  ensure that the vehicles best meet the organization\u2019s needs. According to  USPS officials, it will spread the acquisition over multiple years to avoid a  large cash outlay in any given year and to enable USPS to modify the  vehicle purchases over time to take advantage of any technological  changes, such as advances in alternative fuel technologies. Officials  added that USPS is considering vehicles that will encourage operational  efficiencies. For example, USPS is considering taller vehicles that will  better allow carriers to handle trays of mail and packages. The officials  also noted that USPS may consider different vehicle designs for different  market needs. The officials said that USPS is currently testing various  vehicle prototypes and has not decided on any one vehicle design at this  time. In total, USPS projects that its acquisition of new delivery vehicles  will require about $5.7 billion in capital-spending cash outlays distributed  over a number of years.", "In addition to its planned future acquisition of delivery vehicles, USPS has  also conducted smaller acquisitions of vehicles in recent years. According  to USPS officials, in the past few years USPS has been replacing most of  its non-delivery vehicles and will have done so by 2019, while also  purchasing a small number of delivery vehicles to replace ones that have  exceeded their useful life or will serve route growth. For example, in  April 2017 USPS approved a capital spending project to purchase more  than 2,000 cargo vans used to transport large volumes of mail from postal  plants to post offices and other facilities, and about 375 spotter vehicles  used to move trailers among docks at processing facilities.

As a result, most of USPS\u2019s projected capital spending is for  rehabilitation and repair of existing facilities, such as the replacement of  roofs or heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning systems needed to  sustain operations. For example, in December 2016, USPS approved ca  capital spending project to replace the roof at a mail processing facility in  Tulsa, Oklahoma. USPS had concluded that the roof was in a state of  failure, and there were no economically feasible repair options. In  addition, in 2017 USPS approved about a capital spending project to  repair facilities in the U.S. Virgin Islands damaged during Hurricane  Maria.", "Although most facilities spending is related to rehabilitation and repair,  some USPS capital spending is on new facilities. According to USPS  officials, new facilities projects are generally approved because of the  need to completely replace an existing facility that is beyond repair or to  construct a new facility that will replace multiple existing facilities. For  example, in May 2017 USPS approved a capital spending project to  construct a mail-processing facility in Nashville, Tennessee. The facility is  intended to replace and close four existing facilities which will eliminate  space deficiencies, reduce transportation costs, and improve operating  efficiencies.

For example, there is a baseline of projected costs to  replace servers because USPS knows the length of the technologies\u2019  useful lives and when they will need to be replaced. According to USPS  officials, while much of its capital spending on information technology is  intended to replace outdated servers and other hardware, some spending  is for developing new information technology systems. For example, in  March 2017 USPS approved a capital spending project to purchase 67  video conferencing systems intended to increase productivity and  encourage collaboration among USPS offices. In addition, USPS officials  told us that in recent years USPS has undertaken more capital spending  than expected on cybersecurity, a trend that will likely continue for the  next few years. According to a DAR for cybersecurity investments, USPS  is undertaking such investments to proactively identify and respond to  security threats that have the potential to cause financial or other damage  to the organization\u2019s assets or employees, including threats that could  disrupt or destroy information.", "Capital spending on information technology can also support USPS  strategic goals and provide a positive return-on-investment. For example,  in January 2017 USPS approved an additional capital spending to  support development of its Informed Visibility program, which is a system  that provides tracking and reporting of mail shipments for commercial  mailers. According to the Informed Visibility DAR, these capabilities will  provide users with access to valuable business information, helping  improve operational efficiencies and marketing, among other things.

USPS faces continuing declines in First Class Mail volume, and  while it has experienced increased volume in packages, future increases  in package volume are uncertain. Specifically, according to USPS,  some of its major shipping customers are now building their own delivery  capability that may enable them to divert some package shipments away  from USPS. USPS has also stated that it faces challenges in ensuring  that future operations generate sufficient revenues to support planned  capital spending and that it is constrained in its ability to reduce costs.", "We have previously testified that USPS continues to face a serious  financial situation with insufficient revenues to cover its expenses.", "This uncertain financial outlook may result in USPS changing its current  capital-spending plans, including setting new priorities across its planned  projects and other business needs. These prioritization decisions can  involve tradeoffs among projects and between capital and operations  spending. USPS has already faced these types of tradeoffs, as in fiscal  year 2017, when it did not make $6.9 billion in required prefunding  payments for retiree health and pension benefits, stating that it lacked  sufficient cash to make those payments while ensuring it could continue  to provide service, and stating that it required sufficient cash reserves for  capital spending. While USPS officials noted that USPS must always  make prioritization decisions regarding capital spending, its financial  future may make such decisions more critical given its currently projected  increased capital spending. For example, unless USPS increases its  revenues or decreases other expenses, such prioritization decisions may  involve USPS undertaking less future capital spending than it currently  projects over the next 10 years. Further, even if USPS\u2019s financial situation  were to dramatically improve, USPS may not necessarily undertake more  capital spending than currently projected, because of significant other  business needs, such as funding operating expenses.

As discussed earlier, USPS\u2019s capital spending  processes require DARs to justify proposed capital projects with total  costs of $1 million or more. Specifically, internal USPS guidelines state  that DARs should identify the technological, operational, and integration  risks that could affect capital projects and any tradeoffs related to  potential alternatives to the proposed capital project. For example, we  reviewed one DAR for mail-processing equipment that explained that the  project has a low level of operational risk noting that the new equipment  will not require training for operators, thus avoiding potential costs and  delays associated with training. Another DAR we reviewed for a project  intending to improve the customer experience and reduce costs through  more efficient staffing at retail locations identified integration risks and  noted that the project's proposed deployment schedule might not allow  time for delays.

As a result, USPS can determine  an annual capital spending budget based on the most recent conditions,  including the most recent revenue forecasts, and consider possible  tradeoffs\u2014such as those between capital spending and other spending  needs such as operating expenses. Further, while the creation of a  capital-spending budget establishes capital-spending levels, the process  does not commit capital spending on any particular project.

USPS may approve less capital spending for  capital projects than budgeted for at the start of the year. Our analysis of  capital-spending cash outlays from fiscal year 2007 through 2017 shows  that on average, USPS spent about 18 percent less than was budgeted  for at the start of each year. According to USPS officials, capital  spending can be below budgeted levels for a variety of reasons. USPS  may shift strategic priorities based on business conditions and cancel or  delay some planned projects that it determines are no longer aligned with  its priorities. For example, USPS canceled a previously approved  centralized distribution facility project in Brooklyn, New York, and decided  to look for less costly alternatives to support the area\u2019s increased  package processing needs. Also, officials stated that projects could come  in below budget because of a reduction in project scope or because a  multi-year project falls behind schedule and has less cash outlays in a  given year than were planned.", "In other instances, USPS\u2019s capital-spending approval process provides  flexibility to re-allocate capital funds as USPS identifies and assesses  changing conditions that affect the organization, or when contingencies or  emergencies arise. For example, according to USPS officials, as USPS  monitors the economic indicators that affect its business, the indicators  may signal an increase in package volume. USPS might respond by  allocating more capital toward additional purchases of package-sorting  equipment. According to USPS officials, USPS\u2019s capital-spending  process also allows USPS to respond to contingencies. In fiscal year  2017, USPS approved capital spending to repair facilities in the U.S.  Virgin Islands damaged during Hurricane Maria. (See fig. 4.) In the event  that such unplanned projects arise to repair damages or are required for  safety, project sponsors can expedite the capital spending approval  process, such as by submitting an advance funding request to USPS.", "In addition to having processes to respond to organizational uncertainties,  we also found that USPS has processes for responding to the risks  affecting individual capital projects. According to USPS documentation,  capital projects with total costs of over $5 million are reviewed at certain  stages in their implementation to assess any changes, including changes  in the return-on-investment, timeline, and performance of the projects.  USPS may alter project specifications or time frames to respond to these  changes. During the implementation stage of some major capital projects,  such as the installation of mail-processing equipment, departments may  initially test a limited number of units with the option to request the  purchase of additional units if the tests are successful. Additionally, some  major capital projects, such as the replacement of USPS\u2019s delivery  vehicles, require acquisitions over multiple years, which, USPS officials  told us, can be used to limit risk. As mentioned earlier, USPS is planning  to replace its fleet by purchasing vehicles over a number of years,  potentially allowing it to capitalize on technological advances that may  develop over the time period.", "After a capital project is complete, USPS has a process for reviewing the  results as a way to inform and improve future capital-spending decisions,  including better addressing project risks. USPS\u2019s capital-spending  process requires USPS to evaluate capital projects with total costs over  $25 million after project completion, reviewing the cost, schedule, and  performance results of these projects. For example, in November 2017,  USPS discussed the results of two package processing and sorting  projects that experienced delays associated with accommodating new  equipment at the facilities due to design issues. As a result, USPS  recommended that project sponsors conduct more research about any  site-specific risks before submitting a DAR for future package processing  and sorting projects. In addition, USPS\u2019s Office of Inspector General  prepares an annual capital-project-compliance report that evaluates the  soundness of USPS\u2019s capital spending. According to USPS officials, the  organization considers the results of these reports and seeks to address  any resulting recommendations. For example, we reviewed  documentation explaining that, in response to one recent Office of  Inspector General recommendation, USPS stated it would revise its  capital spending guidance to define review and approval procedures,  validation, and compliance report requirements for all investments."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to USPS for review and comment.

For our second  objective, our scope was limited to assessing whether USPS had  designed processes; that is, we did not assess the quality of any analyses  that USPS conducted regarding risks or any determinations that USPS  made regarding capital-spending projects as this was beyond the scope  of our review. Such assessments are routinely conducted by the USPS  Office of Inspector General.", "To address USPS\u2019s planned capital spending over the next 10 years, we  reviewed USPS data on capital spending from fiscal years 2007 through  2017 and USPS documentation on projected capital spending from fiscal  years 2018 through 2028. In both cases, we focused on a fiscal year\u2019s  actual or projected capital-spending cash outlays\u2014or the amount of cash  spent on capital projects\u2014as opposed to capital-spending commitments  made in that fiscal year. For historical data, we used data from USPS\u2019s  annual budgets, known as Integrated Financial Plans, for fiscal years  2008 through 2018. Each annual budget contains data on actual capital  spending levels from prior fiscal years. The annual budgets generally  report capital spending in four broad categories: vehicles, facilities,  information technology and other, and mail-processing equipment.  Because the categories used in past annual budgets were not consistent,  we recategorized some years\u2019 spending to be consistent. Specifically, we  considered \u201cmail-processing equipment\u201d or \u201cequipment\u201d as part of \u201cmail- processing equipment.\u201d We considered \u201cinfrastructure and support,\u201d  \u201cinformation technology and other,\u201d and \u201ccustomer service and support  equipment\u201d as part of the \u201cinformation technology and other\u201d category.  The past budgets consistently used \u201cfacilities\u201d and \u201cvehicles\u201d categories.  We obtained input from USPS officials on our recategorizations. To  determine the reliability of these data, we reviewed the data for any  obvious errors, reviewed relevant documentation, and interviewed  officials. We determined that these data were sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of reporting on USPS\u2019s past capital spending.", "For information on USPS\u2019s projected capital spending from fiscal years  2018 through 2028 we reviewed USPS\u2019s 10-year capital-spending  forecast for those years, which USPS created in 2017. This 10-year  forecast is a projection of capital spending, but is not a commitment for  any level of investment. The 10-year forecast categorizes capital  spending projects into the following categories: construction and building  purchases, building improvements, mail processing equipment, vehicles,  capitalized software, customer service equipment, and postal support  equipment. For our analysis, we combined \u201cpostal support equipment,\u201d  \u201cinformation technology,\u201d and \u201ccustomer service equipment\u201d into one  overall \u201cinformation technology and other\u201d category, and \u201cconstruction  and building purchases\u201d and \u201cbuilding improvements\u201d into one overall  \u201cfacilities\u201d category. USPS officials agreed with this approach. To  determine the reliability of these data, we interviewed USPS officials,  reviewed data for any obvious errors, and reviewed relevant  documentation. We determined that these data were sufficiently reliable  for the purposes of providing information on USPS\u2019s projected capital  spending. In addition, we interviewed four USPS vice presidents in  charge of the departments that correspond with the four broad categories  of capital-spending investments about historic, ongoing, and projected  capital spending.", "We also selected and reviewed a non-generalizable sample of 14  Decision Analysis Reports (DAR)\u2014internal USPS documents used to  justify and obtain approval for some proposed capital-spending projects\u2014 of the 66 approved by USPS for fiscal year 2017 and part of fiscal year  2018. USPS requires DARs for all proposed capital spending projects  with a total project cost of at least $1 million. The DARs contain  information on, among other things, project specifications, purpose, risks  and tradeoffs, and timeframes. We reviewed the DARs for this and other  information; we did not review the quality of the analyses contained in the  DARs. We obtained a list of all approved DARs for fiscal years 2017 and  2018 and selected DARs of the two largest and two smallest capital  projects by total value in each of the four categories (i.e., vehicles,  facilities, information technology and other, and mail processing  equipment). Because the vehicles category had only two approved  DARs at the time we received the list of approved DARs from USPS, we  reviewed 14 DARs instead of 16. While the information from our reviews  cannot be generalized to all DARs, the information provides insights into  USPS\u2019s reasons for undertaking capital spending projects.", "To assess whether USPS has processes that support its ability to  address uncertainties and risks that affect its capital spending, we  reviewed USPS documentation, including USPS\u2019s policies and  procedures for capital spending, internal guidance documents, and others  related to processes that affect its capital spending. We identified criteria  for addressing uncertainties and risks, including those specific to capital  spending. Specifically, we identified criteria from the Committee of  Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission\u2019s (COSO)  Internal Control-Integrated Framework (the internal control standards  adopted by USPS) and the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s Capital  Programming Guide. COSO Principle 7 states, \u201cThe organization  identifies risks to the achievement of its objectives across the entity and  analyzes risks as a basis for determining how the risks should be  managed.\u201d Further, COSO Principle 9 states, \u201cThe organization identifies  and assesses changes that could significantly affect the system of  control.\u201d The Office of Management and Budget\u2019s Capital Programming  Guide element I.1.1 states, \u201cThe plan should also be consistent with the  level of future budgetary resources that will be available.\u201d We evaluated  USPS\u2019s processes that affect capital spending against these criteria to  determine whether USPS had designed processes to address  uncertainties and risks related to capital spending. We did not review the  capital spending projects USPS has undertaken to determine, for  example, if USPS made appropriate decisions regarding selected  projects. We also interviewed USPS officials regarding USPS\u2019s capital- spending processes. Specifically, we interviewed officials with USPS\u2019s  Capital Investment and Business Analysis Department; Finance and  Planning Department; Technical Analysis, Accounting, and Finance  Department; and the four vice presidents mentioned above about how  they address uncertainties and risks related to capital spending within  their departments.", "We conducted this performance audit from September 2017 to June 2018  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
