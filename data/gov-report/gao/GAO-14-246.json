Agency officials stated that the ICs' mission and appropriations inform priority-setting approaches. Some IC officials noted that because the costs of potential research projects generally exceed the available appropriation, the ICs must prioritize among research projects. In priority setting, IC officials reported taking into consideration scientific needs and opportunities, gaps in funded research, the burden of disease in a population, and public health need, such as an emerging public health threat like influenza that needs to be addressed. While each IC GAO examined had its own approach for setting priorities, they all considered the input of stakeholders, including the scientific community, and used some similar strategies. All five ICs developed strategic plans, though the process varied by IC. Some ICs also used annual planning activities in various forms, which then guided funding opportunity announcements. All five ICs also conducted reviews and evaluations of their research portfolios to ensure that their priorities align with scientific opportunities, research gaps, and emerging science. In addition to these efforts at the IC level, agency officials told GAO that the NIH Office of the Director provides leadership and coordinates priority setting activities, especially for those activities that involve multiple ICs.", "NIH reported funding levels that varied widely for the 40 different Research, Condition, and Disease Categorization system (RCDC) categories GAO examined that correspond to the leading causes of death and the most prevalent chronic conditions. For example, NIH reported actual fiscal year 2012 funding levels ranging from $13 million for projects in the fibromyalgia category to more than $5.6 billion for projects in the cancer category. Although these categories are part of NIH's RCDC, which is used to categorize the research activities across the agency, agency officials said that the system cannot estimate a total, non-duplicated amount of funding that is specific to a given disease or condition. This is because RCDC categories are neither mutually exclusive nor exhaustive. For example, projects may be included in multiple RCDC categories, some categories are related to each other and therefore some categories may also be included within another, and funding for all diseases is not captured in the system. While RCDC is NIH's official system for reporting research funding across the ICs, two of the five ICs that GAO reviewed\u2014the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases\u2014had their own systems for tracking their funding, which allowed them to provide more detailed information than that available from RCDC. For example, NCI has a publicly available website that specifies funding for more than 40 specific cancer types as well as almost 50 research topics that are not disease-specific. Funding for individual projects may be separated for specific studies into those cancer types.

NIAID staff also review their scientific areas  for the latest information on burden of illness and state of scientific  progress, which is used to inform the development of future initiatives.  According to agency officials, NIAID staff use this information, as well  as input from the scientific community, to prepare and present a  concept of an initiative to NIAID\u2019s National Advisory Council, which  reviews, comments on, and decides whether to approve the initiative.  Once an initiative has been approved, NIAID solicits research  applications through a request for application, a program  announcement, or a request for proposal.", "NIDDK uses an annual process that requires NIDDK scientific  program staff within the IC\u2019s divisions to review the research portfolio  and to identify research opportunities.

We then provided our list of diseases, conditions, and ICD- 10 codes with the corresponding RCDC categories to NIH for the  agency\u2019s review and concurrence. NIH officials confirmed most of our  matches. For some of the diseases and conditions, officials noted the  RCDC category that we identified was the closest match, but the category  was substantially broader than the RCDC category it was selected to  represent or it was substantially narrower than the RCDC category it was  selected to represent. In other cases, NIH officials noted that there was  not an RCDC category that was a close enough fit to the disease  category we were trying to represent.
