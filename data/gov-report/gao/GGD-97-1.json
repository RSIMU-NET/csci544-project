GAO also found that: (1) its review of retirement literature revealed a variety of possible explanations for why employers might prefer DC over DB plans if they decide to sponsor only one type of plan; (2) these factors included increasingly complex regulations for DB plans, a surge in the number of employers terminating DB plans to acquire capital assets, and employees' growing preference for pension benefits that they can retain when they change jobs; (3) the literature also noted that an employment shift has occurred away from industries in which employers traditionally favored DB plans toward industries in which employers favored DC plans; and (4) because the literature primarily addressed factors that influence private-sector decisionmaking on pension plan design, these factors may or may not be relevant to the federal government and other public employers."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In accordance with your interest in considering possible future changes to the structure of federal employee retirement plans, you asked that we develop information on the approaches private employers are using to provide retirement benefits to their employees and the extent to which these approaches may be changing.", "As agreed with the Subcommittee, this report is the first in a series of reports that we will be preparing to respond to your request.

Employers can provide these benefits using two basic types of plans\u2014defined benefit (DB) or defined contribution (DC) pension plans.", "For a DB plan, the employer determines retirement benefit amounts for individual employees using specific formulas that consider certain factors, such as age, years of service, and salary levels. Employers bear the full responsibility and risk of providing sufficient funding to guarantee that the benefits promised by the formulas will be paid. The amount an employer must contribute to a DB plan can vary from year-to-year depending on changes in areas such as workforce demographics or investment earnings.", "For a DC plan, the employer establishes an individual account for each eligible employee and generally promises to make a specified contribution to that account each year. Employee contributions are also often allowed or required. The employee\u2019s retirement benefits depend on the total of employer and employee contributions to the account as well as the investment gains and losses that have accumulated at the time of retirement. Therefore, the employee bears the risk of whether the funds available at retirement will provide a sufficient level of retirement income.", "Private employers are not required to provide their employees with pension benefits; however, those employers that do so must meet certain minimum legal standards. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) requires that private employers manage pension plan funds prudently and in the best interests of participants and their beneficiaries, that participants be informed of their rights and obligations, and that there be adequate disclosure of the plan\u2019s terms and activities. For DB plans only, ERISA created a federal insurance program financed primarily by employer-paid premiums to guarantee the payment of pension benefits when an underfunded DB plan is terminated.", "Administrative expenses for pension plans include fees for plan design, payroll deductions, recordkeeping, trustee services, regulatory compliance, investment management, and employee communications."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To provide the requested information, we used a research database of computerized IRS Form 5500 reports that is maintained by the Department of Labor (DOL). ERISA requires all private employers that sponsor pensions, regardless of their size or industry, to annually file a separate Form 5500 report for each of their pension plans. Each report is to include financial, participant, and actuarial data. Unlike other studies that tended to concentrate on the total number of each type of plan in existence, our study focused on the number of employers that used either or both types of pension plans.", "We did not independently verify the accuracy of the research database; however, both IRS and DOL check the data for accuracy and consistency.

The research database did not contain information on employers that did not offer any type of pension plan. We included only single-employer plans in our analyses, since the database did not indicate the number of companies that participated in multiemployer plans. For employers that offered both DC and DB plans, we could not determine whether these plans covered the same or different groups of employees. It is also important to recognize that the contribution and administrative expense data presented in this report are averages for large groups of employers. Thus, the data do not represent any individual employer\u2019s pension plan arrangements or practices nor do they represent the maximum allowable employee and employer contribution rates for DC plans. Also, pension plan experiences in the entire private sector may not be generalizable to the federal government.

Over this same period, the percentage of all employers that offered only DC pension plans increased from 68 to 88 percent. The percentage of employers that offered only DB plans decreased from 24 to 9 percent, and the percentage that offered both DC and DB plans decreased from 8 to 3 percent. Figure 1 shows the change in the percentage of employers offering each combination of pension plans from 1984 to 1993.", "The increase in the percentage of employers sponsoring only DC plans occurred across companies of all sizes. In 1984, the majority of employers with fewer than 500 employees offered only DC plans, while the majority of employers with 500 or more employees sponsored DB plans\u2014either alone or in combination with a DC plan. By 1993, the only employment-size categories where DB plans continued to be offered by the majority of companies were employers with 10,000 to 19,999 employees and 20,000 to 49,999 employees. Figures 2 and 3 show the percentage of employers offering the various types of pension plans by employer size for 1984 and 1993, respectively.", "The increase in the percentage of employers offering only DC plans occurred across all industries. For example, the number of employers in the services industry that sponsored pension plans increased from 183,908 in 1984 to 268,533 in 1993, and the percentage of those employers that offered only DC plans increased from 71 to 93 percent.

Accordingly, we did not determine the extent to which individual employers may have terminated and replaced their DB plans with DC plans. However, one study examined 11,950 employers that sponsored DB plans in 1985. For the 6,974 of these employers that filed a Form 5500 report in 1992, the study found that 1,449 (or about 21 percent) of the employers had terminated their DB plans and adopted or retained DC plans.", "Larger employers continued to use DB plans more extensively than smaller employers. From 1984 to 1993, an increasing proportion of the employers with 2,500 or more employees offered both DC and DB plans. In 1993, nearly half of these employers included a DB plan as part of their retirement package\u2014with or without a supplementary DC plan.

The average ratio for employers that sponsored only DB plans was 19.7. For employers that sponsored both DC and DB plans, the ratios were 0.6 and 58.8, respectively. These results suggest that most private employers did not require employees to contribute to their DB plans. Furthermore, employers contributed proportionately more to DC plans that were designed to provide primary pension benefits than they did to DC plans that supplemented the benefits of a DB plan.", "From 1988 to 1993, employers provided a declining proportion of the total contributions for DC plans and an increasing proportion of the total contributions for DB plans, regardless of whether they offered one or both types of plans. The ratio of employer-to-employee contributions decreased from approximately 3.8 to 1.8 for employers that sponsored only DC plans and, with considerable fluctuation during the intervening years, increased from 19.1 in 1988 to 19.7 in 1993 for employers that sponsored only DB plans. Similarly, for employers that sponsored both DC and DB plans, the ratio decreased from 0.8 to 0.6 for the DC plans and increased from 20.1 to 58.8 for the DB plans.

For employers that sponsored both DC and DB plans, the administrative expense per participant was $71 and $125, respectively. Therefore, a retirement benefits package that consisted of only a DC plan was the least expensive to administer, on average. These results also suggest that employers that sponsor both DC and DB plans may experience some administrative efficiencies compared with employers that offer only one type of pension plan. Although we did not analyze administrative expenses by employer size, the literature indicates that larger companies incur lower administrative expenses because of considerable economies of scale.", "From 1988 to 1993, the average reported administrative expense per participant remained fairly constant for both DC and DB plans.Consequently, growth in administrative expenses did not appear to explain why employers that already had a DB plan would shift to a DC plan. However, the lower administrative expense associated with DC versus DB plans might have been an influential factor for employers designing a retirement benefits package for the first time.

These factors included (1) changes in pension regulations and tax policy that may favor DC plans over DB plans, (2) increases in the stock and bond markets that may encourage employers to terminate DB plans to capture retirement fund assets that exceed plan liabilities, and (3) changes in workers\u2019 preferences that are based on their expectations of short tenures with several employers.", "Since its enactment in 1974, Congress has passed many laws that amended ERISA and increased the complexity of pension regulations. For example, employers must comply with certain minimum funding requirements and maximum funding limits, limits on plan participation by highly compensated individuals or owners, and time limits on how long employees must work before being entitled to pension benefits. Since ERISA was enacted, the plan termination insurance premiums paid by employers with DB plans have increased from $1 to $19 for each plan participant and an additional variable premium is required for underfunded plans. Some studies indicated that the increasing complexity of pension regulations was more burdensome for DB plans compared with DC plans\u2014particularly for smaller employers.", "Changes in tax policy may also have affected employers\u2019 choice of DC plans over DB plans. For example, in 1978, Congress added section 401(k) to the IRS Tax Code that allowed employers to establish DC plans to which employers and/or employees could contribute on a pretax basis and could defer taxes on earnings until funds are withdrawn from the plan. The number of 401(k) plans offered by employers that sponsored only DC plans increased from 13,610 in 1984 to 155,384 in 1993.", "During the 1980s, a strong stock market and higher long-term interest rates contributed to an increase in the number of overfunded DB plans.Employers can terminate an overfunded plan by purchasing annuities to satisfy the plan\u2019s current obligations and \u201creverting\u201d any excess assets back to the company. Some employers use the excess assets for nonpension purposes, such as investment in plant and equipment or retirement of long-term debt. The literature indicated that employers frequently replace terminated DB plans with either a new DB plan or DC plan; however, employers are not legally required to do so. From 1975 to 1988, employers terminated an average of 6,500 DB plans each year, although not all of these terminations were the result of a reversion.", "The rising stock and bond markets were also credited with enhancing the popularity of DC plans with workers who saw their pension account balances increase dramatically. Employees in DC plans are immediately entitled to their own contributions and any earnings on those contributions if they change employers. Moreover, employees in DC plans are entitled to the contributions made by their employers as well as the earnings on those contributions after a minimum period of employment (no more than 7 years). The literature suggests that some workers may prefer DC plans because they are easier to understand and workers can take their pension benefits with them if they were to change jobs.", "Some of the factors that may influence private employers to choose one type of plan over another are not relevant to public employers, including the federal government. For example, because governments are not taxpaying entities, they are not influenced by opportunities to reduce federal taxes on their revenues. Furthermore, governments that finance their pension plans on a pay-as-you-go basis have no opportunity to revert excess pension assets for other purposes.", "Several studies suggested that the reduction in the number of employers with DB plans was not related to any particular policy considerations, but resulted largely because of shifts in the U.S. labor market. Specifically, during the 1980s, employment grew in the services industry where employers favored DC plans, while employment declined in the manufacturing industry where employers traditionally sponsored DB plans. Other studies indicate that many employers will continue to use DB plans as a human resource tool to attract workers with certain characteristics, reward long tenured employees, and achieve desired employee retention patterns. Furthermore, as the workforce ages and retirement becomes imminent for more older workers, employees may begin to place more value on DB plans as they evaluate the sufficiency of their DC accounts. In response to these considerations, an increasing number of employers are adopting hybrid retirement programs that combine the features of DC plans and DB plans."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We requested comments on a draft of this report from the Secretary of Labor or his designee.

The objectives of our review were to determine how many private employers offered a retirement program consisting of (1) only defined contribution (DC) plans, (2) only defined benefit (DB) plans, or (3) a combination of the two types of plans; the average employer and employee contributions to the plans;the average administrative expenses charged to the plans; and the factors that may influence private sector employers when they decide to offer DC plans versus DB plans as a part of their employees\u2019 retirement package.", "To accomplish the first three objectives, we used a research database of computerized IRS Form 5500 reports maintained by the Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration of the Department of Labor (DOL).

However, IRS edits the reports by checking addition and consistency on financial and other record items and corresponds with filers to obtain corrected data before providing the computerized data to DOL.

According to a DOL representative, plans that reported 100-percent employee participation tended to be ones where employers make automatic contributions to the plan on behalf of their employees.
