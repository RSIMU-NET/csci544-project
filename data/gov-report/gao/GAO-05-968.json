To qualify for Medicaid, individuals' assets (income and resources) must be below certain limits. Because long-term care services can be costly, those who pay privately may quickly deplete their assets and become eligible for Medicaid. In some cases, individuals might transfer assets to spouses or other family members to become financially eligible for Medicaid. Those who transfer assets for less than fair market value may be subject to a penalty period that can delay their eligibility for Medicaid. GAO was asked to provide data on transfers of assets. GAO reviewed (1) the level of assets held and transferred by the elderly, (2) methods used to transfer assets that may result in penalties, (3) how states determined financial eligibility for Medicaid long-term care, and (4) guidance the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has provided states regarding the treatment of asset transfers. GAO analyzed data on levels of assets and cash transfers made by the elderly from the 2002 Health and Retirement Study (HRS), a national panel survey; analyzed states' Medicaid applications; and interviewed officials from nine states about their eligibility determination processes."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In 2002, over 80 percent of the approximately 28 million elderly households (those where at least one person was aged 65 or over) had annual incomes of $50,000 or less, and about one-half had nonhousing resources, which excluded the primary residence, of $50,000 or less. About 6 million elderly households (22 percent) reported transferring cash, with amounts that varied depending on the households' income and resource levels. In general, the higher the household's asset level, the more likely it was to have transferred cash during the 2 years prior to the HRS study. Overall, disabled elderly households--who are at higher risk of needing long-term care--were less likely to transfer cash than nondisabled elderly households. Certain methods to reduce assets, such as spending money to pay off debt or make home modifications, do not result in penalty periods. Other methods, such as giving gifts, transferring property ownership, and using certain financial instruments, could result in penalty periods, depending on state policy and the specific arrangements made. None of the nine states GAO contacted tracked or analyzed data on asset transfers or penalties applied. These states required applicants to provide documentation of assets but varied in the amount of documentation required and the extent to which they verified the assets reported. These states generally relied on applicants' self-reporting of transfers of assets, and officials from these states informed GAO that transfers not reported were difficult to identify. To help states comply with requirements related to asset transfers, CMS has issued guidance primarily through the State Medicaid Manual. CMS released a special study in 2005 to help states address the issue of using annuities as a means of sheltering assets. Additionally, CMS officials provide ongoing technical assistance in response to state questions, but noted the challenge of issuing guidance applicable to all situations given the constantly changing methods used to transfer assets in an attempt to avoid a penalty period. In commenting on a draft of this report, CMS noted the complexity of the current law and commented that data on the precise extent and cost of asset transfers to the Medicaid program have been difficult to gather."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["As people age, their ability to carry out certain basic physical functions  declines, increasing the likelihood that they will need long-term care. In  2003, nearly half of the nation\u2019s total expenditures of about $183 billion for  long-term care, including nursing home payments, were paid for by the  Medicaid program, the joint federal-state health care financing program  that covers certain categories of low-income individuals. Medicaid  expenditures for long-term care in 2004 were about $93 billion out of total  Medicaid expenditures of $295 billion. With the aging of the population  and the likely increase in demand for long-term care, federal Medicaid  spending is expected to more than double in size over the next 10 years.", "To qualify for Medicaid coverage for long-term care services, individuals  must meet certain financial and functional eligibility criteria. To meet the  financial eligibility criteria, individuals must have assets that fall below  established standards, which vary by state but are within standards set by  the federal government. Assets include income, which is anything received  during a calendar month that is used or could be used to meet food,  clothing, or shelter needs; and resources, which are anything owned, such  as savings accounts, stocks, or property, that can be converted to cash.  Not all assets are counted in determining financial eligibility for  Medicaid\u2014for example, states generally exclude the value of an  individual\u2019s primary residence. Because certain types of long-term care\u2014 particularly nursing home care\u2014are costly (estimated by some to average  over $70,000 a year for a private-pay patient), individuals who pay for an  extended stay in a nursing home can quickly deplete their assets and  subsequently qualify for Medicaid. In some cases, individuals might divest  themselves of their assets\u2014for example, by transferring them to their  spouses or other family members\u2014in order to establish financial eligibility  for Medicaid long-term care coverage. However, those who transfer assets  for less than fair market value during a specified \u201clook-back\u201d period\u2014the  period of time before application for Medicaid in which asset transfers are  reviewed\u2014may incur a penalty\u2014a period during which they are ineligible  for Medicaid coverage for long-term care services. The look-back period is  either 36 months or 60 months, depending on the type of asset. The  penalty period begins at approximately the time assets were transferred.", "Opinions differ over the extent to which individuals transfer assets to  qualify for Medicaid coverage for long-term care. Some contend that asset  transfers are prevalent and that individuals, on the advice of elder law  attorneys, transfer assets that are sometimes significant in order to qualify  for Medicaid long-term care coverage, thus substantially increasing  Medicaid costs. Others contend that, while such transfers may occur, they  are not a large-scale problem that unduly increases Medicaid program  costs and that individuals expecting to need nursing home care tend to  save more assets than others in order to pay for their care. Evidence on  the extent to which individuals transfer assets to become eligible for  Medicaid long-term care is generally limited and often based on anecdotes.", "The President\u2019s fiscal year 2006 budget proposed to save an estimated   $1.5 billion over 5 years by tightening existing rules related to asset  transfers.

(See app. I for more information about the HRS.)  We used data from this survey to estimate the (1) level of assets (both  income and resources) held by elderly households (defined as those in  which at least one member is aged 65 or over), (2) extent to which they  transferred cash, and (3) amount transferred. Our analysis includes data  from all elderly households; we did not assess whether the respondents  had or were seeking Medicaid coverage. Because the HRS only addressed  cash transfers\u2014cash provided to relatives or other individuals\u2014our  analysis understates the extent and amount of all transfers by excluding  transfers of property and other types of assets. Since the HRS did not  inquire about the reason for the cash transfers, no conclusions can be  drawn regarding the extent to which the survey respondents transferred  cash for purposes of establishing Medicaid eligibility for long-term care. In  addition to analyzing the survey data, we collected and analyzed Medicaid  applications in use during June and July 2005 for long-term care, from all  50 states and the District of Columbia. We reviewed the federal laws  related to Medicaid and asset transfers, as well as related CMS guidance.  We also interviewed officials from 9 states regarding Medicaid eligibility  determination practices, including the process for identifying whether  applicants had transferred assets. To select states, we assessed the  prevalence of five factors in each state; on the basis of this assessment,  we grouped the states into three clusters (low, medium, and high) based  on the prevalence of the five factors. We then selected 3 states from each  cluster based on randomly generated numbers, for a total sample of 9. The  9 states in the sample were Arkansas, District of Columbia, Florida,  Hawaii, Montana, Ohio, Oregon, South Carolina, and Wisconsin.

Once eligible for  Medicaid, individuals can receive basic health and long-term care services,  as outlined by each state and subject to minimum federal requirements.  Long-term care includes many types of services needed when a person has  a physical disability, a mental disability, or both.

Within broad federal standards,  states determine the need for long-term care services by assessing  limitations in an applicant\u2019s ability to carry out ADLs and IADLs. Most  individuals requiring Medicaid long-term care services have become  eligible for Medicaid in one of three ways: (1) through participation in the  Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program, (2) by incurring medical  costs that reduce their income and qualify them for Medicaid, or (3) by  having long-term care needs that require nursing home or other  institutional care.", "The SSI program provides cash assistance to aged, blind, or disabled  individuals with limited income and resources. Those who are enrolled in  SSI generally are eligible for Medicaid.  Individuals who incur high medical costs may \u201cspend down\u201d into Medicaid  eligibility because these expenses are deducted from their countable  income. Spending down may bring their income below the state- determined income eligibility limit. Such individuals are referred to as  \u201cmedically needy.\u201d As of 2000, 36 states had a medically needy option,  although not all of these states extended this option to the aged and  disabled or to those needing nursing home care.  Individuals can qualify for Medicaid if they reside in nursing facilities or  other institutions in states that have elected to establish a special income  level under which individuals with incomes up to 300 percent of the SSI  benefit ($1,737 per month in 2005) are Medicaid-eligible. Individuals  eligible under this option must apply all of their income, except for a small  personal needs allowance, toward the cost of nursing home care. The  National Association of State Medicaid Directors reported that, as of 2003,  at least 38 states had elected this option.", "SSI policy serves as the basis for Medicaid policy on the characterization  of assets\u2014income and resources. Income is something, paid either in cash  or in-kind, received during a calendar month that is used or could be used  to meet food, clothing, or shelter needs; resources are cash or things that  are owned that can be converted to cash.

The community spouse may retain an amount equal to one- half of the couple\u2019s combined countable resources, up to a state-specified  maximum resource level. If one-half of the couple\u2019s combined countable  resources is less than a state-specified minimum resource level, then the  community spouse may retain resources up to the minimum level.

Generally, the look-back period is 36 months. If an asset  transfer for less than fair market value is detected, the individual is  ineligible for Medicaid long-term care coverage for a period of time, called  the penalty period.

According to several elder law  attorneys and some state officials we contacted, one of the first methods  Medicaid applicants use to reduce assets is to spend their money, often by  paying off existing debt, such as a mortgage or credit card bills, or by  making purchases. When such purchases and payments convert a  countable resource, such as money in the bank, to noncountable  resources, such as household goods, they effectively reduce the assets that  are counted when determining Medicaid eligibility. Common purchases  mentioned included renovating a home to make it more accessible for  persons with disabilities, repairing or replacing items such as a roof or  carpeting, prepaying burial arrangements, buying a home, or having dental  work done. Elder law attorneys explained that once individuals are  Medicaid-eligible, they and their families will have limited means.  Therefore, they advise these individuals to update, renovate, repair, or  replace old or deteriorating items such as homes and cars to reduce the  need for maintenance and repairs in the future. No penalty is associated  with paying a debt or making a purchase as long as the individual receives  something of roughly the same value in return.", "Another method married individuals use that does not result in a penalty  period is seeking to raise the community spouse\u2019s resource allowance  above a state\u2019s maximum level, which reduces the amount of income or  resources considered available to the spouse applying for Medicaid  coverage. States establish, under federal guidelines, a maximum amount  of resources that a community spouse is allowed to retain. In general, the  remaining resources are deemed available to be used to pay for the  institutionalized spouse\u2019s long-term care needs. In addition, if the  community spouse\u2019s income is less than the state\u2019s minimum needs  allowance, the state can choose to make up the shortfall by   (1) transferring income from the institutionalized spouse or (2) allowing  the community spouse to keep resources above the resource allowance so  that the additional funds can be invested to generate more income. Under  the latter approach, the community spouse may be able to retain a  significant amount of resources in order to yield the allowable amount of  income. For example, a community spouse might ask to retain a savings  account with $300,000 and an annual interest rate of 2 percent that would  yield an additional $500 in income per month."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Methods to Reduce Assets Could Delay Medicaid Coverage for Long-Term Care Services", "paragraphs": ["Some of the other methods elderly individuals use to reduce their  countable assets could result in a penalty period and thus could delay  Medicaid coverage for long-term care services, according to the elder law  attorneys and state and federal officials we contacted. Whether or not an  asset reduction method results in a penalty period depends on the specific  arrangements made and the policies of the state. Therefore, the extent to  which each of the following methods is used is likely to vary by state.", "Gifts. Under this method, an individual gives some or all assets to another  individual as a gift, for example, by giving his or her children a cash gift.  Although this is probably the simplest method to reduce assets, some elder  law attorneys told us that this method would be one of the last things a  person would want to do. Not only would the individual lose control of his  or her assets, but giving a gift would likely be a transfer for less than fair  market value and therefore result in a penalty period. As with other asset  transfers, if individuals can prove that they gave away their assets  exclusively for a purpose other than qualifying for Medicaid long-term care  coverage, or if the transfer is to a spouse or a disabled child, then there  would be no penalty. Additionally, if a state treats each transfer as a  separate event and does not impose penalty periods for time periods  shorter than 1 month, then transfers for amounts less than the average  monthly private-pay rate for nursing home care in that state do not result  in a penalty period. Because the penalty period begins at approximately  the date of asset transfer, individuals that meet Medicaid income eligibility  requirements can give away about half of their resources and use their  remaining resources to pay privately for long-term care during which time  any penalty period would expire. This is often referred to as the \u201chalf a  loaf\u201d strategy because it preserves at least half of the individual\u2019s  resources.", "Financial Instruments. Some financial instruments, namely annuities  and trusts, have been used to reduce countable assets to enable  individuals to qualify for Medicaid. Annuities, which pay a regular income  stream over a defined period of time in return for an initial payment of  principal, may be purchased to provide a source of income for retirement.  According to a survey of state Medicaid offices, annuities have become a  common method for individuals to reduce countable resources for the  purpose of becoming eligible for Medicaid because they are used to  convert countable resources, such as money in the bank, to a resource  that is not counted, and a stream of income. If converting the resource to  an annuity results in individuals\u2019 having countable resources below the  state\u2019s financial eligibility requirements, then these individuals can become  eligible for Medicaid if their income, including the income stream from the  annuity, is within the Medicaid income requirements for the state in which  they live. Married individuals can use their joint resources to purchase an  annuity for the sole benefit of the community spouse. Since a community  spouse\u2019s income is not counted in a Medicaid eligibility determination, an  annuity effectively reduces the countable assets of the applicant. Annuities  must be actuarially sound\u2014that is, the expected return on the annuity  must be commensurate with the reasonable life expectancy of the  beneficiary\u2014or they are considered a transfer of assets for less than fair  market value and result in a penalty. Trusts are arrangements in which a  grantor transfers property to a trustee with the intention that it be held,  managed, or administered by the trustee for the benefit of the grantor or  certain designated individuals. The use of trusts as a method of gaining  Medicaid eligibility for long-term care services was addressed in 1993  legislation. The law and associated CMS guidance indicate how assets  held in a trust, as well as the income generated by a trust, are to be  counted in the Medicaid eligibility process. According to CMS, since this  legislation was enacted, the use of trusts as a Medicaid asset reduction  method has declined.", "Transfer of Property Ownership. Medicaid allows individuals to  transfer ownership of their home, without penalty, to certain relatives,  including a spouse or a minor child (under age 21). Other transfers of a  home or other property within the look-back period may result in a  penalty period if they were for less than fair market value. For example,  individuals might transfer ownership of their home while retaining a \u201clife  estate,\u201d which would give them the right to possess and use the property  for the duration of their lives. According to the CMS State Medicaid  Manual, this would be a transfer for less than fair market value and thus  would result in a penalty period.", "Personal Services Contract or Care Agreement. Personal services  contracts or care agreements are arrangements in which an individual  pays another person, often an adult child, to provide certain services.  Based on CMS guidance, relatives can be legitimately paid for care they  provide, but there is a presumption that services provided without charge  at the time they were rendered were intended to be provided without  compensation. Under this presumption, payments provided for services in  the past would result in a penalty period.    \u201cJust Say No\u201d Method. Under this method, the institutionalized spouse  transfers all assets to the community spouse, which is permitted under the  law. The community spouse then refuses to make any assets available to  support the institutionalized spouse and retains all of the couple\u2019s assets.  In turn, the institutionalized spouse may seek Medicaid coverage for long- term care. Whether this method results in a delay in Medicaid coverage  for long-term care services depends on the policies of the individual state.", "Promissory Notes. A promissory note is a written, unconditional  agreement, usually given in return for goods, money loaned, or services  rendered, whereby one party promises to pay a certain sum of money at a  specified time (or on demand) to another party. According to CMS and  state officials, some individuals have given assets to their children in  return for a promissory note as a means to reduce their countable assets.  For example, we were told of a case in which a mother gave her daughter  money in return for a promissory note with a schedule for repayments.  Although the note was scheduled to be repaid during the mother\u2019s  expected lifetime, the payment arrangements called for the child to repay  only the interest until the final payment, when the entire principal was  due.

For example, one state  took action to try to deter multiple small transfers by adding the amount of  the transfers together, under certain circumstances, for purposes of  calculating the penalty period. According to this state\u2019s officials,  however, some attorneys had advised their clients to transfer very small  amounts of money in consecutive months and make one final transfer of a  significant amount before applying for Medicaid.

In some cases, the use of  annuities results in individuals qualifying for Medicaid more quickly.

For example, CMS officials  cited the use of personal care agreements, where the individual applying  for Medicaid long-term care coverage hires a family member to perform  services, as a practice that at one time was frequently used to transfer  assets. In some cases, these agreements paid exorbitant fees for the  services provided, and CMS officials provided technical assistance to  states to help them limit the use of such agreements, at which point the  practice diminished in use.
