Five categories of attributes can help an organization be more resilient: robust emergency planning, flexible organizational assets that can be accessed during times of change, leadership capacity distributed through the organization, a committed and skilled workforce, and strong relationships with internal networks and outside organizations. Although each of these categories is important, the characteristics of whatever disruption an organization faces may make some attributes more valuable than others. In its emergency planning, IRS has learned from experiences requiring organizational resilience. For example, during the peak operations of the 2008 filing season, the economic stimulus legislation required that the IRS process stimulus payments totaling $94 billion. Through adjustments to the workforce, IRS was able to implement the change and delivered a generally successful filing season, while making key trade-offs. Although the IRS has learned from past events, its current test and exercise strategy is limited. Functional or full-scale exercises--which are not part of IRS's strategy-- provide more realistic conditions and a better experience to prepare the leadership and emergency personnel to contend with an actual event. Demonstrating the ways that IRS has flexible organizational assets that can be accessed during times of change, IRS strategically has made some operations redundant, which allows work to be shifted between offices when needed. The IRS has also exhibited the capability to use seasonal workers to increase its workforce after a disruption, as was the case in the support it provided to the Federal Emergency Management Agency after Hurricane Katrina. In building leadership and a committed workforce, the IRS has numerous formal training and development initiatives to build the leadership capability of both its management team as well as its non supervisory employees. While IRS employees understand how their work contributes to the IRS's goals and priorities, currently less than half of IRS employees believe that agency leaders and managers generate motivation and commitment in the workforce. A number of IRS initiatives are now in place to address this issue, including coaching of managers based on employee feedback survey data and outreach by managers to IRS employees. Lastly, IRS is highly networked both within and outside of IRS, which provides opportunities for accessing additional resources after a disruption. IRS has requirements for including internal stakeholders in tests and exercises. When IRS has involved external stakeholders in tests and exercises, it has proven useful, but this practice is neither formalized nor widespread."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The functioning of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is vital to the overall  operations of government and the economic health of the nation.

We selected 11 academic and practitioner experts to interview  based on their publications, contributions to the field of organizational  resilience, and frequent citation by other experts. Using an iterative  process with these experts, we developed a list of 21 attributes which the  experts associated with organizational resilience. We assigned these  attributes to five broad categories: emergency planning, organizational  flexibility, leadership, workforce commitment, and networks. To examine  the evidence of organizational resilience among IRS\u2019s business operating  divisions and the challenges and opportunities that IRS faces in becoming  more resilient, we reviewed IRS policies and manuals, observed the  operations of the Joint Operations Center and the Processing Center  during a site visit to IRS\u2019s Atlanta campus, observed the IRS Emergency  Management and Preparedness Working Group, completed an analysis of  IRS employee survey data, and interviewed IRS officials from headquarters  and each of the four business units.", "We conducted this performance audit from January 2008 to April 2009, in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

Both the Congress and executive  branch agencies have addressed resilience in relation to the importance of  the recovery of the nation\u2019s critical infrastructure from damage.  Accordingly, most of the current focus is on assets, systems, and networks  rather than agencies or organizations. In February 2006, the Task Force of  the Homeland Security Advisory Council defined resiliency as \u201cthe  capability of a system to maintain its functions and structure in the face of  internal and external change and to degrade gracefully when it must.\u201d  Later in 2006, the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s National  Infrastructure Protection Plan\u2014again focusing on critical infrastructure,  not agencies\u2014defined resilience as \u201cthe capability of an asset, system, or  network to maintain its function during or to recover from a terrorist  attack or other incident.\u201d In May 2008, the House Committee on  Homeland Security held a series of hearings focusing on resilience at  which government and private sector representatives, while agreeing on  the importance of the concept, presented a variety of definitions and  interpretations of resilience.

A highly resilient  organization is identified by the speed and agility it demonstrates in  achieving a return to its normal state (or new normal state) and its  resulting enhanced ability to respond to future disruptions.", "To make our definition of organizational resilience more practical and  observable, we identified 21 attributes particularly associated with  resilience and assigned them to five related categories.

For example, in 2004, the Federal Emergency  Management Agency\u2019s (FEMA) Hurricane Pam exercise simulated a  category 3 hurricane. In the exercise scenario, 15 to 20 feet of water  inundated New Orleans. This scenario was similar to the actual conditions  of Hurricane Katrina. Based on this exercise, FEMA was able to implement  some strategies which proved helpful during Hurricane Katrina, such as  FEMA\u2019s working with hospital and university officials to create temporary  medical operations around the state. However, FEMA\u2019s exercise also  identified other problems that it did not address, such as the need to plan  for evacuating those with special needs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Organizational Flexibility", "paragraphs": ["A resilient organization has a workforce that can respond to a range of  disruptions with appropriate purpose, initiative, and comfort with change.  One aspect of organizational flexibility is an ability to accept change as a  learning opportunity. For example, the 9/11 Commission report criticized  the Federal Aviation Administration for failing to consider in its planning  the possibility of certain types of terrorist attacks. Specifically, the  commission determined that if the agency had examined a possible suicide  hijacking and reviewed existing security provisions, they could have  identified vulnerabilities. According to the commission, agencies tend to  accept the status quo, and accept that efforts to identify or fix certain  vulnerabilities are too costly, controversial, or disruptive to fix. This  inability to tackle necessary change can leave an organization with  unaddressed vulnerabilities, as was the case with the Federal Aviation  Administration.", "Additionally, knowing when to change rules helped give federal agencies  access to additional resources during the Year 2000 (Y2K) Computing  Challenge. Specifically, increased latitude with human capital practices in  the federal government allowed agencies to access a larger pool of skilled  employees that could be allocated as needs arose. The Office of Personnel  Management recognized that personnel would need to be increased to  meet Y2K compliance and provided additional, more flexible hiring  authorities for agencies who needed employees to work on the  conversion. This included changing some authorities for re-hiring federal  retirees, exceptions on limitations on premium pay, and providing  retention allowances.

Additionally, when  leadership abilities are distributed broadly through the workforce, an  organization is more likely to be resilient. For example, the Senate  Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee found that, after  Hurricane Katrina, the Coast Guard had empowered front-line leaders to  make decisions when they needed to be made, which it found was perhaps  more important to their resilience than their regular training. Also, once it  was known that the September 11 hijackers entered the United States on  valid visas, the Department of State devolved leadership authority by  empowering consular staff to distinguish legitimate visitors from potential  terrorists through antiterrorism training, access to databases with names  of potential terrorists, foreign language training, and more staff to handle  the workload."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Workforce Commitment", "paragraphs": ["Within a workforce that is committed to the organization, individuals are  motivated to make significant personal investments and provide the  knowledge that may be necessary for organizational success following a  disruption.

Another key aspect of this category is a workforce with the  needed skills to meet the organization\u2019s mission.

For example, having dependable connections will  likely expand and expedite an organization\u2019s access to resources when the  organization is faced with a disruption. Specifically, being aware of  interdependencies, knowing when reinforcement is needed, and being able  to communicate among interdependent units can give an organization an  extended reach for information, resources, and advice. Furthermore, an  organization\u2019s knowledge of its supply chain interdependencies can help  identify vulnerabilities, which can inform risk assessments and emergency  planning. For example, after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001,  many companies in the financial sector found that they relied on the same  electronic data system backup sites, which were also affected by the  attacks. As a result, key institutions realized that their individual plans for  preparedness for disasters or other crises significantly affected others,  both directly and indirectly. Accordingly, the Securities and Exchange  Commission recommended that financial institutions explore the  usefulness of coordinated testing of plans. Additionally, the Y2K  challenge was met through the collaborative efforts of the Congress, the  administration, federal agencies, state and local governments, and the  private sector. Had any of these sectors failed to take the Y2K problem  seriously, neglected to remedy computer systems, or failed to work  together with partners on common issues such as contingency planning,  critical services could have been disrupted.", "Although these five categories of attributes contribute to organizational  resilience, all disruptions are individual situations and even a relatively  resilient organization may not be able to restore operations under certain  circumstances. Furthermore, during a disruption, some attributes may  prove to be more important than others. For example, IRS found that, after  the 2006 flood of IRS headquarters, IRS did not have to activate its  headquarters continuity of operations plan. Alternate work space was  quickly made available for all headquarters employees, so identifying  critical personnel, a required step of continuity of operations planning,  was much less important. Additionally, with many attributes, excess of a  positive attribute becomes negative.

After Hurricanes Katrina  and Rita in August and September 2005, IRS deployed more than 5,000  employees at its call sites to help register disaster victims with FEMA.  During the response effort, IRS officials estimated that IRS staff may have  handled more than 50 percent of FEMA\u2019s calls. In order to fill this  increased need for capacity, IRS expanded the size of its workforce by  bringing back about 4,000 seasonal employees, who are typically hired to  assist with the tax filing season. IRS completed a similar service for  FEMA during Hurricanes Ike and Gustav in 2008, and was able to  incorporate lessons learned from the response to Hurricanes Katrina and  Rita. Specifically, during the response to Katrina and Rita, IRS employees  were able to log into either the IRS system or the FEMA system but not  quickly able to transition between the two to serve the needs of the  individual callers. After this experience, IRS\u2019s information technology staff  identified ways for IRS employees to toggle between the two systems and  thus work where demand was greatest.", "IRS implemented lessons from past stimulus payments and delivered a  generally successful tax filing season. During the peak of the 2008  taxpayer filing season, IRS also had to process payments to taxpayers as  directed by the 2008 economic stimulus legislation. IRS processed  stimulus payments totaling $94 billion and handled more than twice as  many calls from individuals looking for assistance than they received in  2007. In addition, IRS processed almost 9 million \u201ceconomic stimulus  only\u201d tax returns from individuals who would not otherwise have had to  file a return. Because many of these individuals had never filed a return,  the error rate on these returns was higher than usual. Because of the  timing of the economic stimulus package, IRS did not have time to hire,  conduct background checks for, and train additional staff to handle the  increased volume of telephone calls for taxpayer assistance. Instead, IRS  maximized the use of its workforce by asking its compliance staff to  answer incoming calls from taxpayers about the stimulus. IRS knew the  adjustments that it would have to make to its workforce based on its  experience implementing past economic stimulus bills. As a result, even  with this increased workload, IRS was also able to deliver a generally  successful filing season. Nevertheless IRS had to make trade-offs in other  key areas. As a result of decisions to shift staff from collection cases to  telephone assistance, IRS estimated that its costs and foregone revenues  would reach up to $960 million.", "IRS has been generally successful in the face of past disruptions. However  valuable these experiences have been, though, they can not provide  experiences for all possible disruptions nor provide experience to all IRS  employees. For example, an influenza pandemic, in which a large portion  of the workforce could be absent from work for extended periods, would  entail a different type of response from the experiences required by past  events.

Third, key emergency response personnel from  each business unit are required to complete a tabletop exercise in which  they familiarize themselves with the business resumption plan, their roles  within the plan, and the steps they would take in case of an emergency.  Participants in the tabletop exercise then walk through possible scenarios  to discuss ways they would respond. Last, in large geographic areas,  emergency personnel from multiple business units participate together in  an integrated tabletop exercise. The goal of the integrated tabletop  exercise is to provide a better understanding of how emergency response  personnel from different organizations work together and identify the  required time needed for resumption and recovery activities.", "The tabletop exercises\u2014while required agencywide since September  2006\u2014are not regularly conducted. TIGTA found that more than half of  the business resumption plans they sampled had not been tested through  tabletop exercises in calendar year 2007. In addition, IRS officials noted  that the tabletop exercises are not always well designed. For example,  they said that one tabletop exercise presented so many scenario events  that participants found the exercise to be unrealistic and, during the  exercise, chose to decrease the number of scenario events and the  duration of the exercise. In response to the need to improve exercises  across IRS and implement new requirements from the Federal Continuity  Directives, IRS assembled its Emergency Management and Preparedness  Working Group, which coordinates emergency activities among its  business units, for a 2-day workshop. With the goal of reducing the  variation in the quality of the tabletop exercises, the workshop leaders  discussed and encouraged sharing among all the participants of how to  prepare and conduct successful tabletop exercises. Headquarters has  also recently made additional resources available to assist the business  units with implementing the tabletop exercises. For example, they recently  established the Incident Management Business Resumption Group as a  resource available to the business units to plan and conduct training,  testing, and exercises.", "In addition to tabletop exercises, FEMA has identified and recommended  two additional types of tests and exercises:    Functional exercise: fully simulated interactive exercise that tests the  capability of an organization to respond to a simulated event.

Accordingly, he thought that it would  be better to initially implement these tests on a limited pilot basis.", "According to the experts we interviewed, some of the benefits of a  functional or full-scale exercise may be accomplished with the investment  of fewer resources, by simply making routine drills more stressful by  taking steps such as withholding an expected resource. For example, one  IRS campus held a fire drill in which use of cell phones was prohibited.  This experience taught employees to practice different modes of  communication and to use \u201crunners\u201d to spread information among  employees.

Specifically, to reduce unneeded capacity caused by  the increase in the number of taxpayers submitting tax returns  electronically, IRS is in the process of consolidating its total number of  paper processing centers. However, in considering the optimal number of  paper processing centers to retain for individual returns, IRS officials used  an analysis of the potential effects, in the face of an emergency, of losing  some campus redundancies. Based on this analysis, IRS will keep three\u2014 rather than two\u2014individual tax return sites open. When combined with  two paper processing centers for small business tax returns, IRS will have  a total of five centers that process paper tax forms, making it better able,  in its view, to maintain the degree of flexibility that it needs for resilience.", "In other IRS operations that do not require as much access to IRS  equipment and facilities, distributed capacity is achieved through moving  work among a dispersed workforce. To move work among noncampus  employees\u2014who typically work in field offices or on site with a  taxpayer\u2014the business units have developed electronic case management  files and have given employees access to laptops so that work can be  completed from any site. This is important because, in many cases, the  work of the noncampus employees is highly specialized, and accordingly,  IRS officials said that they preferred to keep workload within a business  unit after a disruption rather than redistributing it to other business units.", "In contrast, the call center operations are routinely shifted among  individuals\u2014located at 26 call sites nationwide\u2014who respond to taxpayer  questions. The Joint Operations Center, located at the Atlanta campus,  routes incoming calls for taxpayer assistance to available assistors. This  center monitors the number of calls and customer waiting times and  distributes calls across its nationwide network of call centers.

Participants can learn about and try manager competencies without  committing to a position, and managers can identify talented future  managers without promising every participant a manager position. After  completing a program, interested participants are selected for positions on  a competitive basis. Not only are these programs intended to help address  IRS\u2019s projected need for managers, they allow nonmanagers to be trained  in leadership skills, which distributes leadership skills throughout the IRS  workforce and could be helpful in assisting IRS during a disruption. For  the past five years, the IRS Commissioner and Oversight Board have  received quarterly updates on the percent of managers completing these  programs in a timely manner.

We have  reported that an explicit alignment of employee expectations with broader  organizational goals is a defining feature of an effective performance  management system in high performing organizations. We have noted that  these organizations use their performance management systems to  improve performance by helping individuals see the connection between  their daily activities and organizational goals, and this type of system  encourages individuals to focus on their roles and responsibilities to help  meet their goals. Accordingly, IRS employees have communicated  through employee interviews and surveys that they know their roles in the  organization\u2019s mission.

IRS defines employee engagement as the degree  of employees\u2019 motivation, commitment, and involvement in the mission of  the organization, and has created IRS-wide annual targets to increase  engagement scores. Managers of workgroups that receive a score in the  bottom 10 percent of all IRS workgroups are automatically enrolled in the  Leadership Coaching Program. (See table 1 for details.) The coaching  program is intended to give these managers greater tools for improving or  addressing employee concerns. Managers in all four IRS business units  broadly praised the program.

They  mentioned a past practice that included an additional level of screening  before hiring employees, and asked that management explain why this  screening was no longer in place. This question was entered into ES  Tracker and elevated for management to address. Through ES Tracker,  employees have also shared new and useful technologies to make work  more efficient and improve taxpayer relations. For example, workgroups  identified the need for financial market data terminals which would assist  IRS staff. The employees said that the software would validate source  information that taxpayers provided to TE/GE revenue agents. These  technologies were provided to workgroups after management was alerted  through ES Tracker. The Human Capital Office can track trends in the  system across IRS. This transparency helps increase accountability by  allowing employees to see what issues management has addressed.", "Although IRS has a number of programs in place to build staff motivation,  less than half of respondents in the 2008 IRS Employee Survey agree with  the statement, \u201cIn my organization, leaders generate high levels of  motivation and commitment in the workforce.\u201d This is lower than the  percentage of IRS employees responding positively to most other survey  questions, with which an average of more than 65 percent agreed.  According to IRS managers, this response may be due to the geographic  dispersion of IRS offices and hierarchical distance between employees and  leadership. In many cases, IRS employees will only see IRS senior leaders  once a year, if at all. Many of the IRS managers we talked to expressed  concern about this disconnect and have developed individual methods in  addition to the IRS and division initiatives to bridge the geographic and  professional distance between leadership and frontline workers. Managers  and leaders have reported including their pictures on e-mail messages,  creating intranet pages to communicate with employees, and making visits  to IRS sites. Formal initiatives include town hall meetings, which are run  by IRS leadership and provide employee exposure to senior leadership and  a forum for leadership to address employees. Additionally, E-talk, a Web- based comment submission system, allows employees in one business unit  to anonymously share positive and negative comments directly with senior  leadership. IRS has included this survey question in the above discussed  employee engagement index, and accordingly, the steps taken in response  to the index\u2014such as the coaching initiative\u2014may affect this score."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "IRS Has a Number of Networks but Could Include Stakeholders to a Greater Extent", "paragraphs": ["Despite IRS\u2019s large size and distributed workforce, there are many formal  ways for employees to communicate across different parts of the agency.  At the time of our review, IRS had a number of cross-business-unit  initiatives, including over two dozen internal advisory committees to  address human capital, technology, security, and other operational issues.  Also, business units have established working groups, as needed, to  address cross-functional tax administration issues, and in some cases,  teams of employees from multiple units do the work.", "Some of IRS\u2019s formal and informal human capital practices further  enhance internal networks. Formally, participants in the Executive  Readiness Program may complete assignments in other units of IRS. This  helps employees make contacts throughout the agency and observe the  operations of other units, which may better enable them to call on others  for assistance in the face of a disruption. IRS is also developing  corporatewide training for its Revenue Agent staff, a position that is  common to many of the business units. The training will help employees to  make contacts throughout the agency. Many IRS employees move between  business units during their careers. For example, IRS\u2019s Workforce Plan  shows that it is common for SB/SE employees to move to LMSB.", "IRS also works with a number of outside groups. Table 2 highlights  examples of such groups.", "Federal Continuity Directive 1 requires that agencies perform annual tests  of the internal and external interdependencies identified in their continuity  plan, with respect to performing mission-essential functions. Agencies  are also required to have an opportunity to demonstrate inter- and intra- agency communication capabilities and to test equipment used in internal  and external communication. However, the Federal Continuity Directive  does not specify whether representatives of external entities need to be  present at the tests and exercises, or whether they can simply be  represented by agency personnel. IRS is currently implementing the  requirements from the Federal Continuity Directive.", "IRS guidelines require business units to include internal stakeholder  groups in tests and exercises but do not have parallel requirements for  external stakeholder groups. Internal groups include Modernization and  Information Technology Services and Agency Wide Shared Services that  move resources throughout IRS and provide services necessary for  employees to do their jobs. Internal interdependencies are tested through  integrated tabletop exercises, which IRS requires for large geographic  regions as part of its annual test and exercise strategy. However, IRS  currently has no requirement for including external stakeholders in tests  and exercises. As a result, tests and exercises involving these entities have  been inconsistent across IRS. The few IRS exercises involving external  entities tend to be centered on a large city or on IRS campuses.", "In the exercises in which external partners participated, IRS benefited by  identifying important lessons to integrate into its plans. In one case, IRS  held an integrated tabletop exercise with FEMA and the Central U.S.  Earthquake Consortium\u2014an educational organization that coordinates  multistate efforts in emergency planning for an earthquake in the central  United States\u2014where IRS managers and Business Resumption Plan  coordinators reacted to a detailed earthquake scenario. FEMA was able to  provide IRS with a specific impact analysis on its facilities, which showed  that the affected area would be much larger than IRS had anticipated. As a  result of the exercise, IRS recognized that an alternative computing site  would be unusable after an earthquake, and now plans to relocate the site.  In some cities, IRS also participates in exercises hosted by the local  Federal Executive Boards that bring together federal agencies located in  the same city. By participating in an Atlanta Federal Executive Board  exercise, IRS was able to establish important contacts with local  government officials.", "However, even in campus locations, some exercises occur without  participation from external entities. For example, IRS\u2019s Atlanta campus  has its own on-site post office, and is co-located with the Centers for  Disease Control and Prevention, but neither the post office nor the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention participates in IRS exercises.  In a recent exercise, participants from IRS have discussed the possible  response of the post office, but postal representatives were not included in  the tabletop exercises.", "By not having regular external participation in tests and exercises, IRS  missed several opportunities for strengthening ties that could play a  critical role during a disruption. For example, an SB/SE office in New  Jersey that faced a possible anthrax contamination learned that the local  authorities on whom IRS relies in such situations were ill prepared and  even unaware of how to put on protective suits. Rather than learning these  deficiencies during a no-risk situation, such as an exercise, IRS identified  the local authorities\u2019 lack of preparedness during a situation that could  have proved harmful.", "The need to include stakeholders is particularly relevant for providers of  electronic tax software and Electronic Return Originators. As we recently  reported, electronic tax software and the associated electronic return  originators, which electronically submit returns to IRS, are key to the tax  administration system. In 2007, 39 million tax returns were prepared  using commercial software and the majority of electronically submitted  returns went through electronic return originators. Even though these  organizations are a critical component of the tax administration system,  they are not formally included as part of IRS\u2019s test and exercise strategy.  We recently recommended that IRS develop and plan for effectively  monitoring compliance with recommended security and privacy standards  for the 2010 filing season.

Realistic and stressful circumstances are important to include in tests and  exercises, because they build in employees the capacity to respond to the  stress of actual events. At the same time, functional and full-scale  exercises require greater financial and staff investment than do tabletop  exercises. Accordingly, these types of tests and exercises could be done  on a limited basis and the results evaluated to assess the costs and  benefits before conducting them more widely. At the same time, stressful  circumstances can still be included in routine drills, which affect a wider  range of employees than specific planning exercises, with a lower cost and  less time commitment.", "Furthermore, the innovation required in the face of some disruptions  includes knowing how to draw on the agency\u2019s own resources and the  resources of others.

To address this concern, we reviewed IRS\u2019s response bias  analysis that had determined no adjustments were required to correct for  nonrespondents. In addition, based on the average positive response rate  of about 65 percent, we set a threshold for reportable positive responses  of more than 80 percent and a threshold for negative responses of less  than 50 percent, and selected only responses from those that exceeded  these thresholds.

This attribute can be seen in  employee participation in professional organizations, employee  participation in conferences or external training, or formalized agreements  for resource sharing with other organizations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Overall Comments about the Attributes", "paragraphs": ["All of these attributes contribute to potential organizational resilience but  do not ensure it, because all disruptions are individual situations and even  a resilient organization may not be able to restore operations after a  disruption. Furthermore, during a disruption, some attributes may prove  to be more important than others. For example, we found after the 2006  flood of IRS headquarters that IRS did not activate the headquarters  continuity of operations plan because of the specific conditions of the  flood. Specifically, alternate work space was available for all headquarters  employees within a relatively short period, reducing the importance of  identifying critical personnel, a required step of continuity of operations  planning. Additionally, with many attributes, there is the potential for  condition where the excess of a positive attribute becomes negative. For  example, too much experience with change could make employees suffer  from innovation fatigue and become less open and receptive to change."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the Internal Revenue Service", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgements", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contacts listed above, William J.
