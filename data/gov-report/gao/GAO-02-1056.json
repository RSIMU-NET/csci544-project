Specifically, WTO commitments in the areas of intellectual property rights; consistent application of laws, regulations, and practices; and transparency of laws, regulations, and practices emerged as the most important areas in which China made commitments.

However, some company representatives whom GAO interviewed in China believed that China's implementation would be incremental. Survey respondents expected that most of the WTO--related commitment areas listed in GAO's survey would be difficult for Chinese officials to implement. Companies expected the important rule of law--related commitment areas to be the most difficult commitments to carry out and had mixed expectations about implementation for different government levels and geographic areas across China.

China\u2019s WTO commitments are complex and broad in scope.  They range from the rules for how China\u2019s trade regime will be reformed in  accordance with WTO principles to specific market access commitments  for goods and services. A number of commitments are to be phased in over  10 years.", "Commitments related to reforming China\u2019s trade regime require a specific  action from China, such as reporting particular information to the WTO,  while others are more general in nature, such as those that affirm China\u2019s  adherence to WTO principles. Many commitments seek to improve the rule  of law. Generally, China agreed to ensure that its legal measures would be  consistent with its WTO obligations. These rule of law-related  commitments include broad reforms to publish and translate trade-related  laws and regulations and apply them uniformly at all levels of government  and throughout China. China will have to adhere to internationally  accepted norms to protect intellectual property rights and enforce relevant  laws and regulations relating to patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade  secrets, and integrated circuits. China also made a substantial number of  other rule of law-related commitments regarding transparency, judicial  review, and nondiscriminatory treatment of businesses.", "The accession agreement also includes market access commitments for  goods, including commitments that will reduce tariffs on agricultural and  industrial products from about 14 percent in 2001 to less than 10 percent in  2010, as well as commitments to reduce or eliminate many other trade  barriers such as quotas or licensing requirements on some of these  products. Further, China made commitments to allow greater market  access in 9 of 12 general service sectors, including sectors that are  important to U.S. companies such as banking, insurance, and  telecommunications. However, some limitations, including those that  require joint ventures with Chinese partners in some sectors or restrict the  amount of foreign investment, will continue.", "It is important to note that, in addition to the commitments set forth in the  accession agreement, WTO membership confers obligations and rights on  China. For example, membership obligates China to adhere to more than 20  existing multilateral WTO agreements that cover various areas of  international trade. China, like all other WTO members, must adhere to the  WTO\u2019s three main agreements governing key areas of international trade:  (1) the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, (2) the General Agreement  on Trade in Services, and (3) the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of  Intellectual Property Rights. Other specialized multilateral WTO  agreements that apply to China include the Agreement on Trade-Related  Investment Measures, the Agreement on Agriculture, the Agreement on  Technical Barriers to Trade, and the Agreement on Subsidies and  Countervailing Measures. Numerous sections of China\u2019s protocol and  working party report refer to or reiterate specific provisions of a number of  these underlying WTO agreements.

First,  several manufacturers discussed the importance of obtaining increased  market access through tariff reductions. One representative of a food  manufacturer explained that China\u2019s implementation of its WTO  commitments would make it easier and cheaper to import the ingredients  used in his company\u2019s products. Another representative of a manufacturing  firm reported that high tariffs were one of the most important issues for his  company. He noted that although tariffs have already come down on  several imported products, his company still pays high tariffs on certain  other products. Concerning nontariff barriers and reforms to China\u2019s quota  system, one company representative explained that his company  sometimes encounters problems in selling products in China because  quotas reserve a portion of the market for domestic manufacturers. This  has caused problems because it lead to inventory overruns for his  company. Second, several representatives of various U.S. companies in  China also highlighted the importance of other reforms, such as  commitments liberalizing investment-related measures. For example, one  company explained that repatriating profits made in China still involves a  lengthy process. Representatives of another U.S. multinational company  that we interviewed complained about the difficulties that China\u2019s  restrictive foreign exchange regime creates. This company maintains a  separate holding company in order to move renminbi (China\u2019s currency)  from one joint venture to another within China.

Similarly, an almost equal number of  respondents expected officials in China\u2019s major cities to have an easy or  difficult time making reforms. Nevertheless, survey respondents expected  China\u2019s local and provincial governments and autonomous regions to have  the most difficulties implementing reforms. Table 6 provides a summary of  these responses.", "Company representatives whom we interviewed provided a number of  explanations for these expectations by level of government. For example,  one company representative compared China to Europe, in that each  Chinese region is like a different country and they each have different rules  and regulations. Another company official explained how differences  within China play out at the local level. He believed that the local officials  have a different mind-set, because existing approval processes are their  livelihood (he cited import inspections as an example). In his view, local  officials want to protect the domestic market and local suppliers from  losing jobs. A specific example provides further context for understanding  how these differences relate to specific business operations. As one  company representative explained, he believed that there is no unified  customs system and therefore, customs procedures will be slow to change.  In his view, state directives often do not get to local customs authorities  and authorities may interpret the directives differently.", "Another reason that might help explain the varied expectations by level of  government is that many respondents\u2019 knowledge about different parts of  China is limited.

Beijing and Shanghai were the only locations where  more respondents expected reforms to be relatively easy to implement  (compared to the number of respondents who did not know whether  reforms would be difficult and the number of respondents who expected  reforms to be difficult to implement). With regard to Beijing, 43 percent of  the respondents expected reforms would be relatively easy to implement,  while 22 percent of the respondents expected reforms to be difficult to  implement. In Shanghai, 54 percent of the respondents expected that  reforms would be relatively easy to implement, while 15 percent of the  respondents expected reforms to be difficult to implement. Respondents  also expected reforms to be more difficult to implement in locations where  fewer U.S. companies have a presence in China.

Their comments covered a spectrum of opinions ranging  from the broad view that, overall, China\u2019s accession would be great for  China and the United States, to less enthusiastic expectations based on  their companies\u2019 experiences in China. One representative said that WTO  has huge potential for his company and implementation of China\u2019s  commitments could radically improve his company\u2019s ability to operate.

One company  representative reported that Chinese agencies are likely to provide  conflicting answers to business inquiries. In addition, several companies  also cited consistent application of laws as a potential difficulty. At the  central government level, China is committed to implementing WTO, but all  cities and provinces understand WTO differently, in the view of one U.S.  corporate representative.

Even if a company wins a copyright case, you can\u2019t get the government to  enforce the copyright violation, so it\u2019s not worth the time and money  expended on filing a case.\u201d IPR violations were also described by one  company representative as a game embedded in China\u2019s culture.
