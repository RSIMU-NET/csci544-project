These include weaknesses in controls intended to prevent, limit, and detect unauthorized access to computer resources, such as controls for protecting system boundaries, identifying and authenticating users, authorizing users to access systems, encrypting sensitive data, and auditing and monitoring activity on FAA's systems. Additionally, shortcomings in boundary protection controls between less-secure systems and the operational NAS environment increase the risk from these weaknesses.", "FAA also did not fully implement its agency-wide information security program. As required by the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002, federal agencies should implement a security program that provides a framework for implementing controls at the agency. However, FAA's implementation of its security program was incomplete. For example, it did not always sufficiently test security controls to determine that they were operating as intended; resolve identified security weaknesses in a timely fashion; or complete or adequately test plans for restoring system operations in the event of a disruption or disaster. Additionally, the group responsible for incident detection and response for NAS systems did not have sufficient access to security logs or network sensors on the operational network, limiting FAA's ability to detect and respond to security incidents affecting its mission-critical systems.", "The weaknesses in FAA's security controls and implementation of its security program existed, in part, because FAA had not fully established an integrated, organization-wide approach to managing information security risk that is aligned with its mission. National Institute of Standards and Technology guidance calls for agencies to establish and implement a security governance structure, an executive-level risk management function, and a risk management strategy in order to manage risk to their systems and information. FAA has established a Cyber Security Steering Committee to provide an agency-wide risk management function. However, it has not fully established the governance structure and practices to ensure that its information security decisions are aligned with its mission. For example, it has not (1) clearly established roles and responsibilities for information security for the NAS or (2) updated its information security strategic plan to reflect significant changes in the NAS environment, such as increased reliance on computer networks.", "Until FAA effectively implements security controls, establishes stronger agency-wide information security risk management processes, fully implements its NAS information security program, and ensures that remedial actions are addressed in a timely manner, the weaknesses GAO identified are likely to continue, placing the safe and uninterrupted operation of the nation's air traffic control system at increased and unnecessary risk."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making 17 recommendations to FAA to fully implement its information security program and establish an integrated approach to managing information security risk.

Specifically, the FAA Chief Information  Security Officer stated that in November 2013, the agency established a  risk executive function at the agency level in the form of a Cyber Security  Steering Committee. The committee includes representatives from across  FAA, including ATO, NextGen, and FAA\u2019s office of security. However,  FAA has not yet fully established the governance structures and practices  necessary for ensuring that its information security risk management  decisions are aligned strategically with its mission.

Further, according to NIST Special Publication 800-39, one of the tasks of  the risk executive is to establish risk management roles and  responsibilities.

Based on this evaluation, we   for review: FAA  selected a non-generalizable sample of five systemsTelecommunications Infrastructure (FTI), Surveillance and Broadcast  Service System (SBSS), Traffic Flow Management-Infrastructure (TFM-I),  En Route Automation Modernization (ERAM), and En Route  Communications Gateway (ECG).", "GAO, Federal Information System Controls Audit Manual (FISCAM), GAO-09-232G  (Washington, D.C.: February 2009). and procedures; and standards and guidelines from relevant security and  IT security organizations, such as the National Security Agency and the  Center for Internet Security.  reviewed network access paths to determine if boundaries had been  adequately protected;  reviewed the complexity and expiration of password settings to  determine if password management was being enforced; analyzed users\u2019 access authorizations for four systems to determine  whether system access had been approved and properly  documented; observed configurations for transmitting data across the network to  determine whether sensitive data were being encrypted. For the  ERAM and ECG systems, we reviewed configuration settings for  network devices by reviewing the network device builds that are  distributed to Air Route Traffic Control Centers (ARTCC) by the  William J. Hughes Technical Center;  reviewed system security settings to determine if sufficient audit and  monitoring controls had been implemented; evaluated configuration change control processes for selected  systems to determine whether changes were sufficiently documented,  tested, and approved in accordance with system procedures; and  inspected key network devices and servers to determine if critical  patches had been installed and/or were up to date.", "Additionally, our review of boundary protection controls focused on  interconnections between NAS and non-NAS systems.", "Using the requirements identified by the Federal Information Security  Management Act of 2002, which establishes key elements for an effective  agency-wide information security program, and associated NIST  guidelines and agency requirements, we evaluated the FAA\u2019s information  security program by analyzing processes and documentation that were part of FAA\u2019s  information security risk management processes to determine the  extent to which the process sufficiently supported the agency\u2019s  mission and operations; examining system security plans to determine whether they described  the security controls in place or planned for meeting the security  requirements of the system; examining security awareness training records to determine whether  employees and contractors had received training according to FAA  policy and federal guidance; analyzing security testing and evaluation results for four systems to  determine whether testing of management, operational, and technical  controls was sufficient to conclude that controls were in place and  operating effectively; examining remedial action plans for four systems to determine  whether FAA addressed identified vulnerabilities in a timely manner; examining contingency plans and contingency test results for selected  systems to determine whether those plans were appropriately  documented and had been sufficiently tested; and  reviewing FAA\u2019s processes for identifying and responding to  information security incidents to determine whether FAA has  implemented an effective incident response capability for its air traffic  control systems.", "As part of our review of the FAA\u2019s information security program, we  reviewed several sources of computer-generated data. These included  FAA\u2019s employee background investigation data.  inventory of NAS information systems,  IT security training completion data, and  To verify the reliability of these data, we examined them for obvious  outliers, omissions, errors, and consulted with FAA officials to resolve any  identified anomalies. We also interviewed knowledgeable officials  regarding controls on the security training and employee background  investigation data, including how and by whom it is input and used. We  determined that these sources of data were sufficiently reliable for our  purposes.", "We conducted this performance audit from August 2013 to January 2015  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
