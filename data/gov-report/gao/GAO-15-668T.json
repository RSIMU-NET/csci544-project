Specifically, from 2011 to early 2012, DHS conducted a onetime review of its international footprint\u2014the complete set of DHS resources and efforts it has deployed abroad\u2014and created a department-wide international engagement plan. However, DHS had not established specific department-wide strategic priorities for resource use abroad. Specifically, DHS (1) had not established department-wide strategic priorities for international engagement, such as specific types of activities or target regions to further combating terrorism goals; (2) did not have a mechanism for monitoring alignment between resource deployment abroad and strategic priorities; and (3) did not have reliable, comparable cost data for its programs and activities abroad and had not established a standardized framework to capture these data. GAO recommended that DHS establish department-wide strategic priorities, a mechanism to routinely monitor alignment between strategic priorities and resource deployment abroad, and reliable cost data to provide DHS with critical information to make informed resource deployment decisions. DHS concurred and, as of May 2015, has taken steps to implement GAO's recommendations, such as drafting an international engagement strategy to identify specific department-wide priorities and establishing a common cost framework. DHS plans to finalize this strategy by early summer 2015 and use it a mechanism to facilitate additional footprint reviews in future budget years.", "DHS deploys multiple screening and targeting programs designed to help interdict high-risk travelers, such as potential terrorists, and otherwise inadmissible passengers and cargo shipments before they board U.S.-bound commercial vessels. For example, in March 2011, GAO reported on the Visa Security Program (VSP) through which DHS's U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) deploys personnel to certain U.S. embassies and consulates to conduct security reviews of visa applications, among other things. GAO found that ICE had limited guidance for the program and could improve its program expansion planning. DHS concurred with GAO's recommendations to issue guidance and strengthen its planning and took steps to address them. GAO also found that DHS did not collect comprehensive data on all VSP performance measures and track the time officials spent on visa security activities; DHS did not concur with GAO's recommendations to address these limitations. Further, since 2008, GAO has reported on CBP's programs intended to secure the maritime global supply chain\u2014the flow of goods from manufacturers to retailer\u2014and cargo destined for the United States. For example, in September 2013, GAO found that CBP had not regularly assessed foreign ports for risks to since 2005. While CBP took steps to rank ports for risks in 2009, CBP did not use this information to modify where CBP staff were posted.

While DHS\u2019s International Engagement Plan  linked DHS\u2019s strategic missions to the kinds of activities that DHS  conducts abroad, we found that it did not establish specific priorities to  help guide resource decision making. DHS officials from OIA and the  Office of Counterterrorism Policy agreed that DHS\u2019s International  Engagement Plan did not represent a clear priority focus on countries  with factors that represented more immediate threats to the homeland  and did not necessarily serve to identify a clear set of priorities and  principles that would help to guide future resource decisions. To address  these concerns we recommended that DHS establish specific  department-wide priorities for resources abroad. DHS concurred, and as  of May 2015, has started to draft an international engagement strategy to  identify specific department-wide priorities. According to DHS officials,  OIA hopes to use the plan to help inform the department\u2019s fiscal year  2017 budget request and intends to finalize the plan no later than early  summer 2015.", "We also found that although OIA conducted a one-time exercise from  2011 to early 2012 to evaluate the department\u2019s international footprint to  try to bring it into better organizational and programmatic alignment, DHS  had not established a routine or ingrained process that would continually  assess the alignment between strategic goals and resource decisions.  For example, we found each of the operational components that we  interviewed, such as CBP and ICE, described different rationales and  methods for deciding where and how many resources to deploy around  the world. At the time of our review, OIA officials stated they had not  devised an approach for implementing a routine, ingrained process with  department-wide methods and metrics, but officials agreed that such  methods and metrics that were meaningful to all of the components would  help provide a coherent strategic overlay to give the department better  assurance of alignment between resource use and strategic priorities. To  address these concerns, we recommended that DHS establish a routine,  institutionalized mechanism to ensure alignment of the department\u2019s  resource use abroad with the highest department-wide and government- wide strategic priorities. DHS concurred, and as of May 2015, OIA plans  to use the international engagement plan as the foundation of a footprint  review, starting with a specific international region, to identify  opportunities to realign resources with priorities and to identify  crosscutting management efficiencies for the department\u2019s fiscal year  2017 budget request.", "In addition, in 2013, we found that DHS did not have comparable cost  data for its programs and activities abroad and had not established a  standardized framework to capture these data to help inform resource  decision making and to achieve management efficiencies when  addressing issues that are common across the department. We found  that each of the components tracked its international expenditures  differently, and according to OIA officials, the effort to collect comparable  information that reliably informs management decision making had been  challenging. According to OIA officials, a standardized reporting  framework for the costs of conducting activities abroad\u2014for example,  salaries, housing, and fees paid to embassies to cover certain  administrative and security costs\u2014across the department could enable  OIA to identify best practices that could lead to cost savings in  international deployments and enhance the ability to assess the  outcomes and cost-effectiveness of programs and activities carried out  abroad.

We also found that ICE lacked performance  measures to accurately evaluate VSP mission objectives. Moreover, we  found that VSP agents performed various investigative and administrative  functions beyond their visa security responsibilities, a fact that at times  slowed or limited visa security activities, and ICE did not track this  information in the VSP tracking system, making it unable to identify the  time spent on investigative and administrative functions. Finally, we found  that ICE\u2019s plans to expand VSP did not cover 11 of 20 additional  diplomatic posts identified by ICE as high-risk.", "We made several recommendations to help DHS better manage VSP at  posts overseas. First, we recommended that DHS issue guidance  requiring ICE to provide training for consular officers. DHS concurred and  has issued guidance to enhance the training of consular officers by VSP  offices abroad. Second, we recommended that DHS ensure that ICE  collects reliable data to allow ICE to accurately evaluate VSP  performance and report to Congress on progress toward the VSP mission  objectives. DHS stated that the VSP captured all the required  performance metrics. However, as we reported, we determined on the  basis of our analysis that ICE was collecting some data on the required  performance measures, but that the data were not sufficient to accurately  demonstrate the progress made toward the program\u2019s stated objectives.  We continue to believe that without collecting comprehensive data on the  performance measures identified by ICE, DHS cannot accurately  demonstrate progress of VSP in enhancing national security. Third, we  recommended that DHS develop a mechanism to track the amount of  time spent by ICE on visa security activities and other investigations as  part of VSP, in order to determine appropriate staffing levels and resource  needs for VSP operations at posts overseas. DHS did not concur with this  recommendation and has taken no action to implement it. DHS stated  that ICE tracks case investigation hours through its case management  system, and that adding the metric to the VSP tracking system would be  redundant. However, we found, according to ICE documentation, that ICE  cannot accurately determine the amount of time that VSP agents spend  on investigative and visa security activities because ICE does not  distinguish between the hours logged by VSP agents and hours logged  by other ICE officials at posts abroad and that ICE does not maintain  accurate data on the time VSP agents spend on visa security activities at  posts. Without accurate data to determine the amount of time VSP agents  spend on the visa security activities, ICE is not well positioned to  determine whether the current allocations of staffing and resources at  posts are adequate to carry out the visa security reviews and fulfill VSP\u2019s  objectives. Thus, we continue to believe our recommendation has merit,  and should be fully implemented. Lastly, we recommended that DHS  develop a plan to provide VSP coverage at high-risk posts where the  possibility of deploying agents may be limited.

Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007  (9/11 Act), enacted in 2007, required, among other things, that by July  2012, 100 percent of U.S.-bound cargo containers be scanned at foreign  ports with both radiation detection and non-intrusive inspection equipment  before being placed on U.S.-bound vessels. In May 2012, the then  Secretary of Homeland Security authorized a 2-year extension (until July  2014) of the deadline for implementing the requirement. Then, in May  2014, the current Secretary of Homeland Security renewed the extension  (until July 2016).", "GAO-12-422T.", "In addition to the CBP supply chain security programs described above,  we have also reported on CBP\u2019s targeting of high-risk maritime  containerized cargo shipments. Specifically, in January 2015, we found,  among other things, that CBP did not have accurate data on the number  and disposition of each high-risk maritime cargo shipment scheduled to  arrive in the United States. On the basis of our analyses of CBP data for  fiscal years 2009 through 2013, we found that on average each year,  approximately 11.6 million maritime cargo container shipments arrived in  the United States, and less than 1 percent of those shipments were  determined by ATS to be high-risk. CBP targeters at advance targeting  units\u2014responsible for reviewing shipments arriving at ports within their  respective regions\u2014can waive an examination if they determine through  research that (1) the shipment falls within a predetermined category  (standard exception), or (2) they can articulate why the shipment should  not be considered high-risk (articulable reason), such as an error in the  shipment\u2019s data. For example, a shipment could be identified as high-risk  because it is associated with a shipper on a terrorist watch list, but  through further research, CBP officials determine the shipper is not a true  match to the terrorist watch list and, therefore, the shipment should not be  considered high-risk. We found that CBP examined the vast majority of  high-risk shipments, but CBP\u2019s disposition data were not accurate  because of various factors\u2014such as the inclusion of shipments that were  never sent to the United States\u2014and our analyses found that CBP\u2019s data  overstated the number of high-risk shipments, including those not  examined/not waived under CBP policy. We also found that when  determining the disposition of high-risk shipments, CBP\u2019s targeting units  were inconsistently applying criteria to make some waiver decisions and  were also incorrectly documenting the reasons for waivers.", "On the basis of our review of CBP policy and visits to selected targeting  units, we determined that CBP has not established uniform definitions for  standard exception waiver categories, some CBP officials were unaware  of existing waiver guidance for articulable reason waivers, and some CBP  targeters across the targeting units we visited were inconsistently and  inaccurately recording waiver reasons in ATS. As a result, we concluded  that CBP could not accurately determine the extent to which standard  exception waivers were used consistently or whether waivers issued for  articulable reasons were being used judiciously, as required by policy. We  recommended, among other things, that CBP define standard exception  waiver categories and disseminate policy on documenting articulable  reason waivers. Further, we recommended that CBP enhance its  methodology for selecting shipments for self-inspections and change the  way it calculates the compliance rate. DHS concurred with our  recommendations and has actions planned or underway to address them.  For example, CBP plans to, among other things, draft an updated,  comprehensive National Cargo Targeting Policy, which is to include  definitions for each of the standard exception waiver categories and  develop an enhanced methodology for selecting shipment samples used  for self-inspection to increase the likelihood that any potential deficiencies  will be identified so that corrective actions can be taken to reduce errors  in the future. According to CBP officials, CBP is working to implement the  recommendations, and is to provide us with an update on the  implementation status by June 5, 2015.", "Chairman Miller, Ranking Member Vela, and members of the  subcommittee this concludes my prepared statement.
