Offshoring generally refers to an organization's purchase of goods or services from abroad that were previously produced domestically. Extensive public debate has arisen about both the potential benefits of services offshoring, such as lower consumer prices and higher U.S. productivity, as well as the potential costs, such as increased job displacement for selected U.S. workers. In response to widespread congressional interest, GAO conducted work under the Comptroller General's authority to help policy makers better understand the potential impacts and policy implications of services offshoring. This report: (1) provides an overview of experts' views on the potential impacts of services offshoring, (2) describes the types of policies that have been proposed in response to offshoring, and (3) highlights some key areas where additional research might help advance the debate about offshoring. In its comments, the Department of Commerce generally agreed with the findings of this report. Commerce, Treasury, and the Office of the United States Trade Representative also provided technical comments that have been incorporated as appropriate."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Analysts of the offshoring phenomenon have expressed a range of views about the likely impacts of offshoring on four broad areas. The differing views reflect several factors: the fact that services offshoring is a relatively recent development whose impact is not fully known, the limitations of available data on offshoring, and different theoretical expectations about how services offshoring will impact the U.S. economy. The average U.S. standard of living: Traditional economic theory generally predicts that offshoring will benefit U.S. living standards in the long run. However, some economists have argued that offshoring could harm U.S. long-term living standards under certain scenarios, such as if offshoring undermines U.S. technological leadership. Employment and job loss: While economic theory generally predicts that offshoring will have little effect on overall U.S. employment levels in the long-run, there is widespread recognition that pockets of workers will lose jobs due to offshoring, though there is disagreement about the expected magnitude of job loss and implications for displaced workers. Distribution of income: Some economists maintain that offshoring could increase income inequality in the U.S., while others argue that changes in the income distribution are driven primarily by factors other than offshoring, such as technological change. Security and consumer privacy: Experts express varying degrees of concern about the impact of services offshoring on the security of our national defense system and critical infrastructure--such as utilities and communication networks--as well as the privacy and security of consumers' financial and medical information. A wide range of policies has been proposed in response to concerns about offshoring and its potential effects. These proposals can be categorized into four areas by the concerns they seek to address: (1) improving U.S. global competitiveness, (2) addressing effects on the U.S. workforce, (3) addressing security concerns, and (4) reducing the extent of offshoring. Some analysts have recommended policies in more than one area. Determining appropriate policy responses to the offshoring phenomenon is challenging due to the limited state of knowledge about the extent and impacts of offshoring. Nonetheless, there are some key areas where additional research might help advance the debate, such as trends in the wages and skill levels of jobs being offshored, reemployment experiences of workers displaced by offshoring, and the extent to which current laws and practices in different sectors of the economy mitigate any increased security-related risks posed by offshoring. In the face of limited federal data, researchers have begun using a variety of approaches to examine such areas."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Although \u201coffshoring\u201d has existed for decades in the manufacturing sector,  recently concerns have been raised about the emergence of services  offshoring. Offshoring generally refers to the practice, by either U.S.  companies or government entities, of replacing goods or services  previously produced domestically with goods and services produced  abroad. Advances in information technology (IT) and developments in the  management of business processes, coupled with a large pool of educated  workers in other countries, allow companies to move services work  outside of the U.S. as part of a larger trend toward global interdependence.  For example, U.S. companies are now able to move software  programming, accounting, or telephone call center services to lower-wage  locations such as India, the Philippines, and Eastern Europe. While U.S.  government data have limitations, these data indicate that in recent years  the imports of services associated with offshoring have been growing.  This has contributed to heightened public debate about both the potential  benefits of services offshoring, such as lower consumer prices and higher  U.S. productivity, as well as the potential costs, such as increased job  displacement for U.S. workers.", "Services offshoring raises issues on a wide array of topics, including the  economy, workforce, consumer privacy, and national security. Moreover,  various pieces of federal and state legislation have been introduced, such  as bills to restrict the offshoring of some government services or to  provide more assistance for displaced workers. In response to widespread  congressional interest, we have prepared this report under the  Comptroller General\u2019s authority to help the Congress understand and  examine the potential impacts and policy implications of services  offshoring. As this report may prove helpful in the deliberations of  committees with oversight responsibilities or jurisdiction over issues  raised by offshoring, we have addressed this report to these committees.  Although this report focuses on services offshoring, much of our  discussion is applicable to offshoring in the manufacturing sector as well.", "This report addresses three broad areas. First, it provides an overview of  experts\u2019 views on the potential effects of offshoring. Where possible, we  identify empirical research that provides support for various views. Where  experts express different opinions on the potential effects of offshoring,  we highlight the key issues that underlie the debate. However, the report  does not attempt to resolve such differences in views. Second, the report  provides an overview of the various types of policies that have been  proposed in response to offshoring. We generally categorize policy  proposals on the basis of the broad concerns that they seek to address,  and we provide illustrative examples of policies that have been proposed.  Third, the report highlights some key areas where additional research  might advance the debate about the effects and policy implications of  offshoring.

For example, a U.S.-based  company might stop producing parts of its accounting and payroll services  in-house and instead outsource them to a foreign-based company. A U.S.- based multinational company might also offshore by moving parts of its  accounting and payroll services from its domestic operations to its foreign  affiliate, thus keeping the services in-house.

Many services jobs, such as child care providers and  hairdressers, require face-to-face contact with customers. Other jobs, such  as transportation workers, construction workers, and auto mechanics,  require hands-on contact with physical equipment.

Trade data from the  Department of Commerce\u2019s Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) show  that imports of services associated with offshoring are growing. For  example, U.S. imports of business, professional, and technical services  grew from $20.8 billion in 1997 to $40.7 billion in 2004\u2014an increase of  about 10% per year. It is important to note that these import data show  that U.S. entities have been purchasing these services offshore, but the  data do not indicate whether these entities had previously been  purchasing these services from domestic U.S. sources.", "The U.S., Canada, and the United Kingdom are among the world\u2019s leading  exporters of services.

In 2004, this surplus was  nearly $48 billion, according to BEA data. However, since 1997, the trade  surplus in services has generally been shrinking. At the same time, the  overall trade deficit has generally been expanding (see fig. 1), though  imported services comprise a small share (about 17 percent) of total U.S.  imports of goods and services.", "BEA data on direct investment abroad capture U.S. multinational  companies\u2019 establishment of affiliates abroad, including establishment of  affiliates to produce services. The data suggest that most services  produced abroad by U.S. majority-owned foreign affiliates are sold to  foreign markets rather than to the U.S. In addition, the data show that   U.S. direct investment abroad tends to be concentrated in other developed  countries, rather than in developing countries frequently associated with  services offshoring. For example, according to BEA data, 61 percent of  U.S. direct investment abroad in 2004 took place in the European Union,  Canada, and Japan. In the same year, U.S. direct investment in developing  countries that are frequently cited as suppliers of offshore services (e.g.,  India, the Philippines, Malaysia, and China) was relatively small\u2014about   1 percent or less of total U.S. direct investments in each case.

In 2004, the U.S. received nearly $96 billion  in foreign direct investment. The countries that are the largest recipients  of U.S. foreign direct investment abroad are also the largest foreign direct  investors in the U.S., with the European Union, Japan, and Canada  accounting for 82 percent of foreign direct investment in the U.S. Foreign  firms investing in the U.S. employ U.S. workers.

In previous decades, U.S. manufacturing companies were  motivated to offshore because of the low costs and availability of skilled  labor, production and supply networks in some developing countries, and  reductions in cost of transporting goods. At the same time, U.S. companies  divided their production processes into discrete pieces, which allowed  them to offshore some of the components. As a result, some businesses  offshored total production, and others offshored parts of the production  process. Firms generally retained higher-end, higher-skilled services  functions in the U.S., such as management, finance, marketing, and  research and development.", "Offshoring has recently expanded into services due to three key factors.  First, technological advances, such as advances in telecommunications  and the emergence of the Internet, have enabled workers in different  locations in the world to communicate and be connected electronically  and has also facilitated the digitization and standardization of activities  needed to complete business processes. These changes in turn have  allowed business processes to be divided into smaller components, some  of which could be done in different locations. For example, standardized  software has made it possible for firms to outsource financial or human  resources activities to a separate overseas company that performs them  for many clients, rather than handling the functions internally. Thus, in  many cases, the offshoring of services constitutes an outgrowth of  outsourcing business functions. Second, countries such as India, China,  Russia, and much of Eastern Europe have increasingly opened their  borders to the global economy. Third, other countries have highly  educated populations with the technical skills for performing services and  technology-related work.", "According to several business studies, a primary reason that organizations  engage in offshoring is to reduce costs. The cost savings from offshoring  are primarily the result of differences between the U.S. and developing  countries in the unit cost of labor, the worker compensation (wages and  benefits) that must be paid to produce one unit of goods or services. Unit  labor costs are lower for certain services in developing countries primarily  because workers\u2019 wages in those countries are lower than in the U.S.  However, unit labor costs also depend upon the productivity levels of  workers. Although labor costs in a developing country may be lower than  in the U.S., it may still be possible for the unit cost of labor to be lower in  the U.S. than the other country if U.S. workers\u2019 productivity is much  higher, meaning than the U.S. worker can produce many more or higher  quality products within a certain time frame than a worker in the other  country. Differences in unit labor costs can also result from differences in  costs of employee benefits, such as health care and pension benefits. In  addition, cost savings can be affected by currency exchange rates,  countries\u2019 tax policies, and government-provided incentives such as tax  rebates.", "Aside from cost savings, firms may have other incentives to offshore.  Access to a workforce in different time zones across the globe may enable  companies to conduct work around the clock and consequently meet  worldwide customer needs. Establishing a presence in foreign countries  can provide companies access to overseas markets. In addition, offshoring  non-core services can enable companies to focus their resources on their  core functions. By outsourcing non-core functions to overseas firms that  specialize in them, businesses may also experience improvements in the  quality of these functions.", "Although firms may have many incentives to offshore, they may also face  disincentives to offshore. Offshoring has several costs associated with it,  including costs to start up an offshore operation and to manage and train  an offshore workforce. In addition, some experts have noted that wages of  workers in developing countries are rising more rapidly than U.S. wages,  therefore shrinking the cost savings of offshoring over time.  Furthermore, offshoring carries potential risks, such as possible political  instability in overseas locations, less reliable civil infrastructure, exchange  rate volatility, less developed legal and regulatory systems, and risks to  intellectual property."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Legislation Enacted in Response to Trade-Related Concerns", "paragraphs": ["In the last few decades, the Congress has enacted various pieces of  legislation related to trade and increasing global interdependence,  primarily due to concerns about their effects on the manufacturing sector.  (See fig. 2.) This legislation sought to expand U.S. exports; establish fair  trading practices; assist workers, firms, and communities adversely  affected by trade; and improve U.S. competitiveness through support for  education and research and development. For example, trade acts of 1962,  1974, and 1979 sought to expand U.S. exports by establishing mechanisms  for negotiating and entering into trade agreements. The trade acts also  established remedies for industries hurt by import competition through  unfair trade practices. The Trade Act of 1974, as amended, established a  trade adjustment assistance program to provide financial assistance and  retraining to workers involved in the manufacturing of articles who lost  their jobs due to foreign competition. In addition, the act also established  a program that enabled manufacturing firms and communities hurt by  trade to receive technical assistance and financial support to develop new  strategies to improve their competitiveness. Congress enacted various  other legislation to enhance the competitiveness of the U.S. economy by  improving education and supporting research and development. Among  others, these included the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of  1980, which authorized the creation of various technology centers. With  regard to services specifically, the Trade and Tariff Act of 1984 required  the Commerce Department to establish a program on international trade in  services and to issue a report every 2 years. In addition, the Omnibus  Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 directs the Secretary of Commerce  to conduct a benchmark survey of services transactions.", "Aside from these laws, other legislation enacted by the Congress may  address some concerns raised by trade and globalization.

Economists and other policy analysts have expressed in literature and in  interviews with us a range of views about the likely impacts of offshoring  on each of these areas. This diversity of views reflects several factors: the  fact that services offshoring is a relatively recent development in  international trade whose impact is not yet fully known; the limitations of  currently available data about the extent of offshoring and its impacts; and  different theoretical expectations about the likely impact of expanded  trade in services on the U.S. economy.

Economists who contend that offshoring  will increase average U.S. living standards expect that it will do so through  raising productivity (and thereby increasing national income), increasing  average wages for American workers, and providing consumers with  lower prices and access to a broader range of goods and services. In  addition, they expect that U.S. companies will respond to the challenges of  international competition by developing new areas of specialization in the  global economy. Economists who argue that offshoring may lower U.S.  average living standards focus on the possibility that offshoring may  contribute to a decline in the strength of some U.S. industries and may  threaten U.S. leadership in innovation and technological development.  Some economists also focus on the possibility that offshoring may lead to  downward pressure on U.S. wages even if it has positive effects on the  U.S. economy overall. Underlying these disagreements are different  predictions about what areas will emerge as new sources of comparative  advantage in the global economy, as well as different assessments about  whether offshoring is contributing to downward pressure on U.S. wages."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Traditional Economic Theory Predicts that Offshoring Will Benefit Average U.S. Living Standards in the Long Run", "paragraphs": ["Effects on Productivity: Offshoring of services represents an expansion  of trade into sectors of the economy that in the past were relatively  untraded; as such, many economists we interviewed or who have  published literature on offshoring expect offshoring to increase  productivity in these sectors. Offshoring is expected to lead to  productivity increases through several mechanisms. First, increased  competition could lead to pressures for greater efficiency, causing least  productive firms to exit the market so that firms that remain in the market  are increasingly focused on managing for greatest productivity. Second,  offshoring\u2014like domestic outsourcing\u2014could enable U.S. firms to  specialize in the core functions in which they add the greatest value, while  moving lower-value job functions out of the country. As U.S. firms  reallocate resources toward higher-value activities, moving lower-value  activities overseas, the U.S. economy overall could see productivity gains.  Third, offshoring could enhance productivity by promoting reductions in  the costs of technology and other inputs that improve the efficiency of  business processes. For example, some economists have argued that  offshoring of IT services will reduce the cost of these services, making   IT-enabled products and services more affordable and leading to increased  diffusion of productivity-enhancing technology throughout many  industries. For instance, the lower cost of offshored health-record  transcription services might encourage more health care providers to keep  digitized medical records, improving the efficiency and productivity of the  health care industry.", "Because the acceleration in services offshoring is a relatively recent  phenomenon, empirical evidence about its effects on the productivity of  the U.S. economy remains preliminary. However, the effects of offshoring  in manufacturing have been observed over many years and can shed some  light on the potential impact of services offshoring on U.S. productivity. A  number of research studies suggest that offshore outsourcing contributed  to productivity improvements in U.S. manufacturing. Catherine Mann,  among others, has argued that offshoring in the production of computer  hardware\u2014along with domestic innovation\u2014kept prices of new hardware  low and thereby played a role in the deepening of IT investment  throughout the U.S. during the 1980s and 1990s. Since the mid-1990s, the  U.S. has experienced a period of unusually rapid productivity growth,  which many attribute to accelerating investment in IT and the rapid  diffusion of new applications and uses that occurred in the 1980s and  1990s.", "New Areas of Comparative Advantage: Traditional economic theory  also predicts that increased trade\u2014including offshoring\u2014will increase  economic growth, and therefore average living standards in the long run,  by driving the economy to develop new innovative and high-value areas of  comparative advantage\u2014that is, to specialize in the creation of high-value  goods and services that are produced most efficiently in the U.S.  Although increased competition due to offshoring and other trade may  lead to contraction of production and employment within some U.S.  industries, trade is also expected to reallocate the resources of the U.S.  economy to sectors that are comparatively more efficient, such that U.S.  companies are expected to eventually develop new areas of comparative  advantage in the global economy that will lead to continued economic  growth. Some economists contend that advantages that the U.S. has over  less developed countries, such as a relatively high-skilled workforce,  abundance of capital, and well-developed financial markets and  investment opportunities will enable the U.S. economy to specialize in  higher-value work. In particular, they expect that offshoring will  contribute to the reduction or elimination of certain lower-skilled  occupations in the U.S., but lead to the creation of new jobs in  occupations that require higher levels of skill, shifting U.S. production and  the distribution of employment to fields with higher returns.", "Some empirical studies suggest that the U.S. economy has historically  developed new high-value areas of comparative advantage as trade has  increased. The process of the U.S. developing higher-value areas of  comparative advantage as lower-value work is moved offshore has been  observed over many years in some manufacturing industries. For example,  in the semiconductor industry, assembly work that was originally  conducted in the U.S. began to be moved offshore in the 1960s. Although  this offshoring did lead to job losses in the U.S., economists Clair Brown  and Greg Linden assert in their research that this movement also kept the  U.S. semiconductor industry competitive and permitted the U.S. industry  to specialize in higher-value work within the industry. According to Brown  and Linden, as chip assembly moved offshore, U.S. firms specialized in  higher-value fabrication work, and when fabrication work began to move  offshore, U.S. firms specialized in design. Offshoring of services has not  been occurring long enough to observe the relationship between  offshoring and the emergence of new areas of specialization; however,  economists J. Bradford Jensen and Lori Kletzer have argued that recent  data demonstrates that workers in industries and occupations that are  more likely to be affected by international trade tend to have higher wages  and higher skills than workers in \u201cnon-tradable\u201d service sector jobs, which  is consistent with the hypothesis that offshoring and globalization is  leading the U.S. economy to specialize in higher-value work. Historical  trends also suggest that openness to trade has increased the economy\u2019s  aggregate output in the past. The U.S. economy has grown as trade has  expanded, and internationally, there is some evidence that countries that  are more open to trade typically experience faster growth than those that  are more closed.", "Effects on Wages: Some economists also argue that offshoring could  increase average living standards by contributing to growth in average real  wages for U.S. workers, corresponding to offshoring\u2019s effects on  productivity. Economic theory predicts that average real wages should  typically rise with average productivity rates, as workers are compensated  for producing more per hour of work. Wages are expected to move with  productivity growth in the long run if the share of national income that  accrues to workers versus the share that accrues to firms\u2019 profits and  other income remains fairly constant. Historically, wage growth in the   U.S. has broadly tracked productivity growth, although changes in wages  and productivity may have diverged for periods of time (see fig. 4). During  the post-World War II period, the share of national income spent on total  compensation\u2014wages and benefits\u2014rose throughout the 1950s, 1960s,  and 1970s, and has been fairly constant since 1980, averaging about 66  percent of national income, with the remainder accruing to corporate  profits, proprietor\u2019s income, rental income, and net interest. Since 1970,  an increasing amount of total labor compensation has been spent on  benefits rather than wages and salaries. In recent years\u2014since the end of  the 2001 recession\u2014wages have not moved up with productivity growth,  and total labor compensation as a share of national income has declined  somewhat, from 66 percent in 2001 to 64 percent in 2004. During this time,  wages and salaries as a share of national income declined from 55 percent  in 2001 to 52 percent in 2004. Some economists have argued that this  divergence of compensation growth from productivity growth is  problematic and runs counter to assertions that increased productivity  gains from offshoring will necessarily raise average living standards;  however, this fluctuation is considered by other economists to fall within  recent norms.", "Effects on Prices and Availability of Consumer Goods and Services:  Traditional economic theory also predicts that offshoring will improve  average U.S. living standards by lowering consumer prices and providing  consumers access to a wider range of goods and services than would  otherwise be available. Many economists expect that competition will lead  companies to pass the cost savings from offshoring onto consumers in the  form of lower prices. However, economic theory also predicts that the  extent to which cost savings are passed onto consumers depends on how  competitive the market is for particular goods and services. While firms in  highly competitive markets are likely to pass most of the cost savings from  offshoring through to the purchasers of the service, in less competitive  markets, economic theory predicts that firms may retain some or all of the  cost savings."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some Economists Have Argued That Offshoring Could Negatively Impact U.S. Living Standards", "paragraphs": ["Although the most commonly cited economic trade theories predict that  offshoring will likely have positive effects on the average U.S. living  standard, some trade models generate scenarios under which the U.S.  could lose either its absolute or relative position in the global economy,  and some economists have argued that services offshoring is better  described by these latter types of economic models. Models in which the  U.S. could face potential losses from increased trade such as offshoring  reflect the possibility that as our trading partners become more productive  in creating goods and services that the U.S. specializes in, the economic  position of the U.S. could be undermined. For example, Ralph Gomory and  William Baumol have described scenarios in which a trading partner  experiences productivity improvements in an important U.S. export  industry, resulting in declines in U.S. national income because U.S. firms  lose their position as the most competitive producers in the industry. The  impact on the U.S. workforce, in this model, is particularly detrimental if  the industry in which the U.S. is challenged is highly profitable and pays  high wages, such as industries in which the U.S. has long held  technological superiority or an industry that is difficult to enter. Other  economists have developed different models in which productivity  changes abroad lead to losses in the absolute or relative position of the  U.S. in the global economy. The negative results of increased trade in  these models are not specific to offshoring\u2014they could result from other  forms of trade too, but they are sometimes cited when concerns about  offshoring are raised because services offshoring raises the specter of the  movement of high-value work from the U.S. to foreign trading partners.", "Some have raised concerns that offshoring poses risks to U.S. leadership  in innovation, particularly in high-value areas such as technology fields  and research and development, raising the possibility that the global  economic position of the U.S. could be eroded over time. Economists and  other offshoring observers have suggested a range of mechanisms through  which offshoring could have a negative impact on U.S. innovation. Some  argue that innovation results from solving technical problems during  manufacturing, design, and research and development. To the extent that  this work is conducted overseas, offshoring could promote faster  technological diffusion to foreign firms, which may over time lead to  foreign competitors coming to dominate an industry in which the U.S. was  once the technological leader. Some contend that offshoring portions of  the research and development infrastructure could threaten U.S.  technological leadership by disrupting important innovation networks in  the U.S., such as the IT cluster in Silicon Valley in California, or the  biotechnology cluster in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and promoting the  emergence of such networks abroad. In addition, some express concern  that offshoring routine or entry-level work in some technical industries  could hurt the U.S.\u2019s ability to maintain an innovative workforce by closing  off career prospects for some U.S. workers and discouraging U.S. students  from entering those fields.", "Another concern raised by some economists is that offshoring could  reduce average living standards for American workers by slowing the  growth of average wages. These economists raise the concern that even if  offshoring promotes economic growth and productivity, it could decrease  labor\u2019s share of national income by subjecting American workers to direct  competition with foreign workers, leading to slower growth or even a  decline in average wages. As we previously noted, recent statistics show  a dip in the share of national income accruing to total worker  compensation in recent years, and some economists believe that  offshoring may be contributing to this trend.", "Finally, some question whether firms will use the cost savings from  offshoring in ways that lead immediately to the productivity improvements  and consumer price reductions predicted by trade theory. Under certain  market conditions, an individual firm could retain supernormal profits  (profits above the usual for their particular industry and product) for a  period of time, distributing these gains to shareholders or their remaining  employees, rather than passing on cost savings to consumers in the form  of price reductions or investing their cost savings in productivity- enhancing reorganization or new technology. Although economic theory  predicts that under many market conditions competitive forces will  constrain the ability of firms to earn supernormal profits on an ongoing  basis, the assumption that individual firms face perfectly competitive  market conditions may not necessarily be accurate. Thus, some offshoring  experts stress the importance of examining firm-level decisions to  determine whether, how, and how quickly offshoring leads to price  reductions and the reorganization of firms and industries toward  specialization in higher-productivity activity.", "Underlying the debate about the effects of offshoring on the average U.S.  standard of living are different perspectives on the following questions:    What new areas of comparative advantage will the U.S. economy develop  to compensate for declines, if any, in areas threatened by offshoring?", "How will offshoring affect average U.S. wages?

According to Bureau of Labor  Statistics (BLS) data, since 1947, the civilian employment rate has  increased gradually from around 59 percent in the 1940s and 1950s, to an  average of 66 percent over the past 20 years. During this period, the  unemployment rate has generally fluctuated between about 4 percent to   8 percent, averaging 5.6 percent per year, even though the U.S. labor force  has grown by, on average, 1.4 million people per year. Furthermore, the  U.S. employment rate has not been correlated with trade or imports. While  traded goods and services have increased from about 4 percent of the  gross domestic product (GDP) to about 14 percent of GDP over the past   60 years, employment rates have steadily increased.

For example, some private sector studies estimate that  between 100,000 to 500,000 information technology jobs will be displaced  over the next few years, and potentially several million jobs across all  occupations could shift outside the U.S. over the next decade. Several  economists have pointed out that even the larger job loss estimates  represent a relatively small percentage of the total number of jobs  destroyed and created annually in the U.S. According to BLS statistics,  since the end of the last recession in the fourth quarter of 2001, the U.S.  has shed an average of 7.64 million jobs per quarter, while creating an  average of 7.77 million jobs per quarter. Viewed in this context, some note  that estimates of the number of jobs that could be lost due to offshoring do  not appear to be as large of a shock to the economy. Moreover, some  maintain that job losses due to offshoring should also be viewed in the  context of the two-way flow of trade. Jobs are created as a result of U.S.  firms exporting goods and services to other countries and foreign firms  locating their production in the U.S. through direct foreign investment.", "Although some economists argue that trade, including offshoring, is  unlikely to affect long-term employment rates, others have noted that  increases in offshoring and globalization could lead to changes in the  structure of employment, which could lead to changes in the number of  jobs available in different occupations and industries and could also  potentially increase unemployment. Structural changes to employment  involve the permanent reallocation of workers and resources throughout  the economy. Offshoring could contribute to structural changes in  employment by changing employers\u2019 demand for different skill-sets and  occupations within certain industries. For example, offshoring could lead  to substantial reductions in low-skilled IT-based services work while  generating increases in high-skilled work such as IT systems management.  It may take a long time for the economy to replace jobs lost to structural  changes with new jobs because workers must switch industries, locations,  or skills in order to find re-employment and because employers must  create new jobs. Although the workforce should eventually adjust to the  structural changes in the economy, a significant structural change could  potentially lead to an increase in unemployment in the meantime.", "Regardless of the impact of offshoring on aggregate employment and the  unemployment rate, many economists acknowledge that offshoring and  increased trade could produce structural changes that could generate  permanent shifts within the U.S. labor market. Some economists believe  these structural changes will lead to the U.S. workforce gaining better jobs  overall, as U.S. businesses respond to offshoring and globalization by  creating jobs in new areas of specialization that capitalize on the relatively  highly skilled workforce and abundance of capital of the U.S. economy.  For example, some note that while the U.S. has lost significant numbers of  computer programming jobs, potentially due to offshoring, the U.S.  economy at the same time has experienced an increase in the number of  more sophisticated computer-related occupations, such as computer  software engineers. Other economists suggest that structural changes  could lead to lower-quality jobs if the U.S. develops comparative  advantage in areas that primarily produce low-skilled jobs.", "Research has been done on the extent to which job gains and losses in  recent years have resulted from structural changes in the economy;  however, this research does not indicate whether the structural changes  were due to offshoring.

The data limitations have led to conflicting  claims, with some arguing that offshoring is a minor phenomenon and  others arguing that it is being underestimated. For example, some cite data  from the Mass Layoff Statistics (MLS) program produced by the Bureau of  Labor Statistics, which showed that about 16,000 manufacturing and  services job separations\u2014less than 3 percent of the nonseasonal mass  layoffs that took place in 2004\u2014resulted from \u201cmovement of work\u201d to  locations outside the U.S. However, the MLS undercounts total job  separations due to offshoring because it is designed to capture only mass  layoffs, not total layoffs. In contrast, others cite privately collected data  that suggests that the extent of offshoring is much greater. For example,  some have cited data collected by Kate Bronfenbrenner and Stephanie  Luce, who attempted to measure the extent of offshoring with data  collection from media reports and other sources. Extrapolating from a  three month period, they estimate that as many as 406,000 manufacturing  and services jobs were shifted from the U.S. to other countries in 2004.", "Although there is considerable uncertainty about the number of jobs that  have been lost due to offshoring, a number of economists expect that  offshoring is likely to expand in the future, both in absolute numbers and  in types of work. For example, Cynthia Kroll has estimated that nearly   15 million people, or 12 percent of the employed labor force, are in white- collar occupations at risk to offshoring, though she notes that not all jobs  in these occupations are likely to be offshored. Private sector studies  have also attempted to create forecasts of the effects of offshoring on  employment in \u201cat-risk\u201d occupations; some of these studies project that  between 100,000 and 500,000 IT jobs will be displaced within the next few  years, and potentially several million jobs across all occupations will shift  outside the U.S. over the next decade. However, these studies face  challenges in estimating the effects of offshoring because they are often  based on federal statistics that currently provide limited information on  the level and effects of offshoring.", "Some economists have expressed concerns about the potential size of the  dislocation costs for workers who lose their jobs due to offshoring, based  in part on the experiences of manufacturing workers whose jobs were lost  due to trade; others argue that the costs of displacement might not be as  large for services workers as they have been for manufacturing workers.  Dislocation costs that workers could potentially experience include lost  income during their period of unemployment and a lifetime of reduced  wages if they cannot find a job that pays as much as the job they lost.  Dislocation costs could be higher if job losses are concentrated in  geographic areas because it may be difficult for the regional economy to  absorb so many job seekers quickly and the local real estate market could  be impacted. Research on workers dislocated from jobs in manufacturing  industries that faced import competition suggests that workers who lose  their jobs due to trade-related employment changes tend to be less likely  to find reemployment and to face larger income declines after job  displacement than workers displaced from industries that are less trade- sensitive. However, some have raised questions about whether these  results are applicable to trade-impacted services workers, who tend to  have more desirable labor market characteristics than manufacturing  workers. Research by J. Bradford Jensen and Lori Kletzer suggests that in  recent years, services workers displaced from \u201ctradable jobs\u201d\u2014jobs in  industries and occupations likely to be affected by trade\u2014had labor  market advantages over those displaced from \u201cnon-tradable\u201d service  sector jobs and from manufacturing jobs, such as more education and  higher predisplacement earnings. Re-employment rates were slightly  higher for displaced service sector workers in tradable jobs, compared to  those in non-tradable jobs, and were significantly higher than the  reemployment rates for displaced manufacturing workers. Earnings losses  were significant for displaced services workers in tradable jobs, however.  Of those re-employed, 55 percent experienced a decrease in earnings, with  the average re-employed worker experiencing a 30 percent decline in  earnings after reemployment. These large losses reflect the fact that  displaced services workers in tradable jobs tended to have had relatively  high wages prior to displacement.", "Underlying the debate about the effects of offshoring on employment and  job displacement are different perspectives on the following questions:    Will offshoring contribute to structural changes in U.S. employment, and  how will these changes affect aggregate employment levels and the type of  occupations available to U.S. workers?", "How many workers will be displaced due to offshoring?", "What are the reemployment experiences of workers dislocated due to  offshoring?"], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Potential Impacts on the Distribution of Income", "paragraphs": ["Some economists have expressed concern that offshoring could accelerate  income inequality in the U.S.; however, others argue that changes in the  income distribution are driven primarily by factors unrelated to offshoring,  and still others point out that offshoring could potentially decrease income  inequality.

Some contend that offshoring will  increase income inequality and note several possible ways that it could do  so. First, offshoring could increase income inequality if it primarily led to  job losses or wage reductions among relatively low-income workers but  had less of an effect on the jobs or wages of middle- and higher-income  workers. Some offshoring observers argue that offshoring in the service  sector has thus far primarily affected lower-wage jobs, such as call-center  work and office support functions, rather than middle- or higher-income  jobs. Second, some economists and policy analysts have expressed  concern that offshoring could reduce wages at the middle of the income  distribution and lead to a \u201chollowing out\u201d of the middle class if it is  primarily middle-income jobs that are moved offshore or experience wage  declines. For example, some economists and other policy analysts have  noted that sophisticated and well-paid job functions, such as computer  programming and radiology analysis, are increasingly susceptible to  offshoring. In addition, some contend that offshoring will lead to increased  inequality by contributing to income growth among those at the high-end  of the income distribution. For example, an increase in corporate profits  resulting from offshoring may promote growth in high-wage managerial  positions and income accruing to business owners.", "However, some economists contend that offshoring could also reduce  income inequality if it leads to job losses or reduced wages among higher- wage occupations, such as engineering, without significantly affecting the  jobs and wages of low-wage workers. In addition, some argue that  offshoring could reduce inequality if it led to a decline in the wages, and  consequently fees charged, by highly compensated workers who provide  services to lower- and middle-income households. For example, if  offshoring puts downward pressure on the wages of accountants, the  resulting decrease in the cost of accounting services represents an  increase in real wages for lower- and middle-income households who use  these services, reducing inequality.", "Trade theory can provide a rationale for those who have noted that  offshoring could lead to increasing income inequality. One of the most  commonly cited models, the Heckscher-Ohlin model, predicts that when  the U.S. initiates or expands trade with a country that has a dissimilar  workforce, such as a developing country, this trade is likely to have a  negative effect on the distribution of wage income within the U.S.  workforce. For example, when trade expands between the U.S., a country  with a large pool of highly-skilled and educated workers, and a developing  country with a large pool of less skilled and educated workers, this model  generally predicts that the U.S. will specialize in those goods and services  that are best produced by more skilled and educated workers, while the  developing country will specialize in those goods and services best  produced by less skilled and less educated workers. The implication of  this international specialization for U.S. workers is that demand for skilled  workers in the U.S. will grow, while demand for less skilled workers in the  U.S. will shrink. As a result, wages for more skilled and educated U.S.  workers will increase relative to the wages of less skilled and educated  U.S. workers, thus increasing income inequality. However, to the extent  that services offshoring involves the movement of higher-skilled work to  developing countries, more complex versions of this model generate  different predictions about income inequality in the U.S.\u2014income  inequality could decline if the demand for higher-skilled workers declines  relative to the demand for lower-skilled workers.", "Although many economists agree that international trade, including  offshoring, could have some impact on the distribution of income, some  argue that these factors are not among the more important determinants  of the U.S. income distribution. These economists argue that other factors  are much more significant determinants of the changing U.S. income  distribution. In particular, technological change is viewed by some  economists as the primary determinant of the growing wage gap between  more and less skilled workers. Many economists claim that as  technological advances have occurred, particularly in computers and IT,  requirements for technological skills for workers across a range of  occupations have increased, requirements that often translate into  increased demand for more educated workers. At the same time,  technological advances have permitted some routine work to be  automated, decreasing demand for less-skilled workers. Numerous studies  have examined whether trade or technological change explained a larger  share of the growing wage gap between more and less educated workers  during the 1980s and 1990s, with the majority concluding that  technological change was a more important determinant than trade. On  balance, these studies conclude that trade has made a small contribution  to the increase in income inequality. Estimates suggest that trade explains  between 10 and 20 percent of the increase in income inequality, with the  majority of the increase attributable to other factors such as technological  change that favors higher-skilled workers.

Software security experts in the  public sector\u2014including DOD and the Central Intelligence Agency\u2014have  expressed concern that organizations and individuals with hostile  intentions, such as terrorist organizations and foreign government  economic and information warfare units, could gain direct access to  software code by infiltrating or otherwise influencing contractor and  subcontractor staff, and then use this code to perpetrate attacks on U.S.  infrastructure systems or conduct industrial or other forms of espionage.  Security experts also note that critical infrastructure systems rely  extensively on commercial off the shelf (COTS) software programs that  are developed in locations around the world. These programs include  exploitable vulnerabilities and potentially even malicious code that can  allow indirect access to infrastructure systems to cause the systems to  perform in unintended ways.

Some fear  that offshoring certain high-tech work may lead to the transfer of  information and technology that could be used by foreign entities to match  or counter current U.S. technical and military superiority.

Services offshoring is a relatively recent  phenomenon that raises a broad range of issues. No federal data series  directly measure the extent of offshoring or its effects. Moreover, experts  have expressed differing views about the potential impacts of offshoring.  Nevertheless, there are some key areas where further research might help  to provide more information about the impacts and policy implications of  services offshoring. These areas include  impacts of offshoring on various sectors of the U.S. economy, and  especially the sectors that are emerging as new sources of comparative  advantage; impacts of offshoring on the workforce, such as numbers of workers  displaced and their reemployment experiences; impacts of offshoring on the U.S. income distribution, including trends in  wage levels of jobs moving offshore; and    any increased security-related risks posed by offshoring and the extent to  which these are mitigated by current practices and laws.", "Further research in these areas could help inform policy making by  providing more information about the nature and magnitude of the  benefits and costs resulting from offshoring. For example, research on  whether offshoring is negatively impacting important sectors of the  economy could help to inform the need for new policies to enhance U.S.  competitiveness. Further information on the number of job losses  resulting from offshoring as well as how workers fare in the labor market  after their dislocations could help inform the need for new policies to  assist displaced workers and to target these policies appropriately.  Research on how offshoring is affecting the distribution of income in the  U.S. could help to inform policy makers whether new policies are needed  to address income inequality. Research that examines whether offshoring  increases risks to national security, critical infrastructure, and consumer  privacy can help to inform policy makers whether there is a need for  additional security protections. Finally, research in all of these areas may  help to advance the debate about whether policies to reduce the extent of  offshoring are warranted.", "Researchers are conducting studies that can shed light on some of these  areas. For example, some researchers have conducted case studies that  examine the effects of offshoring in the semiconductor, call center, and  radiology industries. Among other issues, these studies examined the  types of work that are conducted offshore and the types of work that are  conducted in the U.S. In their study of the radiology industry, for instance,  Frank Levy and Ari Goelman conclude that radiology work conducted  overseas is unlikely to displace radiology work done in the U.S., noting  that offshore work primarily consists of preliminary readings of  radiological images conducted at night when few radiologists in the   U.S. would be available. However, the radiology industry may not be  comparable with other industries in which offshoring takes place. Other  researchers have utilized statistical methods for analyzing existing data  series. For example, Martin Baily and Robert Lawrence have used a variety  of methods to analyze trade and employment data and examine  offshoring\u2019s effects on unemployment. In some instances, researchers  may be able to apply statistical methods that were utilized in research on  offshoring and trade in the manufacturing sector to conduct research on  services offshoring.", "There may also be opportunities to expand or improve current federal data  series to obtain more information on this topic. For example, some have  raised concerns that there is a significant discrepancy between data on the  levels of services imports from India as reported by U.S. federal  government sources and the data reported by India. In a review of BEA  and Indian services data, we identified several factors that contributed to  this discrepancy, such as differences in each country\u2019s definitions of trade  in services. We also recommended ways in which BEA can further  improve its services trade data. Other examples of limitations of current  databases identified by offshoring researchers are that data on services  trade are not available at a sufficiently detailed industry level, trade data  may not capture services that are bundled with goods or other services,  and data on foreign affiliates of multinational corporations lack  information on occupations of workers employed overseas.", "Table 1 illustrates some key areas where further research might contribute  to a better understanding of the effects and policy implications of  offshoring. The table identifies some pertinent data sources, though none  of the sources can directly answer the research questions. Generally  speaking, these data sources can provide information on a phenomenon,  such as changes in employment in a given occupation or changes in the  output produced by an industry, but they cannot provide information on  the extent to which these changes resulted from offshoring. For example,  BLS collects data on employment levels in various industries and  occupations, but the data capture job losses and gains that occur for all  reasons, not only because of offshoring. Table 1 also identifies some of the  methodological approaches that have been, or could be, used in these  areas of research. These include conducting in-depth studies of firms and  industries and using statistical methods for analyzing existing data. Table 1  also highlights some potential challenges and limitations of the various  approaches.
