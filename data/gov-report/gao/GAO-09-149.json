Although DDSs pay most medical providers for medical records and SSA pays the DDSs to cover these expenses, 14 of 51 DDSs reported the percentage of requests for which they did not receive records was 20 percent or more in fiscal year 2007. In response to this challenge, all DDSs conduct follow-up with providers and claimants to urge them to provide records. Over half of the DDSs (34 of 51) have also implemented more timely payments for records and six increased the amount they pay. Although SSA evaluates DDS collection of medical records, it does not compile key data necessary to identify and share promising collection practices. Recruiting and retaining qualified providers is a challenge to obtaining consultative exams needed to supplement insufficient medical records. For example, 41 of 51 DDSs reported routinely asking claimants' own providers to perform these exams; yet 34 reported providers never or almost never agree to do so. DDSs directors in our survey believe that current payment rates account for some of the difficulty recruiting and retaining consultative exam providers. In response to these challenges, 32 DDSs rely on medical providers who specialize in performing disability evaluations, and 20 pay providers for time spent preparing for appointments claimants fail to attend. SSA evaluates evidence from consultative exams, but these evaluations and the data they yield are too limited to identify and share promising DDS practices. SSA has made progress moving to electronic collection of medical records, but faces challenges in fully implementing electronic retrieval and analysis of medical evidence. SSA now uses electronic images instead of paper copies of new claimants' records. Though SSA seeks to obtain all records electronically and provides options for online submission of records, only one large provider accounts for most of the records submitted online, and about half of all records received are on paper. To date, SSA has taken only limited action to identify and analyze the barriers providers face in using current electronic record submission options, and has not developed a strategy to address them. In the long run, SSA is participating in an advanced prototype to collect medical records in formats that can be searched and analyzed by electronically querying a hospital's records database and directly retrieving the claimants' records."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Social Security Administration (SSA) has faced challenges for decades  in making accurate and timely decisions on whether claimants have  impairments that qualify them to receive disability benefits. Some  disability applicants whose claims are denied and appeal wait years for  their claims to be decided at the final administrative appeals level, which  can be a hardship. In fiscal year 2006, 30 percent of claims processed at  the hearings stage alone took 600 days or more. To help avoid such  hardships and improve its process, SSA Commissioners have emphasized  the need to make the right decision at the beginning of the process. The  prompt collection of relevant medical evidence is key to SSA\u2019s process for  deciding each year whether about 2.5 million new claimants have  impairments that qualify them to receive disability benefits. SSA estimates  that in fiscal year 2007, disability cases prompted an estimated 15 million  to 20 million medical records requests sent to providers including  hospitals, physicians, psychologists, and community health centers. The  number of new claimants is expected to increase as the baby boom  generation ages. To promptly make consistent and accurate decisions on a  high volume of claims, SSA needs efficient and effective methods to  collect medical evidence, including records from claimants\u2019 own medical  providers as well as consultative examinations and tests performed by  other medical providers.", "To be eligible for disability benefits under SSA law, individuals must have  a medically determinable impairment that prevents them from engaging in  substantial gainful activity, and is expected to last at least a year, or result  in death. The initial determination of disability is generally made by  federally funded, SSA-authorized state agencies called Disability  Determination Services (DDS). DDSs help claimants collect medical and  other evidence of their impairments. When medical records obtained from  claimants\u2019 own providers are inconclusive, DDSs obtain additional  evidence through consultative examinations. In most cases, DDSs pay  medical providers for the medical records and consultative exams at rates  set by the states within limits set by SSA, and SSA pays DDSs to cover  these expenses. SSA reported that in fiscal year 2007, it paid DDSs about  $1.7 billion dollars for their services, including $123 million for medical  records and $311 million for consultative examinations. SSA and DDSs are  working to transform what is largely a paper process into a computerized  one, as the medical community moves to electronic medical records.", "To respond to your concern about the adequacy of medical evidence  collection in the disability determination process, we evaluated: (1) the  challenges, if any, in collecting medical records from the claimants\u2019 own  providers and ways SSA and DDSs are responding to these challenges;   (2) the challenges, if any, in obtaining high-quality consultative exams and  ways SSA and DDSs are responding to these challenges; and (3) the  progress SSA has made in moving from paper to electronic collection of  medical evidence.", "To address these topics, we conducted background research and  interviews with SSA, SSA Office of the Inspector General, and DDS  officials. We also spoke with representatives of professional associations,  including those representing people with disabilities; disability examiners;  physicians; representatives of claimants; and medical providers. We  conducted a Web-based survey of DDSs in all 50 states and the District of  Columbia concerning medical evidence collection for initial disability  decisions, including DDS practices for collection of medical records and  medical opinions from claimants\u2019 own providers and from consultative  exam providers. To learn more about how DDSs collect medical evidence,  we reviewed a random, but nonprojectable, sample of 100 claim folders for  initial DDS disability determinations during fiscal year 2007; to document  the differences in medical evidence collection between the initial and  appeals levels, we reviewed a random sample of 50 administrative law  judges\u2019 decisions and their associated claim folders. We conducted site  visits to DDSs in large and small states in various geographic regions that  purchased medical records for a relatively high or low percentage of  claimants, and that requested consultative examinations for a relatively  high or low percentage of claimants. Based on these criteria, we visited  California, Mississippi, New York, Vermont, and Wyoming. We also  analyzed SSA data concerning the disability determination process,  including SSA data on DDS cases, and quality assurance reviews of DDS  cases by SSA regional Disability Quality Branches. To assess progress in  moving from paper to electronic collection of medical evidence, we  reviewed SSA documents concerning SSA and the health industry\u2019s efforts  and analyzed data compiled by SSA\u2019s computer system regarding receipts  of evidence and discussed efforts to encourage electronic submission with  SSA and DDS officials, as well as medical providers. We conducted our  review between September 2007 and December 2008 in accordance with  generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards  require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate  evidence to provide a reasonable basis for out findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained  provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our  audit objectives. For details concerning our scope and methodology, see  appendix I.

In 2007, SSA paid about $99 billion in DI  benefits to about 8.1 million workers, spouses, and dependents. The  average monthly benefit was $1,004 for disabled workers. SSI is a means- tested income assistance program created in 1972 that provides a financial  safety net for people who are aged, blind, or disabled, and have low  incomes and limited assets. Unlike the DI program, SSI has no prior work  requirements. In 2007, SSA paid about $37 billion in SSI benefits. As of  December 2007 about 7.4 million recipients received an average monthly  benefit of $468.

The disability  determination process, which is the same for DI and SSI claimants,  involves an initial determination of disability and provides up to two levels  of administrative review within SSA. A claimant first completes an  application, or claim, for DI or SSI benefits, which includes information  regarding illnesses, injuries, or conditions and a signature giving SSA  permission to request medical records from medical care providers. Once  the SSA field office staff verify that nonmedical eligibility requirements are  met, the claim is sent to the state\u2019s DDS office for determination of  medical disability. If the claim is approved, a claimant will be notified and  will receive benefits, including limited retroactive benefits for some DI  claimants. Additionally, if the claim is approved, a claimant may become  eligible for Medicaid or Medicare health coverage. If the claim is rejected,  a claimant has 60 days to request that the DDS reconsider its decision. If  the DDS reconsideration determination concurs with the initial denial of  benefits, the claimant has 60 days to appeal and request a hearing before  an SSA administrative law judge (ALJ). A claimant may appeal an  unfavorable administrative law judge decision to SSA\u2019s appeals council,  which includes administrative appeals judges and appeals officers and,  finally, to federal court. SSA and DDS officials (examiners and ALJs)  determine disability using a five-step sequential process based on evidence  such as medical findings and statements of functional capacity obtained  during the initial determination process and updated as necessary at each  appeal level.

DDSs generally pay providers for records and SSA pays the DDSs to cover  these expenses. Each DDS determines its payment rates for medical and  other services necessary to make determinations, subject to certain  limits. DDSs request laboratory reports, X-rays, doctors\u2019 notes, and other  information used in assessing the claimant\u2019s health and functional  capability from many types of providers including: physicians or  psychologists; hospitals; community health centers; schools (for child  claimants); and Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), military, or prison  health care facilities.

SSA directs DDSs to make \u201cevery  reasonable effort\u201d to help the claimant obtain medical reports, which SSA  defines as one initial medical records request and, if needed, one follow-up  request within 10 to 20 days, when providers have not responded, unless  experience with a particular provider warrants more time. DDSs allow a  minimum of 10 days after the follow-up request for the provider to reply.

This process uses a computer model using certain key terms in the claim  file to identify claims for which a decision of disability is likely and  medical evidence establishing disability can be easily obtained. DDSs can  use expedited processes for these claims; for example, DDS staff in a  couple of states we visited explained how they request and receive  medical records for Quick Disability Determination cases by fax.

One DDS director noted that public health clinics and  hospitals are overburdened providing patient care and that medical  records programs get short shrift. According to both DDS officials and  providers we interviewed, generating records for disability claims takes  lower priority than patient care and costs money for medical records staff  time and contracted copy services, for example.

Provider response to these  requests for medical records is inconsistent; some submit records to the  DDSs within 10 days, others never respond at all. Timeliness of medical  record receipt is a central concern because SSA tracks how long it takes to  process initial claims, and measures DDSs against regulatory performance  standards.

Examiners may find out about  additional medical providers as they review the records in the file, for  example, and must generally request records from those providers. In our  review of 100 initial claim files, we identified 19 in which DDS examiners  requested records from providers who had treated the claimant but had  not been identified on the application.", "In addition to contacting multiple providers, DDS examiners must develop  evidence for all of the claimed impairments, which can be numerous and  include both mental and physical conditions. During our site visits, DDS  claims examiners told us that claims involving mental impairments posed  particular documentation challenges, noting that some claimants with  mental impairments may have difficulty obtaining treatment or accurately  describing their medical histories. Furthermore, SSA regulations include  some specific requirements for collecting evidence of mental impairments.  For example, generally where there is indication of a possible mental  impairment, SSA regulations establish a special technique to be used when  evaluating the severity of mental impairments, which includes rating the  claimant\u2019s degree of functional limitation in four broad functional areas  and recording the results of this evaluation on a standard document.", "The opinions of providers with an ongoing treatment relationship with the  claimant are a particularly important source of evidence for disability  determinations. Treating providers\u2019 opinions about the nature and severity  of the claimant\u2019s impairment often are given great deference in SSA  regulations. Examiners must give controlling weight to treating providers\u2019  opinions if they are not inconsistent with the other substantial evidence in  the case record and are well supported by medically acceptable clinical  and laboratory diagnostic techniques. Yet, of the 51 DDSs we surveyed,  none reported that half or more were willing to provide such opinion  statements, and 15 indicated that none or almost none were willing to  provide the statements. Almost all DDSs (48 of 51) reported asking for  treating sources\u2019 opinion statements in their initial medical records  requests, but as table 2 shows, DDSs are not always successful at  obtaining those statements, even after multiple requests, and the  statements they receive are not always helpful in making their  determinations.", "A good and useful MSS  both states a quantification of the  effects of the condition on the claimant\u2019s ability to function and an explanation as to  how the assessment is supported by the evidence.

This annoys them and  usually does not come to a beneficial or happy result.", "DDS officials and providers described various reasons why treating  providers may be reluctant to submit medical source statements. Treating  providers may be concerned that submitting their medical opinion to the  DDS might interfere with the doctor-patient relationship, and they also  typically focus on diagnosis and treatment rather than evaluation of  functional ability.

DDS directors  reported in our survey that claimants fail to attend approximately 16  percent of consultative exam appointments on average, with 40 of the 51  directors providing this information. When asked the reason why  claimants fail to attend these appointments, DDS directors reported that  claimants sometimes miss appointments for reasons including  transportation challenges, unmet needs for someone to accompany the  claimant to the appointment, reluctance to take part in the exam, or  inability to attend due to a mental or physical health condition. Regardless  of the reason for claimants\u2019 failure to attend scheduled exams, several  DDS examiners we spoke with identified missed consultative exams as a  major problem which may affect providers\u2019 willingness to participate. If a  claimant misses an appointment, providers lose revenue if they are unable  to substitute another patient and cannot bill the DDSs for the missed  exam. When asked to what extent provider concerns about missed  consultative exam appointments posed challenges, almost half of DDS  directors (24 of 51) reported that such concerns posed challenges to a  great or very great extent, although some DDSs (20) reimburse providers  for time spent preparing for missed consultative exams.", "Current payment rates also may contribute to the DDSs\u2019 challenges  recruiting and retaining consultative exam providers who submit high- quality reports. Almost all DDS directors (50 of 51) reported that DDS fee  schedules posed a challenge, at least to some extent, to recruiting and  retaining a panel of highly qualified consultative exam providers. Several  DDS officials told us current consultative exam payment rates affect their  ability to recruit and retain consultative exam providers in their states. For  example, California DDS officials commented that current consultative  exam payment rates are below prevailing payment rates in the state.  Wyoming DDS officials also told us that payment rates pose challenges to  the recruitment of providers for Wyoming\u2019s consultative exam provider  pool.", "Consultative exam payment varies among DDSs nationwide. SSA  regulations require that payments to providers for consultative exams not  exceed the highest rate paid by federal or other agencies in the state for  the same or similar services. Within those parameters, DDSs vary in the  type of payment rates they use as benchmarks for consultative exams.  (See fig. 4.)", "Many DDS directors (17 of 51) also indicated that in their opinion current  payment amounts in their states are not high enough to ensure that the  DDS receives timely, high-quality consultative exam reports. For those  DDSs, seven also reported that consultative exam reports only sometimes  demonstrated sufficient familiarity with the claimants\u2019 medical records  and history to support the assessment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some DDSs Rely on High- Volume Consultative Exam Providers or Pay Providers for Preparing for Missed Appointments", "paragraphs": ["Some DDSs have adopted responses to the challenge of recruiting and  retaining consultative exam providers by (1) relying on high-volume  providers whose practices focus primarily on performing disability  evaluations and (2) adjusting consultative exam payments. As shown in  figure 5, most DDSs (32 of 51) report they often use high-volume providers  to conduct consultative exams for claimants in their state. Twenty-nine  indicated that using these providers has a moderately positive or very  positive effect on the quality of the consultative exam reports they receive.", "At least one DDS has taken the concept of high-volume consultative exam  providers one step further. The New York DDS expanded its use of high- volume consultative exam providers by hiring contractors to recruit  consultative exam providers and manage claimants\u2019 appointments. New  York DDS officials reported that the majority of consultative examinations  now are conducted through these contractors in areas of the state covered  by contracts. As described to us by New York DDS officials, these  contracts provide for extensive training of new consultative exam  providers that can last several months, content and timeliness  requirements for exam reports, and quality assurance including surveys of  claimants and inspection of providers\u2019 facilities.", "Some DDSs have adjusted their payments for consultative exams to  address recruitment challenges in their states. For example, Wyoming  currently pays usual and customary rates that providers receive for similar  exams throughout the state. Wyoming DDS officials reported that they  make use of such a structure due to the sparse population and small  number of medical providers that service their state, approximately 1,000.  According to Wyoming DDS officials, a relatively small portion of these  providers are willing to perform consultative exams for the DDS and they  believe that without usual and customary payment, even fewer providers  would be willing to conduct them. In addition, many DDSs (20 of 51) pay  consultative exam providers for the time they spend preparing for exams  that claimants fail to attend, which may help DDSs retain their  consultative exam provider pool. Among those 20 DDSs reporting that  they offer such payments, the average payment provided was about $44.", "Finally, DDSs engage in various activities to facilitate claimant attendance  at consultative exams. The most common activities reported are reminder  letters and telephone calls and reimbursement for travel costs (see table  3). Examiners at two of the DDSs we visited described arranging for  consultative exam providers to perform in-home evaluations for claimants  whose impairments kept them confined to their homes. Examiners noted  that \u201cthird parties\u201d\u2014family members or social workers listed as contacts  on the application for benefits\u2014may help facilitate consultative exam  appointments, especially for claimants who are homeless or who have  mental or developmental impairments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "SSA Reviews Consultative Exams and DDS Decisions, but Does Not Evaluate DDS Practices to Address Recruitment and Retention Challenges", "paragraphs": ["While SSA evaluates consultative exams as part of its quality assurance  review process and collects data on spending for consultative exams, it  has not evaluated the effectiveness of varied DDS responses to challenges  related to recruiting and retaining consultative exam providers.

Electronic medical evidence\u2014even  in the form of electronic images\u2014facilitates collaboration between SSA  and DDSs. For example, electronic files have enabled SSA to implement a  new process for resolving disagreements concerning DDS disability  decisions reviewed by SSA before initial decisions are finalized. Rather  than having SSA reviewers in each regional office review DDS decisions  only in that region, electronic access to records enables staff in other  regions and policy staff in SSA headquarters to review cases remotely. SSA  introduced this process to promote more nationally consistent  interpretations of SSA policy.

SSA  maintains several avenues for providers to submit medical evidence  online, and nearly all DDS directors (48 of 51) reported that DDS outreach  to providers very often addressed options for electronic submission.  Some providers, however, have told DDS officials they find SSA\u2019s online  submission options inconvenient, difficult to use, or beyond their technical  expertise. For example, many providers do not use SSA\u2019s Electronic  Record Express Web site to submit records, although it was designed to  provide an efficient option for submitting medical records. This Web site  limits the number of files that can be sent at one time, which is  problematic for large providers such as big hospitals or medical centers.  Additionally, infrequent users must call a designated DDS official to reset  expired passwords if too much time has passed between submissions.  SSA officials told us some providers opt to pay a commercial service to  submit medical records, because the service provides for the submission  of many files at once, which can be a more efficient option for providers of  large volumes of medical records. SSA has recently deployed its own tool  for submission of many files at once, called Webservices, but to use this  option, medical providers must develop their own software interface to  SSA\u2019s Web site. Although SSA provides some technical support, some  providers may still find this option beyond their technical expertise. As of  November 2008, only two medical record providers were using  Webservices.

In order to use online options for submitting medical records to  SSA, some providers with electronic medical record systems may either  need to convert files or print and scan them. In some cases, providers may  find this too time consuming to be feasible. Although some providers have  registered as Web site users, the difficulties encountered were enough to  make them stop using it. A DDS professional relations officer said that  they were getting so many calls from providers having problems with the  Web site that they had to designate someone to handle the calls. On the  other hand, the Mississippi DDS had early success encouraging providers  to use the Web site by contracting with a former SSA official who provided  detailed \u201cstart to finish\u201d guidance on how to use the Web site.", "SSA held conferences in two cities in March 2008 to give its Web site users  an opportunity to express their concerns, and made some modifications to  the Web site in July 2008, but SSA has conducted only limited study of the  problems with electronic submission of medical records or analyzed the  barriers various groups of providers face using the site (such as small- and  medium-volume users), and they have not developed a strategy for  overcoming these barriers. The agency has made progress responding to  some user concerns, for example, by enabling claimants\u2019 representatives  to view clients\u2019 folders online, but SSA has not developed a strategy to  address the concerns of other user groups.", "SSA\u2019s efforts to realize its electronic submission goal also are hindered by  the uneven pace of the medical community\u2019s acceptance of electronic  records.

Most surveyed DDS  directors (32 of 51) reported that options for submitting medical evidence  in these new formats would be of great or very great value. In its strategic  plan for fiscal years 2008 to 2013, SSA established a goal to transform its  medical evidence collection process by automatically requesting and  receiving electronic medical records through a nationwide health  information network. This network is expected to enable medical  providers to securely exchange electronic medical records in uniform  formats. This will enable SSA to automatically search and analyze the  records at the start of the disability determination process.

For example, SSA and a  Boston hospital have launched a prototype effort by which SSA  electronically queries the hospital\u2019s computer and retrieves the hospital\u2019s  electronic medical records for specific claimants. SSA plans to expand  the Boston initiative to additional providers in the future. However,  industry standards and protocols need to be further developed before this  process can be replicated widely. For example, standards have only  recently been developed for the document format used in the Boston  initiative called the \u201ccontinuity of care document.\u201d This format is an  electronic exchange standard for sharing patient summary information.

The difficulties some DDSs have in obtaining requested  medical records and ensuring that claimants attend consultative exams  suggest opportunities for continued improvement in the medical evidence  collection process. Some DDSs have independently developed varied  approaches to respond to these challenges; and all DDSs might benefit  from learning from one another and testing and adopting some of these  approaches, as appropriate. SSA, however, currently lacks some important  data necessary to evaluate these approaches and identify promising  practices, which might be shared to promote more timely and complete  collection of relevant medical evidence by all DDSs.", "Meanwhile, SSA efforts to improve the use of consultative examinations  and the collection of medical records proceed as the medical community  undertakes a major transformation from paper to computer records. With  a presidential goal of widespread adoption of electronic medical records  by 2014, increasing numbers of providers may have certified electronic  records systems capable of fulfilling DDS records requests in electronic  formats. As a high-volume user of these records, SSA has incentives to  keep pace with industry standards. As such, the prospect of electronically  requesting and receiving medical records being explored by SSA and a  Boston hospital, and in the development of the nationwide health  information network, among other projects, holds promise for achieving  even greater efficiencies in medical evidence collection for disability cases  in the long run. In the near term, SSA has opportunities to realize greater  efficiencies in the collection of medical evidence by encouraging providers  to submit records online, saving both time and money by dispensing with  inefficient copying and scanning.

SSA guidance for DDSs is included in SSA\u2019s  Program Operations Manual System. Its counterpart for ALJs is called the  Hearings, Appeals, and Litigation Law Manual.", "To obtain information on how medical evidence is collected at the ALJ  hearing level, we reviewed electronic copies of 50 claims that were  decided at the appeals level during the first half of fiscal year 2008. Claims  were randomly selected from all decided initial disability claims  nationwide which had a certified, fully electronic folder. The small sample  size means that the information we obtained from these selected cases  cannot be considered representative of all cases at the appeals level, but it  provides examples of how medical evidence is collected at the appeals  level. These included 34 fully favorable decisions, 1 partially favorable  decision (a changed date for onset of the claimant\u2019s disability), and 10  unfavorable decisions. In 4 cases, the case was dismissed or the claimant  withdrew. The tables below summarize results from our review of these  cases:  ALJs often gather nonmedical as well as medical evidence to reach a  decision. They typically observe the claimant during the hearing, in- person, or by video conference. One ALJ wrote, for example,  \u201cFurthermore, the state agency consultants did not adequately consider  that the claimant\u2019s statements concerning the intensity, persistence and  limiting effects of these symptoms are generally credible.\u201d Hearings also  sometimes involve evidence from vocational experts\u2014experts in assessing  a claimant\u2019s ability to perform various jobs. In 3 of the 50 cases reviewed,  the ALJ cited medical-vocational rules as the basis of their decision. By the  time the cases we reviewed were decided by the SSA hearings office,  medical evidence had typically been added that was not available at the  time of the initial DDS decision. In most of these cases, the claimant\u2019s  representative collected the new evidence and submitted it to SSA. Often  this included evidence from sources that had not provided medical  records at the initial DDS level. In several cases the representative  obtained a medical source statement from a source that had not previously  submitted one, but had provided medical records. In 12 cases, evidence  indicated that the claimant\u2019s condition proved more prolonged than the  DDS expected."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Comments from the Social Security Administration", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Michael J.
