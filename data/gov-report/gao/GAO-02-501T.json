Because no adults in these families received either Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) or state maintenance-of-effort funds, work requirements and time limits did not apply. Welfare reform legislation passed in 1996 included a caseload reduction credit that reduces each state's mandated participation rate if its welfare caseload declines. Because of the dramatic declines in welfare caseloads since 1996, states have generally seen greatly reduced participation rates for TANF programs. After accounting for cases involving only children, states excluded 11 percent of the remaining 1.4 million families with an adult from federal or state time limits.

The 1996 Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity  Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) significantly changed federal welfare policy  for low-income families with children, building upon and expanding state- level reforms. When the Congress created the Temporary Assistance for  Needy Families block grant (TANF) to replace the previous welfare  program, it emphasized that the new program was to be transitional in  nature and focus on moving welfare recipients into employment. To this  end, states are required to enforce work requirements and time limits on  most families receiving cash assistance. More specifically, states face  financial penalties if they do not include a minimum percentage of adults  receiving cash assistance in work or work activities each year, referred to  as the mandated participation rate requirement. This mandated rate  increased each year, reaching 50 percent of all families in fiscal year 2002.  In addition, states are to enforce a 60-month lifetime limit on families with  adults who receive cash assistance. To receive its TANF block grant, each  state must also meet a maintenance-of-effort requirement, under which it  must spend at least a specified amount of its own funds, referred to as  state maintenance-of-effort funds (MOE).", "Along with these federal requirements, the law allows states considerable  flexibility to exclude families from work requirements and time limits.  First, these requirements only apply to families with an adult receiving aid,  not to cases in which only children receive cash assistance. Second,  PRWORA specifies that up to 20 percent of families receiving assistance  may receive extensions to federal time limits. Third, states may provide  cash assistance not subject to work requirements and time limits if they  use their state MOE in specified ways, such as through a state program  other than their TANF program.", "As the Congress considers reauthorization of TANF, you asked us to  determine and assess the states\u2019 implementation of these work  requirements and time limits. More specifically, you asked us to determine  (1) the extent of child-only cases among the cash assistance caseload  funded by federal TANF and state MOE, (2) how states made use of work  requirement flexibility, (3) the number of families states have excluded  from time limits, and (4) key issues related to states\u2019 experiences in  applying TANF work requirements and time limits. The information we  gathered came from site-visits in 4 states, telephone interviews with TANF  officials in 8 other states, and a survey administered to TANF officials in  all 50 states and the District of Columbia. We conducted our work from  August 2001 through February 2002, in accordance with generally  accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["PRWORA made sweeping changes to national welfare policy, creating  TANF and ending the federal entitlement to assistance for eligible needy  families with children under Aid to Families With Dependent Children  (AFDC). The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)  administers the TANF block grant program, which provides states with up  to $16.5 billion each year through fiscal year 2002. TANF was designed to  help needy families reduce their dependence on welfare and move toward  economic independence. The law also greatly increased the discretion  states have in the design and operation of their welfare programs, allowing  states to determine forms of aid and the categories of families eligible for  aid. TANF establishes time limits and work requirements for adults  receiving aid and requires states to sustain 75 to 80 percent of their  historic level of welfare spending through a maintenance-of-effort  requirement.

While the intent of  TANF is to provide temporary, time-limited aid, federal time limits do not  apply to all forms of aid or to all families receiving aid. First, states are  only to count toward the 60-month time limit any month in which an  individual receives a service or benefit considered \u201cassistance,\u201d which is  defined in the TANF regulations as cash or other forms of benefits  designed to meet a family\u2019s ongoing basic needs. Second, time limits do  not apply to the following types of cases:  1.\t Cases in which the adult in the household does not receive cash  assistance, typically called \u201cchild-only\u201d cases.2.\t Families that received assistance while living in Indian country or an  Native Alaskan village where 50 percent of the adults are not  employed.", "Third, all states have the option to use federal funds to extend assistance  beyond the federal 60-month limit for reasons of hardship, as defined by  the state. States can extend assistance for up to 20 percent of the average  monthly number of families receiving assistance (\u201c20 percent extension\u201d).States can also extend assistance for victims of domestic violence through  federally approved domestic violence waivers.Finally, assistance that is  provided solely through state MOE is not subject to the federal time limit.", "TANF also establishes work requirements for adults receiving aid. After 2  years of assistance, or sooner if the state determines the recipient is ready,  TANF adults are generally required to be engaged in work as defined by  the state. In addition, TANF establishes required work participation  rates\u2014a steadily rising specified minimum percentage of adult recipients  that must participate in federally specified work or work-related activities  each year.  States were required in federal fiscal year 2002 to meet a work  participation rate of 50 percent for all TANF families with adult  members\u2014referred to as the rate for all families. States were also required  to meet a much higher rate\u201490 percent\u2014for two-parent families. States  must meet these work participation rates to avoid financial penalties.", "While states have generally met the work participation rate for all families,  many states have faced financial penalties due to failure to meet the two- parent required rate in recent years. HHS issued penalty notices to 19  states in fiscal year 1997, 14 in fiscal year 1998, 9 in fiscal year 1999, and to  7 states in fiscal year 2000.", "In addition to establishing federal participation rate requirements,  PRWORA specified that the required rates are to be reduced if a state\u2019s  TANF caseload declines. States are allowed caseload reduction credits,  which reduce each state\u2019s work participation requirement by one  percentage point for each percentage point by which its average monthly  caseload falls short of its fiscal year 1995 level (for reasons other than  eligibility changes).", "In addition, federal time limits and work requirements may not apply in  some states that were granted federal waivers to AFDC program rules in  order to conduct demonstration programs to test state reforms."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "States May Choose Various State Funding Options for Providing Cash Assistance", "paragraphs": ["Previously, under AFDC, state funds accounted for 46 percent of total  federal and state expenditures.

The federal TANF funds and state MOE funds can be  considered more like funding streams than a single program and states  may use their MOE to assist needy families in state programs other than  their TANF programs. In fact, states have flexibility to expend their MOE  funds for cash assistance in up to three different ways, some of which  allow states to exclude some families from time limits and work  requirements.", "A state may use its state MOE funds in three different ways to provide  cash assistance for needy families.", "Commingling: A state can provide TANF cash assistance by commingling  its state MOE with federal funds within its TANF program.", "Segregating: A state can provide some TANF cash assistance with state  MOE accounted for separately from its federal funds within its TANF  program.", "Separating: A state can use its state MOE to provide cash assistance to  needy families in any one or more non-TANF state programs, referred to  as \u201cseparate state programs.\u201d", "Each state may choose one or more of these options to provide cash  assistance.

In addition, we focus  only on cash assistance and not on other forms of aid or services,  including, for example, child care and transportation, for which time limits  and work requirements generally do not apply.", "How a state structures its funds determines which TANF rules apply to the  needy families being served. (See table 1.) When a state commingles funds,  it must meet all TANF requirements. For example, states that commingle  all their state MOE with federal funds are only able to exclude families  from time limits through the 20 percent extension, cannot exclude families  from counting towards the federal work participation rate, and cannot  provide assistance to certain groups of legal immigrants.", "States may exclude families from time limits by funding their cash  assistance with state MOE, either through \u201csegregated funds\u201d or in any  non-TANF state programs.

For example, if a state provides monthly cash assistance to working  families with state-only funds, those months of assistance do not count  toward the federal time limit.", "Extend the time limit. States can provide cash assistance beyond the  60-month time limit by using state-only funds. A state may extend a  family\u2019s time limit because it has determined that the adult needs more  time to prepare for and find employment.", "Finally, while not required by federal law, states may choose to apply time  limits on their state-funded assistance.

Generally, child-only cases are not subject to work requirements or time  limits. The most common types of child-only cases were families in which  the  caregiver is a nonparent, such as a relative, often a grandparent (40  percent); parent is receiving Social Security or Supplemental Security Income  and not eligible for TANF (25 percent); parent is a noncitizen ineligible for federally funded TANF (23 parent is subject to sanctions (7 percent). (See figure 1.)", "The breakdown of child-only cases varied significantly across states,  however. For example, child-only cases in which the parent is an ineligible  noncitizen ranged from 0 percent in ten states to 39 percent in California  and 77 percent in Texas; this variation is likely due to the variation in  immigrant populations across the states.

Since the implementation of welfare reform, states have  experienced strong economic growth and welfare caseloads have declined  dramatically, from 4.4 million in August 1996 to 2.1 million as of  September  2001, marking a 52 percent decline in the number of families  receiving cash welfare. The work participation target rate for every state in  fiscal year 2002 is 50 percent for all families. However, once the caseload  reduction credit is taken into account, the target rates can be greatly  reduced. For example, as shown in table 2, the actual rate for all families  reported by HHS for fiscal year 2000 was zero in 31 states and less than 25  percent in all but two states.", "As a result, states have had increased flexibility in determining the  numbers of adults that are to be working or preparing for work and the  types of activities required. For states to count families\u2019 activities towards  the work participation rate, families have to be participating in federally  approved work activities. In a previous report, we found that some states  included recipients in a range of work and work-preparation activities that  extend beyond those that meet federal work participation requirements,  particularly to meet the needs of recipients considered hard to employ.Officials in one state told us that because the work participation rates are  so low due to caseload reduction credits, states have more flexibility in the  types of activities or services provided, for example, substance abuse  treatment or mental health services, without fear of not meeting their  federal work participation rates. In other cases, the lower target rates give  states more flexibility in exempting TANF recipients considered hard to  employ from meeting work requirements, as we found in our report on  TANF recipients with mental and physical impairments.", "In addition to the flexibility provided by reduced federal target rates, many  states have increased work requirement flexibility by using state MOE  funds to provide cash assistance through non-TANF programs, as allowed  by PRWORA. Twenty-six states use state MOE funds to provide cash  assistance through separate state programs, which allows states to  exclude families from federal work requirements and to serve certain  immigrants ineligible for federal TANF. Sixteen of these states provide  cash assistance to two-parent families through these programs. Several  state officials told us they provide aid in this way to avoid the risk of  financial penalties for failing to meet the federal two-parent work  participation rate. State officials told us that two-parent families often  have as many or more challenges as single parents, making the higher  target rate for two-parent families difficult to meet.", "While states expressed concern about failing to meet the federal target  rate for two- parent families, all 16 of these states imposed their own state  work requirements on these families. Thirteen of the 26 states used state  MOE in separate programs to provide cash assistance to certain legal  immigrants not eligible for federal TANF aid; these 13 states still apply a  state work requirement for these families as well. Overall, approximately  nine-tenths of the families receiving cash assistance in separate state  programs are still subject to a state work requirement. While states  generally imposed work requirements, about half of them also have  policies in place to exclude families facing significant barriers to work  from work requirements.

Even  in those states where it was possible to have received 60 months of cash  assistance, many families had not reached their time limit because they  have cycled on and off welfare, slowing their accrual of time on assistance.  As a result, only 15 states had begun to use the federal 20 percent hardship  extension, and all of these states were applying it to less than 6 percent of  their total caseload. One state we visited, California, told us it estimated  that over 100,000 families with adults would reach the federal time limit in  the next year. California plans to use state-only funds to continue aid  beyond 60 months to children by removing the adult from the case.

In addition, another  Maryland official noted that time limits encourage caseworkers to link  families, particularly the hard to employ, to the services they need to  become self-sufficient. States also said that, for the most part, flexibility in  implementing time limits and work requirements were important in  allowing them to meet the needs of special populations while supporting  the federal goal of reducing dependency.
