The Service projects that such competition will lead to substantial declines in the Service\u2019s First-Class Mail volume in the next decade.  Should this occur, the Service will likely face unprecedented challenges as it seeks to fulfill its primary mission of providing universal postal service at reasonable rates while remaining self-supporting from postal revenues.", "The Service and other stakeholders agree that growth in the Service\u2019s core business of delivering First-Class Mail has already been affected by the rapid growth of the Internet, electronic communications, and electronic commerce.   Although the Service\u2019s mail volume increased in the 1990s to record levels, the rate of growth has slowed.  As figure 1 indicates, the Service projects that First-Class Mail volume will decline at an average annual rate of 0.8 percent in fiscal years 1999 to 2008.  Specifically, First- Class Mail is projected to grow at an average annual rate of 1.8 percent in fiscal years 1999 to 2002\u2014the projected peak\u2014and then to decline at an average annual rate of 2.5 percent in fiscal years 2003 to 2008.  Such a decline would be unprecedented in the Service\u2019s history and would likely create financial and performance challenges.  As the Postmaster General has noted, the Service\u2019s environment is changing rapidly, and therefore the Service cannot predict precisely when or to what extent competitive pressures may affect the Service\u2019s revenues.", "Statement U.S. Postal Service:  Challenges to Sustaining Performance Improvements Remain Formidable on the Brink of the 21st Century Note 1:  The U.S. Postal Service forecasts First-Class Mail to increase by an average annual rate of 1.8 percent in fiscal years 1999 through 2002 and to decline by an average annual rate of 2.5 percent in fiscal years 2003 through 2008.  The Service also forecasts Standard A mail to increase by an average annual rate of 5.3 percent in fiscal years 1999 through 2002 and to increase by an average annual rate of 3.3 percent in fiscal years 2003 through 2008.", "Note 2:  Actual data for fiscal year 1999 are not yet available.  Standard A mail is primarily advertising mail and includes letters, flats, and parcels that are not sent by First-Class Mail or Priority Mail.", "Historically, increases in mail volume\u2014including the volume of First-Class Mail\u2014have helped the Service cover its costs.  In the 1990s, increasing postage rates and mail volume helped provide the Service with additional revenue to finance wage increases, modernization efforts, and improvements in the quality of delivery service.  The Service projects that total mail volume will continue to increase from fiscal years 2000 through 2008 by an average annual rate of 1.7 percent, with the growth rate tapering off during the decade and total mail volume peaking in fiscal year 2006.", "Even if total mail volume increases, a decline in First-Class Mail volume would present the Service with the challenge of making corresponding reductions in the costs of handling First-Class Mail\u2014that is, in costs that historically have varied directly or indirectly with changes in First-Class Mail volume\u2014in order to hold down First-Class rates.  Further, in fiscal year 1998, revenues from First-Class Mail covered about two-thirds of the Service\u2019s institutional costs.  A substantial reduction in First-Class Mail volume would reduce its contribution to institutional costs, which could lead to somewhat higher postage rates in the future.", "The Service recently provided us with a detailed explanation of its volume forecast scenario and why it projects a substantial decline in First-Class Mail in the next decade.  The Service\u2019s Chief Financial Officer wrote us on September 9, 1999, that First-Class Mail volume is projected to decline on the basis of the assumption that diversion of mail to electronic communications alternatives would accelerate in a new and vastly different environment in which the Service would operate.  In this environment, changes in technology and business would create a climate in which current hypotheses about mailing behavior may no longer hold. Notably, the combination of consumer movement to alternative bill payment methods and the consolidation in the financial sector would reduce the number of bills, statements, and payments in the mail stream. Moreover, the movement of advertisers to the Internet would cause a slowdown in the growth of Standard A mail, while growth in Priority Mail and Parcel Post would continue to be robust as consumers embrace electronic commerce and more packages are shipped by Internet retailers. Specifically, the Service\u2019s forecast was based on the following assumptions:", "Potential Year 2000-related complications are largely avoided, increasing business and consumer confidence in electronic alternatives to traditional mail-based bill and statement streams.", "Businesses increase research and development and technology spending as a result of the easy Year 2000 transition, resulting in rapid implementation of on-line banking and financial applications and the spread of Internet-based small business Electronic Data Interchange.", "First-Class letter advertising reaches a saturation point because of consolidation in the banking sector, as well as the diversion of bills and payments away from the mail stream.", "Advertisers move away from traditional media to Internet-based platforms because of increased consumer use of the Internet.", "Another key development has been the globalization of the Service\u2019s competitors in the delivery sector, which has contributed to recent declines in the Service\u2019s international mail volume.  Further, the Service\u2019s competitors have charged that the Service is using its governmental status to compete unfairly.  These developments have fueled the debate over whether the Service should be allowed to introduce new nonpostal products in competition with the private sector, or whether the Service should be limited to offering traditional postal services and wind down its operations as its core business declines.  Regardless of how this public policy debate is resolved, the Service has recognized that it must continue to meet customer needs, improve its performance, and operate more efficiently in order to be successful in an increasingly competitive environment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Financial and Delivery Performance Continues to Show Positive Results", "paragraphs": ["The Service projects positive results for both financial and service performance for fiscal years 1999 and 2000.

Notwithstanding this controversy, the Service moved ahead with several new products in the mid- to late-1990s.", "The Service has established a formalized process to govern the introduction of most new products.  To facilitate the process of developing and introducing new products and to ensure effective management control, the Service developed a formalized system of checks and balances that requires top management buy-in at critical stages of the product development process.  The process is also to be used to review the performance of products and terminate those that do not perform to Postal Service expectations.  For those products we reviewed in more detail, we found that the Service had generally followed the tenets of the newly established product development process.  We also reported that most of the new products had not yet produced revenues that exceeded expenses. We cautioned, however, that it might not be reasonable to expect all new products to become profitable in their early years, because new products generally take several years to become established and recover their start- up costs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "International Competition", "paragraphs": ["the Service to the Department of State.  We are currently reviewing how effectively the Department of State has implemented its new responsibilities in this area.", "Our October 1998 report noted that differences in legal requirements contributed to differences in stakeholder involvement and the processes used to develop U.S. policies for international postal and telecommunications issues.  One key difference was that the Department of State was legally required to obtain input from the private sector on international telecommunications policy issues; however, the Service was not subject to such legal requirements when it had the lead role for U.S. involvement in the UPU.  In the international telecommunications sector, we found that government and private sector stakeholders had more direct involvement in U.S. policy formulation through a structured and documented advisory committee process headed by the Department of State and subject to the requirements of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA).  FACA requirements include Federal Register notice of advisory committee meetings; detailed minutes of meetings; public access and participation at meetings; and annual reports to the General Services Administration, which is to report to Congress on the activities, status, and any changes in the advisory committees.  In the postal sector, the Service was not subject to FACA.  The process for involving government and private sector stakeholders in international policy formulation was more informal, involving ad hoc briefings with limited public notice or documentation of meetings.

We followed up on the recommendations we had previously made for specific actions the Service should take to strengthen oversight of its National Change of Address (NCOA) program. The Service had not taken action on our recommendation that it explicitly state, in the acknowledgment form signed by customers of the Service\u2019s address correction licensees, that NCOA program-linked data are not to be used to create or maintain new-movers lists.

The Service has a special responsibility to correct its computers because a number of private sector and government groups may need to use the Service as a backup delivery system if their computers malfunction.  For this reason, the Service is concerned about the prospect of a mail surge in January 2000.

This is another crucial phase of the Year 2000 effort because core processes may still be disrupted by Year 2000-induced failures and by errors in business partner systems or public infrastructure systems, such as power, water, transportation, and telecommunications systems.  The Service\u2019s plans include preemptive measures and work-arounds to ensure critical business processes continue in the event of a Year 2000-related disruption or system failure.  The field plans were distributed in August 1999, and all rehearsals and adjustments to these plans are expected to be completed by November 30, 1999.", "With these actions under way, the Service is clearly much better positioned to face the upcoming century change.  However, the challenge facing the Service is still significant: there are less than 3 months remaining before the Year 2000 deadline, the Service is now entering into the holiday business rush, and many important tasks\u2014including the rehearsal and finalization of contingency and continuity plans\u2014remain.
