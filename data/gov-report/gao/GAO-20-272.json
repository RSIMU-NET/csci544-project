At times, FFRDCs need to access such data to support DOD. The pilot was intended to reduce the burden on FFRDCs to seek permission from hundreds of contractors to access information needed for their research. Six of DOD's 10 FFRDCs have taken part in the pilot, enrolling a combined total of 33 projects, as shown in the table.", "DOD officials and FFRDC representatives reported that the streamlined process made the use of sensitive data feasible. As a result, FFRDCs with completed projects in GAO's sample indicated they were able to provide more robust analyses or insights to DOD.", "DOD guidance for the pilot program established procedures to protect sensitive data. But GAO found that DOD did not incorporate all of the details of the required protections into its agreements with FFRDCs. Further, GAO found that not all FFRDCs were performing annual certification of financial disclosure forms, as required by its agreements with DOD. DOD does not have a process to ensure that all the protections pertaining to FFRDCs' streamlined access to sensitive data are being followed. Without a process that defines roles and responsibilities, DOD cannot ensure that FFRDCs adhere to the protections.", "DOD developed goals for the pilot program and outlined what information was to be obtained for each participating project, actions that are consistent with GAO's leading practices for pilot design. However, DOD has not developed a plan for evaluating the program nor has it consistently collected information on about a third of the pilot projects. Leading practices for pilot design call for an evaluation plan, which should include an assessment methodology and identify responsibilities as to how the evaluation will be conducted. Without an evaluation plan and a mechanism to collect information on pilot projects, DOD will not be positioned to identify the effectiveness of the pilot program and benefit from lessons learned.

FFRDCs historically have assisted  the Department of Defense (DOD) in assessing individual programs or  identifying trends among the department\u2019s weapon system acquisitions.  At times, FFRDC employees have needed to access certain sensitive  data, such as proprietary information from DOD\u2019s contractors, to  accomplish these tasks. The Federal Acquisition Regulation states that  FFRDCs have a special relationship with federal agencies, to include  DOD, and that the department may give FFRDCs access to sensitive  data beyond that which DOD would commonly share with contractors.  DOD currently has 10 FFRDCs under contract.", "Despite this special relationship, in practice, providing access has been  complicated in certain circumstances. The Trade Secrets Act prohibits  unauthorized disclosure of certain confidential information (which includes  sensitive data) by government personnel. To allow FFRDCs access to  sensitive information, until recently, DOD generally had FFRDC  researchers sign nondisclosure agreements with the original owners of  the sensitive data (defense contractors). According to DOD officials, this  practice effectively limited FFRDCs\u2019 ability to perform certain work  because some large data repositories\u2014such as the Cost Assessment  Data Enterprise\u2014include sensitive data that DOD has collected from  hundreds of contractors as part of its acquisition contracts.

The Act also contained a provision for GAO to review DOD\u2019s pilot  program activities and report to Congress within 2 years of initiation of the  pilot. This report addresses the extent to which (1) FFRDCs are using the  pilot program, (2) DOD put procedures in place to protect sensitive data  accessed in the pilot program, and (3) DOD is evaluating the pilot  program.", "To determine how extensively the pilot program is used, we obtained and  reviewed reports required by the pilot to identify the number of FFRDCs  and projects participating in the pilot from January 2018 (when the DOD  sponsors started reporting on the pilot) through September 2019.

They are managed by various military departments or divisions within the  department, called primary sponsors. FFRDCs are operated by  universities, other not-for-profit or nonprofit organizations, or private  firms\u2014called parent organizations\u2014under long-term contracts. They  provide special research and development services that generally cannot  be readily satisfied by government personnel or private contractors. For  example, the Lincoln Laboratory develops key radar and electronic  warfare technologies for integrated air and missile defense systems. The  Software Engineering Institute provides cybersecurity solutions for  defense entities.", "DOD\u2019s FFRDCs are grouped into three categories: research and  development laboratories, study and analysis centers, and systems  engineering and integration centers. DOD oversees 10 FFRDCs (see  table 1).

According to DOD\u2019s  guidance, the sponsoring agreement defines the FFRDC\u2019s purpose and  mission, establishes the conditions under which DOD may award an  FFRDC contract, and describes the overarching requirements for  operation of the FFRDC. For example, the primary sponsor must include  provisions in the sponsoring agreement to prevent real or perceived  organizational and personal conflicts of interest. As part of that, sponsors  are to require FFRDC parent organizations to establish and maintain  policies and procedures to protect information, such as sensitive data,  from disclosure and provide training that covers ethics and conflicts of  interest. We reported in December 2019 that representatives from the  five study and analysis center FFRDCs said they provide annual training  covering ethics and conflicts of interest for all personnel.", "DOD may use FFRDCs to perform work that is closely associated with  the performance of inherently governmental functions or that is critical to  maintaining control of the department\u2019s missions and operations. Work  could include activities such as support for financial analyses, policy  development, acquisition planning, source selection, and contract  management. In the course of performing work, FFRDCs may need  access to acquisition data collected from DOD\u2019s prime contractors and  program offices. FFRDCs may obtain these data through DOD personnel,  government databases, or directly from prime contractors. Government- held data may be stored and managed in department-wide databases or  by individual program offices. For example, the Cost Assessment Data  Enterprise is a web application that allows users access to various reports  that include information such as major defense acquisition programs\u2019  cost, software, and technical data.", "On December 21, 2017, DOD issued implementing guidance that marked  the launch of its 3-year pilot program. According to DOD officials, prior  to the start of the pilot program, FFRDC researchers needed to obtain  permission from each data owner (e.g., DOD prime contractor or  supplier), typically by signing a nondisclosure agreement. According to  DOD officials that requested the authority to allow FFRDCs to have  increased access, one of the purposes of the pilot was to allow for a  streamlined nondisclosure agreement process. Under the pilot program,  FFRDC researchers no longer have to obtain nondisclosure agreements  with each data owner.", "To participate in the pilot, the FFRDC and DOD sponsor must first take  steps to ensure certain protections are in place to protect against  unauthorized disclosure or use of the data being accessed. For example,  according to the statute, in order to be eligible, participating FFRDCs and  its personnel (FFRDC researchers) had to agree to be subject to and  comply with appropriate ethics standards and requirements applicable to  government personnel, including the Ethics in Government Act of 1978,  the Trade Secrets Act, and the Procurement Integrity Act. After the  protections are in place, the FFRDC and DOD sponsor can enroll  individual projects in the pilot program. Per the implementing guidance,  the FFRDCs and DOD sponsors agree to collect and provide information  about the enrolled projects.

Representatives from the six participating FFRDCs told us they elected to  participate because they required access to sensitive data and, in some  cases, lacked viable options for obtaining that data.

They said  they were able to provide DOD\u2019s Industrial Policy office with a more  complete picture by combining these microlevel analyses with broader  analyses of employment trends and economic outputs.

According to several DOD sponsor officials and FFRDC researchers we  spoke to, completing the requested analysis without the pilot program  would have required individual nondisclosure agreements with hundreds  of individual contractors and suppliers. Systems and Analyses Center  representatives said this would have been essentially impossible, and  would have prevented researchers from completing important parts of the  analyses. In another case, a Software Engineering Institute  representative told us that, before the pilot, their team could not access  software data when attempting to complete a 2017 project involving DOD  software costs and production time frames. For that project, the DOD  organization responsible for the data repository had recommended  researchers send out a data request letter to each of the contractors with  data in the system. Researchers sent out roughly one hundred requests  to contractors for permission, but received no responses. They pointed  out this was in part because contractors have no incentive to respond to  an FFRDC\u2019s request for access to their data. As a result, Software  Engineering Institute was unable to use updated data for the 2017 report.", "While several sponsoring agency officials noted benefits of using the data  for analyses to inform key program decisions, they also noted that a  causal relationship between the pilot program activities and acquisition  process improvements would be hard to establish, in part due to the  length of time needed for projects to effect change. DOD officials  responsible for two completed projects examining the munitions industrial  base said they expect the analyses performed will lead to improved  acquisition processes but that it would take many years to see the  benefits. Specifically, they said the FFRDCs\u2019 work helped identify areas  for improvement in the department\u2019s budget and acquisition strategy to  better signal future demand to its lower tier munitions industrial base  suppliers. In addition to noting these expected improvements, several  DOD officials also acknowledged that expanding access of sensitive data  to more people increases the potential for unauthorized use or disclosure  but said that the pilot program put in place important protections to help  mitigate these risks."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOD\u2019s Pilot Established Protections for Accessing Sensitive Data but Did Not Establish Procedures to Verify Compliance", "paragraphs": ["DOD\u2019s guidance to implement the pilot program outlined protections the  FFRDCs must agree to, in order to guard against unauthorized disclosure  or use of sensitive data, and required that these protections be  incorporated into the sponsoring agreements between the FFRDCs and  the DOD sponsor. However, we found some instances where details of  the required protections were not incorporated into the agreements. We  also found that the Laboratories and Personnel Office, which is  responsible for managing the pilot program, does not have a procedure to  verify whether protections were implemented, in part because it has not  developed a process for doing so.

For example, the prohibition on their  use of sensitive data to compete against a third party was already a  fundamental aspect of FFRDCs\u2019 role in supporting DOD. Similarly,  participating FFRDC representatives told us that certain protections, such  as implementing nondisclosure agreements and training, required only  small adjustments to their existing procedures. However, the pilot\u2019s  financial disclosure program, annual certifications by parent  organizations, and instructions for researchers to notify contracting  officers of employment offers when supporting source selection decisions  were new and specific to the pilot, according to a DOD official involved in  the pilot\u2019s implementation.", "We found that not all the details of protections were incorporated into the  sponsoring agreements we reviewed.

These officials explained that, when the pilot\u2019s  guidance was formulated, the department was in the process of  reorganizing the former Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics Office and  they pointed out that GAO was to do the assessment of the pilot  program. They said the reason the program collected information\u2014such  as quarterly reports\u2014was to inform our review. Thus, they had no plan to  assess the information collected and no plans to talk to stakeholders or to  collect and share lessons learned.", "While our review occurred during pilot implementation, an evaluation of  the pilot conducted by DOD after more projects are completed would  provide an opportunity to identify lessons learned and gather valuable  input from stakeholders\u2014such as the offices that manage the data  repositories and the sponsors requesting the projects. We found cases  where FFRDC researchers had problems accessing data and where  gathering this input from stakeholders involved with pilot projects would  have been useful for DOD. For example, some FFRDC researchers  described barriers when trying to gain access to certain government- and  department-wide databases. In one case, Project AIR FORCE  researchers reported not being able to access information in the  Electronic Document Access database and various databases containing  contractor performance information because researchers lacked military  or government email addresses. Further, some of the databases that  FFRDC researchers and a DOD official said would be useful are not  owned by DOD. We found that guidance for one such database explicitly  prohibits disclosure of contractor evaluation data to any contractor or non- government entity. In addition, the researchers were able to gain only  partial access to DOD\u2019s Acquisition Information Repository (a database  containing acquisition documents for DOD\u2019s major weapons programs)  and, as a result, were unable to access individual documents, such as  program assessment reports. They told us the repository is set up such  that the researchers must request access to individual documents directly  from document owners, who set permissions when uploading documents,  rather than from a central source that can grant access across the  repository. Without further evaluation of the pilot, DOD is missing an  opportunity to benefit from gathering input from its stakeholders and  identifying lessons learned, such as learning and understanding more  about these barriers to accessing certain databases.", "There is still time for DOD to develop an evaluation plan with elements  described in our leading practices. The pilot program ends December 21,  2020. Our review comes at a time when 11 of the overall 33 projects have  been completed; therefore, information exists to report on outcomes.  Officials and representatives from the Laboratories and Personnel Office  and participating sponsors and FFRDCs expressed a continued need for  access to the sensitive data. Without an evaluation plan, DOD will have  difficulty determining the effectiveness of the pilot to meet its goal of  accruing more analytic value for the department while also safeguarding  sensitive data."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The FFRDC pilot program has already provided DOD with some benefits,  as a few FFRDCs have reported success in completing analysis that  would not have been possible without it. However, in implementing the  pilot, DOD has room for improvement. A key control of this pilot that  provides access to sensitive data is ensuring protections are in place to  prevent improper disclosure. Another control is to establish a process to  ensure these protections are followed, yet the responsible office within  DOD has not done so. Further, despite the fact that the pilot is past the  midpoint of implementation, this office still has an opportunity to develop a  plan on how to evaluate it. But to do this, it must develop a mechanism to  ensure it is collecting complete information on the pilot activities. Ensuring  comprehensive reporting and implementing a well-developed evaluation  plan will help DOD understand and articulate the benefits the department  has accrued because of FFRDC\u2019s access to sensitive data. Further,  through identifying lessons learned and obtaining stakeholder input, the  Laboratories and Personnel Office has an opportunity to better  understand the challenges FFRDCs and the department face when  attempting to access and use sensitive data included in government- and  department-wide databases. Such an evaluation could help inform  Congress\u2019 decision whether to extend, make FFRDC access permanent,  or end the pilot."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making the following six recommendations to the Department of  Defense:  The Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering should  direct the Laboratories and Personnel Office to take steps to ensure that  the details of the pilot program\u2019s data protections are incorporated into the  existing agreements.
