Specifically, HRSA issued the first agency-wide guidance written primarily for project officers in November 2012 and is in the process of developing new guidance and revising existing guidance for staff in OFAM. Additionally, HRSA required each of the bureaus to develop more detailed guidance for project officers by the end of 2012. To assist the bureaus in systematically developing this guidance, HRSA provided a template outlining the minimum components to be included in the documents. While all of HRSA's bureaus developed guidance for their project officers, GAO found that the bureaus' guidance did not address all of the key components of grantee monitoring identified by HRSA, such as components related to conducting site visits. Although HRSA conducted reviews of the bureaus' guidance, these reviews were not sufficient to ensure that the guidance addressed all required grantee monitoring components. Consequently, there is an increased possibility that project officers will not conduct, or document, all the monitoring activities required by HRSA, which puts the agency at risk for incomplete or insufficient grantee monitoring.", "Since 2013, HRSA has implemented agency-wide training programs for key staff responsible for conducting monitoring of grantees\u2014a project officer certification program, which the majority of project officers have completed, and a career development program for grants management specialists. Both programs include courses that cover material related to grantee monitoring.

To carry out its mission, HRSA provides  funding and support for a wide variety of programs, most commonly  through grants. In fiscal year 2013, HRSA awarded over $6 billion in  grants, which accounted for over 80 percent of the agency\u2019s  appropriations. Through these grants, HRSA provided financial support to  more than 3,000 recipients, including organizations in every state. These  grantees serve millions of people each year through programs that  provide health care to uninsured individuals; people with human  immunodeficiency virus and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome  (HIV/AIDS); pregnant women, mothers, and children; people living in rural  communities; and others.", "To manage its grant programs, HRSA employs project officers in its  programmatic bureaus and staff in its Office of Federal Assistance  Management (OFAM).

Specifically, they are responsible for collecting and  assessing information from reports, audits, site visits, and other sources  to ensure that grantees are in compliance with the terms of their grants.  The effective monitoring of grantees is critical to ensure that they are  financially sound, in compliance with programmatic and administrative  requirements, and appropriately utilizing federal funds. In addition,  monitoring is essential to ensure that grantees receive the support and  assistance they need so that funding is used as effectively as possible for  the populations HRSA serves. However, in 2012 we reported on  weaknesses in HRSA\u2019s monitoring of certain grant programs. Specifically,  we reported that HRSA did not consistently follow HHS regulations and  guidance in its monitoring of grantees under the Ryan White  Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency Act of 1990, as amended.  We also reported that HRSA\u2019s monitoring of its Health Center Program  grantees was insufficient to ensure that the agency consistently identified  all instances of grantee noncompliance with program requirements.

The nearly 400 project officers within the bureaus  have primary responsibility for the day-to-day monitoring of an  assigned portfolio of grantees. Project officer monitoring activities  include reviewing grantee reports on various topics to ensure  performance requirements are met and to identify performance or  financial problems; communicating with grantees regularly and  documenting that communication; consulting with grantees on  programmatic issues; and conducting and arranging for site visits. For  example, project officers conduct the initial review of requests from  grantees for prior approval of certain actions, such as carrying over  unobligated funds to subsequent funding periods; review grantee  progress and financial reports; and are generally expected to have at  least quarterly contact with their grantees. They are expected to keep  their supervisors and relevant OFAM staff informed regarding grantee  performance and the need for any intervention.", "Grants management specialists. Located in OFAM\u2019s Division of  Grants Management Operations, grants management specialists are  responsible for managing business and financial issues for a portfolio  of grantees. For example, they review the Federal Financial Report, a  required report to document the financial progress of a grant award,  which includes information on the funds a grantee has received and  how they were spent. Grants management specialists and project  officers are expected to coordinate in monitoring grantees; for  example, grants management specialists are responsible for  approving or disapproving prior approval requests after the project  officer\u2019s initial review. As of June 2014, there were nearly 70 grants  management specialists within OFAM.", "Financial integrity staff. Located in OFAM\u2019s Division of Financial  Integrity, financial integrity staff are responsible for the financial  oversight and monitoring of grantees, which includes conducting or  coordinating financial audits and reviews of grantees. For example,  some financial integrity staff conduct program integrity analyses to  ensure that financially at-risk grantees are identified for targeted  intervention; others work with grantees to ensure the resolution of  financial audit findings. As of June 2014, there were 34 financial  integrity staff with grantee monitoring responsibilities.", "HRSA supplements its staff with contractors that perform grantee  monitoring activities such as conducting site visits to monitor compliance  with grant requirements, or financial audits and reviews.

After the initial certification, all project officers are required  to meet annual continuing education requirements. Both the new and  experienced project officer training includes courses that cover material  related to grantee monitoring. For example, these courses cover the  goals of grantee monitoring, project officer responsibilities, sources of  information, and helpful tips for effective monitoring of grantees.

Three bureaus\u2014the Bureau of Health Professions, the Bureau  of Primary Health Care, and the HIV/AIDs Bureau\u2014provided some formal  training on grantee monitoring in 2013. These bureaus, which  represented three of the four largest bureaus at HRSA in 2013, offered  trainings ranging from a single course on grantee performance to a series  of courses on specific grant program requirements and monitoring  activities, such as financial monitoring and site visits. Officials from the  HIV/AIDs Bureau said they had mechanisms in place for formally tracking  and evaluating the training they offered. Leadership from three of the four  bureaus that did not provide formal training related to grantee monitoring  explained that their bureaus are relatively small. Thus, the officials  indicated that their project officers benefit from frequent communication  with their supervisors in lieu of formal training. Leadership from the  remaining bureau that did not provide formal training said that because  the bureau has many different programs with different requirements, it  would not make sense to offer formal bureau-wide training.", "Officials from all of the bureaus described various informal training  mechanisms in place that help provide project officers with the knowledge  and skills to conduct their work, including one-on-one meetings between  project officers and their supervisors, mentoring programs, and having  new project officers shadow more experienced project officers on site  visits prior to conducting them. For example, the Bureau of Health  Professions developed a tool for new project officers that specifies  timelines for completing certain tasks that will prepare them for their role  as project officers within the bureau, such as reviewing key bureau and  HRSA guidance, shadowing a senior project officer and identifying a  mentor, and reviewing bureau resources. In addition, supervisors we  spoke with generally agreed that it is their responsibility to provide on-the- job training to project officers, particularly related to program-specific  grant requirements. While project officers and supervisors we interviewed  generally felt that the training provided by HRSA and the bureaus related  to grantee monitoring was sufficient, a few identified areas where project  officers could use more training; for example, training on financial  monitoring, effectively conducting monitoring calls with a large number of  grantees, and documenting monitoring activities in EHB.

HRSA officials and  supervisors we interviewed identified reviewing information in, and reports  from, EHB as one of the main methods for overseeing staff responsible  for monitoring grantees; EHB is the agency\u2019s online system for  documenting grantee monitoring activities, as well as corresponding and  exchanging documents with grantees. There are three main ways that  supervisors use EHB for oversight purposes.", "Supervisors review certain documents or decisions made by staff  about grantees for quality, accuracy, and completeness; the EHB  system requires supervisory review and approval to occur before  certain grant-related actions can be taken. Examples of items  requiring supervisory review and approval in EHB include project  officers\u2019 assessments of grantee compliance, noncompliant grantees\u2019  plans and time frames to address their noncompliance, and grantee  prior approval requests, as well as certain financial assessments that  are completed by financial integrity staff. Additionally, officials told us  that there are multiple levels of required supervisory review and  approval in EHB for certain monetary actions made by grants  management specialists. In reviewing staff\u2019s work, supervisors told us  that they consider the documentation used to support staff\u2019s  recommendations. For example, when reviewing a project officer\u2019s  assessments of grantee compliance, a supervisor may review the  reports submitted by the grantee, which also are to be documented in  EHB. In doing so, the supervisor is able to determine if the EHB  record includes the necessary documentation and if that  documentation supports the project officer\u2019s assessment, and then  provide feedback to the project officer.", "Supervisors also spot-check staff\u2019s day-to-day activities in EHB to  oversee their work. For example, at any time a project officer\u2019s  supervisor can access a grantee\u2019s EHB record to assess whether a  project officer has communicated with the grantee at the required  intervals and documented that communication. By reviewing the  documentation of the communications, the supervisor can determine  the information the project officer and grantee discussed. Supervisors  can also see whether site visit reports have been entered or uploaded  into EHB within the established time frames, and can review the audit  reports completed by financial integrity staff, including reviewing the  supporting materials from EHB.", "Supervisors also use EHB-generated reports to oversee staff.", "According to the HRSA officials we spoke with, supervisors generate  EHB reports to review information, such as the number and types of  tasks in a staff member\u2019s queue, the timeliness of task completion,  and whether anything is overdue.", "Participating in interactions with grantees. Supervisors provide  oversight of staff by participating in some of their interactions with  grantees. According to HRSA officials, supervisors may participate in  monitoring calls between project officers and grantees. Supervisors may  also review project officers\u2019 email or other written correspondence in  advance of it being sent to grantees, or may be copied on email  exchanges between project officers and grantees, so that they are  cognizant of grantee interactions. In addition, supervisors may participate  in grantee site visits with project officers. According to officials,  participating in these interactions allows supervisors to observe how the  staff interact with the grantees, how they handle any problems that come  up, and the customer service staff provide. If they identify any problems  or concerns with these interactions, supervisors told us they discuss it  with their staff.", "Communicating regularly with staff. Supervisors use regular  communications with staff as another oversight method. For example,  according to HRSA officials, supervisors hold individual, one-on-one,  meetings with members of their staff on a regular basis, ranging from  weekly to quarterly. Two officials said that the frequency of one-on-one  meetings varies based on the staff\u2019s experience. Topics discussed during  these meetings include updates on the grantees that the staff is  responsible for monitoring, any grantee compliance issues, upcoming or  recent site visits, and submissions from grantees. In preparation for these  meetings, officials we interviewed reported that supervisors often review  the staff\u2019s EHB documentation, and then discuss it during their meetings.  Officials from one bureau stated that supervisors use EHB information to  guide conversations with their staff during their one-on-one meetings to  discuss grantee progress, concerns, and best practices. In addition to  one-on-one meetings, some supervisors hold regular group meetings with  all of their staff responsible for grantee monitoring, where, among other  things, staff can report on any issues they are encountering with their  grantees or ask questions of their peers or supervisors.", "Conducting performance appraisals. HRSA also uses its annual  performance appraisal process to hold its staff accountable for their  grantee monitoring responsibilities. The performance appraisals for all  staff with responsibility for monitoring grantees include performance  elements related to monitoring. The specific elements upon which staff  are assessed are based on the roles and responsibilities for their job  function, and can vary by individual. Table 1 provides examples of  performance elements related to monitoring for the three key positions  with responsibility for grantee monitoring. In addition, supervisors and  bureau and office leadership also are held accountable through their  performance appraisals for their oversight of the staff who perform  grantee monitoring activities. For example, HRSA officials told us bureau  and office leadership are held accountable for overseeing the monitoring  of grantees through the business acumen element of their appraisal,  under which they are expected to ensure program integrity and  responsible stewardship of resources."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HRSA Has Several Mechanisms in Place Designed to Ensure Contractors That Monitor Grantees Are Qualified and to Oversee Their Work", "paragraphs": ["HRSA has several mechanisms in place designed to ensure that HRSA  contractors that conduct grantee monitoring activities are qualified and to  oversee the work performed by these contractors. HRSA officials told us  that the agency\u2019s process for awarding contracts is designed to ensure  the contractors that conduct grantee monitoring activities are qualified. As  part of the process for awarding such contracts, HRSA considers staffing  proposals and the expectations outlined in the statement of work\u2014a  section of the contract solicitation that describes the specific tasks  required of the contractor. For all 13 contracts that HRSA identified as  including grantee monitoring activities in fiscal year 2013, the personnel  proposed by contractors were a factor in HRSA\u2019s evaluation and selection  of the contractors. For each of these contracts, HRSA required  prospective contractors to submit staff r\u00e9sum\u00e9s and, for some contracts,  also required letters of commitment or other information regarding the  expertise and qualifications for certain staff designated as \u201ckey  personnel\u201d\u2014contractor staff who are proposed to lead the work, such as  the project director. Officials told us they considered the experience of  these individuals when evaluating the potential contractors.", "For some contracts, HRSA identified specific qualifications required for  contractor staff. Nine of the 13 contracts\u20144 used by OFAM for financial  reviews and 5 used by programmatic bureaus for grantee monitoring\u2014 included specific requirements for the qualifications or characteristics of  contractor staff. For example, the OFAM contracts included information  on educational requirements, years of experience, and skill sets needed  for certain positions including senior financial analysts and senior  auditors. One of the bureau contracts required contractor site visit staff to  have specific clinical experience, as well as experience with  administrative and management information systems, fiscal management,  and familiarity with the support services available for the population  served by the grant.", "Additionally, almost all of the contracts (12 of 13) included a clause that  specifies procedures for the contractor to follow if it makes a change to  key personnel. For example, some contracts stated that if the contractor  needed to change any key personnel, it would need to notify HRSA in  advance in writing and provide justification for the change. The contractor  would then need to receive written consent from HRSA to make the  change in personnel.", "After a contractor is selected, HRSA has other mechanisms designed to  ensure that the contractor staff conducting grantee site visits are qualified  to conduct this monitoring activity. For example, some of the contracts  used by the HIV/AIDS Bureau and the Bureau of Primary Health Care  stated that the contractor is responsible for providing training to its staff.  One contract specified that contractor staff must achieve a particular  score on a posttraining assessment before they are considered eligible to  perform site visits. HRSA officials and the contractors we spoke to  explained that development of this training is a joint effort; that is, HRSA  and the contractor work together to develop the training and ensure it  covers the necessary information. Contractor staff may also attend HRSA  webinars or other trainings offered to grantees that discuss grant program  requirements.", "In addition to training, HRSA has resources available for contractor staff  that conduct site visits. For example, contractor staff have access to site  visit guides, which help to ensure that the staff are knowledgeable about  the requirements of the grant programs for which they are conducting site  visits. Additionally, HRSA officials and contractors we interviewed told us  that new contractor staff may shadow more experienced contractor staff  during site visits, allowing them to observe an actual site visit prior to  being responsible for conducting one on their own. HRSA officials also  stated that when possible, HRSA project officers attend the site visits to  help new contractor staff understand what to look for when assessing a  grantee\u2019s compliance with program requirements. HRSA officials and one  of the contractors we interviewed told us that HRSA staff also provide  input to contractors about the staff available or selected for grantee  monitoring activities, such as site visits; however, the contractor is  ultimately responsible for selecting its staff and assigning them to  particular assignments. Specifically, officials said that when there is a  specific need for a particular type of expertise among the contractor staff  conducting grantee monitoring activities, HRSA officials may recommend  to the contractor that certain individuals be added to the roster of  contractor staff available to provide services or assigned to conduct a  particular site visit.", "HRSA officials reported several mechanisms they use to oversee  contractors\u2019 work, including regular communications with contractors, the  review of contractors\u2019 deliverables, and the collection of feedback from  project officers and grantees on contractor performance.", "The contracts we reviewed all required regular communications  between HRSA and contractors for the purpose of, among other  things, discussing the status of the contractor\u2019s work or any problems  the contractor encountered with the grantees. For example, several  contracts required contractors to provide monthly progress reports to  HRSA staff on the status of their accomplishments for the month and  any problems encountered. CORs and contractors we spoke with  stated they have standing meetings ranging in frequency from weekly  to monthly and have more frequent informal communication as  needed to carry out the day-to-day activities of the contract.  Additionally, the contractor we spoke with that conducts site visits of  Bureau of Primary Health Care grantees told us that it has quarterly  meetings with representatives from the bureau, which include  discussion of the site visit process and any grantee trends staff are  seeing during the site visits.", "CORs and other HRSA officials review contractor deliverables, such  as routine progress reports and site visit reports, to assess timeliness  and quality of the products. The CORs we interviewed said they  regularly rely on project officers, who have the programmatic  expertise, to review and provide feedback on site visit reports  submitted by contractor staff. Contractor staff are then responsible for  making any necessary revisions to the reports. Officials also said that  CORs work with financial integrity staff when reviewing certain  contractor deliverables, such as financial ratio analyses to assess  grantees\u2019 financial health and viability, as they have expertise related  to these financial reviews.", "For at least some contracts, contractors collect feedback from  grantees and project officers that interact with the contractor staff. For  these contracts, grantees have the opportunity to provide feedback on  contractor staff site visit performance by completing a postvisit survey.  Contractors for the HIV/AIDS Bureau and the Bureau of Primary  Heath Care told us that they administer such surveys to grantees.  Additionally, the Bureau of Primary Heath Care contractor we spoke  with sends project officers a similar postvisit survey about their  experiences with contractor staff, while the HIV/AIDS Bureau  contractor we spoke with solicits contractor staff feedback from  debriefing calls with the project officer after the site visit is completed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["HRSA uses a large portion of its appropriations\u2014over 80 percent in fiscal  year 2013\u2014to award grants to external entities. As a grant-making  agency, HRSA is responsible for monitoring its grantees to ensure that  they are meeting the requirements of their grants. Effectively monitoring  grantees is essential to ensure that government funds are being used  appropriately and efficiently. In the past few years, HRSA has taken steps  to increase and improve its guidance and training related to monitoring  grantees, including implementing new training programs for key staff  responsible for grantee monitoring and developing SOPs for these staff at  both the agency and bureau level. These efforts reflect HRSA\u2019s recent  emphasis on systematically providing guidance and training on grantee  monitoring. To assist with the development of the SOPs, HRSA provided  its bureaus with a template outlining the key components of grantee  monitoring that should be addressed in the guidance. However, we found  that the bureau-level SOPs did not address all of the key components of  grantee monitoring specified in that template; the lack of detailed policies  is inconsistent with federal standards for internal control. Because HRSA  did not ensure that the bureaus\u2019 SOPs included the required information  and detail, and thus provided comprehensive guidance to staff  responsible for monitoring grantees, the agency has put itself at risk for  incomplete or ineffective grantee monitoring, which could jeopardize its  stewardship of federal dollars."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To help ensure complete and effective monitoring of grantees, we  recommend that the Administrator of HRSA develop a process, either at  the agency or bureau level, to ensure that bureaus\u2019 SOPs address all of  the key components of grantee monitoring as established by the agency."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to HHS for comment.
