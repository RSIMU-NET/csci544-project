For example, the Chief Human Capital Officer (CHCO) Council Working Group (Working Group) identified skills gaps in six government-wide occupations, such as cybersecurity and auditors. Although this effort was an important step forward, GAO's work has identified skills gaps in nearly two dozen occupations with significant programmatic impact. In some cases, such as cybersecurity, the skills gaps GAO identified were consistent with the Working Group's findings. But GAO's work has also identified additional skills gaps. For example, a decline in telecommunication expertise at multiple agencies contributed to delays and cost overruns of 44 percent when those agencies were transitioning to a new network of telecommunications services. The Working Group did not address a more comprehensive list of skills gaps because of various methodological shortcomings that included insufficient analysis of workforce data early in the process. In 2015, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and the CHCO Council plan to identify and address a new set of government-wide skills gaps. It will be important that key lessons learned from the initial efforts to identify skills gaps inform this next round of work, including the need to (1) use a data-driven approach early in the process, (2) prioritize occupations using criteria that consider programmatic impact, and (3) consult with subject matter experts and other stakeholders prior to the identification of skills gaps in occupations.", "Key features of OPM's efforts to predict emerging skills gaps are in the early planning stages. GAO has previously reported that further progress in closing skills gaps will depend on, among other things, the extent to which OPM develops a capacity to predict emerging skills gaps beyond those areas already identified. A re-named interagency group, known as the Federal Agency Skills Team, plans to strengthen the methodology used to identify emerging skills gaps. Additionally, OPM officials are discussing plans to modify OPM's workforce database to capture government-wide staffing data. However, OPM will need to establish a schedule for modifying this database to ensure its implementation. OPM officials also stated that because agencies' capacity to assess workforce competencies varies, OPM does not have government-wide data on competency gaps, which is needed to identify emerging cross-agency skills gaps. In conjunction with agencies' CHCOs, OPM will need to strengthen agencies' ability to assess their competency needs that are critical to successfully achieving their mission and goals.", "OPM and selected agencies that GAO reviewed\u2014the Departments of Commerce (Commerce) and Energy (DOE), and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)\u2014could improve efforts to address skills gaps by strengthening their use of quarterly data-driven reviews, known as HRstat meetings. Specifically, the metrics used by the selected agencies during their HRstat meetings vary from agency to agency, making it difficult for OPM to assess agencies' progress in closing skills gaps government-wide. Although it is important for agencies to have their own HRstat metrics, OPM should work with the CHCO Council to develop a core set of HRstat metrics that all agencies use so that OPM may have the ability to analyze skills gap data across the government."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that OPM (1) strengthen its methodology for identifying and addressing skills gaps, (2) establish a schedule and process for collecting government-wide staffing and competency data, and (3) develop a core set of metrics for use in agencies' HRstat reviews.

We also reviewed  documentation, such as status reports, that described the Working  Group\u2019s activities, and our reports from October 2010 to May 2014 to  identify skills gaps that we determined were causing programmatic  impacts at agencies across the federal government. Moreover, we  reviewed planning documents for addressing skills gaps in the six MCOs  identified by the Working Group for such things as their alignment with  key practices for project planning that we identified through a literature  review. The criteria were drawn from our prior work assessing project  planning, our guide for key practices in project schedules, and our criteria  for removing issues from our high-risk list. In particular, we assessed  whether the planning documents included the following elements relevant  to closing skills gaps: (1) identifying root causes, (2) establishing  objectives, (3) developing specific actions, (4) assigning roles and  responsibilities, (5) planning duration of actions, and (6) using outcome- oriented performance metrics. To determine progress made toward the  interim CAP goal for closing skills gaps, we reviewed documentation,  such as quarterly status updates.

First, FAST is to use a data- driven approach as the initial step for identifying a broad list of skills gaps.

According to an OPM official, federal agencies\u2019 ability to  assess workforce competencies varies, which makes collection of  government-wide data on competency gaps difficult. As one example, we  have found that the Census Bureau has started to assess the  competencies needed to carry out its future work. In contrast, Department  of Commerce (Commerce) human capital officials stated that they do not  conduct a Department-wide competency assessment of Commerce\u2019s  workforce. Moreover, the Department of Energy (DOE) has conducted a  competency assessment for a number of engineering occupations such  as nuclear engineers. DOE officials have also developed a model for  conducting a Department-wide competency assessment. Key principles  for effective workforce planning that we developed note that agencies  must determine the competencies that are critical to successfully  achieving their mission and goals. Doing so can help agencies to  effectively meet demographic, technological, and other forces that are  challenging government agencies to change the activities they perform  and the goals that they must achieve, how they do their business, and  even who does the government\u2019s business. Therefore, as OPM  develops its process for using EHRI to collect agencies\u2019 skills gaps data,  it will be important for OPM to also work with agency CHCOs to bolster  the ability of agencies to assess workforce competencies by sharing  competency surveys, lessons learned, and other tools and resources\u2014 and to ensure that such information can be stored in the EHRI database  for government-wide workforce analysis."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "OPM and Selected Agencies Could Improve Efforts to Address Skills Gaps by Strengthening Data-Driven Reviews", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "OPM Developed HRstat Data-Driven Reviews to Help Agencies Regularly Track Their Progress in Achieving Their Human Resources Goals", "paragraphs": ["Data-driven reviews\u2014commonly referred to as \u201cstat\u201d meetings\u2014are  regularly scheduled, structured meetings used by organizations to review  performance metrics with department or program personnel to drive  progress on agency priorities and goals.

While some amount of variation is  both desirable and expected given the different missions of the agencies  and the flexibility OPM gave agencies in selecting metrics, the variation  shown above has at least two significant downsides. First, the variation in  number and types of metrics agencies are tracking suggest that some  agencies\u2019 HRstat reviews are more robust and well rounded than others  in that they are measuring factors affecting skills gaps from a more  complete perspective. Indeed, each metric may tell a different story about  the extent and nature of current and emerging skills gaps.
