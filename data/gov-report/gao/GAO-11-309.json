The Navy's estimate of the one-time cost is $537.6 million--also in base year 2010 dollars--which is outside the upper range of GAO's estimate. Unlike GAO's estimate, the Navy did not conduct a risk and uncertainty analysis on its one-time costs; as a result, its estimate does not include a range. The largest difference between GAO's estimate of one-time costs and the Navy's estimate is the cost of constructing new facilities at Mayport. Based on the historical costs of constructing similar facilities, GAO estimates at the 65 percent confidence level that the cost for constructing the controlled industrial facility will be $70.5 million, and the cost for constructing the ship maintenance support facilities will be $45.6 million. The Navy estimates the construction costs to be much higher at $139.1 million and $157.2 million, respectively. Navy officials told GAO the difference is due to the increased cost involved in protecting the buildings from a potential storm surge associated with a Category 4 hurricane. GAO included a hurricane factor in its estimate to account for this increase, but GAO and the Navy used different estimating methods in developing the estimates for the construction costs. GAO used adjusted actual costs from similar construction projects, while the Navy used a detailed engineering estimate. For recurring costs, GAO's independent cost estimate suggests that the total is expected to be between $9.0 million and $17.6 million per year. The Navy's estimate of $15.3 million per year is within GAO's estimated range. The Navy's estimate did not fully meet any of the four characteristics-- comprehensive, accurate, well documented, and credible--for producing a high-quality cost estimate. Specifically, although the estimate included almost all of the life-cycle costs related to homeporting a nuclear aircraft carrier at Mayport, it partially met the criteria for being comprehensive because it does not fully describe the cost-influencing ground rules and assumptions. The estimate was only minimally accurate and well documented in that although many elements of the estimate are based on actual experiences from other comparable programs, it is difficult to say if the cost estimates are the most likely costs since the Navy did not conduct a risk and uncertainty analysis. Further, the estimate contains very little step-by-step description of how the estimate was developed so that a cost analyst unfamiliar with the program could independently replicate it. The Navy had to recreate several portions of the estimate in order to provide GAO with supporting documentation. Further, the Navy's estimate does not meet the GAO best practice for a credible estimate because it does not include a sensitivity analysis and was not compared by the Navy to an independent cost estimate conducted by a group outside the Navy. Without fully meeting the characteristics of a high-quality estimate, the Navy's ability to present a convincing argument of the estimate's affordability and credibly answer decision makers' and oversight groups' questions about the estimate is hampered."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends DOD take several actions to improve the quality of its Mayport cost estimate.

Consequently, to homeport a nuclear  powered aircraft carrier, several major infrastructure upgrades are  required at Mayport. These infrastructure improvements include  construction of four new buildings: (1) controlled industrial facility,  (2) ship maintenance facility, (3) maintenance support facility, and  (4) parking garage. The controlled industrial facility would be used for the  inspection, modification, and repair of radiologically controlled equipment  and components associated with naval nuclear propulsion plants. The ship  maintenance facility is necessary to perform nonnuclear maintenance on  the carrier\u2019s nuclear propulsion plants. The maintenance support facility  would provide the needed administrative and technical staff offices to  support propulsion plant maintenance and a central area for receiving,  inspecting, shipping, and storing materials. The parking garage would  replace parking spaces lost through construction of the three new  maintenance buildings. The infrastructure upgrades also include  improvements to Wharf F, which would receive improvement to its  structural components, berthing capability, and utility and security  systems in order to make it capable of homeporting a nuclear carrier.  Additionally, traffic improvements would be made to the Massey Avenue  corridor to rebuild a boulevard-style roadway with two lanes each way  divided by a grass median. Dredging would also be necessary to deepen  the Mayport turning basin to allow access for a fully loaded nuclear  aircraft carrier.

One known complexity of the Mayport construction projects is  that the controlled industrial facility must be built to withstand a storm  surge from a category 4 hurricane.

All the steps  involved in developing the estimate should be documented so that a cost  analyst unfamiliar with the program could recreate it with the same result.", "In addition, documentation for the cost estimate should reflect changes in  technical or program assumptions or new program phases or milestones.  Insufficient documentation makes it difficult for outside organizations to  validate the Navy\u2019s life-cycle cost estimate for homeporting an aircraft  carrier at Naval Station Mayport. Not having adequate documentation also  impedes the Navy\u2019s ability to develop future estimates and facilitate  oversight by Congress."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Navy's Estimate Does Not Meet GAO's Best Practices for a Credible Estimate", "paragraphs": ["Overall, the Navy's estimate does not meet the GAO best practices\u2019 criteria  for a credible estimate, because it does not include a sensitivity analysis  and was not compared by the Navy to an independent cost estimate  conducted by a group outside the acquiring organization. Although DOD's  Office of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation did review the Navy's  presentations and supporting documentation in conjunction with the 2010  Quadrennial Defense Review working group, the office only performed a  general review of the Navy's costs, not a full independent cost estimate  with a sensitivity analysis. Further, while the Navy did identify some risks,  it did not conduct a formal risk and uncertainty analysis that would  identify a level of confidence in the estimate. In addition, although some  cost elements in the Navy\u2019s estimate were derived from models that have  undergone validation, verification, and accreditation, others were not. For  example, the model that was used to develop the estimate of the recurring  travel cost for the maintenance workers who would travel from Norfolk  Naval Shipyard to work on the carrier\u2019s nuclear propulsion systems in  Mayport underwent a documented validation, verification, and  accreditation process. Similarly, the DOD\u2019s facilities sustainment model  that was used to calculate the recurring facilities sustainment costs was  also validated, verified, and accredited. However, we did not find any  evidence that any validated, verified, or accredited model was used for  calculating the costs of transporting equipment for the carrier air wing, the  cost of the differential in the basic allowance for housing between Norfolk  and Mayport, the cost of the differential in utilities charges between  Norfolk and Mayport, or the cost of the permanent change of station for  the aircraft carrier crew. In terms of risk analysis, only the military  construction estimates contained any consideration of risk, in the form of  contingency factors.", "Moreover, we found that the Navy has not assigned a single office with the  responsibility for ensuring that the overall estimate for Mayport  homeporting was packaged into a comprehensive and well documented  final estimate and that a sensitivity analysis was conducted on the  estimate to determine which cost elements, and which factors of those  cost elements, most influenced the overall cost. When an organization  does not assign a single office responsibility for assembling the estimate  into a comprehensive package, it is difficult to conduct proper sensitivity  and risk analyses. Additionally, different offices preparing parts of the  estimate may use conflicting assumptions. For example, different offices  may use different assumptions regarding the treatment of inflation.  Some  costs may be expressed in base year dollars, while others are expressed in  then-year dollars.  This was the case with the Navy\u2019s original estimates  which showed one-time costs in then-year dollars and recurring costs in  base year 2010 dollars.  Even if amounts are all expressed using the same  type of dollars, different contributors may use different inflation indexes,  resulting in conflicting underlying assumptions.", "According to GAO\u2019s guide, cost estimates are credible when    major assumptions have been varied and other outcomes recomputed  to determine how sensitive outcomes are to changes in the  assumptions,  risk and uncertainty analyses have been performed to determine the  level of risk associated with the estimate, and  the estimate\u2019s results have been cross-checked and an independent  cost estimate has been developed to determine whether other  estimating methods produce similar results.", "Sensitivity and risk analyses should be included in all cost estimates as a  best practice because all estimates have some uncertainty. A sensitivity  analysis addresses some of the estimating uncertainty by testing discrete  cases of assumptions and other factors that could change. By examining  each assumption or factor independently, while holding all others  constant, the cost estimator can evaluate the results to discover which  assumptions or factors most influence the estimate. However, because  many parameters could change at the same time, a risk analysis should  also be performed to capture the cumulative effect of additional risks. Risk  analysis adds to the credibility of a cost estimate because it quantifies the  uncertainty and provides a level of confidence associated with the point  estimate. The results of a high-quality, reliable cost estimate should also be  cross-checked, and an independent cost estimate should be developed to  determine whether other estimating methods produce similar results. An  independent cost estimate is considered to be one of the most reliable  validation methods and is typically performed by organizations higher in  the decision-making process, or entirely outside of the office performing  the baseline cost estimate, using different estimating techniques and,  where possible, different data sources from those used to develop the  baseline cost estimate.", "Performing a sensitivity analysis for the Mayport aircraft carrier estimate  would help to identify and focus on key elements with the greatest effects  on cost and understand the potential for cost growth and the reasons for  it. Additionally, because the Navy has not conducted a risk and uncertainty  analysis, it is unable to provide Congress with a reasonably high  confidence level for its Mayport aircraft carrier cost estimate. Performing  a risk and uncertainty analysis would enable the Navy to quantify the risk  and uncertainty associated with the cost model; provide a level of  confidence for its cost estimate; and give decision makers perspective on  the potential variability of the cost estimate should facts, circumstances,  and assumptions change.", "Navy officials told us that short time frames and budgetary constraints  prevented them from following the criteria for comprehensiveness,  accuracy, documentation, and credibility in developing their estimate.  For elements of the recurring costs, such as the travel and per diem for  public shipyard workers, the estimates were produced in response to  different congressional requests for information often requiring quick  turnaround\u2014in some cases as short as 3 days. Navy officials told us that in  the case of the military construction estimates, their intention was not to  develop budget quality estimates, but rather an estimate more suitable for  initial programming and planning purposes. Navy officials noted that this  is a typical approach for construction projects that are not scheduled to  begin for several years. According to the Navy, it would have been cost  prohibitive to develop budget quality estimates for every proposed military  construction project. Navy officials stated that the Navy further reviews  and refines the construction estimates as they proceed through the DOD  budget process. Because many of the projects planned for Mayport would  be included in future budgets, these projects have not yet undergone this  review. Consistent with prior experience, it may not have been feasible for  the Navy to follow cost estimating best practices to the fullest extent in  developing initial estimates, especially given the short time frames often  available. However, as the Navy continues to respond to congressional  interest in the costs associated with homeporting a nuclear carrier at  Mayport, it has the opportunity to more completely incorporate cost  estimating best practices in its revised estimate, thereby improving the  estimate\u2019s quality and making it easier to defend in future budgets and  decision making."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The Navy\u2019s ability to produce a comprehensive, accurate, well  documented, and credible cost estimate for homeporting a nuclear- powered aircraft carrier at Naval Station Mayport will continue to be  hampered until it makes certain fundamental changes to the process it  uses to develop, document, and update its overall estimate of Mayport  homeporting costs.

Further, without conducting sensitivity and  risk and uncertainty analyses on its cost estimate, the Navy is unable to  identify and focus on major cost drivers, analyze the potential for cost  growth, and quantify the risk and uncertainty associated with the cost  estimate. Moreover, without a comprehensive, accurate, well documented,  and credible cost estimate, Congress cannot have reasonable confidence  that it has a complete understanding and an accurate and realistic  determination of the projected costs to evaluate and make decisions on  the Navy\u2019s planned homeporting of a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier at  Mayport."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To improve the Navy\u2019s life-cycle cost estimate for the planned  homeporting of a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier at Naval Station  Mayport, Florida, we recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct the  Secretary of the Navy to take the following three actions to incorporate to  a greater extent the best practices identified by GAO for developing a high- quality cost estimate in future revisions of its Mayport nuclear carrier  homeporting cost estimate as part of the annual budgetary process or in  response to future congressional requests:  1.  To improve the comprehensiveness of its cost estimate, the Navy  should    include all potential recurring costs, and     clearly describe the ground rules and assumptions underlying the  estimation of each cost element;  2.  To improve the quality and transparency of the Navy\u2019s estimate, the  Navy should thoroughly document the life-cycle costs associated with  homeporting a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier at Naval Station  Mayport. Specifically, documentation should   identify the source data used, their reliability, and how the data  were normalized,   describe the steps used in developing the overall estimate so that it  can be clearly understood and easily replicated, and    describe in sufficient detail the estimating methodology and  calculations performed to derive each element\u2019s cost; and  3.

DOD stated that the elements, or cost estimating  best practices, cited in our recommendations may contribute to improved  quality in cost estimates, but they may not be ideally suited to the myriad  situations in which the Navy is required, or may be requested, to provide  cost estimates to Congress.", "We recognize that it may not have been feasible for the Navy to always  follow cost estimating best practices to the fullest extent in developing  some of its initial estimates, especially when the preparation time for some  estimates may have been limited. However, both recommendations were  directed at improving future Navy cost estimates associated with the  Mayport carrier homeporting. As the Navy continues to respond to  congressional interest, we believe it has the opportunity to more  completely incorporate the cost estimating best practices we identified in  our report in its revised estimates for Mayport in order to improve the  quality of its estimates. Additionally, DOD states that the similarity  between our initial estimate and the Navy\u2019s budget estimate for dredging  costs suggests that the Navy\u2019s programming/budgeting process leads to  high-quality, credible cost estimates. However, the Navy\u2019s overall Mayport  estimate currently includes several cost elements that have not been  refined through a programming/budgeting process. Furthermore, as  described in our report, GAO\u2019s criteria for assessing high-quality, credible  estimates involve factors that go beyond the accuracy of any individual  point estimate. The convergence between our estimate and the Navy\u2019s  estimate on a single cost element is not an indication by itself of the  quality of the Navy\u2019s overall estimate for homeporting a nuclear carrier at  Mayport. Improving the Mayport estimate\u2019s quality will allow the Navy to  more easily defend its plans in future decisionmaking and budgets within  DOD. We believe that in order to best inform the budget decisionmaking  process of the likely costs, affordability, and scheduling of funding needed  to support the Navy\u2019s plans for Mayport, DOD should take every available  opportunity to provide Congress with the highest quality cost estimates  possible. We therefore believe these two recommendations remain valid.", "DOD disagreed with our third recommendation that the Secretary of  Defense direct the Secretary of the Navy to improve the accuracy and  credibility of its cost estimate by assigning a single office with the  responsibility for assembling the overall estimate into a comprehensive  and well documented package and for performing sensitivity and risk and  uncertainty analyses on the overall estimate. DOD stated that  responsibilities for centralized supervision and coordination of  programming and budgeting within the Department of the Navy are well- established and that Navy program/budget estimates and exhibits are  prepared and submitted in accordance with the Office of the Secretary of  Defense guidance. DOD further noted that reports to Congress are  typically assigned to a central office for preparation and coordination and  that where necessary, instructions to the offices providing inputs can  include guidance on baseline assumptions.", "As we state in our report, the Navy\u2019s level of coordination used in  packaging its final cost estimate did not ensure that the offices providing  inputs adequately and completely documented the cost estimates and did  not provide for the implementation of sensitivity and risk and uncertainty  analyses. Additionally, the Navy\u2019s final cost estimate was not consistent in  its use of various baseline assumptions, such as consistency in using either  then-year or constant dollars in the individual original estimates that made  up the Navy\u2019s final estimate for Mayport. This lack of consistency limits  the Navy\u2019s ability to appropriately combine the estimates from different  offices into a single, coherent cost estimate. High-quality cost estimating  requires good organization and a consistent approach in pulling together  disparate data for each cost element and packaging it as an accurate and  credible whole. Thus, without a single office\u2014within the already  established programming/budgeting process\u2014that is responsible for  assembling future revisions of its Mayport estimate, the Navy will continue  to lack assurance that its overall estimate is comprehensive, well  documented, accurate, and credible.
