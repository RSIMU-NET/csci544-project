The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 required DOD to develop business case analyses for its shared service proposals as part of its submissions on its plans for the implementation of DHA, including, among other things, the purpose of the shared service and the anticipated cost savings. Although DOD has stated that the Directorate is a shared service that combines common services and that it will result in cost savings, DOD has not fully developed the required business case analysis for the medical education and training reforms. This is because DOD has not yet completed the first step of the process, which includes identifying the specific problems that the reform is intended to address and thereby achieve cost savings. Unlike the medical education and training reforms, other DOD shared service projects present a clear linkage between (1) a stated problem, (2) proposed process changes, and (3) an estimate of benefits, costs, and risks. For the Directorate, DOD has identified the new processes it will employ, but has not identified the concerns the proposed new processes are intended to address and how they will achieve cost savings. In addition, some officials are unconvinced that the potential cost savings will be achieved, and stated that the creation of the Directorate serves more as a functional realignment than a cost savings endeavor. Without a fully developed business case analysis, it is unclear how DOD will measure any accomplishments and hold the Directorate accountable for achieving cost savings.", "DOD is unable to determine whether the consolidation of training at the Medical Education and Training Campus (METC) resulted in cost savings; however, DOD is taking action to improve some of the processes for evaluating the effectiveness of training at METC. DOD co-located medical training for enlisted medical servicemembers at METC as part of the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure Commission (BRAC) process to achieve cost savings, and subsequently, the services decided to consolidate their training. However, some officials stated they were unsure whether all funds were transferred to METC. Furthermore, due to a shortage of military service funds, the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs provided funding for METC in addition to the services' transfers. DOD is unable to determine whether the consolidation of training at METC resulted in cost savings because it did not develop baseline cost information as part of its metrics to assess METC's success. Baseline cost information is a key characteristic of performance metrics critical to ensuring that processes achieve the desired results. Without baseline cost information prior to future course consolidation of training at METC and within the Education and Training Directorate, DOD will be unable to assess potential cost savings. DOD has designed processes to evaluate the quality of training at METC\u2014including processes related to certification rates, accreditation, and surveys. Further, DOD has taken action to improve some processes. For example, to improve the level of feedback received from METC surveys, METC officials have begun a pilot process to conduct their own post-graduation surveys."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DOD conduct a fully developed business case analysis for the Education and Training Directorate and develop baseline cost information as part of its metrics to assess cost savings for future consolidation efforts.

This  network consists of institutions located across the United States, with  some providing training to participants from all three military services and  others providing training within a single service setting. DOD trains its  officers and enlisted servicemembers for a wide variety of medical  positions (e.g., physicians, dentists, nurses, therapists, and laboratory  technicians) and expended approximately $655 million on such training in  fiscal year 2013. This includes funds appropriated to the Defense Health  Program, which provides support for education and training opportunities  for medical personnel and includes resources for specialized skill training,  formal educational programs outside DOD, and professional development  education programs at various military sponsored schools.", "Over the past decade, decisionmakers have recognized the need to  transform the Military Health System (MHS) to better control rapidly  escalating health care costs and take advantage of opportunities to  realize savings. For example, the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure  (BRAC) Commission and DOD in its 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review  called for transforming medical education and training. Specifically, the  2005 BRAC recommended co-locating all (except Aerospace Medicine)  medical basic and specialty training for enlisted servicemembers from  several locations to a single site, known as the Medical Education and  Training Campus (METC), in San Antonio, Texas. In implementing this  BRAC recommendation, the services decided to consolidate courses  where feasible to achieve cost savings and facilitate interservice training,  and METC began training students in 2010 as a tri-service institution. In  April 2012, we reported that DOD had not documented savings resulting  from the creation of METC, but agency officials believed that combining  several training sites into METC had saved money and that other  efficiencies had been achieved. We recommended, and DOD concurred,  that DOD should employ key management practices to show both  financial and nonfinancial achievements from its governance initiatives.  Further, in October 2013, DOD established the Defense Health Agency  (DHA) to, among other things, combine common (\u201cshared\u201d) medical  services with the intent of achieving cost savings. DHA\u2019s Education and  Training Directorate is intended to oversee and manage many aspects of  medical education and training and is scheduled to begin operations in  August 2014. Our recent report on DOD\u2019s efforts to reform the MHS  focused on the establishment of the DHA. Specifically, in November  2013, we found that DOD lacked a thorough explanation of the potential  sources of cost savings in its shared service projects, a plan to monitor  potential implementation costs increases for these projects, and a current  baseline assessment of MHS personnel and final staffing requirements  for the DHA. As a result, we made a number of recommendations to  provide decision makers with more complete information on the planned  implementation, management, and oversight of DOD\u2019s newly created  DHA, and DOD concurred with our recommendations, as discussed later  in this report.", "The House Armed Services Committee Report accompanying the  National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014 (H.R.

Specifically, DOD identified three product lines for the  directorate, which involve (1) management of professional development,  sustainment, and related programs, including the METC, the Defense  Medical Readiness and Training Institute, and the Joint Medical Executive  Skills Institute; (2) academic review and policy oversight functions,  including management of online courses and modeling and simulation  programs; and (3) management of academic and administrative support  functions, such as training and conference approval processes. According  to DOD\u2019s second submission to Congress, the overall purpose and core  measure of success for all shared services is the achievement of cost  savings. This focus differentiates the objective of establishing shared  services from the six other objectives outlined in DOD\u2019s plans for the  implementation of the DHA. However, in its plans, DOD has not  demonstrated how its Education and Training Directorate projects will  result in cost savings through a fully developed business case analysis,  including an analysis of benefits, costs, and risks. In its third submission  to Congress on its implementation plans for DHA, DOD presented  estimates of costs and cost savings for two \u201csub-product lines\u201d  concerning modeling and simulation and online learning. However, these  projects do not represent the core of the directorate\u2019s mission, but rather  a portion of the academic review and policy oversight project. Further,  these projects overlap with DHA\u2019s contracting and information technology  shared services. Specifically, while cost savings for modeling and  simulation are allocated to the Education and Training Directorate,  implementation costs are to be incurred by the DHA contracting shared  service. In addition, the savings for the online learning project are found  within the DHA information technology shared service portfolio. Aside  from these projects, DOD did not present information concerning the cost  savings of its other shared service projects within the Education and  Training Directorate.", "GAO\u2019s Business Process Reengineering Assessment Guide states that a  business case begins with (1) measuring performance and identifying  problems in meeting mission goals, which is then addressed through (2)  the development and selection of a new process.

The Guide further states that as a project matures, the  business case should be enlarged and updated to present a full picture of  the benefits, costs, and risks involved in moving to a new process. Such  analysis is to provide a sound basis to proceed with the reengineering  process. DOD\u2019s own process for developing its shared services, outlined  in its second submission on implementation of the DHA, states that after  an assessment of the current state of performance and measures of  effectiveness have been identified, performance improvement and cost  reduction opportunities should be identified. It also states that new  processes and initiatives are to be developed to address these  challenges, along with associated implementation costs. Further, the  National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 required DOD to  develop business case analyses for its shared service proposals as part  of its submissions on its plans for the implementation of the DHA,  including, among other things, the purpose of the shared service and the  anticipated cost savings.", "DOD does not have a fully developed business case analysis for medical  education and training because it has not yet completed the first step of  that analysis, which is to identify specific problems, which, given the  stated purpose of shared services, should be directed toward the  achievement of cost savings. Several of DOD\u2019s other shared service  projects present a clear linkage between (1) a stated problem, (2)  proposed process changes, and (3) an estimate of benefits, costs, and  risks. For example, DOD\u2019s third submission on the implementation of  DHA, states that the pharmacy shared service will address rising costs  due to variation in drug purchasing, staffing, and formulary management  (the problem) through the introduction of MHS-wide standards and  business rules (the new processes), which will result in cost savings.  Similarly, the plan states that the contracting shared services will address  rising costs due to fragmentation in its acquisition strategy (the problem)  through a common approach to acquisition planning, program  management, contract execution, management, and administration (the  new processes).

However, in its official plans for the  Directorate, DOD has not identified this issue or any other challenge  related to cost savings as the problem its shared service will address.  DOD also lacks the information to assess its current performance to then  identify a problem. Specifically, DOD officials stated that they lack data on  the cost of DOD\u2019s education programs and potential redundancy within its  portfolio of courses, which would allow them to identify a problem and  develop processes to address these challenges. In fact, officials stated  they have identified the need for developing a baseline of current medical  education and training courses and associated spending as a goal for the  Directorate, and therefore have acknowledged the lack of such  information. In addition, some officials cast doubt on the potential cost  savings that could be achieved. Several DOD officials told us that the  creation of the Directorate represents a logical step in the course of  further cooperation among the services in the area of medical training.

However, we found in 2012 that DOD did not have  a plan for achieving cost savings. For example, during our review of  DOD\u2019s effort to implement this BRAC recommendation, joint base officials  provided us with anecdotal examples of efficiencies that had been  achieved at joint bases, but it was unclear whether DOD had achieved  any significant cost savings to date, due in part to weaknesses in such  areas as DOD\u2019s approach to tracking costs and estimated savings.  Specifically, it did not establish quantifiable and measurable  implementation goals for how to achieve cost savings or efficiencies  through joint basing. We recommended that DOD develop and implement  a plan that provides measurable goals linked to achieving savings and  efficiencies at the joint bases and provide guidance to the joint bases that  directs them to identify opportunities for cost savings and efficiencies.", "DOD did not concur with our recommendation, and we noted that this  position contradicts DOD\u2019s position that joint basing would realize cost  savings. Similarly, the co-location and consolidation of training at METC  was, in part, premised on the achievement of cost savings, but DOD did  not establish baseline costs as part of its metrics for assessing  performance.", "It is now likely not possible to develop baseline cost information for fiscal  year 2009 to determine the extent to which the establishment of METC  resulted in cost savings. However, without developing baseline cost  information before undergoing future course consolidation of training at  METC and within the Education and Training Directorate, DOD will be  unable to accurately assess cost savings in the future."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Has Designed Processes for Evaluating the Effectiveness of Training and Is Taking Action to Address Accreditation and Survey Response Issues", "paragraphs": ["METC has designed quality assurance processes to provide continuous,  evaluative feedback related to improvements in education and training  support, and is taking action to address issues regarding course  accreditation and the post-graduation survey process."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "METC Has Established Quality Assurance Processes", "paragraphs": ["Certification Rates: METC monitors the national certification exam  pass rates of its students, both to meet national requirements and to  make comparisons with national averages.

When DOD responded to the 2005 BRAC recommendation to relocate  some medical education and training programs for enlisted  servicemembers at METC, DOD similarly did not have key information  necessary to determine whether the consolidation of training there had  resulted in cost savings. Although DOD\u2019s plans for the implementation of  the DHA acknowledge the benefits of conducting business case analyses,  it has not done so for its medical education and training reforms. DOD\u2019s  inability to demonstrate that cost savings had resulted from the  consolidation of training at METC risks being repeated on a larger scale  in the reform effort of the DHA\u2019s Education and Training Directorate.  Specifically, absent analysis demonstrating how the Directorate\u2019s efforts  will result in cost savings, the creation of the Directorate could increase  costs by increasing staff levels without achieving any cost savings. In  addition, without baseline cost information prior to future course  consolidation of training at METC and within the Education and Training  Directorate, DOD will be unable to assess potential cost savings.
