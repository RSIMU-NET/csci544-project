Senate Report 114-255 included a provision for GAO to review the Navy's and the Marine Corps' strategies for unmanned system operators. GAO examined, among other things, the extent to which the Navy and the Marine Corps have (1) evaluated workforce alternatives (such as the use of civilians and contractors) for unmanned system operators and (2) developed and updated personnel requirements and related policies and goals for selected unmanned systems. GAO compared documentation on unmanned systems with DOD policies and conducted discussion groups with unmanned system operators."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Navy and the Marine Corps are rapidly growing their portfolios of unmanned aerial systems (UAS) and unmanned maritime systems and have opted to use military personnel as operators without evaluating alternatives, such as federal civilian employees and private sector contractors. Service officials stated that civilians or contractors are not viable alternatives and policies are unclear about when and how to use them. However, a June 2016 Department of Defense-commissioned study found that alternative staffing strategies could meet the UAS mission more cost-effectively. Military personnel may be the most appropriate option for unmanned systems, but without clarifying policies to identify circumstances in which civilians and contractors may serve in operational roles, the services could continue to make workforce decisions that do not consider all available resources.", "The Navy and the Marine Corps have sufficient personnel requirements or efforts underway to develop personnel requirements for seven unmanned systems that GAO reviewed (see fig.), but requirements for one system (i.e., the RQ-21 Blackjack UAS) have not been updated. That system's requirements have not been updated because service entities disagree about whether they are sufficient. Since 2015, units have deployed with about two to three times the personnel that headquarters and command officials expected they would need. Marine Corps officials stated that the Blackjack's personnel requirements were based on an outdated concept of operations and are insufficient for supporting workloads. Without updating the personnel requirements for the Blackjack UAS, the services will lack current information about the number of personnel needed.", "The Department of the Navy has taken positive steps but has not fully evaluated and updated aviation policies that affect personnel requirements for certain UAS and lacks clear goals for informing future requirements for all of its UASs. GAO found that the policies do not fully account for differences between UASs of varying sizes and capabilities. These policies require, for example, that the Blackjack UAS be held to the same maintenance standards designed for larger aircraft and UAS, which in turn affects personnel requirements. Until the Department of the Navy evaluates and updates such policies and clarifies related goals, the services will be hampered in developing and updating future requirements as unmanned system inventories grow and operations expand."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making ten recommendations, including that the Navy and the Marine Corps clarify policies to identify circumstances in which civilians and contractors may serve in operational roles and apply the policies to future evaluations; update personnel requirements for one UAS; and evaluate and update policies and goals to inform future personnel requirements.

As discussed in the report, GAO continues to believe that all ten are warranted."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Navy\u2019s top senior leaders have emphasized the growing importance  of unmanned systems to future fleet operations. In 2015, for example, the  Secretary of the Navy established a Deputy Assistant Secretary for  Unmanned Systems and announced that the F-35 Lightning II will likely  be the last manned strike fighter aircraft the Department of the Navy will  buy or fly. The Chief of Naval Operations announced in 2017 that the  future of the Navy includes unmanned aerial, surface, and underwater  systems as an integral part of the future fleet and that these systems  must be purchased in large numbers in order to expand the Navy\u2019s  presence in key areas. To fulfill its commitment to rapidly grow its  portfolio of unmanned systems, the Department of the Navy included  nearly $10 billion in its budget for fiscal years 2018 through 2022 for  unmanned aerial systems (UAS), unmanned surface vehicles (USV), and  unmanned underwater vehicles (UUV). The Navy also committed to  tailoring policies to support expeditious acquisition processes. The  Department of the Navy has at least 24 different types of unmanned  systems in various stages of development, testing, and fielding to units.", "Despite their name, \u201cunmanned\u201d systems require personnel who are  integral to performing their missions. Operator personnel are needed to  transit, launch, navigate, and recover unmanned systems and control and  monitor their payloads (e.g., sensors for identifying terrain or targets);  maintainers are needed to perform preventive and corrective  maintenance tasks; and other support personnel are needed for post- mission analyses of data the systems gather. According to DOD policy,  the initial steps in planning for personnel requirements include  determining categories of eligible personnel (i.e., military servicemembers  or the other two workforce alternatives of federal civilian employees and  private sector contractors) based on whether the activities to be  performed are \u201cinherently governmental\u201d or \u201ccommercial.\u201d The next step  involves the identification of the appropriate and cost-effective  combination of eligible personnel categories (i.e., workforce mix). Military  servicemembers and federal civilians must be considered before the  services may consider using private sector contractors as a workforce  alternative to perform a function. Following that step are analyses of the  numbers of personnel required and the staffing approaches needed to fill  personnel requirements.", "Since 2001, we have identified the strategic management of human  capital as a high-risk area across the government in part because of the  mission-critical skills gaps within the federal workforce that pose a high  risk to the nation by impeding the government from cost-effectively  serving the public and achieving results. Related to the UAS workforces,  we issued multiple reports from 2014 through 2017 on the Army\u2019s and the  Air Force\u2019s personnel strategies for UAS operators. For example, in  January 2017 we reported that neither the Air Force nor the Army had  evaluated its UAS operator workforce mix to determine an effective and  efficient mix of personnel for meeting mission needs. We recommended  that the Air Force and the Army evaluate their workforce mix and the use  of federal civilians for UAS pilot positions and conduct cost analyses  consistent with Department of Defense (DOD) guidance. DOD concurred  with both recommendations but has not yet implemented them. A list of  related products is included at the end of this report.", "A Senate Armed Services Committee report accompanying a proposed  bill for the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017  includes a provision for us to review the Department of the Navy\u2019s  personnel strategies for unmanned systems, including UASs, USVs, and  UUVs. This report addresses the extent to which the Navy and the  Marine Corps have (1) evaluated workforce alternatives for their  unmanned system operators, including the use of federal civilian  employees and private sector contractors; (2) developed and updated  personnel requirements and related policies and goals that affect  requirements for operators, maintainers, and other support personnel for  selected unmanned systems; and (3) developed approaches for staffing  unmanned system operators to meet personnel requirements.", "For these objectives, we used a case study approach to review the  Navy\u2019s and the Marine Corps\u2019 evaluations of workforce alternatives,  development and updates of personnel requirements and related policies  and goals, and staffing approaches for selected unmanned systems. Of  24 Navy and the Marine Corps unmanned systems in development as  programs of record in calendar year 2016, we selected: four UASs\u2014the  Navy\u2019s MQ-4 Triton, MQ-8 Fire Scout, MQ-25 Stingray, and the Marine  Corps\u2019 RQ-21 Blackjack; two USVs\u2014the Unmanned Influence Sweep  System and the Mine Countermeasures USV\u2014associated with the  Navy\u2019s littoral combat ships; and two types of Navy UUVs\u2014the MK 18  family of UUV systems and the Snakehead Large Displacement UUV\u2014 based on their size and missions. While the UUV case study findings  are not generalizable, they provide illustrative examples for each  objective. In appendix I, we provide additional information on each of  these eight unmanned systems.", "For objective one, we compared any Navy and Marine Corps efforts to  evaluate workforce alternatives\u2014specifically the use of federal civilian  employees and private security contractors\u2014for operators of unmanned  systems with two DOD policies: (1) DOD Directive 1100.4, Guidance for  Manpower Management and (2) DOD Instruction 1100.22, Policy and  Procedures for Determining Workforce Mix. DOD Directive 1100.4  directs that authorities should consider all available sources when  determining workforce mix. DOD Instruction 1100.22 directs the steps  that workforce planning authorities must take in planning for personnel  requirements. We analyzed documentation on the services\u2019 efforts to  evaluate alternative workforces for unmanned system operator positions,  and interviewed knowledgeable officials about such evaluations and any  reasons for not evaluating workforce alternatives. We also compared the  services\u2019 respective policies on workforce planning with DOD policies and  with federal internal controls standards that emphasize the importance of  having clear, updated policies that align with an organization\u2019s mission  and goals. Finally, we reviewed DOD-commissioned workforce mix  studies and interviewed officials from the Office of the Under Secretary of  Defense for Personnel and Readiness (OUSD(P&R)) to identify benefits  and limitations of the different personnel categories as workforce  alternatives.", "For objective two, we reviewed the Navy\u2019s and the Marine Corps\u2019 efforts  to develop and update personnel requirements for our selected case  study systems and interviewed knowledgeable service officials about their  perception of the sufficiency of those personnel requirements for  supporting training and deployment requirements. We compared  requirements documents with DOD Directive 1100.4, which states that  personnel requirements should be driven by workload and established at  the minimum levels necessary to accomplish mission and performance  objectives, and with Navy Instruction 1000.16L. The Navy instruction  states that personnel requirements must be validated as program  changes dictate and at a minimum annually over a system\u2019s lifecycle to  determine if a personnel update is required. We also compared the life  cycle cost estimate for the RQ-21 Blackjack with DOD Instruction  5000.02, Operation of the Defense Acquisition System, and with Office of  Management and Budget guidance. DOD Instruction 5000.02 requires  that components determine a weapon system program\u2019s life cycle cost by  planning for the many factors needed to support the system, including  personnel. The Office of Management and Budget guidance states that to  keep the cost analyses for capital assets, such as weapon systems,  current, accurate, and valid, cost estimating should be continuously  updated based on the latest information available as programs mature.", "We also reviewed the Navy\u2019s policies on operating and maintaining UAS  and documentation from the Marine Corps about any effects of those  policies on personnel workload, and interviewed service officials about  any effects and efforts to review and update policies. We then compared  those efforts with DOD policy and with federal internal controls standards  that emphasize the importance of having clear, updated policies that align  with an organization\u2019s mission and goals. Finally, we compared goals  established in DOD\u2019s Unmanned Systems Integrated Roadmap, FY2013- 2038 and Department of the Navy strategy documents on unmanned  systems with federal internal controls standards that state than an  agency\u2019s management should define goals clearly to enable the  identification of risk.", "For objective three, we reviewed the Navy\u2019s and the Marine Corps\u2019  approaches for selecting, training, and tracking unmanned system  operators to identify any challenges. We also reviewed Navy reports and  Marine Corps data on operator inventory and retention levels relative to  the services\u2019 requirements and goals. Specifically, we reviewed Navy  reports on the retention of certain aviation personnel to serve as UAS  operators for fiscal years 2015 through 2017 because data from earlier  years were less relevant given the lower numbers of UAS inventories. We  requested data from the Marine Corps on its inventories of and  requirements for enlisted UAS operators for fiscal years 2007 through  2017, and on UAS officers for fiscal years 2013 (the first year of available  data) through 2017. We requested retention data\u2014actual numbers of  personnel who reenlisted versus annual quotas\u2014on enlisted UAS  operators for fiscal years 2010 (the earliest year for which data were  available) through 2017.", "We assessed the reliability of the Marine Corps\u2019 data by administering  questionnaires to obtain information on the quality control measures in  place to ensure that the data systems record, track, and report reliable  data, and by interviewing knowledgeable officials and manually testing  the data for errors and omissions. We found the data to be sufficiently  reliable for our purposes of describing personnel inventory trends and the  sufficiency of operator personnel to meet requirements. We found that the  retention data are of undetermined reliability but are reporting them  because they are the data of record used by Marine Corps planning  officials.", "We also compared Navy and Marine Corps financial incentives for  retaining personnel as UAS operators with DOD\u2019s 2012 Eleventh  Quadrennial Review of Military Compensation, which established that  organizations should assess civilian supply and demand and civilian  wages to determine the most cost-effective special and incentive pay  strategies. We compared any Marine Corps efforts to address workforce  challenges specific to the Marine Corps\u2019 UAS operator career field with a  key principle of strategic human capital planning from our prior work,  which states that agencies should ensure that \u201cflexibilities\u201d are part of  their overall human capital strategy.

For seven  of the eight selected systems, the officials stated that they did not  evaluate the use of federal civilians or contractors in their determinations  for using military personnel for their operator workforces. In the case of an  eighth system, the MQ-4 Triton UAS, the Navy evaluated using contractor  personnel, but did so without first considering the use of federal civilian  employees as DOD policy requires. In a 2009 analysis for the Triton, the  Navy concluded that comparisons between the cost-effectiveness of  using military personnel and federal civilian employees were beyond the  expertise of the working group that performed the analysis. Ultimately, the  Navy decided to use military personnel as Triton operators.", "According to senior-level officials from OUSD(P&R), there are concerns  within the department about the level of consideration the military  services have applied to workforce mix alternatives for unmanned system  operators. As a result, OUSD(P&R) and other entities from the Office of  the Secretary of Defense commissioned the Institute for Defense  Analyses to conduct a study, which was published in June 2016, on  alternative staffing strategies to enable DOD to accomplish UAS-related  missions more cost-effectively. The study found that staffing alternatives  exist for each service and could produce cost savings. According to the  Institute for Defense Analyses\u2019 report, the use of enlisted personnel for a  portion of the Navy\u2019s and the Air Forces\u2019 UAS operator workforces offers  the potential for savings, as could the use of limited duty officers or  warrant officers. The Institute for Defense Analyses also reported that  federal civilian employees of DOD could generate the most substantial  savings of the options studied if they were used in combination with  military servicemembers as UAS operators responsible for the launch and  recovery of air vehicles.

For example, officials cited  concerns that federal civilians cannot serve aboard Navy ships or provide  rapid deployment capability. However, officials from OUSD(P&R) told us  that these concerns are inaccurate, noting that federal civilian employees  have deployed on Navy ships. Further, we note that DOD\u2019s Expeditionary  Civilian Workforce comprises federal civilian employees across DOD  components who are available to deploy within 120 days of notice to meet  urgent requirements. DOD officials responsible for the Expeditionary  Civilian Workforce program stated that such personnel are intended to be  predictable, reliable, and effective so that the military services will source  them and the combatant commands can depend upon them.", "Further, service workforce planners stated that relevant service-level  guidance is unclear on when and how such personnel can and should be  considered for performing in operational roles and in deployable  positions. The Navy\u2019s and the Marine Corps\u2019 policies do not provide  details about the types of operational roles specific to a service, including  those related to unmanned system operators, that could be filled with  federal civilians or private sector contractors, nor do the policies provide  guidance on the limitations and benefits of using these personnel  sources, such as those identified in DOD-commissioned reports and our  prior work. For example, military personnel can be the most costly of the  three personnel categories and shortages exist in certain functions that  have been deemed military essential and are in high demand, such as  fighter pilots. On the other hand, federal civilians and private sector  contractors can be cost-effective and may augment military  servicemembers on a short-term basis if needed (see table 1).", "Federal internal controls standards emphasize the importance of having  clear, updated policies that align with an organization\u2019s mission and  goals. Officials from the Office of the Secretary of the Navy for  Manpower and Reserve Affairs agreed that the cited service policies do  not provide the sort of detail and clarity that could aid planners and  decision makers with determining eligible personnel categories for their  workforces and weighing the benefits and limitations thereof. Clarifying  their respective workforce planning policies could help workforce planners  better understand when, where, and how federal civilians or contractors  may serve in operational roles (e.g., from shore or from underway naval  vessels) and what the benefits and limitations are. The use of military  servicemembers, and not federal civilians or private sector contractors, as  unmanned system operators may indeed be the most appropriate and  cost-effective workforce option for the Navy and the Marine Corps.

In contrast, higher level command and service  headquarters entities in the Navy and the Marine Corps have established  a requirement of nine Marine Corps personnel per detachment, including  three enlisted UAS operators and one UAS officer along with  maintenance and support personnel. Squadron officials stated to the  Navy and the Marine Corps in their written rebuttal of the 9-person  requirement that 13 more personnel are needed to support operations for  10 to 12 hours per day, or up to 24 hours a day for 10-day surges in  operations, and to comply with naval aviation maintenance procedures.

According to officials from the Navy Manpower  Analysis Center, correctly determining personnel workload and the  related numbers of personnel required for operation and maintenance is  especially critical for UAS units because of the safety risks associated  with operating in shared airspaces and over populated areas. These  officials also stated that naval aviation policies\u2014which apply to manned  aircraft and UAS\u2014affect the workload of operators and maintenance  personnel and the numbers required to achieve a squadron\u2019s mission and  meet the standards prescribed in the policies. For example, the Naval Air  Training and Operating Procedures Standardization manual contains  provisions for pilot fatigue and hours they can fly compared with the hours  they must rest. Further, the Naval Aviation Maintenance Program  instruction prescribes standards for performing and documenting quality  assurance steps for maintenance tasks, among other things.", "Our review of these selected policies found that some naval aviation  standards have been modified to account for UAS separately from  manned aircraft, and to some extent between UAS of different sizes and  capabilities. The Naval Air Training and Operating Procedures  Standardization manual was updated in 2016 with a new chapter for UAS  policies and operations. The Naval Aviation Maintenance Program  instruction has been updated to specify that UAS of groups 3, 4, and 5  will always be governed by the policy similar to manned aircraft, with a  few exceptions, such as compass calibration.", "Notwithstanding these updates, Marine Corps headquarters- and unit- level officials told us that the policies have not been fully reviewed and  updated to account for differences in UAS of varying sizes and  capabilities, especially group 3 UAS, which are those systems weighing  55 to 1,320 pounds. According to these officials, applying certain  procedures and standards from these policies equally across different  sizes of UAS is problematic for group 3 UAS in particular, which includes  the RQ-21 Blackjack. The officials stated that the application of such  standards affects workloads and personnel levels in a way that prevents  squadrons from accomplishing their missions as efficiently as possible.  Specifically, they stated that upholding current naval aviation standards is  one key reason\u2014the other being changes to the concept of operations for  the RQ-21 Blackjack\u2014for having staffed up to 21 more personnel per  RQ-21 Blackjack detachment than the 9-person requirement discussed  earlier in this report.", "Applying naval aviation operating and maintenance standards equally  across different sizes of UAS may not align with the Marine Corps\u2019  concept of operations, which states that all UAS are intended to be  recovered by landing or capture even though they may be expendable.  Each RQ-21 Blackjack system includes five air vehicles, more than one of  which could be unavailable for assigned missions at the same time. For  example, Marine Corps officials told us that damage to RQ-21 Blackjack  air vehicles can be caused by weather, a deficiency with the air vehicle  itself, a crash landing, or a combination of factors, and up to three air  vehicles could be unavailable at a time. These officials told us that  holding the RQ-21 Blackjack to maintenance standards designed for  other non-expendable aircraft may not be efficient because their  application has a limited effect on mishap rates relative to the additional  personnel needed to uphold the standards. Moreover, in discussion  groups we held with Marine Corps UAS operator personnel, operators  mentioned that mishap investigations performed to existing standards  sideline operators from training pending the investigation\u2019s outcome.  Such standards also apply to the Navy\u2019s larger, non-expendable UAS like  the MQ-8 Fire Scout and the MQ-4 Triton.", "According to DOD Directive 1100.4, existing policies, procedures, and  structures should be periodically evaluated to ensure efficient and  effective use of personnel resources.

Such goals could  include the Department of the Navy\u2019s goal to accelerate the development  and fielding of unmanned systems, and the Marine Corps\u2019 emphasis on  reducing operator workload and providing effective and efficient support  to mission execution and decision making. For example, the Marine  Corps\u2019 UAS concept of operations envisions a future in which one UAS  operator will perform multiple functions as opposed to the current  approach in which multiple Marines are necessary for a single mission.", "We found that the Navy has taken a preliminary step to further evaluate  what policy changes may be needed to support unmanned systems by  establishing an advisor position for this purpose within the Naval  Innovation Advisory Council.

We requested retention data\u2014actual  numbers of personnel who reenlisted versus annual quotas\u2014on enlisted  UAS operators for fiscal years 2010 (the earliest year for which data were  available) through 2017.", "We assessed the reliability of these Marine Corps data by administering  questionnaires and interviewing relevant personnel responsible for  maintaining and overseeing the systems that supplied the data and  manually checking the data for errors or omissions. Through these  methods, we obtained information on the systems\u2019 ability to record, track,  and report on these data, as well as on the quality control measures in  place. We found the inventory and requirements data to be sufficiently  reliable for the purposes of describing personnel inventory trends and the  sufficiency of operator personnel to meet requirements. We found that the  retention data are of undetermined reliability but are reporting them  because they are the data of record used by Marine Corps planning  officials. We also reviewed Navy and Marine Corps financial incentives for  retaining sufficient personnel to serve as UAS operators and compared  those approaches with criteria from DOD\u2019s 2012 Eleventh Quadrennial  Review of Military Compensation, which established that organizations  should assess civilian supply and demand and civilian wages to  determine the most cost effective special and incentive pay strategies.", "Further, we compared the Marine Corps\u2019 efforts to address workforce  challenges specific to the Marine Corps\u2019 UAS operator career field with a  key principle of strategic human capital planning from our prior work,  which states that agencies should ensure that flexibilities are part of their  overall human capital strategy. In our prior work, we found that strategic  human capital planning is an important component of an agency\u2019s effort  to develop long-term strategies for acquiring, developing, and retaining  staff needed for an agency to achieve its goals and of an agency\u2019s effort  to align human capital activities with the agency\u2019s current and emerging  mission. Specifically, we have found that an agency\u2019s efforts to conduct  strategic human capital planning should include, among other things,  building the capability needed to address administrative, educational, and  other requirements important to supporting workforce strategies by  ensuring that flexibilities are part of the overall human capital strategy.  We focused on workforce challenges in the Marine Corps, in particular,  because it has a long-established career field for UAS operators, and the  Navy does not yet have a separate career field for any of its unmanned  systems operators.", "We identified workforce challenges within the Marine Corps\u2019 UAS  operator career field by reviewing a 2015 Marine Corps-sponsored survey  of its pilot and UAS officer workforce. The survey included questions  about satisfaction with career and benefits, and intentions to stay in the  Marine Corps and the underlying reasons for these. Although officers in  ranks of first lieutenant through lieutenant colonel were surveyed, we  were unable to include majors and lieutenant colonels in reporting results  for UAS officers because the Marine Corps aggregated those officers\u2019  responses with those of majors and lieutenant colonels who operate other  types of aircraft. By reviewing the survey methodology and interviewing  an official involved in administering the survey and analyzing the results,  we determined that the survey results were sufficiently reliable for  reporting the perceptions about career satisfaction at a single point in  time for UAS operators who answered those questions.", "In addition, we visited one of three active duty Marine Corps UAS  squadrons, which we chose because it had the most deployment  experience with the RQ-21 Blackjack UAS. We met with squadron  leaders to discuss their views about UAS personnel requirements and  staffing approaches. We also conducted eight small group discussions  with active duty UAS operators and officers\u2014separately for enlisted  personnel and officers\u2014to gain their perspectives on topics such as  morale, workload, and career satisfaction. The opinions of Marine Corps  UAS operators we obtained during our discussion groups are not  generalizable to the population of UAS operators in the Marine Corps."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Office of the Secretary of Defense", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Joint Staff", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Marine Corps", "paragraphs": ["Office of the Deputy Commandant for Aviation", "Office of the Deputy Commandant for Combat Development and", "Office of the Deputy Commandant for Manpower and Reserve Affairs", "Marine Corps Systems Command", "Marine Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Squadron 2  We conducted this performance audit from September 2016 to February  2018 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.
