CMS officials explained that the task of developing a first-of-its-kind federal marketplace was a complex effort with compressed time frames. To be expedient, CMS issued task orders to develop the federally facilitated marketplace (FFM) and federal data services hub (data hub) systems when key technical requirements were unknown, including the number and composition of states to be supported and, importantly, the number of potential enrollees. CMS used cost-reimbursement contracts, which created additional risk because CMS is required to pay the contractor's allowable costs regardless of whether the system is completed. CMS program staff also adopted an incremental information technology development approach that was new to CMS. Further, CMS did not develop a required acquisition strategy to identify risks and document mitigation strategies and did not use available information, such as quality assurance plans, to monitor performance and inform oversight.", "CMS incurred significant cost increases, schedule slips, and delayed system functionality for the FFM and data hub systems due primarily to changing requirements that were exacerbated by oversight gaps. From September 2011 to February 2014, FFM obligations increased from $56 million to more than $209 million. Similarly, data hub obligations increased from $30 million to nearly $85 million. Because of unclear guidance and inconsistent oversight, there was confusion about who had the authority to approve contractor requests to expend funds for additional work. New requirements and changing CMS decisions also led to delays and wasted contractor efforts. Moreover, CMS delayed key governance reviews, moving an assessment of FFM readiness from March to September 2013\u2014just weeks before the launch\u2014and did not receive required approvals. As a result, CMS launched Healthcare.gov without verification that it met performance requirements.", "Late in the development process, CMS identified major performance issues with the FFM contractor but took only limited steps to hold the contractor accountable. In April and November 2013, CMS provided written concerns to the contractor about product quality and responsiveness to CMS direction. In September 2013, CMS program officials became so concerned about the contractor's performance that they moved operations to the FFM contractor's offices to provide on-site direction. At the time, CMS chose to forego actions, such as withholding the payment of fee, in order to focus on meeting the website launch date. Ultimately, CMS declined to pay about $267,000 in requested fee. This represents about 2 percent of the $12.5 million in fees paid to the FFM contractor. CMS awarded a new contract to another firm for $91 million in January 2014 to continue FFM development. As of June 2014, costs on the contract had increased to over $175 million due to changes such as new requirements and other enhancements, while key FFM capabilities remained unavailable. CMS needs a mitigation plan to address these issues. Unless CMS improves contract management and adheres to a structured governance process, significant risks remain that upcoming open enrollment periods could encounter challenges."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that CMS take immediate actions to assess increasing contract costs and ensure that acquisition strategies are completed and oversight tools are used as required, among other actions.

Some of these new requirements resulted from  regulations and policies that were established during this period. For  example, in March 2012, federal rulemaking was finalized for key  marketplace functions, resulting in the need to add services to support the  certification of qualified health plans for partnership marketplace states.

The result was that problems were not  discovered until late, and only after costs had grown significantly.", "As FFM contractor performance issues were discovered late in  development, CMS increasingly faced a choice of whether to stop  progress and pursue holding the contractor accountable for poor  performance or devote all its efforts to making the October deadline. CMS  chose to proceed with pursuing the deadline. After October 1, 2013, CMS  decided to replace the contractor, but in doing so had to expend  additional funds to complete essential FFM functions. Ultimately, more  money was spent to get less capability.", "Meanwhile, CMS faces continued challenges to define requirements and  control costs to complete development of the financial management  module in the FFM. Unless CMS takes action to improve acquisition  oversight, adhere to a structured governance process, and enhance other  aspects of contract management, significant risks remain that upcoming  open enrollment periods could encounter challenges going forward."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["In order to improve the management of ongoing efforts to develop the  federal marketplace, we recommend that the Secretary for Health and  Human Services direct the Administrator of the Centers for Medicare &  Medicaid Services to take the following five actions:", "Take immediate steps to assess the causes of continued FFM cost  growth and delayed system functionality and develop a mitigation plan  designed to ensure timely and successful system performance.", "Ensure that quality assurance surveillance plans and other oversight  documents are collected and used to monitor contractor performance.", "Formalize existing guidance on the roles and responsibilities of  contracting officer representatives and other personnel assigned  contract oversight duties, such as government task leaders, and  specifically indicate the limits of those responsibilities in terms of  providing direction to contractors.", "Provide direction to program and contracting staff about the  requirement to create acquisition strategies and develop a process to  ensure that acquisition strategies are completed when required and  address factors such as requirements, contract type, and acquisition  risks.", "Ensure that information technology projects adhere to requirements  for governance board approvals before proceeding with development."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments, Third-Party Views, and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this product to the Department of Health and  Human Services and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services for  review and comment.", "In its written comments, which are reprinted in appendix III, HHS  concurred with four of our five recommendations and described the  actions CMS is taking to improve its contracting and oversight practices.  HHS partially concurred with our recommendation that CMS assess the  causes of continued FFM cost growth. The agency says that CMS  already has assessed the reasons for cost growth under the CGI Federal  task order and that any increase in costs since the contract with  Accenture Federal Services for continued development of the FFM was  finalized is attributable to additional requirements, not cost overruns. We  recognize that much of the increase in costs under the Accenture Federal  Services contract is due to new requirements or enhancements.  Nevertheless, based on our review of the contract modifications, not all  the increase in costs from $91 million to more than $175 million, when  measured from the initial projection, is attributable to new requirements.  For example, as CMS stated in its comments, after additional analysis  CMS determined a $30 million cost increase was needed to complete the  contract\u2019s original scope of work.

Specifically, we reviewed data in the Federal Procurement Data System- Next Generation, which is the government\u2019s procurement database, to  identify CMS contracts and task orders related to the IT systems  supporting the Healthcare.gov website and amounts obligated for fiscal  years 2010 through March 2014. In addition, we reviewed CMS provided  data on the 62 contracts and task orders related to the IT systems  supporting the Healthcare.gov website and amounts obligated as of  March 2014. To select contracts and task orders to include in our review,  we analyzed Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation and  CMS data to identify contracts and task orders that represent large  portions of spending for Healthcare.gov and its supporting systems. We  then selected one contract and two task orders issued under an existing  2007 contract and interviewed contracting officials in CMS\u2019s Office of  Acquisition and Grants Management and program officials in CMS\u2019s  Office of Information Services to confirm that these contracts are central  to development of Healthcare.gov and its supporting systems. The  contract and task orders combined accounted for more than 40 percent of  the total CMS reported obligations related to the development of  Healthcare.gov and its supporting systems as of March 2014. Specifically,  we selected the task orders issued to CGI Federal Inc. (CGI Federal) for  the development of the federally facilitated marketplace (FFM) system  and to QSSI, Inc.

These eight agencies include the Centers for Medicare &  Medicaid Services (CMS), Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Social  Security Administration, Veterans Administration (VA), Peace Corps,  Office of Personnel Management, Department of Defense (DOD), and  Department of Homeland Security. We then obtained and analyzed  various types of agency-provided data to identify overall IT-related costs  for Healthcare.gov and its supporting systems. Three agencies, including  CMS, IRS, and VA reported almost all of the IT-related obligations  supporting the implementation of Healthcare.gov and its supporting  systems as of March 2014. We performed data reliability checks on  contract obligation data provided by these three agencies, such as  checking the data for obvious errors and comparing the total amount of  funding obligated for each contract and task order as reported by each  agency to data on contract obligations in Federal Procurement Data  System-Next Generation or USASpending.gov.were sufficiently reliable for the purpose of this report.", "We found that these data  To assess CMS acquisition planning activities, we reviewed Federal  Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and relevant Department of Health and  Human Services (HHS)/CMS policies and guidance.

In assessing CMS\u2019s acquisition planning  efforts, we looked for instances where CMS took steps to mitigate  acquisition program risks during the acquisition planning phase, including  choice of contract type and source selection methodology. In addition, we  interviewed CMS contracting and program officials to gain a better  understanding of the acquisition planning process for select contracts and  task orders including the rationale for choosing the selected contract type  and the analysis conducted to support the source selection process. We  also reviewed prior GAO reports on CMS contract management to assess  the extent to which CMS\u2019s acquisition planning activities addressed  issues previously identified by GAO.", "To assess CMS oversight of cost, schedule, and system capability  changes, we analyzed contract file documents for one selected contracts  and two task orders. As part of our assessment of the selected contracts  and task orders, we reviewed contract modifications, contractor monthly  status and financial reports, statements of work, contractor deliverables,  schedule documentation, and contracting officer\u2019s representative files,  and meeting minutes to determine if there were any changes and whether  system development proceeded as scheduled. We performed a data  reliability check of cost data for selected contracts and task orders by  comparing contract modification documentation to contract obligation data  in Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation. To evaluate the  extent to which CMS adhered to its governance process, we compared  the governance model the agency intended would guide the design,  development, and implementation of Healthcare.gov and its supporting  systems, to the development process the agency actually used for the  FFM and data hub. We also obtained and analyzed documentation from  governance reviews to identify the date and content of the reviews to  determine if key milestone reviews were held in accordance to the  development schedule. In addition, we reviewed FAR and federal  standards for internal control for contract oversight to evaluate the extent  to which CMS\u2019s approach to contract oversight for the selected contracts  and task orders met FAR and federal internal control standards. We  interviewed CMS contracting and program officials to gain a better  understanding of FFM and data hub cost, schedule, and system  capabilities, and to obtain information on the organization and staffing of  offices and personnel responsible for performance monitoring for selected  contracts and task orders. We also interviewed contractors to obtain their  perspective on CMS\u2019s oversight of cost, schedule, and system  capabilities.
