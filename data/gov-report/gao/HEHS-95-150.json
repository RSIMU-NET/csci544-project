The number of employment law cases filed in the federal courts has increased similarly. In resolving these complaints, employers have become more and more concerned about the costs\u2014in time, money, and good employee relationships. In response, some employers have adopted internal alternative dispute resolution (ADR) approaches, including arbitration, that is, submitting disputes to a neutral third person\u2014an arbitrator\u2014for resolution. Some require their employees to agree to mandatory, binding arbitration of discrimination complaints as a condition of their employment, forcing employees to waive the right to sue.", "To determine the extent to which employers in the private sector have implemented ADR approaches, you asked us to determine (1) the extent to which private-sector employers use ADR approaches, especially arbitration, to resolve discrimination complaints of employees not covered by collective bargaining agreements and (2) the fairness of employers\u2019 arbitration policies.", "To determine the extent of the use of ADR approaches, we sent a questionnaire to a stratified, random sample of 2,000 businesses that had (1) filed equal employment opportunity (EEO) reports with the EEOC in 1992 and (2) reported having more than 100 employees. ADR approaches include negotiation, fact finding, peer review, internal mediation, external mediation, and arbitration. The following are the definitions of these approaches we used in the questionnaire:", "Negotiation is a discussion of a complaint by the employee and employer and, if appropriate, their counsels, with the goal of setting the terms of a resolution. Negotiation does not require involvement of a neutral party and could include an open door policy, that is, a policy that guarantees an employee the opportunity to discuss his or her complaint with a senior manager without fear of reprisal.", "Fact finding involves a neutral person\u2014someone either within the company or external to the company\u2014investigating a complaint and developing findings that may form the basis for resolution. This would not include formal investigations of charges by government agencies, such as the EEOC.", "Peer review involves a panel of employees or employees and managers working together to resolve employment complaints. Internal mediation is a process for resolving disputes in which a neutral person\u2014trained in mediation methods\u2014from within the company helps the disputing parties negotiate a mutually acceptable agreement. This process does not lead to an imposed solution.", "External mediation is a process for resolving disputes in which a neutral person\u2014trained in mediation methods\u2014from outside the company helps the employer and employee negotiate a mutually acceptable agreement. This process does not lead to an imposed solution.", "Arbitration involves a neutral person\u2014an arbitrator from outside the company\u2014deciding how the complaint is to be resolved. The arbitrator\u2019s decision is usually binding on both the employee and the employer.", "To obtain more detailed information on ADR approaches, we telephoned those employers who had reported using arbitration and asked each of them to send us a description of the arbitration policies used. As part of our assessment of the policies, we compared the policies\u2019 provisions with the key quality standards proposed by the Commission on the Future of Worker-Management Relations as standards for a private arbitration system that ensures employees a fair and full airing of their complaints. Further details of our scope and methodology, including sampling errors, are discussed in appendix I. Unless specifically noted, sampling errors do not exceed plus or minus 5 percent.

Under title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, EEOC investigates\u2014and may litigate, on its own behalf or on behalf of the charging party\u2014charges of employment discrimination because of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. EEOC has similar responsibility under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, which prohibits employment discrimination against workers aged 40 and older; under the Equal Pay Act of 1963, which prohibits payment of different wages to men and women doing the same work; and under the Americans With Disabilities Act, which prohibits employment discrimination against workers with physical or mental disabilities.", "In April 1995, EEOC announced changes in the way it processes private-sector employment discrimination charges. As soon as guidance and implementation instructions are issued, EEOC will begin categorizing charges according to three priorities. The first category is for charges that appear more likely than not to involve discrimination, and these charges will be fully investigated. The second category includes charges that appear to have some merit but will require additional evidence to determine whether a violation occurred. The third category includes charges that can be immediately dismissed without investigation. EEOC also announced that it will initiate in October 1995 a voluntary ADR program using mediation to handle some of its workplace discrimination charges. Under this planned program, some employees filing charges and their employers will work with a neutral mediator to settle discrimination disputes, rather than go through EEOC\u2019s traditional investigative procedures. If the employer and employee fail to reach a resolution, the charge will be returned to EEOC\u2019s regular caseload.", "If EEOC investigates the charge, it notifies the employer of the charge and requests information from the employer and any witnesses with direct knowledge of the incident that led to the discrimination charge. If the evidence obtained by the EEOC investigator does not show reasonable cause to believe discrimination occurred\u2014for example, the employee was terminated for poor performance and not due to discrimination\u2014EEOC dismisses the case after issuing a \u201cno cause\u201d finding and a right-to-sue letter. When the evidence shows that reasonable cause exists to believe discrimination occurred, EEOC tries conciliation. If conciliation attempts fail, EEOC may go to court on behalf of the employee, although it rarely chooses to do so. EEOC officials have said that the Commission lacks sufficient legal staff to significantly increase the number of cases it can litigate effectively. When EEOC decides not to go to court, it issues the employee a right-to-sue letter, which allows the employee to sue.", "While charges filed with EEOC may lead to legal relief for employees with valid claims, each charge results in costs to the employer, even though most are found to be in compliance with the law. Although the employee does not pay for the EEOC investigation, he or she may incur psychological costs while pursuing the claim, the average time of which was 328 days in fiscal year 1994. The federal government also incurs costs for each charge investigated.", "ADR approaches are being considered by employers because \u201calmost any system is quicker, cheaper, and less harrowing than going to court,\u201d according to an official of the Equal Employment Advisory Council, an employers\u2019 group. Their concerns have recently increased as a result of (1) multimillion dollar jury awards to employees and (2) the provision in the Civil Rights Act of 1991 that permits punitive damages in cases of intentional discrimination under title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Americans With Disabilities Act. In addition, a 1991 U.S. Supreme Court decision upholding mandatory arbitration for statutory claims concerning employment disputes in the securities industry has led to consideration of arbitration in particular.
