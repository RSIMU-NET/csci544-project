In light of these concerns, GAO sought to determine (1) what major occupational categories H- 1B beneficiaries were approved to fill and what is known about H-1B petition approvals and U.S. citizen employment from 2000-2002; (2) what factors affect employers' decisions about the employment of H-1B workers and U.S. workers; and (3) what is known about H-1B workers' entries, departures, and changes in visa status."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["H-1B beneficiaries were approved to fill a variety of positions in 2002, and the number of approved petitions (i.e., employer requests to hire H-1B beneficiaries) in certain occupations has generally declined along with the economic downturn, as have U.S. citizen employment levels in these occupations. In contrast with 2000, most H-1B beneficiaries in 2002 were approved to fill positions in fields not directly related to information technology, such as economics, accounting, and biology. Both the number of H-1B petition approvals and U.S. citizens employed in certain occupations, such as systems analysts and electrical engineers, decreased from 2001 to 2002. GAO contacted 145 H-1B employers, and the majority of the 36 employers that agreed to speak with GAO said that they recruited, hired, and retained workers based on the skills needed, rather than the applicant's citizenship or visa status. Despite increases in unemployment, most employers said that finding workers with the skills needed in certain science-related occupations remains difficult. Although some employers acknowledged that H-1B workers might work for lower wages than their U.S. counterparts, the extent to which wage is a factor in employment decisions is unknown. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has incomplete information on H-1B worker entries, departures, and changes in visa status. As a result, DHS is not able to provide key information needed to oversee the H-1B program and its effects on the U.S. workforce, including data on the number of H-1B workers in the United States at any time. GAO also found that DHS's ability to provide information on H-1B workers is limited because it has not issued consistent guidance or any regulations on the legal status of unemployed H- 1B workers seeking new jobs. Allowing unemployed H-1B workers to remain in the United States may have implications for the labor force competition faced by U.S. workers. While DHS has long-term plans for providing better information on H-1B workers, policymakers in the interim need data to inform discussions on program changes."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The continuing use of H-1B visas, which allow employers to fill specialty  occupations with foreign workers, has been a contentious issue between  U.S. workers and employers during the recent economic downturn.

In particular, employment substantially  decreased within information technology (IT) occupations, for which  employers often requested H-1B workers. Critics of the H-1B program  argue that enough U.S. workers are available to fill these highly skilled  positions and that the use of foreign labor results in U.S. worker  displacement. Proponents of the program argue that it has contributed to  our nation\u2019s productivity in the booming economy of the 1990s and that  the need for highly skilled foreign workers continues to exist for certain  highly specialized occupations.", "The H-1B program was established in 1990 to assist U.S. employers in  temporarily (for up to 6 years) filling specialty occupations with highly  skilled workers.

In  addition, we analyzed 2000-2002 Current Population Survey (CPS) data on  U.S. citizen employment in similar occupations.

Seventy-five percent of the 145 employers we contacted chose not to  discuss H-1B issues with us; consequently, our results may be affected by  this self-selection. Most employers that agreed to speak with us used the  H-1B program to fill engineering positions. We also interviewed  associations representing U.S. and H-1B workers and associations  representing employers. To report information available on H-1B workers\u2019  entries, departures, and changes in visa status, we examined DHS data and  reports on planned tracking systems, and we interviewed DHS officials  about their data systems and tracking procedures.

Employed H-1B workers may stay in the United States on an H-1B  visa for up to 6 years.", "Until 1990, there was no limit on the number of specialty occupation visas  that could be granted to foreign nationals. Through the Immigration Act of  1990, Congress set a yearly cap of 65,000 on H-1B visas. In an effort to help  employers access skilled foreign workers and compete internationally, the  Congress passed the American Competitiveness and Workforce  Improvement Act of 1998, which increased the limit to 115,000 for fiscal  years 1999 and 2000. In 2000, Congress passed the American  Competitiveness in the Twenty-First Century Act, which raised the limit to  195,000 for fiscal year 2001 and maintained that level through fiscal years  2002 and 2003. The limit is scheduled to revert back to 65,000 in fiscal year  2004.", "In order to hire H-1B employees, employers must first file a Labor  Condition Application (LCA) with Labor, attesting to the fact that the  employer intends to comply with a number of required labor conditions  designed to protect workers. On this application, an employer must state  the number of workers requested, the occupation and location(s) in which  they will work, and the wages they will receive. The employers must  attest, among other things, that: the employment of H-1B workers will not adversely affect the working  conditions of other workers similarly employed in the area; the H-1B workers will be paid wages that are no less than the higher of the  actual wage level paid by the employer to all others with similar  experience and qualifications for the specific employment or the  prevailing wage level for the occupational classification in the area of  intended employment; and no strike, lockout, or work stoppage in the applicable occupational  classification was underway at the time the application was prepared.", "H-1B dependent employers (generally those with a workforce consisting of  at least 15 percent H-1B workers) and willful violators (employers who  have been found in violation of the conditions of an earlier LCA) are  subject to additional requirements. These employers must also attest that: before filing an LCA, the employer will make a good faith effort to recruit  U.S. workers for the position, offering wages at least as great as that  required to be offered to the foreign national; the employer will not displace and did not displace any similarly employed  U.S. workers within 90 days prior to or after the date of filing any H-1B  visa petition; and before placing the H-1B employee with another employer, the current  employer will inquire whether or not the other employer has displaced or  intends to displace a similarly employed U.S. worker within 90 days before  or after the new placement of the H-1B worker.", "After Labor approves the LCA, an employer who wishes to hire an H-1B  worker can file two types of petitions with BCIS to obtain approval.\u201cInitial\u201d petitions are those that are filed for a foreign national\u2019s first-time  employment in the United States and allow for the H-1B worker to stay in  the United States for 3 years. With some exceptions, these petitions are  counted against the annual cap on the number of H-1B petitions that may  be approved. \u201cContinuing\u201d employment petitions are filed for: extensions  of the initial petitions for another 3 years, the maximum period  permissible under the law; sequential employment, which occurs, for  example, when an H-1B worker changes employers within their 6-year  time period; and concurrent employment, in which the H-1B worker  intends to work simultaneously for a second or subsequent employer.  Continuing petitions do not count against the cap.", "In both fiscal years 2001 and 2002, the number of initial H-1B petitions  approved that applied to the cap did not reach the annual limit of 195,000  (see fig. 1). In fiscal year 2001, 163,600 petitions were approved against the  cap. The number of approved petitions decreased by more than 50 percent  in one year, with 79,100 petitions approved against the cap in fiscal year  2002. This recent change contrasts with the trends from fiscal years 1997  through 2000, during which time the cap was lower and the number of  petitions reached or exceeded the annual limit.", "DHS is responsible for managing the entry and departure of  nonimmigrants, including H-1B workers. To enhance DHS\u2019s ability in this  regard, legislation was enacted that required the agency to develop an  automated entry/exit control system. Section 110 of the Illegal Immigration  Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) of 1996 required that  this system collect departure records from every foreign national leaving  the United States and match it with arrival records. The act also required  that the system have the capability to assist DHS officials in identifying  nonimmigrants who have been in the United States beyond their  authorized period of stay. The Immigration and Naturalization Service  Data Management Improvement Act of 2000 (DMIA) replaced section 110  of IIRIRA in its entirety. The DMIA, among other things, required that the  entry/exit system integrate arrival and departure information on foreign  nationals required under IIRIRA and contained in the Department of  Justice (now DHS) and Department of State databases. DMIA also  required that this system be fully implemented by December 31, 2005.

DHS has the authority to issue  regulations that further specify how visa portability will be administered.", "In March 2001, when the economy began to decline, U.S. employment  declined as well, with 1.4 million jobs lost during the year. The  unemployment rate rose to 5.8 percent at the end of 2001 and hovered  between 5.5 and 6 percent throughout 2002. Although downturns tend to  affect sectors throughout the economy, existing research indicates that job  loss from 2001-2002 was particularly severe in IT manufacturing, a sub- sector in which many H-1B workers were employed.", "Concerns that the H-1B program might have unfairly impacted U.S.  workers during the recent economic downturn have prompted labor  groups to raise questions about the use of the H-1B program. Associations  representing U.S. workers that we spoke with believe that employers  abuse the program by laying off U.S. workers while retaining and hiring  H-1B workers at lower wages. Such practices, according to employee  associations, had the effect of displacing U.S. workers during the  economic downturn. Labor representatives argue that some employers  force H-1B workers to work for lower wages than U.S. citizen workers,  knowing that continued employment is the only legal way for H-1B  workers to remain in the United States. One advocate for H-1B workers  said that some employers dangle the possibility of sponsorship for  permanent residency in front of H-1B workers as a reward for extra work.  These representatives believe that visa portability options do not actually  give H-1B workers more freedom to move around in the labor market,  arguing that H-1B workers are still dependent on their employers to legally  remain in the United States. On the other hand, associations representing  employers argue that H-1B workers were not treated differently than U.S.  workers during the economic downturn, and that use of the H-1B program  by employers has decreased substantially. They also argue that the real  challenge to U.S. workers occurs when companies rely on workers  overseas where the work can be done at a lower cost."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "H-1B Beneficiaries Were Approved to Fill a Broad Range of Occupations, and as U.S. Citizen Employment Generally Declined with the Recent Economic Downturn, So Did the Number of H-1B Petition Approvals", "paragraphs": ["H-1B beneficiaries were approved to fill a wide variety of occupations, and  the number of H-1B petition approvals in certain occupations has  generally declined with the economic downturn, along with the  employment levels of U.S. citizen workers in these occupations.

In the case of  H-1B dependent employers, the law prohibits companies from hiring H-1B  workers when it has the effect of displacing similarly employed U.S.  workers in the workforce. Although Labor has found no instances of such  illegal displacement by H-1B dependent employers, a few cases are  currently under investigation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Most Employers Cited Cost and Lengthy Petition Processing Time as Major Disadvantages of the H-1B Program, but Said They Will Continue to Use the Program to Find the Skills Needed", "paragraphs": ["Nearly all employers interviewed said that the length of time required to  process petitions is a major disadvantage of the H-1B program. About half  of these employers said that hiring an H-1B worker could take from  2 to 6 months, but that they often pay an additional $1,000 fee for premium  processing, which substantially reduces processing time. In addition, most  employers interviewed said that the combination of processing fees and  legal fees made the program very costly, with costs cited ranging from  $2,500 to $8,000 to hire an H-1B worker.", "Citing their need to fill permanent positions, some employers noted that  the main disadvantage of the H-1B program is its temporary provision of  labor. These employers said they experience a substantial loss of  intellectual capital when an H-1B visa has expired and a foreign national is  forced to leave the United States. Nearly all employers interviewed said  that in order to retain these foreign workers, they often sponsored H-1B  workers for permanent residency either as part of their initial employment  offer or after a certain period of employment. Some of these employers  said that the fees associated with applications for permanent residency  can raise the cost of hiring an H-1B worker substantially, with a few citing  costs as high as $10,000 to $15,000. A few companies said that if their H-1B  workers were unable to obtain permanent residency, they would send  them to one of their foreign offices for a year and then bring them back to  the United States on new H-1B visas.", "Despite the disadvantages of the H-1B program cited, 31 of the 36  employers interviewed said they would continue to use the program in the  future to meet skill needs. These employers believe that once the economy  recovers it will be difficult to find enough qualified U.S. workers, and that  the H-1B program gives them the opportunity to access a larger pool of  workers. Of the 24 employers that commented on the H-1B cap, 16 said  they were concerned that a limit of 65,000 would create processing  backlogs at BCIS when the economy improves, and feared that they would  have to wait several months longer to hire H-1B workers, as was the case  when the cap was reached in 2000.", "While employers said that they would continue to use the H-1B program, a  few employers mentioned that they are seeking additional visa options for  bringing highly skilled workers to the United States. For example, in  recent years, employers have increasingly turned to the L-1 visa, an  intracompany transfer visa that can be used by companies to bring their  foreign professional workers to the United States on a temporary basis  (see fig. 7). L-1 visas do not have an annual cap and are not subject to  prevailing wage laws. Department of State statistics show that the use of  L-1 visas has increased substantially since fiscal year 1998. The number of  L-1 visas issued in fiscal year 1998 was 38,307 and rose to 41,739 in fiscal  year 1999, peaked in fiscal year 2001 at 59,384, and decreased slightly in  fiscal year 2002 to 57,721. Eight companies noted that the process to  obtain an L-1 visa was less cumbersome than the H-1B visa process, and a  few said that they planned to increase use of the L-1 visa in the future.", "In addition to using other visas, some employers said that they are now  considering outsourcing work or moving their own operations offshore to  remain competitive. A few employers said that if they cannot find enough  highly skilled workers within the United States, they would start operating  overseas. One offshore IT services company said its competitive advantage  comes from offering U.S. clients IT services in India, which can  significantly reduce costs.

As shown in table 3, the number of investigations in which  violations were found doubled from fiscal year 2000 to 2002, and the  amount of back wages owed to H-1B workers by employers increased  from $1.6 million in fiscal year 2000 to $4.2 million in fiscal year 2002.  These violations were largely due to employers bringing H-1B workers into  the United States to work, but not paying them any wages until jobs are  available, according to WHD officials. This dramatic increase in  violations and back wages owed to H-1B workers may be due to the  increase in the number of H-1B workers who have entered the country  over the years and does not necessarily indicate an increase in the  percentage of H-1B workers affected by wage violations.", "The extent to which violations of the H-1B program take place is unknown  and may be due in part to WHD\u2019s limited investigative authority. WHD can  initiate H-1B-related investigations only under limited circumstances.  WHD may investigate (1) when a complaint is filed by an aggrieved person  or organization, such as an H-1B worker, a U.S. worker, or the employee  bargaining representative; (2) on a random basis, employers, who, within  the previous 5 years, have been found to have committed a willful failure  to meet LCA work conditions; and (3) if it receives specific credible  information from a reliable source (other than the complainant) that the  employer has failed to meet certain specified work conditions. According  to WHD officials, H-1B workers may be reluctant to complain, given their  dependency upon their employers for continued residency in the United  States. In 2000, we suggested that the Congress consider broadening  Labor\u2019s enforcement authority to improve its ability to conduct  investigations under the H-1B program.

The Non-Immigrant Information System (NIIS) has data  on entries and departures of H-1B workers and the Computer Linked  Application Information Management System 3 (CLAIMS 3) has data on  changes in visa status, but data from both of these systems are needed to  calculate the number of H-1B workers in the United States.

This includes  information on the number of H-1B workers in the United States at any  time, the extent to which these workers become unemployed, the extent  to which H-1B workers become long-term members of the labor force  through other immigration statuses, and the occupations they fill as  permanent members of the labor force.", "We found that obtaining better arrival and departure information on H-1B  workers requires integration of change of status data from CLAIMS 3 with  data from NIIS, and that such integration has proven to be challenging.  Currently, if a foreign national enters the United States under a student  visa and later becomes an H-1B worker, NIIS will not have a record that  indicates this person is an H-1B worker, unless the person exits and re- enters the United States under the H-1B visa. In 2001, DHS officials  attempted to obtain better information on the number of nonimmigrants in  the United States and their current statuses by matching CLAIMS 3 and  NIIS data using automated formulas, but found that about 60 percent of  the records between these two systems still needed to be matched  manually. This was mainly because the two systems do not have unique  identifiers for matching records. While DHS is examining ways to improve  its ability to match these records through formulas or by creating unique  identifiers, arrival and departure data continue to be separated from  change of status data.", "Although data integration could improve information on H-1B workers,  DHS may continue to face challenges accounting for all departures  because these data are not consistently collected. While NIIS is supposed  to maintain departure records for H-1B workers, along with other  nonimmigrants, data from fiscal years 1998 through 2000 indicate that  departure information for foreign nationals is missing in about 20 percent  of the cases. DHS cannot account for all H-1B worker departures because  some nonimmigrants, especially those departing through land borders, do  not submit departure forms when leaving the United States. The United  States has an agreement with Canada that allows Canadian immigration  officials to collect departure forms and submit them to DHS. However,  Canadian officials are not required to collect these forms and, therefore,  some nonimmigrant departures from the United States through Canada are  not recorded. DHS also does not have immigration officials at some  departure areas along the Mexican border, thereby relying on  nonimmigrants to voluntarily deposit departure forms in collection boxes.", "DHS officials also told us that airlines do not consistently collect and/or  return departure forms to DHS. In addition, some H-1B workers become  permanent residents and, therefore, are no longer required to submit  departure forms when exiting the country, leaving NIIS with no record of  their departures from the United States.", "Moreover, DHS does not consistently enter change of status and  occupation data into CLAIMS 3. As a result, it is not possible to determine  either the number of H-1B workers who remained a part of the U.S.  workforce by becoming permanent residents or other employment-related  visa holders and the types of jobs they performed. About 50 percent of  electronic records on permanent residents do not include data on  residents\u2019 prior visa status, according to a DHS official. Also, in fiscal years  2000 and 2001, about 20 to 25 percent of electronic records on permanent  residents who were known to have been H-1B workers did not contain  information on their occupations. In the data sets used to determine the  number of nonimmigrants, such as H-1B workers, who changed to other  employment-related visa statuses, the prior status data was missing in 30  percent of the cases. In addition, BCIS officials told us that occupation  data for H-1B workers who changed to other employment-related visa  statuses was often missing, but they were unable to tell us the extent to  which this occurred. Although no formal studies have been conducted to  determine why these data are missing, DHS officials believe that this is  primarily due to contractors not entering prior visa status and occupation  information into CLAIMS 3. One official said that some data contractors  may not enter this information because CLAIMS 3 will accept records if  the prior visa status and occupations fields are left blank. These data could  also be missing because individuals without a prior status or occupation  may leave these fields blank on their applications. These individuals, such  as spouses of permanent residents, may be coming directly from a foreign  country without having previously entered the United States under a  nonimmigrant visa.", "DHS also maintains information in CLAIMS 3 that could indicate whether  an H-1B worker is no longer employed and possibly no longer in H-1B  status, but the agency has faced challenges with collecting this  information. When H-1B workers become unemployed before their visas  expire, employers are required to submit a letter to DHS stating that these  workers are no longer employed with them. DHS uses this information to  revoke the H-1B petitions, and this is indicated in CLAIMS 3. However,  agency officials do not believe that all employers are submitting these  letters, because DHS officials believe they have not received an equal  number of subsequent employment petitions as notices that the H-1B  worker is no longer with a former employer. Agency officials said that they  are not able to better ensure the collection of these letters because they do  not have the resources to proactively monitor employers.

We used fiscal year 2000 BCIS data to select employers because we  wanted to capture any changes in H-1B worker staff since the economic  downturn.", "Through interviews with these employers, we collected qualitative  information on the factors affecting employers\u2019 decisions in recruiting,  hiring, and laying off both H-1B workers and U.S. citizen employees.  Employer participation in this study was voluntary. We contacted 145  employers, and 25 percent, or 36, of these employers chose to participate;  consequently, our results may be biased by this self-selection. In order to  provide a broader perspective, we interviewed associations representing  highly skilled workers and associations representing employers to obtain  their views on how employers make decisions about their U.S. and H-1B  workers. We also interviewed Labor WHD officials about the agency\u2019s  enforcement authority and employer violations of the H-1B program  requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DHS Current and Planned Tracking Systems", "paragraphs": ["To obtain information available on H-1B workers\u2019 entries, departures, and  changes in visa status, we examined DHS data from current tracking  systems. However, we determined that these data had limitations that  precluded them from meeting our reliability standards. As a result, we did  not include them in our report. For example, we obtained data from DHS  on the total arrivals and departures of H-1B workers for fiscal year 2000  and the number of permanent residents who reported previously being H- 1B workers immediately before changing status in fiscal years 2000 and  2001. According to DHS officials, these were the most recent automated  data available. We also obtained data on the number of H-1B workers who  changed from H-1B to other employment-related visa statuses from  January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2002. In addition, we spoke with DHS  officials about the limitations of these data, data on the occupations of  employment-related visa holders, and current tracking systems.", "We also obtained and reviewed reports on DHS\u2019s planned tracking  systems. Among the documents we reviewed were the concept of  operations for US-VISIT (formerly known as the entry/exit system), a  report on system requirements for US-VISIT, the Data Management and  Improvement Act Task Force\u2019s first annual report, and a report on the case  management system that is planned to replace CLAIMS 3. We also  interviewed DHS officials who are developing the new systems to learn  more about the planned system capabilities."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Age Distribution and Salaries of H-1B Beneficiaries and U.S. Citizen Workers", "paragraphs": ["Tables 6 and 7 provide information on the age distribution and salaries of  H-1B beneficiaries and U.S. citizen workers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the above contacts, Danielle Giese and Emily Leventhal  made significant contributions to this report.
