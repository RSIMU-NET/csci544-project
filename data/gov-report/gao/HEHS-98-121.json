Such GME adjustments require care to ensure an appropriate balance between the numbers and types of physician specialists in training, and thus not militarily deployable, and the numbers of trained specialists available for deployment. As overall downsizing continues, the services are finding that required GME reductions may entail closing whole programs at selected facilities. In early 1997, moreover, the Navy Surgeon General attempted but was unsuccessful in closing selected GME programs.", "In response to the Navy\u2019s experience, the Congress included a requirement in the 1998 National Defense Authorization Act that we review a Navy advisory council\u2019s recommendations for restructuring Navy GME.Specifically, we were to review recommendations for GME closures at Bethesda Medical Center that the Navy Surgeon General rejected in favor of closing the Portsmouth, Virginia, Medical Center\u2019s GME programs. Also, the National Security Committee\u2019s Subcommittee on Military Personnel asked us to comparatively review the Army\u2019s and the Air Force\u2019s GME closure activities. In discussions with cognizant congressional offices, we agreed to focus our response to these requests on (1) why the Navy did not accept its council\u2019s recommendations for Bethesda GME closures and why its other closure attempts did not succeed, (2) whether the other services already have faced or may face similar experiences, and (3) what improvements may be needed if the services are to successfully make and implement their GME sizing decisions.

Most care is provided in about 600 military medical facilities worldwide, including medical centers, community hospitals, and clinics. The system employs about 100,000 active duty military personnel.", "Military medical personnel include about 12,275 physicians, of whom about 3,000 are in GME programs in military facilities. The services view GME as the primary pipeline for developing and maintaining the required mix of medical provider skills to meet wartime and peacetime care needs. They also view GME as important to successful physician recruitment and retention. GME includes internships, residencies, and fellowships enabling medical school graduates to become specialists in such areas as internal medicine, radiology, and general surgery. Some of the military personnel GME training is done in civilian hospitals. The cost of GME is unclear. In May 1997, the DOD Inspector General reported that GME costs exceed $125 million annually, with per-student costs ranging from about $20,000 to $100,000, but reported also that military facilities did not accurately account for such costs.", "DOD\u2019s Office of Health Affairs is responsible for developing overall GME policy guidance and promoting GME program coordination and integration among the services. The services are responsible for ensuring that GME goals are met and for individual GME programs. Civilian boards review DOD\u2019s GME programs to ensure that they meet such medical standards as minimum numbers of trainees per program and can thus be accredited. GME is taught at the services\u2019 facilities throughout the United States, as shown in figure 1.", "Several DOD policies directly affect the services\u2019 GME program size, locations, and specialty types. In 1996, for example, DOD issued a requirement that medical force levels including GME trainee numbers be linked to each service\u2019s wartime and operational support requirements.This was a major departure from when each service did as much GME training as it had capacity for or when it trained to the prior year\u2019s level. DOD also defined GME trainees as nondeployable unless a full mobilization state has been reached. Deploying trainees would disrupt the specialty physician pipeline and would likely result in lost GME program accreditation. Thus, as defined, about 25 percent of active duty physicians are not deployable. A 1994 DOD strategic plan set forth the following added GME rightsizing principles:", "Base realignment and closure (BRAC) 1995 would determine whether further sites conducting GME training will close.", "GME programs having no new trainees for 2 years are to be phased out.", "Duplicate Washington, D.C., and San Antonio, Texas, GME programs should be integrated to the extent possible.", "The number of GME trainees in DOD medical facilities should not exceed their aggregate fiscal year 1994 proportion of all active-duty physicians.", "In response to the 1994 plan, BRAC 1995 identified two hospitals for closure that had GME programs, thus eliminating 177 GME positions. But BRAC legislative authority has expired, and any such future authority is uncertain. Also, ending programs lacking new trainees has resulted in few position reductions, according to Health Affairs officials. And the Washington, D.C., and San Antonio GME program integrations have also produced few trainee reductions, while no other GME locations appear to be susceptible to such integration.", "Maintaining a maximum ratio of GME trainees to active duty physicians is referred to as DOD\u2019s \u201c25 percent policy.\u201d The aim is a proper mix of experienced specialists, supplemented by the flow of newly trained specialists needed to maintain that mix. The services\u2019 actual GME percentages vary slightly, but in total they equal about 25 percent of active duty physicians.", "In the past, the GME ratio was met through BRAC actions and by reducing GME without closing programs, but DOD and service officials now agree that GME programs have been cut to levels below which accreditation would be lost. Thus, rather than basing GME size on training capacity, the services are shifting toward basing their reductions of GME on wartime requirements.

Lacking specific guidance on how to select closure sites, the MEPC primarily focused on meeting the Navy sizing model\u2019s needed medical specialist estimates and complying with the Surgeon General\u2019s past statements about the importance of having GME where the active duty personnel are concentrated\u2014which today is in San Diego and Portsmouth. Records indicate that MEPC considered such other factors as civilian GME accreditation standards and the population, particularly active duty, to be served but did not comparatively analyze how well the areas\u2019 available patient mix would support GME\u2014believing that Bethesda and Portsmouth were more than sufficient on both scores. While the MEPC weighed the potentially adverse effects of closing Bethesda\u2019s GME programs on the GME integration efforts, it concluded that preserving GME at Portsmouth and San Diego, where active duty personnel are more concentrated, was still preferable.

Other such areas would be San Antonio, San Diego, and Madigan Army Medical Center near Tacoma, Washington.", "In further justifying his decision, the Surgeon General later announced that integrated national capital area GME programs would be maintained. The Surgeon General told us that while the MEPC had acted in the Navy\u2019s interests, broader DOD interests were also at stake. Moreover, about 5 months after announcing the Portsmouth GME closure decision, the Navy Surgeon General\u2019s office completed a study of health care demographics and workload covering the Bethesda, San Diego, and Portsmouth areas, where it has major health care concentrations. That study concluded that, on the basis of population, workload, and other factors, GME should be preserved at Bethesda and San Diego rather than Portsmouth.", "Along with his Portsmouth GME closure decision, the Surgeon General announced plans to close the Bremerton, Washington, naval hospital\u2019s GME family practice program. But the MEPC had specifically recommended against family practice program closures, concluding that such residencies were needed services.

The Surgeon General\u2019s office responded that it would monitor the effect on Portsmouth\u2019s workload and would add resources if needed. Portsmouth Medical Center officials also argued that their center was as rich a GME environment as any of the four locations apparently selected for GME concentration. Taking particular issue with Navy study findings supporting Bethesda, Portsmouth officials told us that they have comparable or better facilities, workload, patient mix, and other GME support advantages. MEPC officials told us that while both locations have more than enough to support GME, Bethesda has the greater workload for supporting GME. And while the Surgeon General agreed that Portsmouth is an attractive GME environment, he told us that Bethesda is preferable because of greater available population and patient mix and the overriding need to continue the national capital area GME program integration efforts.", "Regarding the Surgeon General\u2019s reliance on the apparent agreement for a four-area GME concentration, Health Affairs officials told us that such an agreement was not made formal or otherwise published. Rather, these officials said the policy aim now is for the services to size their GME programs by requirements-driven analyses rather than by dictating some fixed number of GME centers.

Initially offering reassurances about maintaining Bremerton\u2019s health care levels, the Surgeon General eventually deferred the decision\u2014which occurred at about the same time as he deferred the Portsmouth GME decision.

A few months after the Navy\u2019s closure attempts, the Army Surgeon General acted on an internal recommendation to close all remaining GME programs at the Army\u2019s William Beaumont Medical Center in El Paso. A representative from the Surgeon General\u2019s office told us that the apparent proposal to concentrate GME in four geographic locations was not a factor in choosing William Beaumont. The official told us that essentially the Army projected a need to eliminate about 50 GME trainee positions, and William Beaumont\u2019s remaining 64 positions met that requirement.", "Like the Navy\u2019s efforts, the Army\u2019s closure attempt was met with surprise and resistance by medical center, line command, and congressional representatives, who took issue with the decision\u2019s basis.

Medical center officials and their local supporters argued that the care level for active duty personnel and their dependents and other beneficiaries in El Paso\u2019s medically underserved community would be devastated and that most El Paso physicians trained in certain specialties are at William Beaumont. The officials also argued that when a military hospital loses its GME training, either the service relocates its best teaching specialists or civilian markets attract them away. An Army Surgeon General\u2019s office representative told us that while the plan was to redistribute William Beaumont teaching faculty to other locations, the center\u2019s full patient care capability was to be maintained.", "Like the Navy, moreover, the Army had not involved those most directly affected by their closure deliberations in the initial decision process. And after William Beaumont officials and a local congressional member appealed for the decision\u2019s reconsideration, the Army conducted further analysis of such factors as patient demographics, workload, and quality indicators among the Army\u2019s teaching centers and GME programs but then suspended GME reduction decisions for the coming training year."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Air Force Soon to Confront GME Program Closures", "paragraphs": ["The Air Force has not recently attempted major GME program closures.

One is an ongoing, long overdue study of the medical personnel required to meet wartime requirements, commonly referred to as the 733 Update, originally scheduled for completion by the end of March 1996. The other is the Defense Reform Initiative, announced in November 1997, that recommended reorganizing the DOD health care program. Related actions are expected to strengthen program oversight and thus will likely affect the way GME decisions are guided and made. Another influence on GME is the nationwide implementation of TRICARE, DOD\u2019s managed health care program. TRICARE requires military hospitals to be more cost effective, focus on primary care, and share the care workload with support contractors. Such health care management shifts under TRICARE may reduce funding and, according to DOD officials, reduce or otherwise change the workload support for military facilities\u2019 GME.", "Further, DOD and the services are engaged in joint efforts toward more integrated GME management, including collective oversight over DOD\u2019s GME strategic plan, joint evaluation of GME applicants, and planned efforts to consolidate GME administrative functions. Also, DOD is working toward standardizing the application of medical force sizing models. In 1996, we reported that while the services\u2019 respective modeling approaches to estimating medical strength requirements appeared to be reasonable, the models\u2019 results were largely affected by input data and judgmentally assigned values and assumptions. Because the services differ somewhat in their modeling applications, DOD is examining and seeking to reconcile the differences\u2014such as the relative effects of the Army\u2019s inclusion of a \u201cpeacetime mission\u201d component that the other services\u2019 models do not include.

Along with disputes about decision criteria, a key omission in the Navy\u2019s and Army\u2019s closure attempts was that of not involving medical and line commanders and others most directly affected by the decisions. Unsuccessful closure efforts dissatisfy those making and affected by the decisions and reduce the credibility of the process but they also may result in too many GME trainees, who are not readily deployable, and too few deployable physicians ready when needed.", "Thus, we believe that with commonly accepted GME sizing criteria, DOD and the services could make the program consolidations and closures needed to meet readiness goals.

While we noted differences of opinion about the application of the overall sizing models, resolving those differences was beyond the scope of our work; the differences are expected to be addressed in the update of the 733 study.", "We also researched efforts by private sector medical schools and hospitals to alter the size of their GME programs, including a recent study by the Association of American Medical Colleges, representing medical schools and teaching hospitals, including the Department of Veterans Affairs medical centers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Services\u2019 Use of Military Medical Force Sizing Models", "paragraphs": ["Each service has its own sizing model for adjusting military medical forces to meet its requirements.

In November 1996, the Surgeon General decided to apply THCSRR, which resulted in attempts to significantly reduce GME.", "The THCSRR model defines readiness requirements as supporting three missions, including (1) a wartime mission meeting the demands of two nearly simultaneous major regional conflicts, including mobilizing hospital ships, supporting Navy fleet and Marine Corps operations ashore and afloat and numerous fleet hospitals, and maintaining military treatment facilities outside the United States; (2) a day-to-day operational support mission for the Navy fleet and Marine Corps that allows Navy personnel to rotate between the United States and operational Navy platforms and overseas assignments and that includes GME; and (3) a peacetime health benefit mission providing health care benefits in military treatment facilities in the United States.", "While the Navy views all three missions as imperative to Navy medicine under the THCSRR model, the first two are to determine the number of needed active duty personnel. It is only because of the first two missions of wartime readiness and day-to-day operational support that active duty Navy personnel are to be available to support the third mission of providing peacetime health care benefits.", "Pressure to develop a model such as THCSRR came from a study by the Office of the Secretary of Defense of the overall military health services system and the system\u2019s wartime medical force requirements; commonly referred to as the 733 study, it was required by section 733 of the 1992 National Defense Authorization Act and was completed in 1994. The 733 study examined the total medical care requirements needed to support all three services during a post-cold war wartime scenario along with peacetime health care requirements. The study concluded that the three services\u2019 medical force requirements for the two major regional conflict scenarios would be significantly reduced from earlier global wartime scenarios. However, the Navy saw a need for further study on its own to adequately determine its medical force requirements for day-to-day operational support and to combine those requirements with the wartime requirements to define the minimum number of fully trained active duty personnel required to accomplish both missions. The determinations for operational support requirements include the needed flow of trained physicians from GME."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Sizing Models and Standardization", "paragraphs": ["The Army and Air Force have independently developed sizing models to project their readiness needs, including GME requirements, and Health Affairs has presented a DOD medical sizing model to all three services to promote the standardization of requirements determinations and has used that model to compare requirements projections by the three services. A comparison in March 1997 showed that the Army\u2019s model included consideration of GME requirements beyond readiness to include what the Army defined as \u201cpeacetime mission,\u201d thus projecting more needed training positions than did the DOD model. Health Affairs used the Navy\u2019s THCSRR model as the starting point for the DOD model, specifying the same three critical DOD health care missions of readiness, day-to-day operational support, and peacetime health care and providing that only the first two missions are to determine the required number of active duty personnel.
