In your request, you expressed concerns that these enterprises may be using their benefits in financial markets resulting from their government ties to make investments that may not serve the public purposes as expressed in their federal charters. Specifically, you requested that we examine (1) the enterprises\u2019 legal authority for making nonmortgage investments and federal regulatory oversight of that activity, (2) the relationship between nonmortgage investment policies and practices and missions of the enterprises, and (3) the extent to which the enterprises have undertaken nonmortgage investments for arbitrage profits\u2014using the funding advantage from government sponsorship to purchase nonmortgage investments that generate profits.

GSEs receive benefits from their federal charters that help them fulfill their missions. Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae (the housing enterprises) have federal charters granting each of them explicit benefits, which include (1) exemption from registering their securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), (2) exemption from state and local corporate income taxes, and (3) use of the Federal Reserve as a transfer agent. Farmer Mac is subject to SEC registration requirements, but it uses the Federal Reserve as a transfer agent, and Farmer Mac officials told us that it is exempt from state income taxes in most states. The most important benefit that all three enterprises receive is an implicit one stemming from investors\u2019 perception that the federal government would not allow the enterprises to default on their obligations. Due to this perception, investors do not demand yields on investments in enterprise debt and mortgage-backed securities that are as high as those on comparable financial instruments issued by corporations without government sponsorship. One result of government sponsorship, therefore, is a reduction in debt costs compared with debt costs in similar corporations without government sponsorship.", "Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae were chartered by Congress to enhance the availability of residential mortgage credit across the nation. The housing enterprises accomplish this mission by purchasing residential mortgages from lenders. The housing enterprises retain some of the mortgages they purchase in their own portfolios, but a majority of the mortgages are pooled into mortgage-backed securities (MBS) that are sold to investors in the secondary residential mortgage market. As of December 1996, Freddie Mac had about $463 billion in MBS obligations and $156 billion in debt obligations outstanding. The corresponding figures for Fannie Mae were about $548 billion and $331 billion, respectively. Therefore, combined MBS and debt obligations of these housing enterprises totaled about $1.5 trillion.", "Farmer Mac was chartered by Congress to enhance the availability of agricultural mortgage credit across the nation. Farmer Mac is making efforts to establish a secondary mortgage market for agricultural mortgages along the lines the housing enterprises have established for residential mortgages. Farmer Mac issues, and guarantees payment on, agricultural mortgage-backed securities (AMBS). One type of AMBS, called Farmer Mac I securities, is backed by agricultural mortgages not containing federally provided primary mortgage insurance. The other type of AMBS, called Farmer Mac II securities, is backed by agricultural mortgages containing primary mortgage insurance provided by the Department of Agriculture. Farmer Mac is a small financial institution in comparison to the housing enterprises. As of December 31, 1996, Farmer Mac had about $642 million in AMBS (of which about $226 million were owned by others, and about $416 million were held by Farmer Mac) and about $546 million in debt obligations outstanding. Therefore, combined AMBS owned by others and debt obligations of Farmer Mac totaled about $772 million.", "The housing enterprises pass along, at least in part, the benefits they receive from government sponsorship, such as lower debt costs, to residential borrowers. In a previous study, we estimated that interest rates on single-family, fixed-rate, conforming mortgages were probably 15 to 35 basis points lower than they would have been without government sponsorship of the enterprises. Limiting the activities of the housing enterprises primarily to funding conforming residential mortgages helps create a mechanism for the benefits they receive, such as lower debt costs, to be passed through to borrowers. Such limitations are consistent with the special purpose charters imposed by Congress. Congress gave the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) general regulatory authority over the housing enterprises so that HUD can ensure that the missions of these enterprises as stated in their respective charter acts are being fulfilled. HUD also has regulatory authority to approve new mortgage programs proposed by the housing enterprises. In consideration of the potential risks to taxpayers from an enterprise default on its financial obligations, Congress created safety and soundness regulators for the enterprises. HUD\u2019s Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO) is the safety and soundness regulator of the housing enterprises.

Consequently, in its legal analysis, HUD took the position that as long as the MPP program is permissible under the current laws, MPP should not be regarded as against the public interest solely on the basis of a potential adverse impact on federal revenues or the concomitant favorable impact on Fannie Mae\u2019s tax position. \u201cThe Treasury has long been concerned about the revenue loss from the favorable tax treatment of cash value life insurance with business policyholders or beneficiaries, and the MPP highlighted these concerns.

Appendix I contains a more detailed discussion of our analysis.", "In the previous report about the housing enterprises, we indicated that government sponsorship of the housing enterprises lowered interest rates on single-family, fixed-rate, conforming mortgages. Although the benefits of government sponsorship reduce certain mortgage interest rates, there is no similar effect on the yields of nonmortgage investments, because the enterprises are not a significant source of funding outside the residential mortgage market. Thus, there is an additional incentive for the enterprises to issue debt, whose yield is lower by virtue of government sponsorship, to invest in nonmortgage investments, whose market yields will be relatively higher because they are not affected by government sponsorship.", "Farmer Mac is a government-sponsored enterprise that also benefits from the market perception of an implied guarantee on enterprise obligations. It is, however, a much smaller and less established corporation than either of the housing enterprises. As a result, it is difficult to estimate Farmer Mac\u2019s funding advantage. For example, we do not know whether it could remain in business without government sponsorship or what its credit rating would be if it became a going concern as a private corporation without government sponsorship. If its credit rating without government sponsorship would be less than A, its funding advantage from government sponsorship could be greater than the advantage for the housing enterprises. However, Farmer Mac\u2019s securities may be currently perceived by market participants as more risky than housing enterprise securities. Farmer Mac documents provided to us in July 1997 indicated that yields on Farmer Mac debt had been between 1 and 10 basis points higher than yields on equivalent housing enterprise debt prior to Farmer Mac\u2019s new debt issuance strategy, and these yield differences had not yet been eliminated by Farmer Mac\u2019s debt issuance strategy.", "Of the specific nonmortgage investments made by the enterprises, public information is available on one investment that generated arbitrage profits; this investment was in Phillip Morris bonds purchased by Freddie Mac. The Phillip Morris bonds, which had an A rating, were purchased by Freddie Mac and were funded by Freddie Mac bonds with the same maturity. The yield difference was slightly over 60 basis points. Freddie Mac officials told us that its nonmortgage investment fund holding securities with maturities exceeding 5 years is authorized to contain up to $10 billion. Applying, as an example, an interest rate differential of 60 basis points, a $10 billion fund could generate as much as $60 million annually in arbitrage profits. If a similar 60-basis-point differential were applied to Farmer Mac nonagricultural-mortgage investments with maturities exceeding 5 years, arbitrage profits would represent about $3.2 million.", "We did not make an overall estimate of arbitrage profits, in part because of difficulties in estimating the funding advantage.

These enterprises hold nonmortgage investments in variable-rate ABS with stated maturities of over 5 years. The enterprises told us that many of these securities have expected maturities of less than 5 years due to borrower prepayments, and we do not have good estimates for the funding advantage on these investments. We also do not have good estimates for the funding advantage on short-term investments.

The respective interest rates for Fannie Mae in 1996 were 5.68 percent on nonmortgage investments and cash equivalents and 7.71 percent on mortgages. The general preponderance of short-term investments in the enterprises\u2019 nonmortgage investments accounts for the lower overall yield on these investments compared to mortgage investments. Our analysis of these short-term nonmortgage investments, such as term federal funds, indicates that they have a clear relationship to mission in enhancing liquidity, thereby allowing the enterprises to fund residential mortgages during different market conditions. In addition, even though they might also generate arbitrage profits, they are not the primary vehicle through which the housing enterprises would attempt to generate arbitrage profits. Likewise, since the yields from these investments are low relative to long-term nonmortgage investments, it is not likely that the volume of short-term nonmortgage investments would be substantially affected by the tension between increasing shareholder value and achieving mission, because these investments have lower yields than mortgage investments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Long-Term, Fixed-Rate Nonmortgage Investments by the Housing Enterprises Generate Arbitrage Profits, and Their Relationship to Mission Is Less Clear", "paragraphs": ["Freddie Mac officials indicated that nonmortgage investments are an integral tool for carrying out its housing finance mission and are held for three principal reasons: (1) cash management purposes; (2) as an investment vehicle that could make capital available (i.e., to employ capital) to help fund future anticipated demand to fund residential mortgages; and (3) as an investment vehicle to employ capital for future unexpected demand to fund residential mortgages. Freddie Mac created a fund in March 1997, which it calls its core fund, to invest in securities with maturities exceeding 5 years to be funded by matched maturity noncallable debt. The main stated purpose for the core fund is to have capital employed in case it becomes necessary to fund unexpected mortgage demand. Although Freddie Mac does not expect to liquidate core fund investments, Freddie Mac officials told us that liquidation could occur to fund purchases of residential mortgages if a decline in interest rates triggered a substantial increase in mortgage prepayments or if a major mortgage dealer or investor failed. The officials also said that raising capital to fund unexpected mortgage demand could take up to 4 months, and therefore it was important to have capital employed in investments that could quickly be liquidated in case such funds became necessary.", "Our analysis focused on alternative mechanisms available to Freddie Mac for funding unexpected mortgage demand. We asked Freddie Mac officials if they were able to supply the necessary liquidity in 1993, when declining mortgage interest rates caused the highest level of mortgage prepayments in history, by using financing techniques that did not rely on liquidation of long-term investments. The officials told us that the enterprises were able to serve the market by funding purchases of residential mortgages, but this particular experience was not a guarantee for the future. It is worth noting that mortgage prepayments reduce the level of the enterprises\u2019 outstanding MBS held by investors; therefore, investment funds to fund newly refinanced mortgages are made available from investors who purchase housing enterprise MBS. Thus, in this situation MBS issuance could provide necessary liquidity without reliance on liquidation of core fund investments.", "We agree that the potential failure of a major mortgage dealer or investor could bring about a need for additional liquidity in the mortgage market. However, Freddie Mac has a number of vehicles to provide liquidity, such as use of proceeds from maturing short-term nonmortgage investments to purchase residential mortgages, which in turn can be funded by issuance of MBS. Freddie Mac could also issue MBS backed by on-balance sheet holdings of residential mortgages, thereby reducing required capital to support its mortgage servicing portfolio. Such an action would make a capital cushion available to support funding of the unexpected mortgage demand, because the enterprises do not have to hold as much capital to finance off-balance sheet compared to on-balance sheet mortgage assets.", "Fannie Mae officials indicated that nonmortgage investments are held for three principal reasons: (1) cash management purposes, (2) as an investment vehicle to employ capital that is intrinsically appropriate for a financial corporation of its size, and (3) to maintain a capital cushion in excess of minimum capital requirements. Fannie Mae\u2019s nonmortgage investments with maturities exceeding 5 years are mostly asset-backed securities (ABS) with variable interest rates. The market value of the longer term ABS does not fluctuate as much as the market value of long-term fixed-rate securities, because most of the ABS have variable interest rates.", "Therefore, at times Fannie Mae has sold ABS to finance mortgage purchases. This activity is consistent with how Fannie Mae employs its short-term nonmortgage investments. In addition, according to our review of variable-rate ABS investments by all three enterprises, it appears that the funding advantage associated with government sponsorship is lower for these instruments compared to long-term, fixed-rate nonmortgage investments. Nonetheless, some arbitrage profits are generated from these investments. Therefore, the ABS investments appear to have characteristics that differ somewhat from other nonmortgage investments in two dimensions. First, they appear to be somewhat related to mission, because they are more liquid than fixed-rate long-term investments but less liquid than short-term nonmortgage investments.

The definition is in reference to state and local governments whose funding costs are lowered by virtue of the federal income tax exemption for interest on state and local bonds; this definition explicitly accounts for differences in government-provided benefits. Freddie Mac\u2019s assertion that anything profitable would be arbitrage according to our definition is not correct. We note that in an integrated national financial market there would be little if any opportunity for profit from borrowing and lending for the same time period with no risk if no funding advantage were present. Under our definition of arbitrage, arbitrage profit is the amount of profit on nonmortgage investments associated with the funding advantage from government sponsorship and not the profit resulting from either risk-taking or good business judgement.", "Treasury agreed with our conclusion that the enterprises\u2019 long term nonmortgage investments generate arbitrage profits and that some of the enterprises\u2019 short-term investments may also generate arbitrage profits."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Tension Between Increasing Shareholder Value and Achieving Mission", "paragraphs": ["All three enterprises took issue with our conclusion that a tension exists between increasing shareholder value and achieving mission. Freddie Mac said our draft report suggests that there is an inherent conflict between private ownership and Freddie Mac\u2019s public mission, which is at odds with legislative intent and Freddie Mac\u2019s demonstrated record of achievement. Fannie Mae said that although we provided a good review of the policies underpinning its executive compensation policy, our \u201ctension\u201d construct implies a conflict that is theoretical at best. Fannie Mae offered a construct where senior management is required to achieve multiple objectives. Fannie Mae adds: \u201cWhat is unique to the enterprises is that our mission is elevated by the Charter and enforced through oversight, regulation and potential legal sanction. The seriousness of our mission obligations are very clearly understood by managers, Directors and shareholders alike.\u201d Farmer Mac believes that there is a convergence of, rather than a tension between, the interests of Farmer Mac\u2019s shareholders and mission achievement through expanded volume, because of Farmer Mac\u2019s early stage of development.", "In our report, our finding of a tension between increasing shareholder value and mission fulfillment points to the role of mission regulation in helping to ensure that the purposes of the charter acts are achieved. We recognize that Congress granted the housing enterprises federal charters to direct them to bring private sector operating efficiencies to fulfill a public purpose in the secondary mortgage market. Congress also granted regulatory authorities to OFHEO to help ensure that the housing enterprises operate in a safe and sound manner and to HUD to ensure that the purposes of the respective charter acts are accomplished. Therefore, it appears that Congress intended regulatory oversight to address situations in which the private and public interests may not be aligned. Government sponsorship of the housing enterprises has created a mechanism for the government-provided benefits to be passed through, at least in part, in the form of lower mortgage interest rates. Because this mechanism is not present for nonmortgage investments, at least some of these investments could be more profitable on a risk-adjusted basis than mortgage investments. To the extent that profits from some nonmortgage investments are less clearly related to mission, reasonable questions can be raised about whether government benefits are supporting shareholder interests at the expense of the public mission. Fannie Mae\u2019s view explicitly acknowledges charter restrictions, regulatory oversight, and multiple corporate goals. Therefore, it is difficult to distinguish its view from ours, except that Fannie Mae appears to believe that the mission has been integrated into its corporate culture. Rather than relying solely on corporate culture, however, Congress established HUD as a regulator to ensure that mission objectives are achieved. Farmer Mac\u2019s debt issuance strategy has expanded the volume of nonagricultural-mortgage investments. Although it is clear that these investments are profitable and affect executive compensation, it is not yet clear whether they contribute to mission achievement.", "As arranged with your office, unless you publicly announce the contents of this letter report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 14 days after its issue date.

In a previous report about the housing enterprises, we concluded that the largest enterprise benefit from government sponsorship flows from the market perception of an implied guarantee on enterprise obligations, because this perception generates a funding advantage\u2014a reduction in yields on enterprise debt. In that report, we indicated that the funding advantage could be in the range of 30 to 106 basis points. This range accounted for the long-term nature of residential mortgage investments, and it assumed that the housing enterprises would receive a credit rating between a high of AAA and a low of A if their government sponsorship were eliminated.", "Our definition of arbitrage does not require the enterprise to match fund its nonmortgage investments. However, our measurement of the yield differences used to estimate arbitrage profits is based on a comparison of debt securities with similar maturity and risk. Under this method, if the debt securities being compared had different maturities, the yield difference (i.e., yield spread) would reflect both the impact of government sponsorship and the difference in interest rate risk between the debt securities. Alternatively, if the debt securities being compared had similar maturities and risks but differed by virtue of government sponsorship, the yield difference would reflect the impact of government sponsorship. For this reason, matched maturity debt provides the best measure of arbitrage, even though arbitrage is also present when nonmortgage investments are funded by enterprise debt with different maturities and risks.", "In addition to relying on yield differences between enterprise nonmortgage investments in corporate bonds and matched maturity enterprise debt used to finance such investments as a measure of arbitrage, another possible approach to measuring arbitrage is to use statistical techniques to adjust yield differences between corporate and enterprise debt for differences in maturity and risk. Such an approach was used in a study commissioned by the Department of Housing and Urban Development to evaluate the implications of severing government sponsorship of the housing enterprises on the enterprises\u2019 debt costs. The study included analysis of yield differences between housing enterprise debt and debt issued by different groups of corporations (i.e., the benchmark groups) with A, AA, and AAA credit ratings. The benchmark groups were chosen on the assumption that the housing enterprises would have credit ratings in this range if their federal charters were revoked. The analysis was complex, because bond characteristics differ between bonds issued by the enterprises and other issuers. Ambrose and Warga recognized how difficult their research task was and qualified their results on the basis of the statistical complexities.", "We relied on the Ambrose and Warga study results for the period 1991 through 1994, in part, in making our estimate that the housing enterprises\u2019 funding advantage from government sponsorship could be in the range of 30 to 106 basis points. Due to the statistical complexities of their analysis, we concluded that their estimates lacked precision. Therefore, we used this broad range for the funding advantage on debt.", "Recently, the Standard and Poor\u2019s (S&P) credit rating agency rated each housing enterprise for its government risk rating, which is based on the probability that the federal government would be called upon in the event of an enterprise default on its obligations. Each enterprise received an AA minus rating. S&P indicated that the rating for each enterprise still accounted for some benefits, namely liquidity of enterprise obligations, due to government sponsorship. If the enterprises were privatized, S&P said that each would likely have to raise additional equity capital to maintain an AA minus rating.", "The housing enterprises fund their nonmortgage investments with noncallable debt. Generally, the Ambrose and Warga yield spread estimates were smaller for noncallable than for callable debt. On the basis of the S&P credit ratings and the way the enterprises fund their nonmortgage investments, we have concluded that the Ambrose and Warga estimated yield spreads based on the A and AA credit ratings for issuance of noncallable debt are most relevant for measuring arbitrage profits. For the 1991 through 1994 period, the range of estimated yield spreads on noncallable debt between the AA-rated companies and the housing enterprises was 39 to 46 basis points; when the A-rated companies were used as the benchmark, the range was 65 to 72 basis points. We continue to support the Ambrose and Warga estimates and our estimated range of 30 to 106 basis points for the funding advantage; findings from our analysis of housing enterprise financial data are consistent with these estimates.", "As indicated in the body of this report, we could not estimate the funding advantage resulting from government sponsorship for Farmer Mac.", "However, we indicated qualitatively how Farmer Mac\u2019s funding advantage could compare to the funding advantage of the housing enterprises."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Compensation Structure for Board Members and Senior Managers", "paragraphs": ["The enterprises\u2019 management and boards of directors have implemented compensation policies designed to attract and retain individuals from various disciplines who have the talent and motivation needed to accomplish the corporations\u2019 objectives. The enterprises seek to closely link pay with performance and provide compensation that is reasonable and comparable with compensation for employment in other similar businesses involving similar duties and responsibilities. Through committees, the enterprises\u2019 boards of directors develop policies and administer compensation programs that are meant to conform to the congressional mandate.", "Freddie Mac\u2019s overall compensation package consists of both direct compensation (i.e., cash and stock incentives) and noncash employee benefit programs. A base salary, an annual cash bonus, and long-term stock incentives are included in the direct compensation package. Base salaries are determined primarily by position and individual skills and are targeted to match the median (i.e., 50th percentile) level of the market as determined by data obtained from comparator groups (e.g., companies identified as being in a similar line of business) and market surveys. Annual cash bonuses, which function as short-term incentives, are based on a combination of individual and corporate performance and increase as a percentage of base salary at successively higher levels of responsibility and accountability. Long-term stock incentives are awarded to officers and director-level employees (i.e., employees who report directly to officers or are senior-level technical and professional employees, but not members of Freddie Mac\u2019s Board of Directors). For officers, long-term stock incentives are awarded as a percentage of base salary and increase as a percentage of base salary at successively higher levels of responsibility. The director-level employee is awarded long-term stock incentives as a percentage of the director-level salary grade midpoint. Freddie Mac\u2019s long-term stock incentives include restricted stock, which is awarded to the corporation\u2019s executive officers, and stock options. Examples of noncash employee benefits offered to all regular employees include an individually structured benefits package (i.e., health care, life insurance, etc.); a pension plan; and an employee stock purchase plan.", "Fannie Mae\u2019s compensation package consists of a base salary, employee benefits, annual incentives, and long-term incentives. The salary is based on individual skills, experience, performance, etc; benefits include such provisions as insurance coverage, vacation pay, sick leave, and retirement. Annual incentives reward employees for reaching specific objectives or completing projects that enhance the corporation\u2019s success for that year, and long-term incentives generally reward executives for shareholder gains and the achievement of specific corporate objectives.", "Today, Farmer Mac\u2019s salaries and other compensation components are based on surveys of pay structures at other enterprises and other financial institutions; however, this was not always the case. Although its salary compensation policies were generally competitive, Farmer Mac officials told us that other aspects of its compensation were not. In 1995, assisted by a compensation consultant, Farmer Mac recognized the need to revise its compensation policies to emphasize the creation of a greater management equity stake in Farmer Mac\u2019s future. Consequently, the consultant helped Farmer Mac to establish a baseline compensation package for its staff that now includes an annual salary, annual bonus to award current-year contributions to Farmer Mac\u2019s success, and long-term compensation (stocks and options) to ensure that directors and senior managers hold an equity interest in the corporation to provide the incentive to ensure the long-term survival of Farmer Mac.

Freddie Mac said that we calculate nonmortgage assets as a percentage of on-balance sheet assets and that this exaggerates the size of nonmortgage investments in relation to Freddie Mac\u2019s total mortgage-related activities. We calculate nonmortgage investments as a percentage of (1) on-balance sheet assets; (2) total mortgage servicing portfolio; and (3) capital (i.e., corporate equity). The second measure captures Freddie Mac\u2019s total mortgage-related activities. The second measure is relevant if the sole purpose of the nonmortgage investments is, by definition, to support the total mortgage servicing portfolio. However, we provide the first and third measures because of their relevance in cases where the relationship of nonmortgage investments to mission is not clear. For example, both measures are relevant for comparisons among different corporations competing in the financial services industry. 2. Freddie Mac stated that its debt and MBS markets are not immune from disruption and states the example, \u201c. . . should secondary market investors begin to sell large amounts of long-term mortgage-backed securities, the \u2018spreads\u2019 on these securities against Treasury bond benchmarks would widen (. . . perhaps significantly).\u201d Freddie Mac added that it could only make matters worse in this environment by issuing new MBS. Freddie Mac does not specify the economic conditions that would cause investors to sell large amounts of MBS so that the value of MBS relative to Treasury securities would fall, while at the same time there would be such an unexpected surge in mortgage demand that would require liquidation of core fund investments. During the course of our assignment, we asked Freddie Mac to provide analyses indicating the economic conditions that would require sales of nonmortgage investments from the core portfolio to purchase mortgages. With respect to the examples Freddie Mac provided, in our report we analyzed alternative mechanisms available to Freddie Mac for funding unexpected mortgage demand. These alternatives have been successfully employed by the housing enterprises in the past to meet their charter responsibilities. (See pp. 26-27.) 3. Freddie Mac takes issue with our definition of arbitrage, which is similiar to the definition of an arbitrage bond in the U.S. tax code. It said: \u201cIn the municipal bond context, however, Congress disapproved what it viewed as the inappropriate conversion of federal Treasury securities into municipal bonds, the proceeds of which were never applied for any legitimate governmental purposes. Freddie Mac\u2019s nonmortgage investments, in contrast, directly serve our statutory purposes of providing liquidity and stability to the mortgage market.\u201d Here, we again note that the relationship between the various nonmortgage investments and mission achievement is less clear for the longer term than the shorter term nonmortgage investments. Therefore, we have concluded that the analogy to municipal bonds in defining arbitrage is appropriate. 4. Freddie Mac disagrees with our use of the range of 30 to 106 basis points to represent the housing enterprises\u2019 funding advantage on debt. Freddie Mac\u2019s comments and our response appear in the previous GAO report establishing this range. In its comment letter in this report, it cited its analysis of the yield spread on 5-year bullet debt between housing enterprise debt and debt of A and AA rated companies to illustrate Freddie Mac\u2019s disagreement with our range. Freddie Mac also noted that the data upon which this range was established are from the 1991 to 1994 time period. We first became aware of the Freddie Mac analysis when it was submitted for the record at congressional hearings on July 31, 1996, after we completed our previous (i.e., privatization) study identifying the 30- to 106-basis-point range. Although we have not thoroughly analyzed the methodology (including its emphasis on 5-year debt rather than debt issues with longer maturities) or data relied upon in the Freddie Mac analysis, we note that the findings on yield spreads from the Freddie Mac analysis are in the vicinity of the bottom of our range (see reference to the 36-basis-point average cited by Freddie Mac). In addition, our findings from our analysis of housing enterprise financial data during this assignment are consistent with the estimated funding advantage range we established in our previous report and rely upon in this report. The housing enterprise financial data and the Standard and Poor\u2019s credit ratings we relied upon for our analysis during the course of this assignment are more recent than the data relied upon in the Freddie Mac analysis. 5. Freddie Mac disagreed with our \u201cdraft report\u2019s estimates of potential arbitrage profits based on an assumed portfolio that is nearly 17 times larger than Freddie Mac\u2019s current longer-term nonmortgage investments.\u201d We provide this estimate as an example of how much a $10 billion fund, the authorized level for Freddie Mac\u2019s core fund, can generate in arbitrage profits. We also make reference to the $2 billion forecasted level for year-end 1997 holdings in the core fund."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Comments From Fannie Mae", "paragraphs": ["The following comments represent our response to specific comments made on a draft of this report on January 12, 1998, by the Vice President for Regulatory Activities at Fannie Mae."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Comments", "paragraphs": ["1.

As a result, they are less useful in facilitating liquidity in the agricultural mortgage market than short-term investments. 2. Farmer Mac suggested that a reasonable time frame for reaching the final stage of its debt issuance strategy could be 2 to 3 years following adoption of the strategy. As far as we know, this is the first time a time frame has been suggested as a reasonable period of time for the debt issuance policy to contribute to mission. 3. Farmer Mac took issue with our observation that Farmer Mac\u2019s debt issuance strategy, which intends to lower the funding costs to purchase agricultural mortgages and issue AMBS, appears to us to contradict, at least in part, our observation that Farmer Mac has not offered higher prices for agricultural mortgages. Farmer Mac states that the agricultural mortgage origination market is currently very inefficient, and therefore Farmer Mac is directing funds made available by the debt issuance strategy toward expanded efforts to recruit new mortgage originators. We revised our discussion (see page 29) and, rather than referring to a possible contradiction, we now directly relate these observations to the uncertainty associated with the effectiveness of Farmer Mac\u2019s debt issuance strategy on mission achievement. 4.
