By policy, these demonstrations must not increase federal spending. GAO has previously reported concerns with HHS's approval process. GAO was asked to provide information on a new Medicaid section 1115 demonstration initiative called Pharmacy Plus, intended to allow states to cover prescription drugs for seniors not otherwise eligible for Medicaid. GAO reviewed the (1) approval status of state proposals, (2) extent to which HHS ensured that demonstrations are budget neutral, (3) basis for savings assumptions, and (4) federal and state steps to evaluate and monitor the demonstrations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["From January 2002 through May 2004, HHS reviewed Pharmacy Plus proposals from 15 states and approved four: Florida, Illinois, South Carolina, and Wisconsin. These demonstrations offer prescription drug coverage to low-income seniors not otherwise eligible for Medicaid. HHS denied proposals from Delaware and Hawaii as inconsistent with demonstration guidelines; most of the rest were not under active review because HHS had not determined how new Medicare prescription drug legislation will affect proposed or operating Pharmacy Plus demonstrations. Over 5 years, the four approved demonstrations will provide prescription drug coverage to half a million low-income people age 65 or older, at a projected cost of about $3.6 billion, of which the federal share would be about $2.1 billion. HHS has not adequately ensured that the four approved demonstrations will be budget neutral, that is, that the federal government will not spend more with the demonstrations than without them. HHS approved the demonstrations' 5-year spending limits using projections of cost and beneficiary enrollment growth that exceeded benchmarks that HHS said it considered in assessing budget neutrality, specifically, states' recent average growth rates and projections for Medicaid program growth nationwide. Neither HHS's negotiations with the states nor its rationale for approving higher growth rates is documented. Using the benchmark growth rates, GAO estimates that none of the four demonstrations will be budget neutral and federal spending may increase significantly, for example, by more than $1 billion in Illinois and $416 million in Wisconsin over 5 years. Unrealistic savings assumptions also contribute to demonstration spending limits that are not likely to be budget neutral. States assumed that keeping low-income seniors healthy--thus preventing them from spending down their financial resources on health services and \"diverting\" them from Medicaid eligibility--would generate sufficient savings to offset the increased costs of providing a new drug benefit. GAO found neither state experience nor other research to support such savings. Without state-specific evidence, HHS approved savings assumptions for the four states ranging from $480 million to $2 billion per state over 5 years. Had more conservative assumptions been used to estimate demonstration savings, the proposals likely could not have been approved as budget neutral. Efforts by the states and HHS to evaluate and monitor the Pharmacy Plus demonstrations are in their early stages. The four states have taken few steps to put their own required evaluation plans into practice, and an independent evaluation contracted by HHS and started in October 2002 is scheduled to report in September 2005. In the interim, HHS has not ensured that all states meet requirements for progress reporting on the demonstrations. The information that states have submitted is often insufficient for determining whether the demonstrations are operating as intended, and this shortcoming will limit HHS's oversight capability."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Under section 1115 of the Social Security Act (SSA), the Secretary of  Health and Human Services may waive certain statutory requirements for  Medicaid\u2014the joint federal and state program financing health care for  low-income families, certain seniors, and disabled individuals\u2014in  connection with experimental, pilot, or demonstration projects that are  likely to promote program objectives. Because of the projects\u2019  experimental nature, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)  requires demonstrations authorized under section 1115 to include  measurable objectives and an evaluation component. In addition, since the  early 1980s, HHS has required states to show that their proposals for  section 1115 demonstrations are \u201cbudget neutral\u201d for the federal  government: that is, a proposed demonstration cannot raise federal  expenditures beyond what they would be under a state\u2019s existing program.", "In January 2002, HHS announced the Medicaid Pharmacy Plus section  1115 demonstration initiative, offering states the opportunity to provide a  prescription drug benefit to two groups\u2014seniors (people age 65 or older)  and disabled individuals\u2014whose incomes, although low, exceed levels  that would qualify them for full Medicaid eligibility. Under this initiative,  HHS and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the agency  within HHS that has primary responsibility for reviewing the  demonstration proposals, encourage states to test over 5 years whether  extending a drug benefit to seniors who are not eligible for Medicaid  would maintain these seniors\u2019 health and hold down overall Medicaid  costs.", "Over the past decade, Congress and others have raised concerns about the  extent to which HHS has ensured that approved section 1115  demonstration waivers promote the goals and fiscal integrity of both  Medicaid and the State Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP). In  particular, Congress has been concerned about HHS\u2019s waiver approval  process and the federal costs associated with some of the demonstrations.  Our past work has found, for example, that HHS\u2019s process for approving  demonstrations is not always clear or open to public input and that the  department has not always ensured the budget neutrality of approved  demonstrations, thereby raising federal expenditures.", "You asked us for information on the Pharmacy Plus initiative. We focused  our review on the following four questions:  1.  How many states have applied for Pharmacy Plus demonstration  waivers, and what is the status of their proposals?  2.  To what extent has HHS ensured that the approved demonstrations are  budget neutral to the federal government?  3.  How well supported are states\u2019 assumptions about savings that may  accrue to Medicaid from the Pharmacy Plus demonstration waivers?  4.  What steps are states and HHS taking to evaluate approved  demonstrations and to monitor if they are functioning as intended?", "Our work is based on a review and analysis of Pharmacy Plus  demonstration waiver proposals considered and approved by HHS from  January 2002 through May 2004. Our analysis covers only demonstration  proposals submitted in response to HHS\u2019s Pharmacy Plus initiative. To  determine the status of demonstrations under this initiative, we analyzed  HHS data on all proposals it considered, including their number,  outcomes, and characteristics. For approved demonstrations, we analyzed  the applications as submitted by the states; HHS decision memorandums  and approval letters; the applications as ultimately approved; HHS\u2019s terms  and conditions for approved demonstrations; and, when available, the  states\u2019 plans (called operational protocols) for how the demonstrations  will operate. We also discussed the process of review and approval with  officials of the reviewing agencies\u2014HHS, CMS, and the Office of  Management and Budget (OMB)\u2014and we obtained information from  officials representing the states with approved demonstrations. To assess  budget neutrality, we obtained available budget justifications and  documentation from state and federal officials and discussed with them  the budget negotiations associated with each approved demonstration. To  examine the assumptions behind the initiative and the likelihood of  associated savings, we reviewed published literature and interviewed  officials from the Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured and  the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). We discussed plans for evaluating  the approved demonstrations with HHS and state officials. During our  review, Congress passed the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement,  and Modernization Act of 2003, which adds a drug benefit to Medicare, the  federal program providing health insurance for the majority of people age  65 or older regardless of income. We considered the limited information  available as of May 2004 about the relationship between Pharmacy Plus  and the act. We conducted our work from December 2002 through June  2004 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Established in 1965 under title XIX of SSA, Medicaid is the nation\u2019s health  care financing program for low-income families and certain people who  are age 65 or older or disabled. The program accounted for about   $244 billion in federal and state expenditures in fiscal year 2002 and  covered an estimated 53 million people. The states and the federal  government share Medicaid spending according to a formula that provides  a more generous federal match for states where per capita income is  lower.", "Medicaid is an open-ended entitlement program, meaning that the federal  government is obligated to pay its share of expenditures for all people and  services covered under an HHS-approved state Medicaid plan. To qualify  for federal matching payments, state Medicaid programs are required by  law to cover certain categories of beneficiaries, including pregnant women  and children with family incomes below specific limits, as well as  individuals with limited income and assets who are age 65 or older or  disabled. State programs are also required to cover certain services,  including physician and hospital services and nursing home care. As long  as states meet federal requirements and obtain HHS approval for their  state Medicaid plans, they have considerable flexibility in designing and  operating their programs. For example, states may choose to expand  coverage to seniors whose incomes are above statutory limits, and all  states have opted to provide prescription drug coverage. In addition,  section 1115 of SSA permits the Secretary of HHS to waive certain  statutory requirements applicable to Medicaid to allow states to provide  services or cover individuals not otherwise eligible for Medicaid and to  provide federal funding for services and populations not usually eligible  for federal matching payments.", "The Pharmacy Plus initiative allows states to provide a prescription drug  benefit to certain Medicare beneficiaries, specifically seniors and disabled  people, with incomes at or below 200 percent of FPL. Typically, Medicaid  eligibility under an approved state plan provides access to all state  Medicaid-covered services, but eligibility under a Pharmacy Plus  demonstration covers only a prescription drug benefit. The premise  behind the initiative is that expanded access to medically necessary drugs  will help keep low-income seniors healthy enough to avoid medical  expenses that could cause them to \u201cspend down\u201d their resources to the  point of Medicaid eligibility. The initiative assumes that budget neutrality  for pharmacy-only coverage can be achieved by savings to Medicaid from  fewer seniors\u2019 enrolling for full benefits, as well as from improved access  to prescription drugs, improved service delivery or medication  management, and better management of drug benefit costs.", "Unlike some other section 1115 demonstration waivers, the Pharmacy Plus  initiative requires a participating state to accept a fixed spending limit as  part of its budget neutrality agreement with HHS. This spending limit\u2014 sometimes called an aggregate spending limit or global budget cap\u2014 applies not only to services and beneficiaries in the state\u2019s demonstration  drug program, but also to all services for all Medicaid seniors in the state.  The Pharmacy Plus budget neutrality approach limits the amount the  federal government will match for a demonstration according to expected  growth in both service costs and enrollment (see app. I). Once a state has  reached its Pharmacy Plus spending limit, it cannot receive additional  federal matching dollars for any Medicaid services for seniors in the state,  nor can the state restrict enrollment of seniors who qualify for full  Medicaid benefits. Under the Pharmacy Plus scenario, a state accepts the  financial risks inherent in a fixed budget cap for unanticipated changes in  both cost and enrollment growth. For some other section 1115  demonstrations, budget neutrality is based on a projected per capita cost  for each demonstration beneficiary. This other scenario sets a limit on  spending per person, but because federal matching funds are available for  all people who enroll, a state does not have to accept financial risk for  unexpected growth in enrollment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HHS Has Reviewed 15 Pharmacy Plus Proposals and Approved 4", "paragraphs": ["As of May 2004, HHS had approved four states\u2019 Pharmacy Plus  demonstration proposals, denied two, and considered proposals from nine  other states.

Together, the  four approved demonstrations are projected to enroll as many as 527,800  individuals for Medicaid prescription drug benefits only; as of April 2004,  they reported combined enrollment of nearly 372,200 people. Illinois\u2019  demonstration is the largest, with expected enrollment for the drug benefit  of more than 250,000 seniors over 5 years. As of April 2004, more than  192,600 people were enrolled in Illinois\u2019 demonstration, the majority of  them moved into the Medicaid program from an existing state-funded  pharmacy assistance program.", "All the demonstrations except Florida\u2019s are approved to enroll seniors  with incomes at or below 200 percent of FPL, the maximum eligible  income established in HHS\u2019s Pharmacy Plus guidance. As approved,  Florida\u2019s demonstration covers seniors with incomes from 88 to   120 percent of FPL, but in September 2003, the state submitted an  amendment to expand income eligibility to 200 percent of FPL. Illinois  also applied in March 2003 to amend its approved demonstration to  expand eligibility, in its case to include seniors with incomes at or below  250 percent of FPL. The terms of Illinois\u2019 demonstration approval  specifically permit the state to seek this amendment, as long as the state  submits data supporting its ability to cover this expansion population at no  additional cost to the federal government. As of March 2004, HHS was  reviewing both amendments.", "Projected 5-year costs vary among the four approved demonstrations. For  Florida, Illinois, South Carolina, and Wisconsin, total combined federal  and state Medicaid spending on the new drug benefit alone is expected to  be more than $3.6 billion over 5 years, of which the federal share would be  approximately $2.1 billion. The combined federal and state Medicaid  spending limits for the four demonstrations\u2014for services to all Medicaid  seniors in the four states\u2014would total $44 billion over 5 years, with a  federal share of at least $25 billion. The estimated 5-year costs solely for  the drug benefit range from $477 million in Florida to $1.4 billion in  Illinois, and combined 5-year federal and state spending limits (based on  projected costs for services to all Medicaid seniors) range from $5.0 billion  in South Carolina to $16.7 billion in Florida.", "When they applied, three of the four states with approved demonstrations  already operated state-funded pharmacy assistance programs for seniors.  Most beneficiaries eligible for these programs are also eligible for  Pharmacy Plus coverage. HHS allows the states to subsume all or a  portion of an existing program under a demonstration, as long as the  states\u2019 demonstrations propose to expand either the number of  beneficiaries or the scope of drug coverage. In other words, the state may  not simply secure federal matching dollars for the costs of an existing  state-funded drug program with no expansion. To meet this condition,  states with approved demonstrations either raised income eligibility  thresholds or expanded the scope of drug coverage beyond that of their  existing state programs. For example, Florida doubled its maximum  monthly benefit from $80 to $160 per person, and South Carolina  expanded eligibility to include seniors with incomes from 175 through   200 percent of FPL.

Delaware\u2019s state-funded pharmacy assistance  program already covered seniors and disabled adults with incomes up to  200 percent of FPL or whose prescription drug costs exceeded 40 percent  of their annual incomes. For this reason, the state could not expand either  eligibility or coverage and stay within Pharmacy Plus guidelines.

This benefit was to be funded through participant cost  sharing, manufacturer rebates, and a fixed state contribution of $1 per  prescription. HHS\u2019s denial was based primarily on the request to cover  individuals with incomes up to 300 percent instead of 200 percent of FPL.

It also directs HHS to establish effective coordination between Medicare  plans and state Medicaid and pharmacy assistance programs and to  establish a commission to address these and other transition issues. In  2006, the Medicare drug benefit will replace Medicaid as the primary  source of prescription drug coverage for low-income seniors who would  have been eligible for both full benefits under Medicaid and drug benefits  under Medicare plans. Under MMA, individuals with limited assets and  incomes below 150 percent of FPL will be eligible for federal subsidies to  assist with the drug benefit\u2019s cost-sharing requirements.

A standard Pharmacy Plus application form developed by HHS  and a technical guidance document are the chief sources of criteria and  formal guidance to states for developing demonstration proposals. But  HHS has not established written criteria for how it reviews and approves  the growth rates that states propose. These growth rates are key elements  in the budget neutrality negotiations between states and the federal  government because higher rates result in more generous spending limits,  which represent the federal government\u2019s agreed-on maximum spending  for all the states\u2019 Medicaid seniors during the demonstrations. An  inappropriately high spending level can represent a higher federal liability  than warranted.", "The process used by HHS and the states to determine whether states\u2019  proposed Pharmacy Plus demonstrations will be budget neutral requires  comparing two cost estimates: (1) projected 5-year costs of a state\u2019s  existing Medicaid program for seniors (\u201cwithout-demonstration costs\u201d)  and (2) projected 5-year costs of the state\u2019s existing program plus the drug  benefits and beneficiaries added by the demonstration (\u201cwith- demonstration costs\u201d).

As long as projected with-demonstration  costs do not exceed projected without-demonstration costs, the  demonstration can be approved as budget neutral. As a result, the  projected costs of a state\u2019s existing, without-waiver Medicaid program for  seniors effectively sets the spending limit for all services provided to all  Medicaid seniors in the state for the 5-year demonstration term.   Appendix I outlines the basic steps HHS follows in setting Pharmacy Plus  demonstration spending limits.", "To determine budget neutral spending limits for the pharmacy  demonstrations, HHS officials told us they consider the following for  estimating growth in costs and enrollment through the course of the  demonstrations:    For cost growth per beneficiary, similar to guidelines for other types of  section 1115 demonstrations, HHS seeks to approve a growth rate equal  to the lower of either the state\u2019s historical average annual growth in per- beneficiary cost (that is, the average annual rate for the 5 years before the  demonstration proposal) or the nationwide projected growth rate,  developed by CMS\u2019s Office of the Actuary, for Medicaid cost per  beneficiary age 65 or older.", "For enrollment growth, HHS considers the state\u2019s historical average  annual growth in enrollment as a starting point and, to a lesser extent, the  CMS Actuary\u2019s nationwide rate, but it allows states to present a rationale  for a higher rate that anticipates rising future enrollments.", "HHS\u2019s approved growth rates in some cases exceeded these benchmarks  (see table 2). For per-beneficiary cost growth rates in Florida, Illinois, and  Wisconsin, HHS did not approve the lower of either the state\u2019s historical  average rate or the CMS Actuary\u2019s rate of 6.3 percent. Similarly, for  beneficiary enrollment growth rates, HHS approved rates for Illinois and  Wisconsin that exceeded both the states\u2019 historical experience and the  CMS Actuary\u2019s 1.8 percent projected annual growth rate. In Illinois\u2019 case,  the approved rate for beneficiary enrollment growth\u20145 percent per year  over the 5-year demonstration\u2014was considerably higher than the state\u2019s   5-year historical average enrollment growth of 1.6 percent per year."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Basis for Approved Spending Limits Not Clear or Well Documented", "paragraphs": ["HHS\u2019s basis is unclear for approving growth rates higher than the  benchmarks in some cases, particularly for approving higher enrollment  growth rates for Illinois and Wisconsin.

In particular, HHS\u2019s internal decision  memorandums\u2014which described the factors that HHS, CMS, OMB, and  others considered in reviewing the demonstrations and which are not  publicly available\u2014did not provide the rationale for the approved  spending limits, and neither did the publicly available demonstration  approval letters.", "HHS and state officials told us that Illinois and Wisconsin used a variety of  arguments to convince the department that their situations warranted  higher enrollment growth rates. But the states provided little specific  documentation to HHS or to us to support these arguments. For example:  Illinois asserted that its projected annual enrollment growth rate for the  demonstration years from 2002 through 2007 should be significantly higher  than its 5-year average historical growth rate of 1.6 percent, because  income eligibility levels for seniors in its Medicaid program increased from  41 to 100 percent of FPL from July 2000 through July 2002. As support, the  state provided HHS with updated Medicaid enrollment data\u2014which were  more recent than those included in the original demonstration application  and showed increased growth rates for seniors compared with earlier  years\u2014but these rates were still lower than the 5 percent HHS approved  and did not raise the historical average to 5 percent. The state did not  provide documents with actuarial projections of the estimated number of  people expected to enroll in Medicaid because of the change in eligibility  criteria. Illinois justified applying the 5 percent annual growth rate to all   5 years of the pharmacy demonstration by providing a chart showing that  enrollment in a different state program, SCHIP, had grown more than   5 percent per year on average for 3 years after that program\u2019s eligibility  criteria were expanded. In our view, however, Illinois\u2019 SCHIP enrollment  experience with children does not provide a reasonable basis for  predicting enrollment by seniors in the Pharmacy Plus demonstration.", "Wisconsin asserted that its projected annual enrollment growth rate for  the demonstration years should be significantly higher than either its   5-year unadjusted historical growth rate of 0.01 percent or the 0.12 percent  rate based on 3 years of historical data reported in its application because  of the anticipated effects of a nationwide Social Security Administration  mail outreach program to low-income Medicare beneficiaries. This  outreach program informed seniors enrolled in Medicare about other  benefits, including Medicaid assistance for Medicare cost-sharing  requirements, for which they might qualify. Wisconsin officials told us  they proposed a 4 percent future annual enrollment growth rate for  seniors in the expectation that this outreach program, along with factors  including an aging population and the economic downturn, would increase  Medicaid enrollment. According to HHS, Wisconsin did not document any  projections of how many newly eligible Medicaid individuals could be  prompted to enroll after the Social Security Administration outreach  mailing. Instead, it submitted information based on a review of a similar  outreach effort in Minnesota. According to Wisconsin state officials,  during negotiations HHS proposed 1 percent as a more reasonable growth  rate, and HHS and state officials agreed to an approved enrollment growth  rate of 2 percent per year. Our related work suggests that Wisconsin may  be justified in claiming some increase in Medicaid enrollment as a result of  the outreach program, but the effect appears to be less than 1 percent.  Notably, although the Social Security Administration mail outreach  program was nationwide, HHS did not consider its effects when approving  enrollment rates for other states."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Demonstration Spending Limits Would Be Lower if Based on Benchmark Rates", "paragraphs": ["Application of benchmark rates for projected per-beneficiary cost and  enrollment growth would have produced lower spending limits for all four  approved Pharmacy Plus demonstrations (see table 3).

The higher-than-benchmark growth rates HHS approved  for Illinois and Wisconsin accounted for most of these differences. Had the  spending limit for Illinois\u2019 demonstration, in particular, been based strictly  on the benchmark rates, combined federal and state spending would have  been almost $2.2 billion, or 15 percent, lower, and the federal  government\u2019s liability under the demonstration (at the state\u2019s 50 percent  federal matching rate) lower by more than $1 billion. The difference is less  pronounced for Wisconsin, where the approved federal and state spending  limit exceeds what it would have been had benchmark rates been applied  by about $713 million, translating into about $416 million in additional  federal spending.", "The spending limits HHS approved for Illinois and Wisconsin exceed  estimates based on consistent application of the benchmark growth rates  by 15.4 percent and 8.5 percent, respectively.

Without state- specific evidence, HHS approved savings assumptions negotiated with the  states, including significant projected reductions in Medicaid senior  enrollment. But the limited research available suggests that potential  health care savings due to improved access to prescription drugs are likely  to be much less than the levels the states assumed and HHS approved. Had  more conservative savings assumptions been used to estimate the  demonstrations\u2019 costs, the proposals likely could not have been approved  as budget neutral.

The dollar amounts of combined federal and state savings  projected under these assumptions in the demonstrations\u2019 budget  neutrality calculations range from $480 million in Florida to $2 billion in  Illinois (see table 4).", "To project the extent to which Pharmacy Plus would reduce its new  enrollment of Medicaid seniors, and thus its total senior enrollment,  Florida made the relatively conservative assumption that the drug benefit  would enable seniors to avoid Medicaid eligibility for 1 year; after 5 years,  the state\u2019s total projected number of Medicaid seniors would be 5,900   (3 percent) lower with the demonstration than without it. The other states,  in contrast, assumed that everyone diverted in each year of their  demonstrations would remain out of Medicaid throughout the full  demonstration period and would not, for example, enter a nursing home,  which often results in Medicaid eligibility. As a result, Illinois, South  Carolina, and Wisconsin projected reductions of nearly 20 percent or more  in Medicaid senior enrollments at the end of 5 years.

In their proposals,  none of the three states that previously had state-funded pharmacy  assistance programs (Florida, Illinois, and South Carolina) provided data  from those programs that specifically supported such high projected  savings. Based on conversations with Wisconsin health care financing  officials and a review of documents, we found that the state\u2019s  demonstration savings estimates were a residual of the budget-negotiating  process, derived from determining how much was needed in savings to  demonstrate budget neutrality, rather than from research or data about  what was realistic."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Premise behind Approved Demonstrations Not Well Supported by Research", "paragraphs": ["The premise that Pharmacy Plus demonstrations will generate savings by  keeping low-income seniors from becoming Medicaid-eligible is not  supported by research. In a previous report, we reviewed the research  studies cited in Illinois\u2019 demonstration proposal and found that they did  not sufficiently support the state\u2019s theory that a full drug benefit for low- income seniors would yield the projected level of savings. Although these  studies indicated that access to prescription drugs benefited people in  poor health, they all focused on people who already had specific  diagnosed conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, or HIV, rather than  on a general population of seniors. An extensive 2003 review of research  examining drug coverage for low-income seniors found relatively few  studies about the effect on Medicaid spending of expanded access to a  broad prescription drug benefit. The one study this review considered  most relevant, conducted in the mid-1980s, assessed Pennsylvania\u2019s state- funded program, Pharmaceutical Assistance Contract for the Elderly  (PACE), and found that despite high enrollment, Medicaid entry among  PACE participants was neither prevented nor delayed enough to have a  discernible effect on the state\u2019s overall Medicaid budget. Other studies of  broad prescription drug benefits for low-income seniors, including one of  New York\u2019s program, found some reductions in participants\u2019 health care  costs but mainly for inpatient hospital care, which, for people age 65 or  older, is covered by Medicare rather than Medicaid. Still other studies in  this review examined the more limited question of how access to  appropriate drugs affects people already suffering from specific illnesses.  Such research sheds little light on the cost-effectiveness of offering  comprehensive drug benefits to a broad population of low-income seniors.", "Some states that have not submitted Pharmacy Plus proposals examined  the diversion and savings assumptions behind the demonstrations and  found that they would not likely be realized. For example, in considering  whether to apply for a demonstration, Minnesota found a substantial risk  that seniors receiving only a drug benefit would eventually become  Medicaid-eligible over a 5-year follow-up period. In its optimal model, the  study estimated that to generate enough savings to offset the new drug  costs, the risk of Medicaid entry would have to be reduced by 50 percent  for non-nursing-home enrollees and by 30 percent for those who become  eligible after entering a nursing home. Minnesota Medicaid officials  concluded that this scenario was not realistic and dropped the state\u2019s  Pharmacy Plus demonstration proposal.", "Pennsylvania also conducted a Pharmacy Plus demonstration feasibility  study for PACE and the related Pharmaceutical Assistance Contract for  the Elderly Needs Enhancement Tier (PACENET) programs, which  together enrolled about 270,000 seniors in 2002. The study found that to  offset drug benefit costs, the programs would need aggressive cost  containment, through such approaches as increased co-payments, reduced  provider reimbursements, and a preferred drug list. In addition, the study  noted that in states with generous drug benefits, savings from expansion  to more seniors are particularly difficult to realize because most  beneficiaries who would have avoided expensive nursing home care have  already done so.

Officials in Florida and Wisconsin expressed  concerns that their demonstration spending limits, based on fixed rates of  growth projected over 5 years, could not be adjusted to reflect  unpredictable changes in costs and enrollment growth. One study has  raised concerns about the potential effects on Medicaid seniors, noting  that as state spending approaches the limit of what the federal government  will match, states may feel pressed to reduce optional expansions of  eligibility or optional benefits.

According to one HHS official, HHS has not prescribed a standard format  for, or specific information to be provided in, either the quarterly or  annual progress reports; rather, the department works with the states to  obtain needed information.

The same HHS official told us that in  response to these general requirements, states\u2019 progress reports did not  always include all information considered useful for monitoring purposes.  For example, HHS reported that officials were working with Illinois to  obtain additional information to complete its draft annual progress report.

The department\u2019s approval of four states\u2019  demonstrations raises questions about HHS\u2019s basis for its decisions.  Because HHS based the spending limits it approved on higher-than- justified growth rates, these spending limits do not, in our view, represent  reasonable estimates of demonstration costs over the 5-year trial periods  and are not budget neutral. It was difficult to assess the reasonableness of  the spending limits themselves, given that they were decided upon through  an undocumented negotiation process, and neither public nor HHS  internal documents stated the rationale for approving higher growth rates.  We found that if HHS\u2019s benchmarks had been used to establish the  spending limits, the federal government\u2019s liability for the four  demonstrations could have been $1.6 billion lower over 5 years. Moreover,  the approved demonstrations rely on highly questionable assumptions  about the extent to which savings would accrue to Medicaid from  improved health of people receiving the new pharmacy benefit,  particularly since many of them already had pharmacy benefits through  existing state-funded programs.", "In addition, the Pharmacy Plus initiative raises important evaluation  questions about how improved access to prescription drugs may affect  seniors\u2019 health and Medicaid and Medicare costs. Although some of these  questions will likely be addressed by the independent evaluation of two  states\u2019 demonstrations, in the interim HHS does not appear to be ensuring  that states provide sufficient, consistent, and timely information for  demonstration monitoring or that states begin implementing their own  evaluation plans.

Even though HHS has developed a standard  application form for Pharmacy Plus demonstrations, that form and other  guidance does not provide written criteria for how HHS reviews and  approves the growth rates that states propose. HHS\u2019s rationale for  significantly deviating from benchmarks for projecting future program  growth in establishing different states\u2019 spending limits has not been  documented or made clear to us or to others, including other states that  may be seeking approval of demonstration proposals. Without such clarity,  questions arise as to how consistently states have been or will be treated  in applying for demonstrations. Further, in our view, Pharmacy Plus  demonstration approvals were based on questionable savings  assumptions. We believe that HHS should establish clear criteria on which  to base the spending limits and should reconsider its spending limit  decisions for the approved Pharmacy Plus demonstrations in light of such  criteria.", "HHS also commented that it was premature to evaluate the Pharmacy Plus  demonstrations given the limited experience from 12 to 18 months of  operation. HHS said that were the outcome predetermined, a  demonstration would serve no purpose. The agency believes the Pharmacy  Plus initiative provides states an opportunity to use a Medicaid  demonstration to test if providing drug coverage will prevent the aged and  disabled low-income population from becoming Medicaid eligible. HHS  noted that the four approved demonstrations together are providing drug  coverage to 346,000 seniors who would otherwise be without this  important benefit.", "We agree that it is too early to evaluate the outcomes of the 5-year  demonstrations and that section 1115 demonstrations are intended to test  new propositions. More needs to be done, however, to ensure that states\u2019  evaluations collect the information needed to determine whether those  new propositions are functioning as intended. Four states have Pharmacy  Plus demonstrations in place to test such propositions, and substantial  federal funding is involved, including costs that were previously paid for  by the states themselves. For these reasons, HHS has a responsibility to  (1) make fiscally prudent decisions in its approvals, (2) ensure that savings  hypotheses have some grounding in experience or research, and   (3) ensure that the evaluations are planned and conducted in a way that  will produce adequate information regarding the demonstrations\u2019 research  hypotheses.", "We also agree that the demonstrations can provide a valuable benefit to  low-income seniors and disabled individuals who might otherwise be  without drug coverage. But three of the four states with approved  demonstrations had state-funded drug coverage programs in place before  implementing their Pharmacy Plus demonstrations, and these state-funded  programs became eligible for federal matching funds when the  demonstrations were approved. We therefore find HHS\u2019s statement that  the demonstrations are providing drug coverage to seniors who would  otherwise be without it to be an overstatement.", "HHS also commented on how MMA may affect the operation of approved  Pharmacy Plus demonstrations and the review of pending and new  demonstration proposals. HHS stated that seniors covered by the four  Pharmacy Plus demonstrations will be able to begin receiving drug  coverage under the Medicare Part D program in January 2006, and states  will be able to use their own funds to \u201cwrap around\u201d the Medicare benefit  to assist other Medicare beneficiaries whose incomes exceed the level for  low-income subsidies. At that time, HHS believes there will be less need  for Pharmacy Plus demonstrations, given expanded Medicare coverage for  prescription drugs, and states operating the demonstrations will need to  decide if they want to continue doing so and if their demonstrations can  continue to be budget neutral. We have reviewed and incorporated this  new information as appropriate.", "HHS\u2019s written comments appear in appendix III, along with our response  to additional comments that HHS provided on the findings in our draft  report.

In its  comments, Wisconsin said that the draft report failed to consider the  significant benefits its demonstration offers to the federal government and  to seniors.", "We agree that providing a drug benefit to seniors could keep them  healthier, and we do not dispute the benefit to seniors of the states\u2019 drug  programs started or expanded through Pharmacy Plus demonstrations.  The demonstrations were approved, however, on the presumption that the  cost of each state\u2019s prescription drug program would be paid for in savings  from keeping seniors with little or no previous drug coverage healthy  enough that they would not become eligible for full Medicaid benefits.  Illinois\u2019 demonstration was approved on this presumption even though  most of the beneficiaries were already receiving some prescription drug  coverage through the state\u2019s existing state-funded program. We remain  concerned that HHS is not maintaining its policy to ensure demonstrations  are budget neutral.", "Illinois also commented that it had taken all necessary steps to conduct its  own evaluation and that it had cooperated fully with federal evaluators  and HHS officials. Illinois said that although it officially filed its quarterly  reports late, it submitted all the detailed data contained in those reports to  CMS monthly. We are principally concerned with the extent to which the  information that Illinois provided could be used to monitor whether the  demonstration was operating as intended. Its one- to two-page quarterly  reports, filed late, tallied the number of beneficiaries enrolled in the  demonstration and drug expenditures to date and provided a narrative  paragraph on accomplishments, problems, or issues. The information  itself, however, furnishes little insight as to whether the demonstration is  operating as intended or whether the benefit is reducing Medicaid costs.", "Wisconsin commented that the draft report failed to ascribe any value to  the government of Wisconsin\u2019s agreement to cap its federal Medicaid  funding for seniors as a condition of Pharmacy Plus demonstration  approval. We believe the draft report accurately captured HHS\u2019s approach  to limiting the federal liability for the Pharmacy Plus demonstrations by  establishing a \u201ccap,\u201d or spending limit, as a condition of approval. We  remain neutral on the \u201cvalue\u201d of this cap for several reasons.

Those interviews and documents, which we  discussed in the draft report, did not fully support the higher growth rates  that were approved. We note that enrollment growth rates, in particular,  can have a significant multiplier effect on future spending estimates.  Further, we note that HHS allowed at least one state to argue for a higher  growth rate using broad justifications\u2014such as the effect of the Social  Security Administration\u2019s nationwide outreach program for low-income  Medicare beneficiaries\u2014that other states could also have used but did not,  raising questions of clarity and consistency in both the process and the  final decisions.", "Documentation of HHS\u2019s approval decisions and the basis for approved  spending limits could provide a rationale for higher cost and enrollment  growth rates and offer guidance and assurance of consistent treatment to  other states applying for Pharmacy Plus demonstrations.

As noted  in the draft report, the concerns raised by HHS\u2019s approved Pharmacy Plus  demonstrations parallel those we have raised about other section 1115  waiver demonstration approvals over the past decade, including concerns  about the extent to which the department is protecting the Medicaid  program\u2019s fiscal integrity and the need for clear criteria and a public  process in reviewing and approving demonstrations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Approved Demonstrations\u2019 Evaluation and Monitoring Requirements", "paragraphs": ["HHS commented that the department plans to continue working with  states toward developing useful program evaluations based on consistent  data collection as well as sufficient, consistent, and timely monitoring  information.

Our responses to Wisconsin\u2019s specific comments are  numbered below to correspond with each of the state\u2019s numbered  comments.  1.  Wisconsin commented that our $416 million figure (the estimated  federal share of the difference between HHS-approved and benchmark  5-year spending limits in table 3) exaggerates the federal fiscal effect,  because the actual costs of the demonstration\u2019s first years have come  in under the projected costs. The state currently projects federal costs  for the new drug benefit under the demonstration totaling $250 million  over 5 years instead of roughly $537 million, which is the federal share  of $919 million approved for the new benefit (see table 1). Although we  recognize that the actual costs of Wisconsin\u2019s demonstration to date  are less than the costs projected at the time the waiver was approved,  our analysis examined the extent to which HHS ensured that the  demonstrations\u2014in the form they were approved\u2014maintained  spending limits that were budget neutral to the federal government.  Because Wisconsin\u2019s approved spending limit represents the total  amount the state is authorized to spend over the demonstration\u2019s 5- year life-span, the federal government could be liable for as much as   $416 million more than what it would have been liable for had HHS  held the state to a spending limit based on benchmark rates (see table  3).  2.  Wisconsin commented that it is unreasonable to hold HHS to applying  the lower of two benchmark growth rates in calculating budget  neutrality: state experience or projections by the Centers for Medicare  & Medicaid Services\u2019 (CMS) Actuary for Medicaid costs. The state also  expressed concern that our analysis did not incorporate factors other  than the benchmarks that affect program growth. We believe that it is  reasonable to expect HHS to use objective benchmark growth rates in  projecting the Medicaid costs on which it bases spending limits and to  document its reasons for deviating from those benchmarks\u2014even if  the department regards them as starting points. Otherwise, the  department\u2019s rationale for setting higher spending limits (based on  higher growth rates) for some states than for others is not apparent to  other states involved in waiver negotiations and reviews. As noted in  the draft report, HHS responded to Wisconsin\u2019s request for higher  growth rates but did not, in our view, adequately document the basis  for approving higher rates. In our own analysis of the spending limits,  we did not include the additional factors that Wisconsin asserted  should raise its spending limits because neither the state nor HHS  provided adequate support to justify doing so.  3.  Wisconsin stated that our interpretation was unreasonably narrow in  not accounting for potential savings accruing to Medicare, as well as to  Medicaid, from expanding prescription drug coverage for seniors. We  considered savings to Medicaid alone because HHS allows states to  include savings only to Medicaid, not Medicare, in determining  whether their Medicaid demonstrations are budget neutral.  4.  Wisconsin commented that because its historical cost growth rate has  been rising, it was appropriate for HHS to calculate the state\u2019s  spending limit using a rate higher than its historical 5-year average. We  believe that whenever HHS allows growth rate projections that exceed  its benchmarks, it should document the basis for this deviation.  5.  Wisconsin mentioned two state programs that it believes will, like the  Social Security Administration\u2019s outreach program for low-income  Medicare beneficiaries, help increase senior enrollment in Wisconsin\u2019s  Medicaid program because they are likely to identify individuals who  qualify for full Medicaid benefits. But the state did not quantify or  provide any data or other evidence to show the potential effects of  these programs or of Social Security Administration outreach. We did  not include these effects in our benchmark analysis for the same  reason we did not include other factors that Wisconsin believed should  raise is spending limit (see our response to comment 2).  6.  Wisconsin noted that we found no firm evidence to support the idea  that expanding drug coverage would produce significant savings in  Medicaid by diverting or delaying Medicaid enrollment. The state  asserts that this criticism ignores the central purpose of these  demonstrations: to determine if an important health care benefit can  be delivered cost effectively. We acknowledge the value of  demonstrations to test health care alternatives, but we believe that the  case for substantial savings to Medicaid due to expanded prescription  drug coverage is not well supported. We also believe that HHS has not  done enough to ensure that states develop and implement  demonstration evaluation designs. Although we do not dispute  Wisconsin\u2019s comment that research suggests coverage of prescription  drugs benefits seniors, we believe that demonstrating the effects of  drug coverage on avoiding Medicaid enrollment is a separate issue.  7.  Wisconsin has interpreted our mention of congressional concern about  the extent to which HHS has ensured that section 1115 demonstration  waivers promote the goals of Medicaid as implying that the state\u2019s  demonstration is not providing critical prescription drugs to a  vulnerable elderly, low-income, uninsured population. We did not  intend to suggest that Wisconsin\u2019s demonstration is not a valuable  benefit to these individuals. We were referring to our earlier work on  section 1115 Medicaid and State Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program  (SCHIP) demonstrations, which, in addition to raising concerns about  HHS\u2019s use of section 1115 waiver authority to approve demonstration  spending limits that were not budget neutral, also found that HHS was  allowing states to use unspent SCHIP funding to cover childless adults,  despite SCHIP\u2019s statutory objective of expanding health coverage to  low-income children.  8.  Wisconsin commented that we mischaracterized the growth rates  approved by HHS for the state\u2019s demonstration as too high. See our  response to comment 2.  9.  Wisconsin objected to our conclusion that the lack of available  information on how these demonstrations are operating compromises  attempts to assess whether they are operating as intended. This  statement does not apply to any one state alone but synthesizes our  findings for the four approved demonstrations taken together. We  acknowledge that Wisconsin has been responsive to HHS\u2019s  requirements for informative and timely progress reports and have  revised our report as appropriate.  10.  Wisconsin stated that its data reporting system allows its staff to  monitor that the demonstration is operating as intended. In the draft  report, we noted that Wisconsin officials reported having the capability  for monitoring. We have not assessed Wisconsin\u2019s monitoring system.  11.  Wisconsin commented on the importance of, and Wisconsin\u2019s full  participation in, CMS\u2019s contracted independent evaluation as an  effective approach to reviewing the agency\u2019s assumptions relating to  budget neutrality and program effectiveness. We believe the draft  report captured the plans for this independent evaluation, as well as  the apparent confusion over each state\u2019s responsibility for conducting  its own evaluation. We have revised our report to reflect that  Wisconsin officials believe the state is not required to conduct an  evaluation, whereas HHS officials told us the state would be required  to do so."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix VII: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition, Tim Bushfield, Ellen W.
