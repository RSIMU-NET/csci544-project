According to FDA officials, the launch  of the platform has provided the following benefits to FDA and to  stakeholders: (1) faster review times, (2) easier collaboration and  communication with industry, (3) improved application review  consistency, and (4) more predictable application review times and target  completion dates due to having all pertinent information regarding an  application in one location that is accessible to all FDA reviewers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "External Communication", "paragraphs": ["As part of FDA\u2019s GDUFA commitments to streamline the review process,  the agency took steps to change how it communicates with generic drug  applicants. According to FDA officials, prior to GDUFA, deficiency letters  were sent to applicants by specific types of reviewers within CDER\u2014such  as labeling reviewers or chemistry reviewers\u2014in an uncoordinated  fashion, making it difficult for applicants to obtain a comprehensive picture  of their application\u2019s status. Starting in fiscal year 2013, FDA committed to  consolidating all application deficiencies into one letter to the applicant,  called a complete response letter. According to FDA officials, this  systemic approach to provide a single deficiency letter was one of the  biggest changes the agency made to the review process since the  enactment of GDUFA.", "Additionally, in September 2013, OGD issued guidance that established  regulatory project managers as the central point of contact for each  application throughout its lifecycle. FDA officials said that regulatory  project managers are also responsible for overseeing the review of each  application across all disciplines. Prior to GDUFA, FDA officials said that  no one individual at the agency had responsibility for an application  throughout its entire lifecycle.", "FDA has also issued new and revised guidance documents to educate  applicants about changes to the generic drug application review process  made in response to GDUFA. According to FDA officials, since fiscal year  2013 FDA has issued 31 new and revised draft or final guidance  documents related to the application review process. Additionally, officials  said that FDA has also issued almost 600 new or revised product-specific  recommendations to assist the applicants with identifying the most  appropriate methodology for developing generic drugs and generating  evidence needed to support application approval."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "FDA Has Made Additional Refinements to Its Generic Drug Program in Response to Applicants\u2019 Concerns about Program Changes", "paragraphs": ["FDA has made additional refinements to its application review program in  response to applicant concerns about program changes. Specifically, to  provide more timely communication on individual applications, FDA  instituted a mechanism known as real time communication in late 2014.  As described above, as one of its initial changes, FDA identified all  deficiencies found in its review of an application in a single, complete  response letter to the applicant. However, applicants told us that they  found that only providing information in the complete response letters  resulted in fewer informal communication opportunities with FDA and  requested that FDA send information concerning individual application  deficiencies on a rolling basis so that they could address deficiencies in  real time. FDA acknowledged that the initial changes to how it  communicated to applicants made it harder for applicants to assess the  status of their applications and to plan the market launch of generic  medicines. To remedy applicants\u2019 concerns and to enhance the review  process by increasing transparency and decreasing the number of review  cycles, FDA implemented real-time communications\u2014specifically  \u201cinformation requests\u201d and \u201ceasily correctible deficiencies.\u201d According to  FDA officials, information requests are used by application reviewers to  informally notify applicants of any preliminary application concerns as well  as to seek resolution and clarification on some of the minor issues related  to the application. Similarly, application reviewers communicate easily  correctible deficiencies to applicants to obtain missing information that  should be readily available, to seek clarification of data already submitted,  or to request final resolution of technical issues. FDA data show that the  numbers of information requests and easily correctible deficiencies  substantially increased in the first 9 months following their inception in  early 2015 and have decreased somewhat since then, suggesting that  both FDA and applicants have found these new forms of communication  useful. (See fig. 4.)", "FDA also revised its policy outlining the roles and responsibilities of  various FDA staff in communicating with applicants during the application  review process in August 2015. FDA made this revision to address  stakeholder concerns that establishing regulatory project managers as  the primary point of contact for all communication with applicants limited  the opportunities for informal communication with FDA staff directly  responsible for reviewing applications. The revised policy expanded and  set forth responsibilities and procedures for communications between  FDA staff and applicants concerning the review status of applications.  Specifically, OGD\u2019s regulatory project managers would remain  responsible for communicating the review status of applications they  manage, including transmitting complete response letters, while discipline  project managers and Office of Pharmaceutical Quality regulatory  business process managers\u2014both of whom are more directly involved in  an application\u2019s review\u2014would be responsible for issuing all information  requests and easily correctible deficiencies. According to FDA officials,  these changes were made as part of a broader effort to bring  communications between the agency and applicants closer to \u201creal-time.\u201d", "Lastly, FDA has communicated target action dates to applicants since  2015 at the request of industry stakeholders. Target action dates are the  agency\u2019s internal deadlines for taking action on generic drug applications  pending with the agency on October 1, 2012, and those submitted in  fiscal years 2013 and 2014 (years for which there were no GDUFA  performance goals established).

We previously reported that the Food and Drug  Administration (FDA) traditionally funds regulatory science projects with  resources from the agency\u2019s regular appropriations, but projects funded  within the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) have also  been supplemented by funds collected from user fee acts, such as the  Prescription Drug User Fee Act and the Generic Drug User Fee  Amendments of 2012 (GDUFA). GDUFA funds accounted for  approximately $20 million in annual obligations for regulatory science  projects from fiscal years 2013 through 2016.", "The Office of Generic Drugs (OGD), located within CDER, established the  GDUFA Regulatory Science Research Program to support projects that  could potentially enhance the development of generic drugs. In fiscal year  2013, OGD created a list of GDUFA Regulatory Science Priorities that  includes five broad priority areas (see table 5). The list is based in part on  discussions with stakeholders during annual public meetings on GDUFA  and in part on stakeholder comments to FDA\u2019s GDUFA regulatory  science funding announcements. However, generic drug industry  stakeholders have raised concerns about the need for more meaningful  scientific dialogue about FDA\u2019s requirements for the development of  generic drugs, and for more clarity on how the agency develops its  regulatory science priorities list. FDA officials we interviewed were  cognizant of stakeholders\u2019 concerns and noted that they have  reconsidered the five broad categories each year. However, officials told  us they have not made changes to the priority areas since they were  established in fiscal year 2013 and do not envision annual changes to the  broad categories, though the sub-priority areas in each category have  been revised from year to year. The officials acknowledged that while  some information about their process for judging the merit of regulatory  science proposals is public, details about how proposals are scored is not  public in order to promote a process whereby applications submitted are  evaluated free of bias from stakeholders. The officials explained that the  priorities list is created internally at FDA in part to protect the privacy of  applicants that submitted proposals, to avoid potential conflicts of interest  from stakeholders who may want to steer research away from  competitors, and to incorporate internal FDA capabilities to conduct  research at lower costs. Although the officials said that decisions about  which projects to fund is an inherently governmental function and should  be made internally to support public health, they noted plans to improve  communications with industry about the priorities list and plan to more  clearly announce the sub-priority areas available for research on the OGD  webpage.", "In the first 4 years following GDUFA\u2019s implementation, OGD obligated a  cumulative amount of about $77 million from generic drug user fee  collections for 103 regulatory science projects. Data provided by FDA  showed that 15 of these projects supported research into post-market  evaluation of generic drugs, 30 projects supported the equivalence of  complex drug products, 20 projects supported the equivalence of locally  acting products, 20 supported therapeutic equivalence evaluation and  standards, and 18 supported cross-cutting computational and analytical  tools. Obligations from user fees for regulatory science projects remained  relatively stable each year, from a low of $16 million in fiscal year 2016 to  a high of $24 million in fiscal year 2015.
