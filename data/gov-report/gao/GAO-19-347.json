IDR plans base monthly payments on a borrower's income and family size, extend repayment periods from the standard 10 years to up to 25 years, and forgive remaining balances at the end of that period.", "Zero income. About 95,100 IDR plans were held by borrowers who reported zero income yet potentially earned enough wages to make monthly student loan payments. This analysis is based on wage data from the National Directory of New Hires (NDNH), a federal dataset that contains quarterly wage data for newly hired and existing employees. According to GAO's analysis, 34 percent of these plans were held by borrowers who had estimated annual wages of $45,000 or more, including some with estimated annual wages of $100,000 or more. Borrowers with these 95,100 IDR plans owed nearly $4 billion in outstanding Direct Loans as of September 2017.", "Family size. About 40,900 IDR plans were approved based on family sizes of nine or more, which were atypical for IDR plans. Almost 1,200 of these 40,900 plans were approved based on family sizes of 16 or more, including two plans for different borrowers that were approved using a family size of 93. Borrowers with atypical family sizes of nine or more owed almost $2.1 billion in outstanding Direct Loans as of September 2017.", "These results indicate some borrowers may have misrepresented or erroneously reported their income or family size. Because income and family size are used to determine IDR monthly payments, fraud or errors in this information can result in the Department of Education (Education) losing thousands of dollars of loan repayments per borrower each year and potentially increasing the ultimate cost of loan forgiveness. Where appropriate, GAO is referring these results to Education for further investigation.", "Weaknesses in Education's processes to verify borrowers' income and family size information limit its ability to detect potential fraud or error in IDR plans. While borrowers applying for IDR plans must provide proof of taxable income, such as tax returns or pay stubs, Education generally accepts borrower reports of zero income and borrower reports of family size without verifying the information. Although Education does not currently have access to federal sources of data to verify borrower reports of zero income, the department could pursue such access or obtain private data sources for this purpose. In addition, Education has not systematically implemented other data analytic practices, such as using data it already has to detect anomalies in income and family size that may indicate potential fraud or error. Although data matching and analytic practices may not be sufficient to detect fraud or error, combining them with follow-up procedures to verify information on IDR applications could help Education reduce the risk of using fraudulent or erroneous information to calculate monthly loan payments, and better protect the federal investment in student loans."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that Education (1) obtain data to verify income information for borrowers who report zero income on IDR plan applications, (2) implement data analytic practices and follow-up procedures to verify borrower reports of zero income, and (3) implement data analytic practices and follow-up procedures to verify borrowers' family size.

For  these matches, we estimated whether the borrowers may have had  sufficient annual wages to warrant monthly student loan payments greater  than zero dollars. For detailed information about how we performed our  match, estimated borrowers\u2019 annual wages, and limitations to our  approach, see appendix I.

Unlike Standard, Graduated, and Extended  repayment plans, IDR plans offer loan forgiveness at the end of the  repayment period and monthly payments may be as low as $0 for some  borrowers.", "There are a variety of IDR plans, and these plans have differences in  eligibility requirements, how monthly payment amounts are calculated,  and repayment periods before potential loan forgiveness (see table 1)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Application Process for Income-Driven Repayment Plans", "paragraphs": ["To participate in an IDR plan, borrowers must submit an application to  their loan servicer that, among other things, includes information about  their income, marital status, and family size (see table 2).", "According to Education, Education\u2019s loan servicers review the information  borrowers submit on their IDR applications to determine if borrowers are  eligible for IDR plans. If the servicer determines that a borrower is eligible,  it enrolls the borrower in an IDR plan and calculates the borrower\u2019s  monthly payment amount. To continue making monthly payment  amounts based on income and family size, IDR borrowers must annually  submit the IDR application form certifying their income and family size,  which servicers then use to update monthly payment amounts. If a  borrower\u2019s income changes significantly prior to the borrower\u2019s annual  recertification date, the borrower can use the same application form to  request a recalculation of the monthly payment amount (see fig. 1).

However, we cannot determine whether fraud occurred through  data matching alone. Where appropriate, we are referring these results to  Education for further investigation. Among the 76,200 borrowers in our  data matching results, it is possible that some accurately reported zero  income even though they had wages reported in NDNH in the same  quarter in which their IDR application was approved. For example, a  borrower may have earned wages at the start or end of a quarter, but was  not earning wages at the time of submitting the IDR application.  Conversely, our analysis cannot identify borrowers who may have earned  additional taxable income that is not part of NDNH data, but should be  included on IDR applications, such as income for individuals who are self- employed or receiving alimony. Regarding the potential for error,  officials from Education and all four loan servicers we spoke with stated  that it is possible that borrowers could incorrectly report that they had no  taxable income. Officials from Education said, for example, that borrowers  may misunderstand the question about taxable income on the IDR  application, and one loan servicer, echoing this perspective, stated that  some borrowers may mistakenly think that some of their income is  nontaxable when it is in fact taxable.", "To examine how borrowers\u2019 failure to report their income could affect the  amount repaid to Education over the course of a year, we used  Education\u2019s online repayment estimator to illustrate how much  hypothetical borrowers with different annual adjusted gross incomes  would expect to pay under each IDR plan (see fig. 3). If a borrower at  one of these income levels instead reported zero income on the IDR  application, Education could lose thousands of dollars per borrower each  year in student loan payments.

For example, officials  from Education and one loan servicer said borrowers sometimes report  inaccurate family sizes if they are confused about who to count as a  member of their family. Officials from this loan servicer told us that a  borrower initially applied for an IDR plan claiming a family size of five\u2014 himself and four other family members who were not his spouse or  children. They said that during a subsequent phone call with loan servicer  staff about the borrower\u2019s loan, the borrower volunteered that the other  members of his family did not live with him, meaning that for IDR  purposes, he had a family size of one. It is unclear whether this  borrower may have misrepresented his family size to receive a lower  monthly payment or did not understand the definition and reported it in  error. In regards to loan servicer error, Education officials said that  servicers may make mistakes when entering family sizes from paper  applications into their computer systems or when determining the total  family size because borrowers provide information on family members in  up to three places on the application.", "To examine the effect of family size on monthly payment amounts in IDR  plans, we used Education\u2019s online repayment estimator to illustrate how  much hypothetical borrowers with the same income but different family  sizes would be expected to pay each month under certain IDR plans.

If  this borrower instead reported a family size of two people, the monthly  payment amount would decrease by $54, to $128. For each additional  person, the monthly payment would decrease by $54.

Officials from Education and all four loan  servicers we spoke with said that servicers are generally instructed to  take these self-attestations at face value. However, Education has limited,  voluntary procedures for reviewing family size information submitted by  borrowers.", "In 2016, Education implemented a voluntary procedure for loan  servicers to contact borrowers who report changes in family size of  four or more from one year to the next in order to verify the accuracy  of the most recently reported family size.

Officials said that this  process is to ensure that family size data were accurately transferred  from servicers to Education. Borrowers are not contacted for  verification of the information itself.", "Officials from Education and three of the four loan servicers we spoke  with acknowledged that IDR plans are at risk for fraud or error because  verification is generally not performed on borrower reports of zero income  and borrower reports of family size. Officials from Education and two of  the loan servicers also said that certain program requirements discourage  borrowers from providing false information. For example, borrowers are  required to sign the IDR form to certify that all provided information is  true, complete, and correct, and the form warns borrowers that false  statements or misrepresentations are subject to penalties including fines,  imprisonment, or both. However, the extent to which this requirement  may serve as a deterrent is unknown because Education has not  assessed the risk of fraudulent reports on IDR applications. Moreover,  Education officials told us that they were not aware of any IDR borrowers  being investigated or facing penalties for providing false information on  the IDR application. Officials from one loan servicer also said that  borrowers may be deterred from falsely claiming zero income or  misrepresenting their family size because they assume that servicers,  acting on behalf of the government, can check the information on IDR  applications. However, it is also possible that borrowers would assume  that this self-reported information would not be routinely verified because  the only documentation requirements discussed on the application relate  to verifying taxable income.", "Education officials also said that the risk of borrowers providing  inaccurate information on IDR applications must be balanced against the  impact of adding verification procedures. They said additional procedures  could make the already complex IDR application process more  burdensome for borrowers to navigate and result in longer application  processing times. While it is important to make IDR plans accessible to  borrowers who could benefit from them, it is also important that Education  design internal control activities to achieve program objectives and  respond to risks, including addressing the risk of fraud and error in  borrower self-reported information.", "GAO\u2019s Fraud Risk Framework describes the importance of developing  procedures for preventing, detecting, and responding to the risk of fraud  in government programs.  The risk of fraud exists when there is  opportunity and incentive to commit it. The lack of verification of borrower  reports of zero income and limited verification of borrower reports of  family size on IDR applications creates the opportunity for borrowers to  commit fraud. Because lower income and larger family sizes can reduce  borrowers\u2019 monthly payment amounts and, by extension, possibly  increase the amount of loan debt forgiven at the end of their repayment  periods, there is also an incentive for some borrowers to commit fraud. In  regard to error, federal internal control standards state that agencies  should obtain information from reliable sources that are reasonably free  from error. Education officials and all four loan servicers told us that  borrower-reports of family size or zero income can be susceptible to error  if, for example, borrowers misunderstand the definitions of these items on  IDR applications.", "Addressing the risk of fraud and error would also help to minimize the  costs associated with IDR plans that are passed on to the government  and taxpayers. As more borrowers enter IDR plans, the costs of these  plans\u2014including loan forgiveness\u2014increase for the government and  taxpayers. Using data underlying the President\u2019s fiscal year 2017 budget  request, GAO previously reported that Education estimated Direct Loans  repaid with IDR plans would cost the federal government about $74 billon  over their repayment periods. In its fiscal year 2015-2019 strategic plan  for Federal Student Aid, Education acknowledged that as IDR plans  continue to grow in popularity, the cost of loan forgiveness could be a  major issue for the federal government.

Federal internal control standards call  for agency management officials to identify, analyze, and respond to risks  related to achieving program objectives, such as the risk of using  potentially fraudulent or erroneous information about borrowers to  calculate monthly payment amounts for student loans. Approaches,  such as using data analytic practices and follow-up procedures, can help  identify and address these risks. Two data analytic practices that can help  identify such risks with respect to IDR plans are (1) anomaly detection to  identify atypical or unusual information about borrowers and (2) data  matching with outside data sources to verify information that borrowers  provide. These practices, which can be used on their own or together,  can help prevent fraud from occurring and detect potential fraud or error  that may have occurred. Because data analytics alone may not be  sufficient to determine whether fraud or error has occurred, follow-up  procedures can then be used in the investigation and verification to make  such determinations.", "A leading practice in data analytics in GAO\u2019s Fraud Risk Framework is  conducting data mining to identify suspicious activity or transactions,  including anomalies, outliers, and other red flags in the data. Similar to  our family size analysis, borrower-reported family sizes above a certain  threshold on IDR applications could be flagged in loan servicers\u2019 and  Education\u2019s data systems for further verification. Anomaly detection is  used to a limited extent to identify errors in family size on IDR plans by  one loan servicer and by Education. According to officials at Education  and all four loan servicers we spoke with, anomaly detection is not used  to systematically identify potentially fraudulent reports of family size.", "Anomaly detection can also identify deviations from expected patterns in  data over time. Because IDR borrowers are required to fill out  applications annually, it would be possible to develop automated queries  to look for unusual patterns in borrower-reported income and family size  from one year to the next. Officials from Education and servicers  described several patterns across applications that could indicate  potential fraud, specifically large swings in income from one year to the  next, reporting zero income for multiple years, and having a large family  size, but relatively low income.", "Another leading practice for data analytics in GAO\u2019s Fraud Risk  Framework is conducting data matching to verify key information,  including self-reported data and information necessary to determine  eligibility. The results of our analysis illustrate the usefulness of this  technique to identify potential inconsistencies in the income information  on IDR plans. Education does not have authority to access wage data  from HHS\u2019s NDNH or income data from the Internal Revenue Service  (IRS) for the purpose of verifying IDR borrowers\u2019 income information  through data matching. However, private data sources are also available  for data matching. We reported in 2016 on the benefits of government  agencies using private data to address the risk of fraud. Moreover,  some state agencies (such as those administering the Supplemental  Nutrition Assistance Programs) use a private, commercial verification  service known as The Work Number\u00ae to help determine eligibility for  government assistance. We reported in 2016 that 45 states used  income information from The Work Number to help determine eligibility for  food assistance benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance  Program.", "Education may also be able to draw on follow-up procedures it has in  place for verifying information submitted by students and their families  when applying for federal student aid using the Free Application for  Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Education uses a process called  \u201cverification\u201d to help identify and correct erroneous or missing information  on the application to aid the department\u2019s efforts to reduce improper  payments of federal student aid. Each award year, a portion of FAFSA  applications are selected for verification, and schools are required to work  with the selected applicants to obtain documentation and confirm the  accuracy of information provided on these applications. When selecting  FAFSAs for verification, Education aims to select those applications with  the highest statistical probability of error and the greatest impact of such  error on award amounts. FAFSA applicants who are selected to verify their income for the 2018-2019 or 2019-2020 award years may provide a  signed copy of their prior years\u2019 tax returns. FAFSA applicants may also  obtain documentation from the IRS through the IRS Data Retrieval Tool,  an IRS tax return transcript, or an IRS Verification of Non-filing Letter.  FAFSA applicants selected to verify their household size must provide a  signed statement that provides the name, age, and relationship to the  student of each person in the household.", "For IDR plans, Education could implement follow-up procedures for IDR  applications it identifies as at risk for fraud or error and seek additional  documentation from borrowers. For example, to verify reports of no  income, borrowers could be asked to provide an IRS Verification of Non- filing Letter, documentation that the borrower recently lost a job, or  documentation that shows income the borrower receives is nontaxable,  such as public assistance benefits. To verify family size, as is the case  with FAFSA verification, borrowers could be asked to provide a signed  statement with the names, ages, and relationship to the borrower of each  family member. Another option might be to request that borrowers  provide documentation showing that family members (other than the  borrower\u2019s spouse and children) receive mail at the borrower\u2019s address  as well as documentation of the financial support provided by the  borrower. Such follow-up procedures would be consistent with federal  internal control standards advising managers to design control activities  to achieve program objectives and respond to risks."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["While Income-Driven Repayment plans can help borrowers with limited  incomes afford their monthly student loan payments, these plans can also  result in high costs to the federal government and taxpayers. To minimize  these costs, it is important that Education accurately determine monthly  payment amounts under its IDR plans. Because these determinations are  based on income and family size information that borrowers self-report,  there is risk for potential fraud or error. Our data matching analysis  showed, for example, that tens of thousands of borrowers who were not  making monthly loan payments because they reported zero income on  IDR applications may have had enough income to do so. Where  appropriate, we are referring these borrowers to Education for further  investigation. In addition, an increase in family size can cause a  borrower\u2019s payments to decrease, creating a potential incentive for fraud,  and our analysis found atypically large family sizes that are generally not  verified by Education. The results of our analyses highlight the risk for  fraud or error, as well as weaknesses in Education\u2019s procedures. In turn,  the weaknesses we identified raise questions about the strength of  Education\u2019s institutional oversight of a major program involving hundreds  of billions of dollars. The fact that, cumulatively, the borrowers and their  plans we reviewed owed over $6 billion in loans helps illustrate the risk of  potential financial loss for the government from fraud or error absent  comprehensive oversight.", "It is important for Education to take steps to obtain data to verify borrower  reports of zero income and to implement other data analytic practices and  follow-up procedures for verifying borrower-reported information. Such  actions would help ensure that (1) IDR payment amounts are based on  information that accurately represents a borrower\u2019s situation and is free  from fraud and error; and (2) the federal government\u2019s fiscal exposure to  IDR loans is safeguarded from the risk of loss. Implementing data analytic  practices and follow-up procedures to review and verify borrower reports  of zero income could help deter borrowers from inaccurately reporting  zero income and detect those who have done so, either fraudulently or in  error. Similarly, implementing practices and procedures to review and  verify reported family sizes could further stem potential fraud or error.  Without such changes, IDR plans will remain vulnerable to fraud and  error, potentially raising program costs for the federal government and  taxpayers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making the following three recommendations to Education\u2019s  Federal Student Aid office:  The Chief Operating Officer of Federal Student Aid should obtain data in  order to verify income information for borrowers reporting zero income on  IDR applications.

(Recommendation 1)", "The Chief Operating Officer of Federal Student Aid should implement  data analytic practices, such as data matching, and follow-up procedures  to review and verify that borrowers reporting zero income on IDR  applications do not have sources of taxable income at the time of their  application. (Recommendation 2)", "The Chief Operating Officer of Federal Student Aid should implement  data analytic practices, such as data mining, and follow-up procedures to  review and verify family size entries in IDR borrower applications.

Loan servicers provided technical comments,  which we addressed as appropriate.", "Education generally agreed with our recommendations, stating that it  plans to implement significant additional verification policies to ensure  that borrowers who participate in IDR plans do not misrepresent their  income or family size to the department.", "While Education agreed with our recommendation to obtain data in order  to verify income for borrowers reporting zero income, it suggested that  GAO may wish to convert this recommendation to a Matter for  Congressional Consideration to provide Education with access to IRS  data. In its response, Education stated that the President\u2019s fiscal year  2020 budget request includes a proposal that Congress pass legislation  allowing the IRS to disclose tax return information directly to the  department for the purpose of administering certain federal student  financial aid programs. According to Education, such legislation, if  enacted, would allow borrowers to more easily certify their income on an  annual basis to maintain enrollment in IDR plans, and allow the  department to use the information to mitigate improper payments to  borrowers as a result of misreported income data. Education also stated  that in the meantime, it would explore whether commercially available  data are sufficient in terms of scope, reliability, and cost effectiveness.  Given that there are existing actions Education can take to implement our  recommendation, we believe our recommendation is appropriate.  Moreover, we believe that Education is best positioned to determine  whether the proposal, if enacted, would address our recommendation, or  if it would need to be expanded or modified in order to do so.", "Regarding our second recommendation, Education stated that it would  develop data analytic practices to verify borrower reports of zero income  contingent upon the enactment of legislation providing the department  with access to federal income data. However, implementing our  recommendation does not necessarily require Education to wait for such  legislation. Our draft report describes data analytic practices, such as  anomaly detection, which Education could implement using its own data  to identify deviations from expected patterns in data over time. Education  also stated that it plans to develop additional follow-up procedures to  verify borrower reports of zero income, such as requiring borrowers to  substantiate reports of zero income with appropriate documentation. In  addition, Education described plans to formalize procedures to make  referrals to Education\u2019s Office of Inspector General or the Department of  Justice for suspected cases of IDR fraud.  We encourage Education to  combine its follow-up procedures with data analytic practices to satisfy  the recommendation.", "Education agreed with our third recommendation to implement data  analytic practices and follow-up procedures to verify family size, noting  that this information could be subject to misrepresentation or erroneous  reporting by borrowers. Education stated that it would review various data  points that can be used to select IDR applications and certifications for  additional review prior to approval, such as providing more scrutiny when  borrowers report unusual increases in family size from one year to the  next. Education also stated that it plans to formalize additional procedures  to require certain borrowers to substantiate their family size.

We selected these  loan servicers because, at the time of our analysis, together they serviced  96 percent of the outstanding balance of loans being repaid with IDR  plans as of September 2017. We also interviewed Education officials  from Federal Student Aid, the office responsible for developing policies  and procedures for administering IDR plans and overseeing how loan  servicers carry them out, as well as the officials from the selected loan  servicers. Additionally, we reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations  and Education\u2019s procedures for verifying information on the Free  Application for Federal Student Aid. We assessed Education\u2019s  procedures against federal standards for internal control for developing  sufficient control activities, risk assessment, and information and  communication. We also assessed Education\u2019s procedures against the  leading practices for data analytics activities in GAO\u2019s Framework for  Managing Fraud Risks in Federal Programs.", "To determine whether there were indicators of potential fraud or error in  borrowers\u2019 income and family size information on IDR plans, we obtained  data from Education\u2019s Enterprise Data Warehouse and Analytics (EDWA)  database on borrowers with William D. Ford Federal Direct Loans (Direct  Loans) and IDR plans approved between January 1, 2016 and  September 30, 2017, the most recent data available at the time of our analysis. EDWA is a centralized data warehouse that contains  administrative data reported by loan servicers on IDR borrowers and their  loans. Some borrowers had multiple approved IDR plans in the data we  analyzed. We also obtained national quarterly wage data from the U.S.  Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 (HHS) National Directory of  New Hires (NDNH) for the same time period. NDNH is a national  repository of information reported by employers, states, and federal  agencies. The NDNH is maintained and used by HHS for the federal child  support enforcement program, which assists states in locating parents  and enforcing child support orders. In addition to information on newly  hired employees, NDNH contains (1) data on quarterly wages for existing  employees, collected and reported by state workforce agencies and  federal agencies; and (2) data on all individuals who apply for or received  unemployment compensation, as maintained and reported by state  workforce agencies.", "For our analysis of borrower-reported incomes, we matched  approximately 656,600 Education borrowers to NDNH quarterly wage  data to determine if any borrowers who reported zero income on their IDR  applications had wages reported in the same quarter in which their IDR  plans were approved. We took additional steps to further review and  refine these matches and provide reasonable assurance that the NDNH  wage data were associated with the correct borrower by comparing (1)  the borrower\u2019s state of residence as reported in the Education data to the  state agency submitting the NDNH wage data and (2) the borrower\u2019s  name as reported in the Education data to the employee name reported  in the NDNH data. For the refined matches, we then estimated whether  the borrowers may have had sufficient annual wages based on wages  reported in NDNH to potentially warrant monthly student loan payments  greater than zero dollars on their associated IDR plan. Specifically, we  aggregated all NDNH wages reported for the borrower in the quarter in  which their IDR plan was approved to determine a total quarterly wage  amount. We then multiplied the total quarterly wage amount by four\u2014the  number of quarters in a calendar year\u2014to generate an estimate of annual  wages for the borrower. Our approach was based on the methodology  Education instructs loan servicers to use to calculate annual wages when  borrowers provide an alternative to a tax return to document their income  on IDR applications. This methodology may understate or overstate  income given that borrowers may not have earned the same amount in  each of the four quarters. Our estimates of annual wages are based on  the wages reported in NDNH for each borrower and do not take into  account any pre-tax deductions that may apply when determining IDR  payments. Our estimates of annual wages also do not include borrowers\u2019  spousal income or any other taxable income for the borrower that is not  included in the NDNH quarterly wage data\u2014such as unemployment  compensation received or unearned income such as alimony. We did not  independently verify the wages reported in NDNH or the actual total  annual income earned by borrowers identified in our match, as this was  outside the scope of our review.", "Using the estimated annual wage, we then determined whether a  borrower would have had a monthly payment greater than zero by using  Education\u2019s IDR plan repayment calculations for each IDR plan. To  calculate the monthly payment, we used (1) the estimated annual wage  from our NDNH data analysis; (2) the family size reported on the  borrower\u2019s approved IDR plan; (3) the borrower\u2019s approved IDR plan  type; and (4) the relevant percentage of the HHS poverty guideline  amount for the borrower\u2019s family size, state of residence, IDR plan  approval year, and IDR plan type. For borrowers on Income-Based  Repayment, New Income-Based Repayment, Pay As You Earn, and  Revised Pay As You Earn plans, we rounded all calculated monthly  payments that were less than $5 down to zero, in accordance with  Education\u2019s repayment calculations. We then identified which borrowers  had calculated payments that were greater than zero. We did not  determine the actual repayment amount borrowers may have had, as this  was outside the scope of our review. Finally, for borrowers for whom we  had calculated a payment greater than zero, we determined the total  outstanding Direct Loan balance (principal and accrued interest) as of  September 2017, based on EDWA data.", "For our analysis of borrower-reported family sizes, we analyzed the  overall distribution of family sizes reported on approximately 5 million  approved IDR plans. We reviewed the percentile distribution for family  size on all IDR plans in our analysis and identified those in the top 1  percent of the data\u2014in this case, IDR plans that had a reported family  size of nine or more. We defined these IDR plans as having atypical  family sizes for the Education data. We did not independently verify the  family size reported on the IDR plans. For the borrowers with family sizes  of nine or more, we determined the total outstanding Direct Loan balance  (principal and accrued interest) as of September 2017.", "To examine the effects of borrowers inaccurately reporting income and  family size on loan payment amounts, we analyzed the estimated monthly  loan payment amounts for various hypothetical repayment scenarios from  Education\u2019s online repayment estimator as of January 2019, which used  the 2018 HHS poverty guidelines. To examine the effect of various family  sizes on loan payment amounts, we assumed a hypothetical borrower  lived in the continental United States; had an adjusted gross income of  $40,000; an outstanding Direct Loan balance of $30,000 (close to the  average outstanding Direct Loan balance of $33,600 as of September  2018); and an interest rate of 5.1 percent (the Direct Loan 2018-2019  interest rate for an undergraduate borrower). To examine the effect of  various incomes on monthly payment amounts, we assumed hypothetical  borrowers had adjusted gross incomes based on estimated annual wages  common in our data matching analysis ($30,000, $45,000, and $60,000),  a family size of one (meaning just the borrower), and lived in the  continental United States. For this analysis, we also assumed  hypothetical borrowers had an interest rate of 5.1 percent and an  outstanding Direct Loan balance of $50,000, which we selected to be high  enough to qualify these hypothetical borrowers for all IDR plans at each  of the selected income levels.", "To assess the reliability of the EDWA data, we reviewed documents  related to the database and Education loan data generally; interviewed  knowledgeable Education officials; performed electronic testing to  determine the validity of specific data elements that we used to perform  our work; compared the data we received to published Education data on  the number of IDR borrowers and amount of their outstanding loans; and  compared borrowers\u2019 personal information to the Social Security  Administration\u2019s Enumeration Verification System to identify borrowers  whose information may not have been accurate. As part of our reliability  assessment of the EDWA data, we selected a nongeneralizable sample  of 16 borrowers and their IDR plan and loan information from the EDWA  data to compare against four selected loan servicers\u2019 records.  Specifically, we stratified borrowers into two groups based on common  and potentially outlying incomes and family sizes in the EDWA data. We  then randomly selected two borrowers from each stratum for each of the  four selected loan servicers (a total of four borrowers per loan servicer).  We reviewed all IDR plan data in our scope for each selected borrower,  including the plan type, family size, income, and total monthly payment.  We did not review original documents, such as the IDR applications or  documentation of income. We discussed the results of our review with  knowledgeable Education and loan servicer officials to gain additional  understanding of each selected borrower\u2019s IDR plan information as well  as any differences between EDWA and loan servicer data.", "We originally obtained EDWA data on approximately 6.5 million IDR plans  approved between January 1, 2016 and September 30, 2017 that were  held by almost 4.8 million Direct Loan borrowers. Based on data reliability  issues we identified during our review, we had to limit the scope of our  analysis to a subset of EDWA data that we determined were sufficiently  reliable for our purposes. Education officials disclosed issues that  impacted the IDR plan data reported to Education by one of its loan  servicers. Specifically, Education and the loan servicer had identified  instances where the loan servicer\u2019s internal data were changed for valid  reasons but the changes were not reported to Education correctly. As a  result, we excluded data reported by this servicer from all analyses in our  report. We also identified issues with monthly payment amounts for some  borrowers in the EDWA data. Accordingly, we limited our borrower- reported income analysis to borrowers who reported zero income and had  a scheduled monthly payment of zero dollars. Ultimately, we analyzed  about 878,500 IDR plans held by about 656,600 borrowers for our income  analysis and approximately 5 million IDR plans held by 3.5 million  borrowers for our family size analysis. Consequently, our overall income  and family size analyses results may be understated and are not  generalizable to all IDR plans and borrowers.", "Consistent with our report scope, our analyses of borrower-reported  income focused on identifying indications of potential fraud or error;  however, our analyses do not show that fraud or error occurred. It is not  possible to determine whether fraud or error occurred through data  matching alone. As previously discussed, our estimates of annual wages  are based on the NDNH quarterly wage data, and do not take into  account any deductions that may be applicable for determining adjusted  gross income, which is used to determine IDR plan payment amounts. As  a result, our estimates could overstate borrowers\u2019 incomes for IDR plan  purposes. Additionally, wages are reported in NDNH quarterly, so we are  not able to determine when in a quarter a borrower earned wages. For  example, a borrower may have earned wages at the start or end of a  quarter, but was not earning wages at the time of submitting the IDR  application. Because borrowers are only required to certify their income  annually, such a scenario would not constitute fraud or error even though  it would result in a match in our analysis. In addition, our use of  Education\u2019s methodology to annualize wages based on quarterly wages  may understate or overstate income if a borrower did not earn wages at  the same level over the entire year. We are also not able to identify  additional taxable income that is not reported to NDNH but should have  been included on borrowers\u2019 IDR applications, which could understate  borrowers\u2019 incomes. Consequently, our analysis may overstate or  understate the number of borrowers who reported no income on their IDR  application yet may have had sufficient wages to warrant a monthly  student loan payment.", "To assess the reliability of the NDNH data, we reviewed documents  related to the database, interviewed knowledgeable HHS officials, and  performed electronic testing to determine the validity of specific data  elements in the NDNH data that we used to perform our work.
