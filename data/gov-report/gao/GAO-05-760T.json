CDC works with its international partners to improve global  surveillance for influenza. For example, CDC participates in international  disease and laboratory surveillance sponsored by WHO. Also, when  concerns were raised over recent influenza seasons that the avian  influenza A (H5N1) could become the next influenza pandemic, CDC led a  variety of efforts with its international partners to plan for and address  threats of increased influenza activity worldwide. For example, CDC  worked collaboratively with WHO to conduct investigations of avian  influenza A in Vietnam and to provide laboratory testing. CDC also  provided training assistance and has implemented an initiative to improve  influenza surveillance in Asia.", "CDC also supports several domestic initiatives to improve surveillance  capabilities for influenza. For example, CDC supports enhanced influenza  surveillance activities through its Epidemiology and Laboratory Capacity  (ELC) Grants. Established in 1997, this program provides funding to state  and local influenza programs. Grants have steadily increased from the first  awards in 1997, when less than $100,000 was provided to five states  through August 2004, with funding totaling more than $2 million being  given to about 47 states or major metropolitan areas. States and cities  receiving ELC-influenza funding are encouraged to achieve three  highlighted influenza epidemiology and laboratory surveillance capacities:  sentinel physician surveillance, viral isolation and subtyping, and year- round surveillance. Each state targets funding to meet one or more of  these three priorities and uses funding for support of improvements that  include the assignment or hiring of an influenza coordinator, recruitment  of sentinel physicians to collect influenza specimens and report influenza- like illness to the state, laboratory infrastructure enhancements to  increase influenza testing capabilities for viral isolation and subtyping, and  expansion of influenza surveillance activities to year-round.", "In an effort to enhance the ability to detect infectious disease outbreaks,  particularly in their early stages, federal funding has supported state  efforts to implement numerous syndromic surveillance systems. These  systems collect information on syndromes from a variety of sources. For  example, the National Retail Data Monitor (NRDM) collects data from  retail sources instead of hospitals. As of February 2004, NRDM collected  sales data from about 19,000 stores, including pharmacies, in order to  monitor sales patterns in such items as over-the-counter influenza  medications for signs of a developing infectious disease outbreak.", "CDC is taking steps to enhance its two public health communications  systems, the Health Alert Network (HAN) and the Epidemic Information  Exchange (Epi-X), which are used in disease surveillance and response  efforts. For example, CDC is working to increase the number of HAN  participants who receive assistance with their communication capacities.  In addition, following reports of human deaths from avian influenza A in  Vietnam in August 2004, CDC issued a HAN message reiterating criteria for  domestic surveillance, diagnostic evaluation, and infection control  precautions. CDC also issued detailed laboratory testing procedures for  avian influenza through HAN. Similarly, CDC has expanded Epi-X by  giving officials at other federal agencies and departments, such as DOD,  the ability to use the system. CDC is also adding users to Epi-X from local  health departments, giving access to CDC staff in other countries, and  making the system available to Field Epidemiology Training Programs  (FETP) located in 21 countries. Finally, CDC is facilitating Epi-X\u2019s  interface with other data sources by allowing users to access the Global  Public Health Intelligence Network (GPHIN), the system that searches  Web-based media for information on infectious disease outbreaks  worldwide.", "In addition to the efforts to enhance communication systems, federal  public health officials also have enhanced federal coordination for  zoonotic disease surveillance and expanded training programs. According  to CDC, nearly 70 percent of emerging infectious disease episodes during  the past 10 years have been zoonotic diseases. Moreover, recent outbreaks  of human disease caused by avian influenza strains in Asia and Europe  highlight the potential for new strains to be introduced into the  population. Surveillance for zoonotic diseases requires collaboration  between animal and human disease specialists. CDC, USDA, and FDA have  made efforts to enhance their coordination of zoonotic disease  surveillance. For example, CDC and UDSA are working with two national  laboratory associations to add veterinary diagnostic laboratories to the  Laboratory Response Network (LRN). As of May 2004, 10 veterinary  laboratories had been added to LRN, and CDC officials told us that they  had plans to add more veterinary laboratories in the future. In addition,  CDC officials told us the agency has appointed a staff person whose  responsibility, in part, is to assist in finding ways to enhance zoonotic  disease coordination efforts among federal agencies and departments and  with other organizations. This person is helping CDC develop a working  group of officials from CDC, USDA, and FDA to coordinate zoonotic  disease surveillance. According to CDC officials, the goal of this working  group is to explore ways to link existing surveillance systems to better  coordinate and integrate surveillance for wildlife, domestic animal, and  human diseases. CDC officials also said that the agency is exploring the  feasibility of a pilot project to demonstrate this proposed integrated  zoonotic disease surveillance system. In addition, USDA officials told us  that they hired 23 wildlife biologists in fall 2003 to coordinate disease  surveillance, monitoring, and management activities among USDA, CDC,  states, and other federal agencies. While each of these initiatives is  intended to enhance the surveillance of zoonotic diseases, each is still in  the planning stage or the very early stages of implementation.", "USDA also conducts influenza surveillance in domestic animals.  Coordination with USDA is important because a pandemic strain is likely  to arise from genetic mixing of animal and human influenza viruses.  Recent outbreaks in domestic poultry in Asia and Europe associated with  cases of human disease highlight the importance of coordinating  surveillance activities. Surveillance for influenza viruses in poultry in the  United States has increased substantially since the outbreak of highly  pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in Pennsylvania and surrounding states  in 1983 and 1984.

However, as of  May 23, 2005, this document remained in draft form. Further, although the  plan is comprehensive in scope, it leaves many important decisions  unresolved about the purchase, distribution, and administration of  vaccines.

When one manufacturer\u2019s production is  affected, providers who order vaccine from that manufacturer can  experience shortages, while providers who receive supplies from another  manufacturer may have all the vaccine they need. The allocation plan CDC  developed for this past season\u2019s shortage was dependent upon voluntary  compliance by the private sector and individuals to forgo vaccination.  Most annual influenza vaccine distribution and administration are  accomplished within the private sector, with relatively small amounts of  vaccine purchased and distributed by CDC or by state and local health  departments. In the United States, 85 percent of vaccine doses are  purchased by the private sector, such as private physicians and  pharmacies. HHS has not yet determined how influenza vaccine will be  distributed and administered during an influenza pandemic.", "There are many issues surrounding the production of influenza vaccine,  which will only become exacerbated during an influenza pandemic.  Vaccines, which are considered the first line of defense to prevent or  reduce influenza-related illness and death, may be unavailable or in short  supply. Producing the vaccine is a complex process that involves growing  viruses in millions of fertilized chicken eggs. Experience has shown that  the vaccine production cycle takes at least 6 to 8 months after a virus  strain has been identified, and vaccines for some influenza strains have  been difficult to mass-produce, causing further delay. The lengthy process  for developing a vaccine may mean that a vaccine would not be available  during the initial stages of a pandemic.", "Vaccine shortages during the 2004-2005 influenza season have highlighted  the fragility of the influenza vaccine market and the need for its expansion  and stabilization. Currently, only two manufacturers are licensed to sell  their vaccine in the United States. Maintaining an influenza vaccine  supply is critically important for protecting the public\u2019s health and  improving our preparedness for an influenza pandemic. As a result,  according to CDC officials, the agency plans to alleviate the impact of next  year\u2019s influenza season by taking aggressive steps to ensure an expanded  influenza supply to protect the nation. To this end, the agency\u2019s fiscal year  2006 budget request includes an increase of $30 million for CDC to enter  into guaranteed purchase contracts with vaccine manufacturers to ensure  the production of bulk monovalent influenza vaccine. If supplies fall short,  this bulk product can be turned into a finished trivalent influenza vaccine  product for annual distribution. If supplies are sufficient, the bulk vaccine  can be held until the following year\u2019s influenza season and developed into  vaccines if the circulating strains remain the same. In addition, according  to CDC, this guarantee will help to expand the influenza market by  providing an incentive to manufacturers to expand capacity and possibly  encourage additional manufacturers to enter the market. In addition, the  fiscal year 2006 budget request includes an increase of $20 million to  support influenza vaccine purchase activities.", "Even if sufficient quantities of the vaccine are produced in time, vaccines  against various strains differ in their ability to produce the immune  response necessary to provide effective protection against the disease.

HHS officials expect the amount  produced will be below demand during a pandemic. This assumption,  supported by drug manufacturers, is based on the fact that current  production levels of antiviral drugs are set in response to current demand,  whereas demand in a pandemic is expected to increase significantly if  vaccines are unavailable. In addition, the production of antiviral  medications cannot be rapidly expanded and involves a long production  process. Moreover, sometimes influenza virus strains can become resistant  to one or more of the four approved influenza antiviral drugs, and thus the  drugs may not always work.

Although HHS  has statutory authority to prevent the introduction, transmission, or  spread of communicable diseases from foreign countries into the United  States, HHS regulations implementing the statute do not specifically  provide for HHS to obtain passenger manifests or other passenger contact  information from airlines and shipping companies for disease outbreak  control purposes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Most Hospitals Lack the Capacity to Respond to Large-Scale Infectious Disease Outbreaks", "paragraphs": ["A challenge identified during the SARS outbreak that may also affect  response efforts during an influenza pandemic is lack of sufficient hospital  and workforce capacity. This lack could be exacerbated during an  influenza pandemic, compared to other natural disasters, such as a  tornado or hurricane, or an intentional release of a bioterrorist agent,  because it is likely that a pandemic would result in both widespread and  sustained effects.", "Public health officials we spoke with said a large-scale outbreak, such as  an influenza pandemic, could strain the available capacity of hospitals by  requiring entire hospital sections (along with their staff) to be used as  isolation facilities. As we have reported earlier, most states lack \u201csurge  capacity,\u201d that is, the capacity to respond to the large influx of patients  that could occur during a large public health emergency. For example,  few states reported that they had the capacity to evaluate, diagnose, and  treat 500 or more patients involved in a single incident. In addition, few  states reported having the capacity to rapidly establish clinics to immunize  or provide treatment to large numbers of patients. Moreover, a shortage in  workforce could increase during an influenza pandemic because higher  disease rates could result in high rates of absenteeism among health care  workers who are likely to be at increased risk of exposure and illness."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["There are a number of systems in place to identify influenza outbreaks  abroad, to alert us to a pandemic, and these systems generally appear to  be working well. HHS has taken important steps to enhance surveillance  and to fund initiatives for preparedness and response, including steps to  increase the vaccine supply.", "However, important challenges remain in our preparedness to respond,  should an influenza pandemic occur in the United States. The steps HHS is  taking to address vaccine production capacity and stockpiling of antiviral  drugs may not be in place in time to fill the current gaps in preparedness  should an influenza pandemic occur in the next several years. As we  learned in the 2004-2005 influenza season, problems affecting even a single  manufacturer can produce major shortages. Once a pandemic influenza  strain is identified, a vaccine will take many months to produce, and our  current stockpile of antiviral drugs is insufficient to meet the likely  demand. Pandemic influenza would have major impacts on the ability of  communities to respond, businesses to function, and public safety to be  maintained when communities across the country are simultaneously  impacted and hospital capacity is overwhelmed.", "Since 2000, we have been urging the department to complete its pandemic  plan. A draft plan was issued in August 2004, with a 60-day period for  public comment, but as of this week, the plan had not been finalized. It is  important for the federal government and the states to work through  issues such as how vaccine will be purchased, distributed, and  administered, how population groups will be prioritized for vaccination,  what quarantine authorities or travel restrictions may need to be invoked,  and how federal resources should be deployed before we are in a time of  crisis.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes my prepared statement.
