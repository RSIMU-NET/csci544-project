AFRICOM initially conducted these inherited activities with little change. However, as AFRICOM has matured, it has begun planning and prioritizing activities with its four military service components, special operations command, and task force. Some activities represent a shift from traditional warfighting, requiring collaboration with the Department of State, U.S. Agency for International Development, and other interagency partners. GAO's prior work has identified critical steps and practices that help agencies to achieve success. For this report, GAO was asked to assess AFRICOM in five areas with respect to activity planning and implementation. To do so, GAO analyzed DOD and AFRICOM guidance; observed portions of AFRICOM activities; interviewed officials in Europe and Africa; and obtained perspectives from interagency officials, including those at 22 U.S. embassies in Africa."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["AFRICOM has made progress in developing strategies and engaging interagency partners, and could advance DOD's effort to strengthen the capacity of partner nations in Africa. However, AFRICOM still faces challenges in five areas related to activity planning and implementation. Overcoming these challenges would help AFRICOM with future planning, foster stability and security through improved relationships with African nations, and maximize its effect on the continent. (1) Strategic Planning. AFRICOM has created overarching strategies and led planning meetings, but many specific plans to guide activities have not yet been finalized. For example, AFRICOM has developed a theater strategy and campaign plan but has not completed detailed plans to support its objectives. Also, some priorities of its military service components, special operations command, and task force overlap or differ from each other and from AFRICOM's priorities. Completing plans will help AFRICOM determine whether priorities are aligned across the command and ensure that efforts are appropriate, complementary, and comprehensive. (2) Measuring Effects. AFRICOM is generally not measuring long-term effects of activities. While some capacity-building activities appear to support its mission, federal officials expressed concern that others--such as sponsoring a news Web site in an African region sensitive to the military's presence--may have unintended effects. Without assessing activities, AFRICOM lacks information to evaluate their effectiveness, make informed future planning decisions, and allocate resources. (3) Applying Funds. Some AFRICOM staff have difficulty applying funding sources to activities. DOD has stated that security assistance efforts are constrained by a patchwork of authorities. Limited understanding of various funding sources for activities has resulted in some delayed activities, funds potentially not being used effectively, and African participants being excluded from some activities. (4) Interagency Collaboration. AFRICOM has been coordinating with partners from other federal agencies. As of June 2010, AFRICOM had embedded 27 interagency officials in its headquarters and had 17 offices at U.S. embassies in Africa. However, the command has not fully integrated interagency perspectives early in activity planning or leveraged some embedded interagency staff for their expertise. (5) Building Expertise. AFRICOM staff have made some cultural missteps because they do not fully understand local African customs and may unintentionally burden embassies that must respond to AFRICOM's requests for assistance with activities. Without greater knowledge of these issues, AFRICOM may continue to face difficulties maximizing resources with embassy personnel and building relations with African nations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that AFRICOM complete its strategic plans, conduct long-term activity assessments, fully integrate interagency personnel into activity planning, and develop training to build staff expertise.

Upon becoming fully  operational in fall 2008, AFRICOM inherited well over 100 activities,  missions, programs, and exercises from other DOD commands that had  been managing activities on the African continent. These activities ranged  from efforts to fight HIV/AIDS in African militaries to assisting African  partners in combating terrorism. AFRICOM\u2019s initial approach was to  continue to conduct these inherited activities with little change. However,  as the command has matured, AFRICOM\u2014with its four military service  components (Army Africa, Naval Forces Africa, Marine Corps Africa, Air  Force Africa), special operations command, and Horn of Africa task  force\u2014has begun planning and prioritizing activities. According to  AFRICOM\u2019s mission statement, its activities will focus on conducting  sustained security engagement and collaborating with other U.S.  government and international partners to promote a stable and secure  African environment in support of U.S. foreign policy. Because some of  AFRICOM\u2019s activities represent a shift from traditional warfighting  activities, AFRICOM\u2019s efforts to plan and implement its activities have  required increased collaboration with other federal partners such as the  Department of State (State) and the U.S. Agency for International  Development (USAID).", "This report is part of a series of studies on DOD\u2019s efforts in Africa since  the establishment of AFRICOM, which have been requested by the  Subcommittee on National Security and Foreign Affairs of the House  Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. In April 2010, we issued  a report on the Combined Joint Task Force\u2013Horn of Africa, AFRICOM\u2019s  task force that it inherited from U.S. Central Command at Camp  Lemonnier, Djibouti. We recommended, and DOD generally agreed, that  the department determine whether AFRICOM should retain the task force,  and if so, whether changes were needed to the task force\u2019s mission,  structure, and resources to best support AFRICOM\u2019s mission.  Furthermore, we have previously reported and testified on challenges that  AFRICOM has faced since its establishment with regard to its presence on  the continent. We made recommendations to help AFRICOM address the  challenges it faced with respect to communicating its mission, integrating  personnel from other federal agencies (\u201cinteragency personnel\u201d) into the  command, and determining the total costs for establishing a permanent  headquarters and offices in Africa. Furthermore, our prior work has noted  that critical steps and practices that help agencies to achieve success  include (1) strategic planning; (2) measuring performance; (3) aligning  resources to support goals; (4) involving stakeholders; and (5) building  expertise. In response to your request, this report assesses AFRICOM in  each of these five areas with respect to activity planning and  implementation.", "To conduct our work, we reviewed a wide range of DOD and command  documentation, including DOD strategies and guidance; AFRICOM\u2019s  theater strategy, theater campaign plan, and posture statements; and  AFRICOM components\u2019 priorities and draft strategic plans, when available.  We also reviewed non-DOD documents to determine how AFRICOM\u2019s  strategies compared or aligned with the strategies of other federal  partners, including the fiscal years 2007\u20132012 Department of State/USAID  Joint Strategic Plan; the USAID Strategic Framework for Africa; and  fiscal year 2008, fiscal year 2009, and fiscal year 2010 mission strategic  plans of 12 U.S. embassies in Africa. We interviewed DOD officials at  many offices including AFRICOM headquarters, its military service  component commands, and special operations command; its Horn of  Africa task force headquarters; the Office of the Secretary of Defense; the  Joint Staff; and the Defense Security Cooperation Agency. We also  interviewed officials at State, USAID, and the Coast Guard to obtain other  federal agencies\u2019 perspectives on AFRICOM\u2019s processes for planning and  implementing activities, including the command\u2019s considerations of  interagency perspectives, and we interviewed officials associated with  nongovernmental organizations. We met with U.S. embassy officials in  Uganda, Ethiopia, and Djibouti, and we contacted 20 additional embassies  involved with AFRICOM activities and geographically dispersed  throughout Africa. In addition, we met with some African government and  military officials to obtain their viewpoints on AFRICOM\u2019s activities.", "We selected two AFRICOM activities to observe in depth\u2014(1) the Africa  Partnership Station, a maritime safety and security activity, and (2)  Natural Fire 10, a military training exercise associated with AFRICOM\u2019s  pandemic preparedness and response activity. We chose these two  activities based on several factors including their addressing of different  theater security objectives, leadership by different military service  components, considerable involvement of interagency and international  partners, size of the activities, and distinct geographic locations. Detailed  descriptions of these activities can be found in appendixes I and II. We  supplemented our examination of these activities with information on  additional activities highlighted by officials at AFRICOM, its components,  DOD, State, and USAID during our review.", "We conducted this performance audit from April 2009 to July 2010, in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those  standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient,  appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence  obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives.

AFRICOM\u2019s area of responsibility includes the countries on  the African continent, with the exception of Egypt, as well as its island  nations. The command\u2019s mission is to work in concert with other U.S.  government agencies and international partners to conduct sustained  security engagement through military-to-military programs, military- sponsored activities, and other military operations as directed to promote  a stable and secure African environment in support of U.S. foreign policy.  According to AFRICOM, it received about $340 million in funding in fiscal  year 2009.", "In addition to AFRICOM\u2019s headquarters, the command is supported by  military service component commands, a special operations command,  and a Horn of Africa task force (see fig. 1). AFRICOM\u2019s Navy Forces and  Marine Corps components were designated fully operational on October 1,  2008, and its Air Force, Army, and special operations command  components on October 1, 2009. The task force was transferred to  AFRICOM on October 1, 2008. All components have begun carrying out  activities under AFRICOM.", "As of June 2010, AFRICOM reported that the command and its  components had about 4,400 assigned personnel and forces. About 2,400  of these personnel were based at locations in Europe, and about 2,000  personnel\u2014about 400 staff and about 1,600 forces\u2014were assigned to the  command\u2019s Horn of Africa task force at Camp Lemonnier, Djibouti.  AFRICOM also stated that there could be between 3,500 to about 5,000  rotational forces deployed during a major exercise.", "When AFRICOM was established, it inherited the activities previously  conducted by its predecessors. Many of these activities reflect DOD\u2019s shift  toward building the security capacity of partner states, a mission area  noted in the department\u2019s 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review. Building  security capacity furthers the U.S. objective of securing a peaceful and  cooperative international order and includes such activities as bilateral  and multilateral training and exercises, foreign military sales and  financing, officer exchange programs, educational opportunities at  professional military schools, technical exchanges, and efforts to assist  foreign security forces in building competency and capacity. In particular,  AFRICOM\u2019s inherited activities to build partner capacity, some of which  involve coordination with State, range from efforts to train African  soldiers in conducting peacekeeping operations to assisting African  nations in combating terrorism, and they include one of the largest U.S.  military activities in Africa, Operation Enduring Freedom\u2013Trans Sahara.  The areas of responsibility and examples of activities transferred to  AFRICOM from the U.S. Central, European, and Pacific Commands are  presented in figure 2.", "AFRICOM emphasizes that it works in concert with interagency partners,  such as USAID, to ensure that its plans and activities directly support U.S.  foreign policy objectives. On the African continent, DOD focuses on  defense, State plans and implements foreign diplomacy, and USAID leads  foreign development, including efforts to support economic growth and  humanitarian assistance. DOD issued Joint Publication 3-08 in March 2006  to provide guidance to facilitate coordination between DOD and  interagency organizations. The publication acknowledged that the various  U.S. government agencies\u2019 differing, and sometimes conflicting, goals,  policies, procedures, and decision-making techniques make unity of effort  a challenge, but noted that close coordination and cooperation can help  overcome challenges. The 2008 National Defense Strategy identified  AFRICOM as an example of DOD\u2019s efforts toward collaborating with other  U.S. government departments and agencies and working to achieve a  whole-of-government approach. Additionally, the 2010 Quadrennial  Defense Review identified the need to continue improving DOD\u2019s  cooperation with other U.S. agencies. In particular, the report stated that  DOD will work with the leadership of civilian agencies to support those  agencies\u2019 growth and their overseas operations so that the appropriate  military and civilian resources are put forth to meet the demands of  current contingencies. In our February 2009 report on AFRICOM, we  noted that after DOD declared AFRICOM fully operational, concerns about  AFRICOM\u2019s mission and activities persisted among various stakeholders.  Concerns included areas such as humanitarian assistance and other  noncombat activities that involve non-DOD agencies and organizations.  The concerns centered on the view that AFRICOM could blur traditional  boundaries between diplomacy, development, and defense. In some cases,  the apprehensions stemmed from DOD having more resources than other  agencies and thus it could dominate U.S. activities and relationships in  Africa. Among African nations, we found that there was some concern that  AFRICOM would be used as an opportunity to increase the number of U.S.  troops and military bases in Africa."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "AFRICOM Has Created Some Overarching Strategic Guidance, but Activities Are Being Implemented While Many Plans Remain Unfinished", "paragraphs": ["AFRICOM has created overarching strategic guidance and has led activity  planning meetings with its stakeholders such as State.

Strategic plans are the starting point and  underpinning for a system of program goal-setting and performance  measurement in the federal government. DOD strategic planning guidance,  issued in 2008, requires each geographic combatant command to produce  a theater campaign plan and specific posture requirements for its given  area of responsibility. In September 2008, AFRICOM published its theater  strategy, a 10-year strategy describing the strategic environment in which  the command operates. In May 2009, the Secretary of Defense approved  AFRICOM\u2019s theater campaign plan, a 5-year plan that describes the  command\u2019s theater strategic objectives, establishes priorities to guide the  command\u2019s activities, and provides guidance to the command\u2019s staff and  components. In its theater campaign plan, AFRICOM outlined priority  countries that are of strategic importance, and it identified its theater  strategic objectives, such as defeating the al-Qaeda terrorist organization  and associated networks in Africa; ensuring that capacity exists to  respond to crises; improving security-sector governance and stability; and  protecting populations from deadly contagions. AFRICOM officials said  that they worked with State and USAID officials to incorporate their  perspectives into the theater campaign plan. However, AFRICOM officials  observed that the Africa strategies for State and USAID have different  timelines from those of AFRICOM, thus posing a challenge for alignment  among the command and its interagency partners. For example,  AFRICOM\u2019s theater campaign plan covers fiscal years 2010 through 2014,  whereas the State/USAID strategic plan spans fiscal years 2007 through  2012.", "In addition to developing its theater strategy and campaign plan,  AFRICOM has also led activity planning meetings for future activities. The  command has held annual Theater Security Cooperation Conferences,  which include officials from AFRICOM, its components, U.S. embassies,  and other federal agencies. At these meetings, AFRICOM proposes  activities to conduct for the following fiscal year, and it engages with other  federal agency officials to coordinate and implement activities.  Additionally, for individual activities, AFRICOM may hold multiple  planning meetings prior to implementation. For example, for AFRICOM\u2019s  Natural Fire 10 pandemic preparedness and response activity, four phases  of planning occurred during the year prior to the exercise. These phases  included: concept development, in which potential focuses for the  exercise were discussed; initial planning, in which the final focus of the  exercise and its location were determined; main planning, in which key  partners determined the activities that would make up the exercise; and  final planning. Similarly, in July 2009, we observed the main planning  conference for activities of the Africa Partnership Station\u2019s USS Gunston  Hall, which was deployed from March through May 2010. This conference  built upon the progress of the initial planning conference, and it was  followed by a final planning conference to identify specific details for the  activity. During our observation of the main planning conference, we  noted that AFRICOM\u2019s Navy component engaged DOD, interagency, and  African partners in the coordination of Africa Partnership Station events."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Many Plans Remain Unfinished, Hindering Activity Planning", "paragraphs": ["Although AFRICOM has developed overarching strategic guidance and led  planning meetings, it lacks specific supporting plans on conducting  activities, which hinders planning and implementation efforts. As we  previously reported, an agency should cascade its goals and objectives  throughout the organization and should align performance measures with  the objectives from the executive level down to the operational levels.  While AFRICOM\u2019s theater campaign plan identifies strategic objectives, it  does not include detailed information on how to plan, implement, or  evaluate specific activities. Rather, the theater campaign plan states that  AFRICOM is to create specific supporting plans\u2014(1) component support  plans, (2) regional engagement plans, and (3) country work plans\u2014with  more detailed information. However, AFRICOM has not yet approved its  military service components, special operations command, and task force  support plans for use in guiding their activities. Furthermore, the  command has not completed its five regional engagement plans or country  work plans for Africa (see fig. 3).", "In reviewing AFRICOM\u2019s theater campaign plan, we found that it provides  overarching guidance but does not include specific information such as  detailed activity information and the amount of effort focused on specific countries or regions. Rather, AFRICOM\u2019s theater campaign plan sta specific supporting plans will provide this information. To examine how  another combatant command approaches planning, we compared  AFRICOM\u2019s theater campaign plan to that of the U.S. Southern Comm a more mature DOD geographic combatant command that operates in t Americas and Caribbean, which, like AFRICOM, also has a focus on  building partner capacity and collaborating with interagency partne While this comparison was not meant to conclude that one comb command\u2019s approach is superior to the other, our analysis did find  differences between the two plans. For example, we noted that  AFRICOM\u2019s theater campaign plan identifies only one activity\u2014the  African Partners Enlisted Development program\u2014and calls for the  establishment of regional engagement plans to focus on activities and  programs. In contrast, Southern Command\u2019s theater campaign p includes detailed information on dozens of its activities, and no supporting regional engagement plans are required. Additionally, although  AFRICOM\u2019s theater campaign plan identifies priority countries or for each of its theater strategic objectives, it calls for supporting regiona engagement plans and country work plans to provide additional  information on regional and country information. In contrast, Southern  Command\u2019s theater campaign plan specifically details the percentage of  engagement effort that will be directed toward each region and count essence, it appears that both Southern Command and AFRICOM requ that similar types of information on regional efforts and activities be  incorporated into plans. The difference is that AFRICOM \u2019s approach  requires the completion of supporting plans while Southern Command  provides this information in its theater campaign plan.", "AFRICOM\u2019s specific supporting plans\u2014its components\u2019 support pl regional engagement plans\u2014have not yet been completed. AFRICOM\u2019s  theater campaign plan required that component support plans be  completed by each AFRICOM component no later than December 1, 2009 to address activities for fiscal years 2010 through 2012. According to  AFRICOM, as of June 2010, four of the six component support plans had  nder  been developed and were ready to present to the AFRICOM comma ped in  for approval. The Navy\u2019s supporting plan, for example, was develo November 2009, but had not yet been signed out by the AFRICOM  commander.

Specifically, AFRICOM\u2019s theater campaign plan  states that both it and the regional engagement plans provide the  command\u2019s prioritization of time, effort, and resources for all steady-state  activities that the command executes. The theater campaign plan states  that regional engagement plans should contain three elements: (1) regio planning guidance, which highlights key objectives for each region t hat  must nest within the theater security objectives outlined in the theate campaign plans; (2) a 2-year calendar that depicts planned security  cooperation engagement activities, month by month, and country by  country, for the region; and (3) country work plans, which should be  developed for each critical partner identified in the theater campaign  The country work plans should include a detailed list of activities and  events designed to make progress toward objectives for each region  within a particular country, and they are required to be aligned with U.S.  embassy Mission Strategic and Resource Plans to ensure unity of effort.

Currently, each of the military service components has established priority  countries/areas in Africa, but in some cases they overlap or differ from  each other and also differ from the priority countries that AFRICOM has  identified. Air Force component officials told us, for example, that they  used AFRICOM\u2019s designation of priority countries to inform their initial  identification of priority countries, but they also considered where U.S.  Europe Command\u2019s Air Force component had prior engagements or  existing relationships with Africans. These officials told us that they  recently updated their priority countries based on their own objectives.  The officials explained that, because the Air Force component has  different objectives than AFRICOM\u2019s other military service components  and because certain African countries have varying levels of Air Force  capabilities, their designated priority countries would not necessarily  coincide with those of other military service components. Marine Corps  component officials said that their designated priority countries reinforce  AFRICOM\u2019s designated \u201cwilling and capable\u201d African nations; however,  our analysis shows that the priority countries identified by AFRICOM and  those identified by its Marine Corps component also do not fully align.

Air Force component officials said that they currently lack  visibility and coordination with the other components for the full range of  activities, and as a result, they may be unaware of some activities being  planned or conducted by other AFRICOM components. Similarly, officials  from AFRICOM\u2019s Army component stated that perhaps the greatest  challenge to creating positive conditions in Africa is ensuring that U.S.  defense efforts remain synchronized; if plans are not coordinated, their  efforts could have unintended consequences, such as the potential for  Africans to perceive the U.S. military as trying to influence public opinion  in a region sensitive to the military\u2019s presence.

In  addition, according to Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government, U.S. agencies should monitor and assess the quality of  performance over time.

Specifically, DOD and State have not carried out  systematic program monitoring of funds for projects that, among other  things, train and equip partner nations\u2019 militaries to conduct  counterterrorism operations. Instead, reporting has generally consisted  of anecdotal information, although DOD has taken initial steps to establish  systematic program monitoring. For example, DOD has hired a contractor  to identify current project roles, data sources, and ongoing assessment  activities in order to develop a framework for assessing projects. However,  DOD officials stated that they had not consistently monitored these  security assistance projects, and State officials were not involved with or  aware of a formal evaluation process. Our review of 58 proposals for  security assistance projects in African countries from fiscal years 2007 to  2009 revealed that only 15, or 26 percent, of the proposals included a  description of how the activities would be monitored over time. In  addition, only 10 of the project proposals, or 17 percent, included  information related to program objectives or anticipated outcomes."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Some Activities Appear to Support AFRICOM\u2019s Mission, but Others May Have Unintended Consequences", "paragraphs": ["While some activities appear to support AFRICOM\u2019s mission, others may  have unintended consequences\u2014which underscores the importance of  consistently measuring the long-term effects of the full range of the  command\u2019s activities. AFRICOM has stated that a primary purpose of its  activities is to build partner capacity. The two activities we reviewed in  depth appear to support this mission. First, the Africa Partnership Station  initiative builds maritime security capabilities of African partners through  ship- and land-based training events focused on areas such as maritime  domain awareness, leadership, navigation, maritime law enforcement,  search and rescue, civil engineering, and logistics (see app. I). Second, the  command\u2019s Natural Fire 10 exercise brought together participants from  Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda to build partner capacity  in responding to a pandemic influenza outbreak (see app. II). Moreover,  State and U.S. embassy officials said that peacekeeping and military-to- military training activities help support embassy goals and U.S. foreign  policy objectives in African nations. For example, the U.S. embassy in  Algeria stated that AFRICOM\u2019s activities directly support the embassy\u2019s  objectives of counterterrorism cooperation and engaging with and  modernizing the Algerian military. In addition, a senior official at the U.S.  embassy in Mozambique told us that AFRICOM supports the embassy\u2019s  goals pertaining to maritime security and professionalizing Mozambique\u2019s  military.", "However, based on concerns raised by interagency officials, other  activities may not fully align with U.S. foreign policy goals or they may not  reflect the most effective use of resources. For example, State officials  expressed concern over AFRICOM\u2019s sponsorship of a news Web site about  the Maghreb, citing the potential for Africans to perceive the U.S. military  as trying to influence public opinion. State had previously told us that  countries in the Maghreb are very sensitive to foreign military presence,  and if a program is marketed as a U.S. military activity or operation, it may  not be well received among these nations. AFRICOM officials said that  they had inherited this activity from U.S. European Command and that  they have been working closely with State in its implementation.  Moreover, DOD officials observed that, with respect to the Maghreb news  Web site sponsorship, the intent of the activity is to influence African  public sentiment\u2014the same effect for which some State officials have  expressed concern. They said that State supports this as a foreign policy  goal in Africa, and senior State officials have endorsed the Maghreb news  Web site sponsorship activity. Similarly, some officials questioned whether  the U.S. military should conduct a musical caravan activity in Senegal,  which is intended to promote peace by having local artists provide free  concerts throughout the country. State officials noted that the activity has  overwhelmed embassy staff, who had to spend significant time ensuring  that AFRICOM\u2019s effort was appropriately aligned with embassy goals.  AFRICOM officials acknowledged that there have been some concerns  with this activity and that it is being reviewed by both the command and  State. However, AFRICOM noted that all activities within a country are  reviewed and approved by the U.S. embassy before they are executed.", "However, at the U.S. embassy level, officials also expressed concern about  some of AFRICOM\u2019s activities. For example, according to one U.S.  embassy, AFRICOM\u2019s sociocultural research and advisory teams, which  comprise one to five social scientists who conduct research and provide  cultural advice to AFRICOM, seem to duplicate other interagency efforts.  AFRICOM officials told us that they use the information provided by the  teams to help guide operations in Africa and obtain perspectives on  cultural sensitivities among the local populations. However, the embassy  expressed concern about the U.S. military performing this type of research  itself instead of coordinating with interagency partners to gain  sociocultural information. Moreover, an internal State memo emphasized  the need for close coordination among AFRICOM\u2019s research teams and  U.S. embassies. In March 2010, the Secretary of State issued guidance to  U.S. embassies in Africa on AFRICOM\u2019s sociocultural research and  advisory activities, stating that AFRICOM\u2019s research teams will share their  findings with embassy staff and other government counterparts. Finally,  State and USAID officials we contacted at one U.S. embassy expressed  concern that some of the activities that AFRICOM\u2019s Horn of Africa task  force had previously proposed, such as building schools for an African  nation, did not appear to fit into a larger strategic framework, and said that  they did not believe the task force was monitoring its activities as needed  to enable it to demonstrate a link between activities and mission. The  embassy officials cited a past example where the task force had proposed  drilling a well without considering how its placement could cause conflict  in clan relationships or affect pastoral routes. While concerns raised about  specific AFRICOM activities may or may not be valid, without conducting  long-term assessments of activities, AFRICOM lacks the information  needed to evaluate the effects of the full range of its activities, to be able  to respond to critics if need be, and to make informed future planning  decisions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "AFRICOM Generally Does Not Measure the Long- Term Effects of Its Activities", "paragraphs": ["AFRICOM appears to perform some follow-up on activities shortly after  their completion, but the command is generally not measuring the effects  of activities over the long term. AFRICOM officials we met with while  observing the command\u2019s Natural Fire 10 pandemic preparedness and  response activity in Uganda told us that the command planned to produce  an \u201cafter action\u201d report after the activity, but they acknowledged that  AFRICOM needs to develop a method to perform longer-term assessments  on activities. With respect to the Natural Fire engineering projects, for  example, the officials said that AFRICOM does not know whether projects  such as reconstructing a school will have a sustainable effect on the  community. AFRICOM\u2019s Humanitarian Assistance Branch has developed  an assessment tool for Natural Fire that relates to the command\u2019s security  objectives, but an official told us that AFRICOM is still determining exactly  what will be assessed with respect to the activity. AFRICOM also envisions  continuing its work on pandemic response by engaging bilaterally with  each of the countries involved in the 2009 Natural Fire exercise.", "DOD, State, and officials we contacted at several U.S. embassies in Africa  also stated that, from their perspectives, AFRICOM is not measuring the  long-term effects of its activities in Africa. State officials told us, for  example, that AFRICOM\u2019s Military Information Support Teams, which are  intended to support State and U.S. embassies by augmenting or  broadening existing public-diplomacy efforts, are not assessing the effect  of their efforts. In addition, while the Africa Partnership Station activity  has been viewed as a successful African partner training platform,  concerns were raised that it may have taken on too many training  activities\u2014which range from maritime domain awareness to maritime law  enforcement to civil engineering to humanitarian assistance efforts. With  the potential for its mission to become amorphous or lose its  effectiveness, it was suggested that the Africa Partnership Station might be  more effective if it targeted its resources toward fewer activities.", "In our April 2010 report on AFRICOM\u2019s Horn of Africa task force, we  noted that the task force performs some short-term follow-up on activities,  but AFRICOM officials said that the task force has not historically been  focused on performing long-term assessments on activities to determine  whether the activities are having their intended effects or whether  modifications to activities need to be made. In response to our report, the  task force acknowledged that it needed to improve its ability to evaluate  the effectiveness of its activities. The task force stated that it had taken  steps to incorporate measures of performance and effects in its planning  process so that it can determine whether its activities are achieving  foreign policy goals. The command\u2019s sociocultural research and advisory  team in the area is also being used to help assess task force activities, and  the task force is beginning to follow-up on past activities, such as medical  clinics, to determine their effects over time. We commend the task force  for these efforts, which could serve as models for implementing long-term  activity assessments across AFRICOM.", "AFRICOM\u2019s limited long-term evaluation of activities to date may result, in  part, from the differences in agency cultures among DOD, State, and  USAID. Officials from State and USAID told us that their agencies are  focused on monitoring and on long-term results, while they viewed DOD  as having a tendency to take a short-term approach focused on immediate  implementation or results. Similarly, nonprofit-organization officials said  that, from their perspective, the U.S. military tends to view development  activities on a onetime basis and is not focused on monitoring or  measuring the effects of an activity after completion. They voiced concern  that AFRICOM will not know whether its activities are effective or be in a  position to evaluate the quality of the services its activities may be  providing.", "Long-term evaluation can be difficult to achieve but remains nonetheless  important for AFRICOM in meeting its mission in Africa. While some  activities may promote temporary benefits for the participants, their short- term nature or unintended long-term effects could potentially promote  unfavorable views of the U.S. military among partner nations. We  previously reported, for example, that AFRICOM\u2019s Horn of Africa task  force had built a well for a local African community, but it did not teach  the community how to maintain it. AFRICOM officials stated that they  recognize the difficulties associated with measuring long-term effects of  activities, particularly the ability to link an action to a desired effect. For  example, AFRICOM Navy component officials told us that it is difficult to  measure the Africa Partnership Station\u2019s return on investment because  changes in Africa can be incremental and thus it can be difficult to  determine whether the activity caused the change or whether the effects  will persist over time. The Navy has been working with the Center for  Naval Analyses to assess the Africa Partnership Station. Center for Naval  Analyses officials told us that their work has shown that Africa  Partnership Station training has been successful in changing African  participants\u2019 attitudes toward maritime safety and security activities but  that it has been more difficult to show changes in the behavior of  participating African nations. Despite the challenges associated with  measuring long-term effects, implementing such assessments for all of its  activities can help AFRICOM make successful future planning decisions  and allocate resources to maximize its effect in Africa."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Some AFRICOM Staff Face Difficulties in Applying Multiple Funding Resources to Activities", "paragraphs": ["Some AFRICOM staff face difficulties in applying funding to activities,  which can pose challenges in implementing activities and impede long- term planning efforts. AFRICOM stated that it had access to 15 different  funding sources to fund its activities in fiscal year 2009. In addition,  AFRICOM reported that it influences other State and USAID funding  sources\u2014such as funds for State\u2019s Global Peacekeeping and Operations  Initiative and International Military Education and Training, and USAID\u2019s  Pandemic Response Program\u2014but that these funding sources are not  managed by the command. We consistently heard from officials at  AFRICOM and its components that applying funding to activities was not  well understood by staff and that they lacked expertise to effectively carry  out this task. For example, Army component officials told us that activities  must be designed to meet specific criteria in order to be granted funds and  that their staff do not have the skills required to understand the  complexities of funding. Similarly, Navy and Air Force component officials  said that staff spend substantial amounts of time trying to determine  which funding sources can be appropriately applied to which activities.  Many different funding sources may be required for small segments of an  activity, such as transportation or lodging for participants.", "Determining which specific funding sources should be used for various  activities has sometimes resulted in problems with activities. Officials  cited instances in which limited understanding resulted in African nations  having their invitations to AFRICOM-sponsored activities rescinded or in  activities having to be canceled. In two recent instances, an official said  that AFRICOM essentially disinvited two-thirds of the intended  participants for activities at the last minute because it was discovered that  certain funding sources could not be used to support the participants. This  caused much embarrassment and frustration for the Africans who had  planned to attend the activities. Marine Corps component officials said  that difficulties in identifying the appropriate funding source prevented  them from responding to African requests for activities, causing the  cancellation of some peacekeeping exercises. AFRICOM\u2019s Navy  component has also struggled with the application of multiple funding  sources to the Africa Partnership Station activity, an official explained,  occasionally resulting in delayed submissions of funding packages to U.S.  embassies for approval. Table 1 shows eight different funding sources  required for theater security cooperation activities associated with the  Africa Partnership Station\u2019s 2009 USS Nashville deployment.", "According to AFRICOM\u2019s Navy component, funding a large activity like the  Africa Partnership Station on a 1-year planning horizon has hindered the  ability to conduct persistent training efforts. Officials said that funding  sources, such as the Combatant Commander Initiative Fund, are only  available for a year and must be applied only to new initiatives. Similarly,  Global War on Terrorism funds, now known as Overseas Contingency  Operations funds, are supplemental appropriations, which officials said do  not provide permanency for the activity. Our prior work has encouraged  DOD to include known or likely project costs of ongoing operations  related to the war on terrorism in DOD\u2019s base budget requests. Navy  component officials told us that Africa Partnership Station may get its own  funding line for fiscal years 2011 through 2015. If approved by the  President, Navy component officials believe the dedicated budget line  would help facilitate funding the activity, although AFRICOM added that  the Africa Partnership Station will still require several funding sources to  support the activity.", "In its 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review, DOD stated that U.S. security  assistance efforts are constrained by a complex patchwork of authorities  and unwieldy processes. Several AFRICOM and component officials we  contacted agreed, with some stating that funding challenges hampered  their ability to sustain relationships in Africa. AFRICOM stated that the  limitations of current funding sources create a continuing challenge for  the command, noting that some funding sources were not designed for the  types of activities AFRICOM carries out and thus do not adequately  support AFRICOM\u2019s mission of sustained security engagement. Army  component officials said that funding sources available for activities tend  to be short term and must be used in a finite time frame, which limits long- term planning capabilities and the ability to have a sustained presence in  Africa. AFRICOM\u2019s special operations command officials said that the lack  of sustainable funding sources has created a short-term, unsustainable  approach to the command\u2019s activities, describing their efforts as sporadic  connections with African countries with which they should have enduring  relationships. Marine Corps component officials described having to ask  AFRICOM for funds for activities that fall outside of funding cycles, noting  the need for streamlined funding for effective sustained engagement in  Africa.", "Our prior work on security assistance activities also found that the long- term effect of some projects may be at risk because it is uncertain whether  funds will be available to sustain the military capabilities that the projects  are intended to build. There are limits on the use of U.S. government  funds for sustainment of certain security assistance projects, and most  participating countries have relatively low incomes and may be unwilling  or unable to provide the necessary resources to sustain the projects.  Moreover, officials told us that the process for submitting proposals for  security assistance projects is lengthy, requiring them to begin writing the  next fiscal year\u2019s plans before the last year\u2019s are processed, and that the  time frames for receiving and applying the funding from the various  funding sources needed for the project do not necessarily align with one  another. For example, AFRICOM might apply resources from one funding  source to deliver a maritime vessel to an African country, but the  resources that must be obtained from another funding source to train the  recipients on how to use the vessel may fall within a different time frame.", "DOD guidance emphasizes the need for proper training and staffing to  increase effectiveness in budgeting. AFRICOM component officials told  us that guidance or training on applying funding sources to activities  would be helpful. When we asked about funding expertise within  AFRICOM, Air Force component officials said that it is difficult to find  assistance at AFRICOM because officials must first be able to identify the  appropriate funding source in order to ask the correct AFRICOM staff  member about that source. From their perspective, no individual at  AFRICOM or its Air Force component command has comprehensive  knowledge of all available funding sources for activities. AFRICOM  officials said they provide the components guidance on the Combatant  Commander Initiative Fund and noted that AFRICOM does not provide the  actual funding to the components for many sources they use to fund  activities. Additionally, they said that the command is researching funding  sources available for activities, which they believe will help AFRICOM  better define which sources can be applied to which activities.", "Our April 2010 report on AFRICOM\u2019s Horn of Africa task force found  similar issues among the task force\u2019s budget staff. According to task force  officials, budget staff must master a steep learning curve to understand the  provisions associated with these funding sources because the task force  comptroller and deputy comptroller are not financial specialists, generally  do not work on military comptroller issues full time, and have short tour  lengths. This steep learning curve can result in delays in conducting  activities, as task force staff described spending extra time and resources  understanding how to apply funding to activities. Moreover, AFRICOM  stated that command staffing and tour lengths contribute to the difficulties  in learning and maintaining knowledge of funding for task force activities.  For example, task force staff had intended to continue providing training  for senior enlisted Ethiopian military members through one type of  funding source, but they later found that the source did not allow for  training of foreign military members. Consequently, the staff had to revise  their program from one of training officers to one of providing feedback to  Ethiopian instructors. While eventually task force staff may correctly  identify funding sources for their activities, their limited skills in applying  funding may result in difficulties in implementing activities. We  recommended that AFRICOM take actions to ensure that its task force  budget personnel have the expertise and knowledge necessary to make  timely and accurate funding decisions for activities. DOD concurred with  our recommendation and cited some actions it had taken or planned\u2014 such as conducting on-the-job training and lengthening some tours for  personnel\u2014to augment critical skills among task force personnel. We  believe the steps DOD outlined, if implemented in a timely and  comprehensive manner, could help increase understanding and expertise  associated with applying funding sources to activities within AFRICOM\u2019s  Horn of Africa task force. However, DOD\u2019s comments were limited to  AFRICOM\u2019s task force personnel and do not address the lack of  understanding of funding sources throughout the command. Without a  greater understanding of how to apply funding to activities, AFRICOM will  likely continue to face difficulties in implementing activities\u2014including  the potential that activities may be delayed, funds may not be effectively  used, and African partner nations may be excluded from participating\u2014as  well as institutionalizing knowledge within the command."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "AFRICOM Has Made Efforts to Collaborate with Interagency Partners but Is Not Fully Engaging Them in Activity Planning Processes", "paragraphs": ["AFRICOM has made efforts to integrate interagency personnel into its  command and collaborate with other federal agencies on activities, but it  is not fully engaging interagency partners in planning processes."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "AFRICOM Has Integrated Interagency Personnel into the Command", "paragraphs": ["According to DOD and AFRICOM officials, integrating personnel from  other U.S. government agencies into the command is essential to achieving  AFRICOM\u2019s mission because it will help AFRICOM develop plans and  activities that are more compatible with those agencies.

The civilian commander directs the command\u2019s activities related  to areas such as health, humanitarian assistance, disaster response, and  peace support operations. According to AFRICOM, this deputy  commander\u2014who is currently a State ambassador-level official\u2014also  directs outreach, strategic communication, and AFRICOM\u2019s partner- building functions.", "As of June 2010, AFRICOM reported that it embedded 27 interagency  partners into its headquarters staff, which represents about 2 percent of  the total headquarters staff.

The interagency staff came from  several federal agencies, including the Departments of Energy, Homeland  Security, Justice, State, and Treasury; USAID; the Office of the Director of  National Intelligence; and the National Security Agency. The command  also plans to integrate five foreign policy advisors from State later this  year, according to officials at AFRICOM and State. Moreover, DOD has  signed memorandums of understanding with nine federal agencies to  outline conditions on sending interagency partners to AFRICOM. These  memorandums cover such topics as the financial reimbursement between  DOD and the federal agencies for participating employees, the length of  time the interagency partner may reside at AFRICOM, and logistical  provisions (housing, office space, etc.).

In February 2009, we reported that the  command initially expected to fill 52 positions with personnel from other  government agencies. However, according to DOD and AFRICOM  officials, this initial goal was notional and was not based on an analysis of  specific skill sets needed to accomplish AFRICOM\u2019s mission. During our  current review, command officials told us that there is no target number  for interagency personnel, but rather that AFRICOM is trying to determine  where in its command organization it could benefit from employing  interagency personnel or where interagency partners would prefer to  provide personnel. Command officials said that it would be helpful to have  additional interagency staff at AFRICOM, but they understand that staffing  limitations, resource imbalances, and lack of career progression incentives  for embedded staff from other federal agencies may limit the number of  personnel who can be brought in from these agencies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "AFRICOM Has Coordinated with Other Federal Agencies, but Is Not Fully Engaging Federal Partners in Activity Planning Processes", "paragraphs": ["AFRICOM has coordinated with other federal agencies.

State officials stated that  AFRICOM has made improvements in taking their feedback and creating  an environment that is conducive to cooperation across agencies.  Similarly, USAID officials told us that AFRICOM has improved its  coordination with their agency at the USAID headquarters level.

Some interagency officials have stated that  AFRICOM (1) is not always involving other federal agencies in the  formative stages of activity planning, and (2) does not fully leverage  expertise of interagency personnel embedded at AFRICOM."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "AFRICOM Does Not Always Involve Interagency Partners in Formative Planning Stages", "paragraphs": ["While AFRICOM has made progress in coordinating with other federal  agencies since its establishment, interagency partners may not be included  in the formative stages of activity planning. DOD\u2019s 2010 Quadrennial  Defense Review states that the department will continue to advocate for  an improved interagency strategic planning process. However, several  federal agency officials said that AFRICOM tends to plan activities first  and then engage partners, rather than including interagency perspectives  during the initial planning efforts.", "Several interagency officials stated that AFRICOM has tended to develop  initial activity plans before integrating interagency perspectives. Some U.S.  embassy officials described AFRICOM\u2019s annual activity planning meetings,  the Theater Security Cooperation Conferences, as useful for bringing  together AFRICOM and federal partners to plan for future AFRICOM  activities; however, they noted that past meetings have been limited in  their effectiveness because AFRICOM set the agenda without interagency  input, which they viewed as restricting their role. Additionally, officials  said that AFRICOM gave presentations of its planned exercises during one  of its annual activity planning conferences, but there was not meaningful  discussion with interagency partners on the most appropriate activities to  conduct. One official described the embassies\u2019 role at the conference as  telling AFRICOM which proposed activities the embassies could not  accommodate due to limited resources. Some federal officials suggested  that interagency collaboration could be improved at AFRICOM\u2019s annual  activity planning conferences if State took a lead role, although limited  State resources would make this unlikely. In general, both State and  AFRICOM told us that funding shortages prevent some State officials from  participating at AFRICOM planning events. Nonetheless, some State  officials noted that AFRICOM could better align its activities with U.S.  foreign policy goals and reduce the potential to burden U.S. embassy staff  in carrying out activities if AFRICOM would involve interagency partners  earlier in the planning process. From its perspective, AFRICOM said that  State has had significant influence in its planning processes, noting that  State\u2019s deputy chiefs of mission, as well as USAID mission directors, were  provided time to present information on their respective countries at the  November 2009 Theater Security Cooperation Conference and that State  officials are involved in other AFRICOM activity planning events  throughout the year.", "Following AFRICOM\u2019s most recent Theater Security Cooperation  Conference, federal officials stated that the command\u2019s integration of  interagency perspectives had improved from previous conferences. The  officials commented that AFRICOM officials appeared genuinely  interested in learning about foreign policy and political issues in African  countries from U.S. embassy officials and that the emphasis of many  command presentations appeared to convey AFRICOM\u2019s role as  supporting U.S. embassies and furthering U.S. foreign policy goals.", "During our observations of an Africa Partnership Station planning  conference in July 2009, AFRICOM and its Navy component officials  acknowledged that they needed to improve communications among  AFRICOM, its Navy component, and the U.S. embassies; since that time,  we found that AFRICOM has taken some steps to address the problems. At  that conference, an official at the U.S. embassy in Ghana stated that details  of a previous USS Nashville port visit were not provided to the embassy  prior to the ship\u2019s arrival. Rather, when the ship arrived and the Navy  component prepared to provide training, it was discovered that the  proposed training did not meet the needs of the Ghanaian Navy. As a  result, the U.S. embassy was required to work with AFRICOM\u2019s Navy  component to quickly put together a new training plan so that the  Ghanaian Navy could receive more relevant training. According to a State  official, AFRICOM should work on communicating the Africa Partnership  Station\u2019s mission in advance of its deployment because it is too late to  conduct strategic communications once a ship is already in port. In  response to concerns raised at the conference, AFRICOM has  implemented a pilot program to help embassy public affairs offices  generate public awareness of maritime security issues regarding 2010  Africa Partnership Station activities. As of February 2010, funding for the  program had been provided to U.S. embassies in Gabon, Ghana, Senegal,  and Mozambique.", "Conversely, our observation of the Natural Fire 10 pandemic preparedness  and response exercise in Uganda illustrated that early and continuous  interagency involvement can lead to a successful outcome. Prior to the  initial planning for Natural Fire 10, DOD and USAID signed an interagency  agreement to streamline collaboration in enhancing African military  capacity to respond to an influenza pandemic. When AFRICOM began  planning Natural Fire 10, it included USAID in the initial discussions to  consider the feasibility of focusing a portion of the exercise on pandemic  planning and response, as outlined in the interagency agreement. USAID  also funded civilian participation in that portion of the exercise. In  addition, State and U.S. embassy officials were included at all Natural Fire  10 planning conferences prior to the exercise. Furthermore, an embedded  USAID official at AFRICOM told us that the pandemic focus of that portion  of the Natural Fire 10 exercise was unique because it was designed more  like a USAID activity than a DOD activity, having a longer-term focus to  allow AFRICOM to sustain and expand the program over time. By working  with interagency partners throughout the planning process, AFRICOM was  able to sponsor an activity that was well received by its interagency  partners.", "Interagency personnel embedded into AFRICOM\u2019s organization may not  be fully leveraged for their expertise, which can make it more difficult for  some interagency personnel to contribute to the command\u2019s work. Our  prior work has noted that having a strategy for defining organizational  roles and responsibilities and coordination mechanisms can help national  security agencies clarify who will lead or participate in activities, organize  their joint and individual efforts, and facilitate decision making. Although  AFRICOM has included information on interagency collaboration in its  theater campaign plan and created an interagency board to facilitate  collaboration, an embedded interagency official stated that AFRICOM  employs a hierarchal rather than collaborative approach to decision  making. The command\u2019s Army component echoed this sentiment, stating  that coordination and development of strategies is less collaborative than  on specific activities. This approach differs markedly from USAID and  State\u2019s planning approaches, which officials described as focusing on  brainstorming with all relevant personnel or on the long-term results of the  activities. Additionally, an embedded official from another federal agency  told us that while AFRICOM officials bring some issues to interagency  personnel at the command to obtain their perspectives, more often  interagency staff must insert themselves into relevant meetings to affect  decision making. For example, a USAID official formerly embedded at  AFRICOM said that USAID embedded officials have to ask how they can  help the command, even though he believed that the military officials  should be asking how AFRICOM can provide support to USAID, as the  command has stated that it is in a supporting role to USAID on  development activities. Furthermore, some embedded interagency  personnel said that coordination is problematic when activity planning  takes place directly at AFRICOM\u2019s military service component commands  and not at AFRICOM headquarters, as there are few embedded  interagency staff members in the military service components. State  echoed this remark, noting that from its perspective, planning and  decision making at the command\u2019s military service components is separate  from that at AFRICOM headquarters, which creates difficulties for  coordination with interagency partners. As a result, many activities could  have undergone substantial planning at the component level before  interagency perspectives are sought.", "Moreover, some interagency personnel embedded at AFRICOM have said  that they may not be fully leveraged for their expertise. AFRICOM officials  told us that it is a challenge to determine where in the command to include  the interagency personnel. For example, an official from the  Transportation Security Administration decided on his own which  directorate in which to work when he joined the command because  AFRICOM had not identified a directorate for him. Another embedded  interagency staff member stated that AFRICOM initially placed him in a  directorate unrelated to his skill set, and he initiated a transfer to another  directorate that would better enable him to share his expertise. In  addition, Coast Guard officials stated that AFRICOM does not fully  understand the roles and responsibilities of the Coast Guard and what  knowledge and expertise it could provide the command. The officials cited  an example of AFRICOM\u2019s Navy component performing law enforcement  training instead of allowing the Coast Guard to take the lead on providing  this training to African forces.", "Difficulties in leveraging interagency partners are not unique to AFRICOM.  As we have previously reported, organizational differences\u2014including  differences in agencies\u2019 structures, planning processes, and funding  sources\u2014can hinder interagency collaboration, potentially wasting scarce  funds and limiting the effectiveness of federal efforts. Notwithstanding  these difficulties, interagency collaboration can be successful\u2014for  example, observers have cited the U.S. Southern Command as having  mature interagency planning processes and coordinating mechanisms.  Southern Command has also identified civilian federal agencies as leads  for each of its theater security objectives, furthering the early involvement  of interagency partners. A senior State official said that AFRICOM\u2019s  understanding of the roles of interagency partners might be improved if  additional staff from other federal agencies were embedded at the  command. However, several embedded interagency staff said that there is  little incentive to take a position at AFRICOM because it will not enhance  one\u2019s career position upon return to the original agency after the rotation.  Additionally, staffing shortages at other federal agencies reduce agencies\u2019  abilities to send additional staff to AFRICOM. In February 2009, we  reported that State officials told us that they would not likely be able to  provide active employees to fill the positions requested by AFRICOM  because they were already facing a 25 percent shortfall in mid-level  personnel\u2014although AFRICOM and State officials said that five State  foreign policy advisors are expected to arrive at the command later this  year. Despite challenges, AFRICOM has made some efforts that could  improve interagency collaboration within the command, such as  expanding its interagency orientation process and including opportunities  for interagency input into daily command meetings. In addition, AFRICOM  said that its Deputy to the Commander for Civil-Military Affairs, a senior  State official, is in charge of outreach for the command and sometimes  chairs command staff meetings.", "In fall 2009, the command conducted an assessment of the embedded  interagency process to analyze successes and identify lessons learned,  including recommendations on how to integrate interagency personnel  into command planning and operations. AFRICOM identified five key  observations based on its assessment: (1) embedded staff want to ensure  they can accomplish their own objectives and not merely perform duties  that a DOD employee could perform; (2) interagency personnel arrive at  AFRICOM with the expectation that they will help achieve not only  command goals and objectives but also U.S. government goals, yet they  feel that DOD employees do not expect embedded personnel to develop  new programs; (3) embedded interagency personnel need to understand  the function, operation, and role of a military command and how it differs  from other federal government agencies; (4) the military planning process  is more structured than the planning approaches of other government  agencies; and (5) embedded personnel experience an overwhelming  adjustment to military culture. The assessment identified several  recommendations and suggestions, such as developing a training and  orientation program for embedded interagency personnel. In July 2010,  AFRICOM stated that it had established an interagency command  collaborative forum to assess, prioritize, and implement the  recommendations from the study. Fully leveraging its embedded  interagency partners can help AFRICOM contribute to a unified U.S.  government approach to activity planning and implementation in Africa."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "AFRICOM Faces Challenges in Building Personnel Expertise to Work in Africa", "paragraphs": ["AFRICOM emphasizes the importance of collaborating with its interagency  partners and building cultural awareness; however, the command has  sometimes experienced difficulty implementing activities because some  personnel have limited knowledge about working with U.S. embassies and  about cultural issues in Africa.

USAID officials told us that while  AFRICOM has made improvements coordinating with their agency at the  headquarters level, most USAID planning efforts occur at U.S. embassies  in country and that AFRICOM has not fully integrated its staff into the  planning process at the country level. Moreover, in our prior work on  AFRICOM\u2019s Horn of Africa task force, we reported that task force  personnel did not always understand embassy procedures for interacting  with African partner nations. For example, task force personnel would, at  times, approach the Djiboutian government ministries directly with  concepts for activities rather than follow the established procedure of  having the U.S. embassy in Djibouti initiate the contact. Additionally, in  our prior work on the Trans-Sahara Counterterrorism Partnership activity,  we noted that disagreements about whether State should have authority  over DOD personnel temporarily assigned to conduct activities affected  implementation of DOD\u2019s activities in Niger and Chad. In commenting on  that report, DOD stated that it believed sufficient guidance existed that  defined the authorities of DOD\u2019s combatant commander and State\u2019s chief  of mission but noted that issuing joint guidance reflecting the implications  of the shift to a greater DOD emphasis and support in shape and deter  operations would be helpful to both the combatant commander and chief  of mission in the Trans-Sahara Counterterrorism Partnership region. A  senior State official formerly stationed at AFRICOM told us that command  and control responsibilities in Africa are improving but that issues still  exist. He cited a recent example in which the U.S. ambassador to Liberia  maintained that the embassy should have authority over DOD personnel  carrying out security sector reform activities in the country, while  AFRICOM argued that it needed shared authority over these personnel. A  shared authority agreement was eventually reached for DOD personnel  who would reside in Liberia on a semipermanent basis.", "Some AFRICOM personnel\u2019s limited knowledge of working with U.S.  embassy staff can impose burdens on embassies because, as officials  stated throughout our review, the embassies are short-staffed. The  Department of State Inspector General released a report in August 2009  stating, in part, that the embassies in Africa are understaffed and that the  U.S. military is filling a void created by a lack of embassy resources for  traditional development and public diplomacy. AFRICOM\u2019s requests for  information and assistance with activities take embassy staff away from  their assigned duties to focus on command priorities. For example, a U.S.  embassy official in Uganda stated that AFRICOM personnel arrived in  country with the expectations that the embassy would take care of basic  cultural and logistical issues for them.", "AFRICOM is trying to increase its presence in U.S. embassies and send  planning teams prior to activity implementation in order to alleviate the  burden it has placed on U.S. embassies. According to command officials,  AFRICOM inherited 12 offices at U.S. embassies in Africa, and as of June  2010, it had added 5 additional offices, bringing its total U.S. embassy  presence to 17. Command officials told us that they plan to have a total of  28 offices in U.S. embassies, which would give AFRICOM a presence in  just over half of the 53 countries in its area of responsibility. Additionally,  at an Africa Partnership Station planning conference, we observed Navy  component officials request guidance from and offer suggestions on how  to ease the administrative burden the activity may place on U.S. embassy  personnel. AFRICOM has also begun to send reservists to African  countries to help with coordination prior to an Africa Partnership Station  ship visit.

For example, as we reported in our  prior work on AFRICOM\u2019s Horn of Africa task force, task force personnel  did not always understand cultural issues, such as the time required to  conduct activities in African villages or local religious customs. In one  case, the task force distributed used clothing to local Djibouti villagers  during Ramadan, which offended the Muslim population. In another case,  according to a U.S. embassy official, AFRICOM\u2019s task force provided 3  days notice that it would conduct a medical clinic in a remote village in  Djibouti. However, because the villagers are nomads, it was difficult to get  participants with that short amount of notice. Moreover, a Ghanaian  military participant involved with the Africa Partnership Station said that  AFRICOM\u2019s tendency to generalize its programs across Africa is not  effective, as each country is different and requires an individualized  approach.", "A better understanding of African cultural issues would likely help  AFRICOM improve relationships with African nations. For example, as we  previously reported, a U.S. embassy official in Tanzania said that  AFRICOM\u2019s task force team members had become proficient in Swahili,  thus helping them to develop relationships. Getting to know the language,  culture, and the people in the region, the embassy official said, has  contributed to the success in developing a Tanzanian-American  partnership in a region where extremists are known to operate. In  addition, an internal State memo described AFRICOM\u2019s sociocultural  research and advisory teams as intending to provide personnel with the  necessary background to work more effectively on the ground and to  interact in a more respectful and collaborative manner with local  populations. While a U.S. embassy had voiced concern about the teams  appearing to duplicate interagency efforts, the State memo stressed the  need for coordination with embassy and USAID personnel, including the  sharing of information obtained in the field.

Moreover, AFRICOM does not monitor training or require that it be  completed. We have previously reported that collaborative approaches to  national security require a well-trained workforce with the skills and  experience to integrate the government\u2019s diverse capabilities and  resources, and that increased training opportunities and strategic  workforce planning efforts could facilitate federal agencies\u2019 ability to fully  participate in interagency collaboration activities.", "AFRICOM officials told us that current training for personnel includes  Web courses, seminars led by DOD\u2019s Africa Center for Strategic Studies,  and guest-speaker programs. In addition, there are theater entry training  requirements for personnel deploying to Africa such as medical and  cultural awareness Web-based training. Officials said, however, that while  training is encouraged, it is not required, and that the command does not  currently monitor the completion of training courses. We requested to  review training presentations provided to incoming AFRICOM staff. Our  review of the 10 training presentations that were provided to us by the  command found that they did not contain cultural awareness information.  However, AFRICOM stated that there are 2 hours on Africa cultural  awareness provided to new command staff during the first day of training,  though we were not given documentation of this training. Additionally, our  review found that 7 of the 10 training presentations that we were provided  did not contain interagency information. The remaining 3 presentations  provided an overview of AFRICOM partners, including international  government organizations, nongovernmental organizations, and other  federal government agencies; identified the interagency partners at the  command; and provided more detailed information on one specific federal  agency. While these training presentations offered some suggestions for  planning and cooperative opportunities with other federal agencies, we  found that they were brief and lacked specific guidance on how to involve  interagency partners. Furthermore, because the presentations are  provided during the beginning of tours, when personnel are also learning  about their new assignments and daily operations, it is unlikely that they  provide for comprehensive, effective training.", "AFRICOM issued joint training guidance in December 2009 that included  as a training goal the need to work with other federal agencies, but the  guidance lacks specific actions to reach this goal as well as measures to  evaluate progress and effects. Moreover, the guidance states that  AFRICOM will develop predeployment guidance for personnel, but we  noted that no time frames were provided for when the guidance will be  issued. In our prior work on AFRICOM\u2019s Horn of Africa task force, we  reported that the task force\u2019s training on working with U.S. embassies was  not shared with all staff, and cultural awareness training was limited. We  recommended, and DOD agreed, that AFRICOM develop comprehensive  training guidance or a program that augments assigned personnel\u2019s  understanding of African cultural awareness and working with interagency  partners. Since our report, AFRICOM has taken some steps to increase  training opportunities for task force personnel. For example, we reviewed  an extensive briefing on East African culture that the task force said is  now being provided to all incoming task force personnel. In addition, the  task force stated that its sociocultural research and advisory teams  provide some task force personnel with cultural and political training  when needed, including training for some personnel prior to deployment.  Finally, the task force said that online training on cultural awareness is  now available to all task force personnel, and that it intends to make this  training mandatory in the future.", "Formal training is important because it would help institutionalize  practices in the command. Officials from AFRICOM\u2019s Army, Marine Corps,  and Air Force components and task force all voiced a preference for more  cultural training and capabilities, with Army officials noting that staff do  not have sufficient understanding of the size, diversity, and unique  problems confronting the different regions of Africa. In addition, during  our observation of Natural Fire 10, an Air Force official told us that his  team received no training on Ugandan culture prior to its deployment. An  AFRICOM official told us it would be beneficial to have increased  sociocultural training at the command\u2019s headquarters as well as a database  to monitor training completion. AFRICOM\u2019s Air Force component officials  told us that they have begun working with the Air Force Cultural Language  Center to develop a Web-based, African cultural awareness training for Air  Force personnel deploying on AFRICOM activities, but officials noted that  AFRICOM had not provided any cultural awareness training to the Air  Force. Several officials from other federal agencies suggested possible  courses that might be cost-effective or easy for AFRICOM to implement,  such as a State online course focused on working with U.S. embassies,  curricula at the Foreign Service Institute that prepare U.S. embassy  personnel, or training similar to that provided to Peace Corps volunteers.  State also recommended that AFRICOM develop best practices for  working more effectively and efficiently with other agencies to ensure that  any lessons learned are institutionalized within the command. In June  2010, AFRICOM held a symposium to discuss how to augment language,  regional expertise, and cultural competence capabilities. The command  identified some options under consideration to improve capabilities,  including possibly establishing an office to develop training initiatives,  holding an annual symposium, and developing a newsletter with articles  by personnel about their deployment experiences. These considerations  reflect the command\u2019s recognition that it needs to improve its personnel\u2019s  expertise. However, until AFRICOM develops, requires, and monitors  training for all of its personnel on working with interagency partners and  understanding African cultural issues, it continues to risk being unable to  fully leverage resources with U.S. embassy personnel, build relationships  with African nations, and effectively carry out activities."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Building the capacity of partner nations to secure and defend themselves  has become a key focus of DOD, and AFRICOM\u2019s focus on supporting  security and stability in Africa has the potential to advance this effort.  Despite initial concerns among stakeholders about the potential U.S.  militarization of foreign policy or increasing the U.S. military footprint on  the continent, AFRICOM has made progress in developing overarching  strategies and trying to engage interagency partners. Moreover, since our  April 2010 report on AFRICOM\u2019s task force, efforts have been made to  begin to evaluate some task force activities in the Horn of Africa.  However, AFRICOM still faces challenges that could limit its effectiveness.  Until the command completes supporting plans to guide activity planning  and implementation and begins consistently conducting long-term  assessments of activities, it cannot ensure that the actions it is taking on  the continent best support DOD and U.S. foreign policy objectives. On a  broader level, without plans and assessments, AFRICOM lacks the critical  information it needs to make successful future planning decisions and to  allocate resources to maximize its effect in Africa. Moreover, while many  U.S. embassies and federal partners now believe that AFRICOM has the  potential to make positive contributions in Africa, until the command  more fully incorporates interagency partners into its activity planning  process, AFRICOM continues to risk the perception\u2014or worse, the  possibility\u2014of conducting activities that may counter U.S. foreign policy  interests or lead to unintended consequences. Finally, assigning more than  4,000 personnel and forces to AFRICOM and its components illustrates  DOD\u2019s commitment to conducting activities in Africa.

USAID chose not to provide any comments.", "DOD concurred with our first recommendation that AFRICOM  synchronize activities among AFRICOM\u2019s components by expediting the  completion of its supporting plans and developing a process whereby  plans are reviewed on a recurring basis. In its response, the department  stated that, in the absence of supporting plans, AFRICOM conducts weekly  meetings at which its components and the Horn of Africa task force  discuss the status of current activities and future events. The department  added that AFRICOM uses an information database to manage events  conducted by the command and its components. We noted these efforts in  our report, and we agree that it is a good practice for AFRICOM to  coordinate with its components through weekly meetings and an  information database. However, as our report states, component officials  have noted that within AFRICOM the use of the database is preliminary,  that the database may not include all component activities, and that  coordinating defense efforts in Africa remains a challenge. Furthermore,  DOD stated in its response that regional engagement plans and component  support plans are in the final stages of review and approval by AFRICOM\u2019s  leadership, and will be used by the staff and components to guide and  synchronize activities even though the plans have not been formally  approved. The department added that country work plans are being  developed for the command\u2019s critical partners as identified in the theater  campaign plan. However, the department\u2019s response did not include a  specific time frame for completion of AFRICOM\u2019s plans. Such a time frame  is critical, given that AFRICOM has repeatedly postponed the completion  of several of its supporting plans. Until AFRICOM finalizes and approves  its plans, AFRICOM risks conducting activities that do not fully support its  mission and may hinder a unity of effort among its components.", "DOD also concurred with our second recommendation that AFRICOM  conduct long-term assessments of the full range of its activities. The  department stated that its Horn of Africa task force is now required to  report on the effectiveness of its activities\u2014which we note in our report.  Moreover, the department stated that all AFRICOM operations and  planning orders now include tasks to staff and components to develop  metrics and indicators and to conduct assessments; however, we were not  provided copies of these documents during our review. If these actions are  implemented in a comprehensive manner such that they require long-term  evaluation of all AFRICOM activities, they have the potential to provide  the command with valuable information on whether its activities are  having their intended effects or whether modifications are needed.  Completing thorough long-term assessments of its activities will aid in the  command\u2019s efforts to make successful future planning decisions and  allocate resources to maximize its effect in Africa.", "DOD also concurred with our third recommendation that AFRICOM take  actions to ensure that its components\u2019 and Offices of Security  Cooperation\u2019s budget personnel have the appropriate expertise and  knowledge to make timely and accurate funding decisions for activities.  DOD fully agreed with us regarding with the need to improve the use of  security cooperation tools through training, staff changes, and better  guidance. DOD further stated that while AFRICOM has Title 10 authorities  to conduct traditional military activities and operations, the activities that  are most important to the department in Africa center around building  institutional and operational security capacity and that most of the  authorities and funding for these activities belong to State Department  programs under Title 22 authorities. In our report, we acknowledge  AFRICOM\u2019s reports of having access to several funding sources, as well as  influence over some State and USAID funding sources, and that many  different funding sources may be required for an activity. We also note in  our report that DOD, in its 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review, stated that  U.S. security assistance efforts are constrained by a complex patchwork of  authorities. We maintain that, given the challenges associated with  applying various funding sources to activities in Africa, AFRICOM should  identify and complete specific actions\u2014such as training, staffing changes,  and/or comprehensive guidance\u2014to increase understanding among its  budget staff and institutionalize knowledge throughout the command.", "DOD also concurred with our fourth recommendation that AFRICOM fully  integrate interagency personnel and partners into the formative stages of  the command\u2019s activity planning processes to better leverage interagency  expertise.

In our report, we highlighted the civilian deputy as a  positive example of AFRICOM\u2019s efforts to integrate interagency personnel  into the command. DOD also noted that it continues to pursue qualified  interagency representatives to work in management and staff positions at  AFRICOM, will work with its partners to prepare personnel for assignment  in a military organization, and encourages interagency partners to fill  vacant positions and reward their detailees for taking assignments at  AFRICOM. Our review highlights some efforts AFRICOM has taken to  integrate its interagency partners into command planning and  operations\u2014such as developing a training and orientation program for  embedded interagency personnel. We also state in our report that staffing  shortages at other federal agencies reduce those agencies\u2019 ability to send  additional staff to AFRICOM. DOD\u2019s response does not indicate how  AFRICOM intends to better integrate interagency personnel into the  formative stages of activity planning, which would help AFRICOM better  leverage interagency expertise and promote a U.S. government unity of  effort in Africa.", "Finally, DOD concurred with our fifth recommendation that AFRICOM  develop a comprehensive training program on working with interagency  partners and African cultural issues. DOD noted that AFRICOM has  developed cultural awareness training for all incoming headquarters  personnel, which is mandatory and tracked. We include in our report that  AFRICOM told us it allots 2 hours to Africa cultural awareness during the  first day of training for new command staff. However, since presentations  are given at the beginning of tours, when personnel are also learning about  their new assignments and daily operations, we believe that it is unlikely  that this constitutes comprehensive, effective training. The department  also stated that AFRICOM\u2019s Horn of Africa task force personnel receive  Web-based and in-country training as part of newcomers\u2019 orientation. As  we note in our report, we reviewed the task force\u2019s briefing on East  African culture and found it to be extensive and a positive step toward  training personnel.

Additionally, DOD did not address  how AFRICOM would mandate staff participation in any training it  develops.

We chose to visit Uganda to observe the AFRICOM-sponsored,  U.S. Army Africa\u2013led Natural Fire 10 exercise, AFRICOM\u2019s largest exercise  in Africa for 2009; Ethiopia, due to its proximity to Djibouti and large  amount of task force civil-affairs team activity proposals; and Djibouti, due  to the location of the task force at Camp Lemonnier. As part of our review  of AFRICOM\u2019s task force, in January 2010 we observed and obtained  documentation from an academic training and mission rehearsal exercise  for incoming task force staff in Suffolk, Virginia. Additionally, we  interviewed DOD officials at the Office of the Secretary of Defense, Joint  Staff, and the Defense Security Cooperation Agency.", "We also reviewed non-DOD documents to determine how AFRICOM\u2019s  strategies compared or aligned with the strategies of other government  partners, including the fiscal years 2007\u20132012 Department of State /U.S.  Agency for International Development Joint Strategic Plan; USAID  Strategic Framework for Africa; and fiscal year 2008, fiscal year 2009, and  fiscal year 2010 mission strategic plans of 12 U.S. embassies in Africa. We  interviewed officials at the Department of State (State), the U.S. Agency  for International Development (USAID), and the Coast Guard to obtain  other federal agencies\u2019 perspectives on AFRICOM\u2019s process of planning  and implementing activities, including the command\u2019s considerations of  interagency perspectives. We spoke with officials from State and USAID  due to their relationship with DOD in supporting U.S. foreign policy  objectives, and we met with officials from the Coast Guard due to their  relationship with AFRICOM in its maritime activities. We met with U.S.  embassy officials in Uganda, Ethiopia, and Djibouti, and we contacted 20  additional embassies throughout Africa: Algeria, Botswana, Burundi,  Chad, Comoros/Madagascar, Democratic Republic of Congo, Eritrea,  Ghana, Kenya, Liberia, Mauritius/Seychelles, Morocco, Mozambique,  Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, South Africa, Sudan, Tanzania, and Yemen. We  chose to contact these specific embassies based on several factors  including that they were in countries that coordinate with AFRICOM\u2019s task  force; their involvement with the two activities we observed in detail,  Africa Partnership Station and Natural Fire 10 (see below); and their  geographical dispersion to ensure that various regions were represented  across Africa. When multiple countries met our criteria, we gave  preference to U.S. embassies located in countries that were identified by  DOD officials or in documents as important countries for AFRICOM. In  addition, we met with an organization that represents U.S.-based  international nongovernmental organizations that conduct work in Africa,  as well as some African government and African military officials, to  obtain their viewpoints on AFRICOM\u2019s activities.", "We observed two AFRICOM activities in depth to complement our broader  review of the command\u2019s activities at the interagency and command levels.  These two activities were: Africa Partnership Station (a maritime safety  and security activity) and Natural Fire 10 (part of AFRICOM\u2019s pandemic  preparedness and response initiative). In choosing which of AFRICOM\u2019s  over 100 activities to review as illustrative examples, we first narrowed the  activities to 30 main activities that support AFRICOM in achieving its  theater strategic objectives, as identified by AFRICOM officials. We then  chose to review the Africa Partnership Station and Natural Fire 10  activities due to factors such as their addressing of different theater  security objectives, timeliness to our review, leadership by different  military service components, considerable involvement of interagency and  international partners, size of the activities, and distinct geographic  locations. To review the Africa Partnership Station, we observed the  activity\u2019s main planning conference in New York, New York, in July 2009;  reviewed documentation including reports and assessments; and spoke to  officials at DOD, AFRICOM, U.S. Navy Africa, Coast Guard, State, and  USAID, as well as nongovernmental organizations and African military  officials. To review Natural Fire 10, we observed the Natural Fire 10  exercise in Uganda in October 2009; reviewed documentation including  guidance, plans, reports, and assessments; and spoke to officials at DOD,  AFRICOM, U.S. Army Africa, State, and USAID, as well as African military  officials, about the activity. These two activities serve as examples, and  information about them is not meant to be generalized to all AFRICOM  activities. We supplemented our examination of the Africa Partnership  Station and Natural Fire 10 with information on additional activities  highlighted by AFRICOM, AFRICOM\u2019s military service components and  task force, DOD, State, and USAID officials during our review, as well as  by two GAO reports that addressed AFRICOM activities: one that  examined the Trans-Sahara Counterterrorism Partnership, Operation  Enduring Freedom\u2013Trans Sahara, and one that partially reviewed the Global Peace  Operations Initiative and Africa Contingency Operations Training and  Assistance activities.", "Operation Enduring Freedom\u2013Trans Sahara is designed to strengthen the ability of  regional governments to police large expanses of remote terrain in the Trans-Sahara.", "Management portal; Force Allocation Decision Framework; Chairman,  Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction 7401.01E on the Combatant Commander\u2019s  Initiative Fund; and AFRICOM training presentations. We spoke with  officials at AFRICOM, its military service components, special operations  command, and task force about their respective strategic planning efforts.  To examine AFRICOM\u2019s assessment of activities, we reviewed a  presentation of AFRICOM\u2019s strategic assessment tool as well as activity  assessment requirements in the command\u2019s theater campaign plan and the  task force\u2019s draft regional engagement plan. We spoke with officials at  DOD, AFRICOM, AFRICOM\u2019s components, U.S. embassies, and other  federal agencies to assess whether the command\u2019s activities support  AFRICOM\u2019s mission and reflect the most effective use of resources. In  examining funding for activities, we reviewed AFRICOM\u2019s funding sources  as well as the available funding for the Africa Partnership Station and  Natural Fire 10 activities. We also reviewed a GAO report that examined  the use of funds under the programs authorized in Sections 1206 and 1207  of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006. AFRICOM  provided data on the funding amounts for its activities in fiscal year 2009,  which were drawn from the Standard Army Finance Information System.  We assessed the reliability of the finance information system through  interviews with personnel responsible for maintaining and overseeing  these data systems. Additionally, we assessed the quality control measures  in place to ensure that the data are reliable for reporting purposes. We  found the funding amount data reported by AFRICOM to be sufficiently  reliable for the purposes of this review. To review efforts at interagency  collaboration and building expertise, we examined agreements between  AFRICOM and interagency partners, training guidance, and training  programs. We spoke with interagency partners embedded at AFRICOM, at  U.S. embassies in Africa, and at other federal agency offices.", "We conducted this performance audit from April 2009 through July 2010 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those  standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient,  appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence  obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Comments from the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Marie Mak, Assistant Director;  Kathryn Bolduc; Alissa Czyz; Robert Heilman; Lonnie McAllister; James  Michels; Steven Putansu; Jodie Sandel; Erin Smith; and Cheryl Weissman  made major contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
