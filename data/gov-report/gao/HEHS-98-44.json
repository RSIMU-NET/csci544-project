The act established Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), a block grant program for which federal funds are capped at $16.4 billion a year through fiscal year 2002. Through these block grants, the new law granted broad discretion to the states for designing their welfare programs. The law also limited the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 (HHS) regulatory authority over the states\u2019 welfare programs.", "The new welfare law, however, still requires HHS to fulfill many important mandates. Among these new mandates, it directs HHS to reduce its staffing level by 245 full-time equivalent (FTE) positions for those programs converted to block grants under the law\u2014essentially the AFDC and Job Opportunities and Basic Skills Training (JOBS) programs\u2014and to reduce its FTE levels for managerial positions by 60 within the Department. And while the law significantly narrowed HHS\u2019 regulatory authority, HHS remains the primary federal agency responsible for providing oversight of states\u2019 welfare programs. For example, HHS is responsible for developing regulations for specific areas, including establishing various state reporting requirements and penalties for noncompliance with the law. The law also requires HHS to develop a formula to reward \u201chigh performing\u201d states\u2014those that achieve the goals of the law. In addition, HHS is to conduct research on the benefits, costs, and effects of the new welfare law. The Department may also assist states in developing innovative approaches for reducing welfare dependency and increasing child well-being and is responsible for evaluating these approaches.", "Given the significant change in HHS\u2019 role, you asked us to review HHS\u2019 implementation of the new mandates. Specifically, you asked that we report on (1) the extent to which HHS reduced its FTEs to the levels prescribed by the law; (2) the clarity, timeliness, and usefulness of HHS\u2019 guidance and technical assistance to the states in implementing TANF; (3) the status of HHS\u2019 work in establishing performance measures to use in implementing the high-performance bonus program; and (4) the status of HHS\u2019 welfare research and evaluation efforts.", "To address these objectives, we conducted interviews with staff from the budget and program offices in HHS\u2019 Office of the Secretary and Administration for Children and Families (ACF) and staff from national state association groups headquartered in Washington, D.C. We also reviewed fiscal year 1995, 1996, and 1997 documentation from these offices. To address the first objective, we reviewed time and attendance data and staff rosters from the Office of the Secretary and ACF and personnel data from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Since the law does not specify how HHS was to accomplish its FTE reductions, we ascertained HHS\u2019 interpretation of the law and the actions it took to accomplish the reductions and analyzed and verified the reductions that it made. Principles of administrative law generally allow the executive agency charged with carrying out the law to interpret the legislation. To address the second objective, we examined HHS\u2019 policy memorandums, letters to states, and other written material and discussed state issues about the guidance with national state associations. We also surveyed state welfare directors in the 50 states and the District of Columbia to gather their opinions about HHS\u2019 guidance and help. State responses reported in our study reflect states\u2019 opinions prior to HHS\u2019 issuance of proposed TANF regulations in November 1997. For objective three, we examined concept papers by HHS, the American Public Welfare Association (APWA), and the National Governors\u2019 Association (NGA). To address objective four, we reviewed research funding announcements and descriptive compendiums and budget documents. To augment our work at the national level, we conducted site visits with two of HHS\u2019 regional offices and one state in each of the two regions.

Using this definition, HHS considered that it had met the requirement to reduce FTE levels for managerial positions by 60 through staff reductions in the Office of the Secretary.", "Between fiscal years 1995, 1996, and 1997, the Office of the Secretary reduced its authorized FTE level by 613; its reduction in the number of actual FTEs was approximately 354. This reduction in FTE levels resulted from a number of changes initiated before and after the passage of the welfare reform law. These changes included the Federal Workforce Restructuring Act of 1994, which required agencies governmentwide to reduce their workforce, and major restructuring efforts that occurred in HHS\u2019 Office of the Secretary during this period, such as separating the Social Security Administration from HHS; consolidating the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Management and Budget and the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Personnel Administration; abolishing the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health and creating a new Office of Public Health and Science; and transferring responsibility for personnel, finance, and contract operations from the Office of the Secretary to HHS\u2019 new Program Support Center.", "By March 1997, the numerous downsizing and reorganization efforts within HHS had affected the number of staff in the Office of the Secretary holding senior and mid-level management responsibility.

HHS\u2019 final regulations on such requirements could change the type of client the state would select for such a program. Twenty-nine states also reported design and implementation problems for data collection and reporting.

One state official explained to us that his state was converting to an automated data system and that modifications to the system would be expensive, but he is assuming they will have to make some once the final regulations are issued.

In our survey, 14 states mentioned this specific concern.

However, the Department is having difficulty meeting its responsibility for developing and issuing the TANF and high-performance bonus regulations. While a statutory deadline for the TANF regulations was not provided, the need for HHS to quickly issue the regulations became apparent given that states could, and did, begin implementing their TANF programs shortly after the law was enacted. Yet HHS did not issue proposed TANF regulations until November 1997, and final regulations are not expected to be issued until sometime in spring 1998. This same need for early direction arose with the bonus regulations because states wanted to be sure that the data collection systems they were putting in place would collect the data needed to compete for a bonus. Given the status of states\u2019 implementation of welfare reform, the prompt issuance of the TANF and high-performance bonus regulations is of utmost importance so that states\u2019 investment in systems and programs can be made wisely."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["HHS commented on a draft of this report and generally concurred with our findings.

We did not endorse the manner in which HHS accomplished its FTE reductions but simply determined HHS\u2019 interpretation of the FTE provision, described their interpretation, and analyzed both FTE and staff data in the context of that interpretation and other alternative criteria. Our report also points out that in cases where a statute is unclear, principles of administrative law allow the agency charged with carrying out a law to make such interpretations.", "HHS also provided technical comments, which we addressed in the report, as appropriate.", "As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce its contents earlier, we plan no further distribution of this report until 30 days from the date of this letter.

HHS counted this reduction as addressing the provision in the federal welfare reform law. We decided to measure the FTE changes in OFA and the Office of the Secretary annually, beginning fiscal year 1995, in order to develop a complete picture of the changes that occurred.

The Office of the Secretary did not object to this date, pointing out that most of its reductions had been made during fiscal year 1995. Because the effective starting date for TANF was the effective ending date for AFDC and JOBS, we considered this a reasonable date for completing the reduction of FTEs that the federal welfare reform law deemed were no longer needed to administer the new welfare program.
