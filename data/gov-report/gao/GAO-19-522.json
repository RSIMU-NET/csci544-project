An estimated 55 percent of student parents were single parents, 44 percent were working full-time while enrolled, and 64 percent attended school part-time. Undergraduate student parents had fewer financial resources to fund their education than students without children. Nearly half of student parents reported paying for child care, with monthly costs averaging about $490.

Education measures participants' persistence in school and graduation rate to assess the performance of the CCAMPIS program. However, flaws in its calculations of these two measures prevented Education from reporting reliable results, making it difficult for Education and Congress to evaluate the program's effectiveness.", "Some student parents could be eligible to increase their federal student loans to help pay for child care by asking their schools to include an allowance for dependent care expenses in their financial aid calculations.

Students with  dependent children in paid child care are allowed to request a dependent  care allowance as part of their financial aid calculation, but whether it  provides them with additional financial aid depends largely on other  school costs. For example, at higher-cost schools, these students may  already be eligible for the maximum amount of federal student loans  before adding this allowance. In these situations, requesting a  dependent care allowance would not increase the amount of federal  student loans available to the student because they have already reached  the maximum. At lower-cost schools, such as community colleges, costs  may be low enough to allow student parents to access additional federal  student loans by adding a dependent care allowance. According to our  analysis of 2016 NPSAS data, an estimated 2.6 million student parents  nationwide were eligible for a lower federal loan amount than the  maximum allowable loan amount, so that adding a dependent care  allowance might make them eligible for a higher federal loan amount.", "Figure 6 illustrates how adding a dependent care allowance can affect a  student\u2019s federal student loan amount at a school with a relatively low  cost of attendance. In this example, adding a $3,000 dependent care  allowance to a student\u2019s cost of attendance increases the amount of federal student loans the student can borrow without exceeding the  maximum amount available ($9,500 for a first-year, independent  undergraduate student). At a higher-cost school, however, a student may  already be eligible for the maximum possible loan amount, so adding a  dependent care allowance would not affect how much the student could  take out in federal student loans.", "Officials from seven of the 13 schools we interviewed said that adding a  dependent care allowance would more likely increase the amount of  federal student loans a student can borrow, rather than increase a  student\u2019s access to grant or scholarship aid.

Officials at the eight schools that had included  this allowance in recent years reported different ways of determining the  amount of the allowance. At two of these schools, officials said they allot  a fixed amount for the dependent care allowance. Officials at the other six  schools said allowance amounts are flexible and based on students\u2019  documented child care expenses, and can vary depending on the number  of children in child care.", "Fixed. One school in the Northwest surveys local child care providers  annually to determine the community standard rate each year and  bases its dependent care allowance amount on the average market  value in the area, according to a school official. This rate is two tiered.  The first tier is for children ages 0-5 and is $552 per month and the  second is for children ages 6-12, with a monthly allowance of $276. At  a school in the Midwest, an official said that the school provides a  fixed allowance amount to all students who indicate they have a  dependent child on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid  (FAFSA). The allowance amount is based on the student\u2019s enrollment  status (e.g., $900 per school year for a student enrolled full-time). The  school included a dependent care allowance for 30 percent of  students who received financial aid in 2017-2018, according to a  school official.", "Flexible. At one school in the South, students can request a  dependent care allowance based on their actual child care expenses,  according to a school official. Financial aid officials at the school use  their judgment to determine if the request is reasonable for the  community and may request documentation for requests exceeding  $2,500 per semester. For example, students with more than one child  may spend more than $2,500 per semester on child care. An official at another school in the West said it does not set limits for the  allowance, but financial aid counselors use their judgment to counsel  students if the requested amount looks too high for the student\u2019s  circumstances. The average allowance amount at this school is  between $600 and $1,000 per month.", "Not all students may want to increase their student loans to finance their  child care costs while in school, but access to additional federal student  loans could be a useful option for those students who need it. We  previously reported that officials at a national association of community  colleges said that low-income students often use federal loans to help  them pay for basic living expenses. These loans can be a valuable  resource for some students who need additional funds to support  themselves while in college, but some school officials cautioned that  loans may not be the best choice for all students, and may worsen the  financial position of already vulnerable students. However, two recent  studies of 2-year students examined how federal financial aid improved  students\u2019 college outcomes.

Education has used its handbook to  encourage schools to adopt other suggested practices, such as informing  students about how to save money on textbooks by either renting them or  purchasing used copies. Moreover, Education officials said that they  could include language in the handbook encouraging schools, as a best  practice, to include information about the dependent care allowance on  school websites along with other college cost information. Federal  standards for internal control state that management should consider the  availability of information and the extent to which information is readily  available to the intended audience.

(Recommendation 3)"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to HHS and Education for review and  comment. HHS provided technical comments, which we incorporated as  appropriate. Education provided written comments, which are reproduced  in appendix III.", "In its comments, Education stated that the report inaccurately  characterizes the CCAMPIS performance data as unreliable and  disagreed with the recommendation to correctly calculate its CCAMPIS  persistence rate and cost per persistent student measures  (recommendation 1). Regarding this first recommendation, Education  acknowledged one error in its persistence rate calculation that affected  the accuracy of both the persistence rate and cost per persistent student  measures that it reported in its fiscal year 2020 budget justification to  Congress. The agency noted that it plans to correct this error in its fiscal  year 2021 budget justification. In addition, Education stated that it would  explore a different model for calculating the persistence rate. While we  support Education\u2019s plans to correct the error it acknowledged and  explore another model for calculating the persistence rate, Education\u2019s  persistence rate calculation has additional errors that the agency needs to  correct to accurately calculate the CCAMPIS program\u2019s persistence rate.  For example, as we stated in the report, Education\u2019s calculations did not  include students who transferred, which the agency has reported should  be included in its persistence rate measure. Moreover, we identified other  technical errors in the numerator and denominator of Education\u2019s  formulas. For example, when calculating the persistence rate for  CCAMPIS participants, Education counted students who declined to  participate in the CCAMPIS program. We continue to believe that it is  important for Education to report reliable program information to oversee  and monitor the program and to provide accurate information to  Congress. To do this, Education needs to take additional action to  address all of the errors in its persistence calculations.", "Education disagreed with the recommendation to collect the CCAMPIS  participant enrollment data needed to calculate a standard 3-year  graduation rate or accurately define and calculate a different college  completion measure (recommendation 2). Education stated that it could  address our concerns with a modification to the description of the  measure published in the agency\u2019s budget justification. Specifically,  Education said it plans to clarify that, for graduation rate data published  for fiscal year 2020 and prior years, the term \u201cwithin 3 years of  enrollment\u201d means within 3 years of enrolling in the CCAMPIS program.  However, as we stated in the report, Education\u2019s calculations do not align  with this measure either. As for future years, the agency stated that it will  explore transitioning to a new model of tracking CCAMPIS students over  time, which, as described, would be consistent with Education\u2019s standard  graduation rate. However, Education noted that it must carefully balance  the need to collect more informative and reliable data from grantees with  the need to avoid adding unnecessary reporting burdens. We recognize  that collecting the enrollment data needed to calculate the standard  graduation rate could place a burden on grantee schools. Our  recommendation therefore gives Education the option to define a different  college completion measure and calculate it correctly. We continue to  believe that Education needs to take steps to either collect the necessary  enrollment data to calculate a standard 3-year graduation rate or correctly  calculate a modified college completion measure.", "Education disagreed with the recommendation to encourage schools\u2014 through appropriate means, such as the FSA Handbook\u2014to inform  students via school websites about the availability of the dependent care  allowance and how to request the allowance (recommendation 3).  Education stated that it believes it would be inappropriate to  indiscriminately encourage all schools to encourage student parents to  borrow additional loans without considering a student\u2019s individual financial  circumstances. We did not suggest that schools should encourage all  student parents to borrow additional loans to pay for child care. Instead,  we recommended that Education encourage schools to make students  aware of this potential option\u2014which federal law makes available to  students\u2014to allow them to make informed financial decisions based on  their personal circumstances. We made this recommendation because  we found that schools were not consistently sharing information with  students about the dependent care allowance or how to request one. We  further recognized in the report that not all students may want to increase  their student loans to finance their child care costs while in school;  however, access to additional federal student loans could be a useful  option for those students who may need it, so we believe students should  be aware of this potential option.", "Education also stated that it would be inappropriate for the agency to  require schools to take actions that could erode their student loan  repayment and default rates. We did not recommend that Education  require schools to take any action; rather, we recommended that  Education encourage schools to inform students about a potentially  available federal resource. In addition, Education did not provide any  evidence that being aware of or using the dependent care allowance  would negatively affect student loan repayment or default rates. Further,  access to additional financial resources can help some students succeed  in school if it allows them to work less and study more. For example, as  cited in the report, recent research suggests that additional federal  financial aid, including student loans, can lead to improved academic  outcomes for some students.", "Education also expressed concerns about students borrowing more and  noted there are numerous federal, state, local, and private options that  offer low-income students affordable or no-cost child care. Education  noted that the federal Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF)  provides significant resources for student parents. However, as we noted  in the report, some states either fund very few families pursuing education  or training or have implemented policies that restrict access to CCDF  subsidies for college students. Education also noted that many colleges,  as well as countless faith-based organizations offer affordable or no-cost  child care to low-income students. However, we found that nearly half of  student parents reported paying for child care, with costs averaging about  $490 per month. Moreover, even colleges that received a CCAMPIS grant  had significant waiting lists for assistance and reported more children on  waiting lists for CCAMPIS assistance than children receiving subsidized  care from the CCAMPIS program.", "Finally, Education noted that the Federal Student Aid Handbook already  contains information about the dependent care allowance and its  inclusion in students\u2019 financial aid calculations. While the handbook does  include information to help school financial aid administrators implement a  dependent care allowance appropriately, it is not a resource directed at  student parents. For this reason, we recommended that Education  encourage schools to take steps to inform students about the dependent  care allowance and how to request one.

NPSAS data  contain nationally representative, detailed demographic and financial aid  data for college students enrolled in postsecondary education programs.  These data come from institutional records, government databases, and  interviews with students. We also analyzed Beginning Postsecondary  Students Longitudinal Study (BPS) data from 2008-2009. BPS tracks  students over a 6-year period and collects both survey and transcript  data. The most recently completed BPS cohort first enrolled in  postsecondary education in the 2003-2004 school year. We assessed the  reliability of the NPSAS and BPS data by reviewing existing information  about the data and the system that produced them.

We selected these two schools based on expert and agency  recommendations and research. We also considered level of degree  program (2-year and 4-year) and geographic diversity. We also  conducted descriptive analysis of the performance data that CCAMPIS  grantees reported to Education for the 2016-2017 school year, the most  recently available performance data at the time of our review.

Instead, Education uses the detailed information  grantees provide for each student. This student-level data includes  student demographic information, the number of children served,  CCAMPIS child care subsidies received, and child care fees paid.  Grantees also report each student\u2019s CCAMPIS participation and  academic enrollment during four academic terms (fall, winter, spring, and  summer).", "To assess the reliability of the CCAMPIS performance data, we reviewed  related program documentation, interviewed knowledgeable agency  officials, and conducted electronic data testing for missing data, outliers,  and logical errors. When we reviewed the student-level data, we identified  instances of incomplete and inconsistent data that affected which  students could be identified as participating in the CCAMPIS program. To  address these concerns, we excluded from our analysis students that  grantees reported as having 1) declined to participate in CCAMPIS for  each of the four academic terms, 2) no enrollment information for any of  the four academic terms, and 3) an enrollment code not included in  Education\u2019s report instructions. We discussed our methodology for  identifying program participants with Education officials, who agreed with  our approach. We also omitted from our analysis any student for whom  grantees reported duplicate information. After these corrections, we  determined that CCAMPIS student-level performance data were  sufficiently reliable for the purpose of describing participant  characteristics. We determined that selected summary variables  reported elsewhere in grantees\u2019 performance reports were similarly  reliable for the purpose of describing child care services funded and  number of children on waiting lists.", "We also examined Education\u2019s calculations underlying the CCAMPIS  program\u2019s performance measures that the agency reported in its fiscal  year 2020 budget justification to Congress and assessed them against  federal internal control standards related to data quality.

We selected these schools to achieve a mix of  schools that did and did not publicize the availability of the dependent  care allowance on their websites, as well as degree levels (2-year and 4- year), and geographic diversity. We also considered the cost of  attendance for the average low-income student, after grant or scholarship  aid. We also analyzed the characteristics of all 62 schools using 2016-2017 data, the latest available, from Education\u2019s Integrated  Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS), and examined the  characteristics in the context of our website analysis. We also interviewed  federal officials from Education about the information the agency provides  to schools about the dependent care allowance. We assessed the  reliability of the IPEDS data by reviewing existing information about the  data and the system that produced them, and determined they were  reliable for our purposes. We assessed Education\u2019s practices against  federal internal control standards for communicating with external parties.", "We conducted this performance audit from April 2018 to August 2019 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Estimated Percentages of Selected Demographics for Student Parents and All Other Undergraduate Students, 2015-2016", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the U.S. Department of Education", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the individual named above, Michelle St. Pierre (Assistant  Director), Karissa Robie (Analyst-in-Charge), Jennifer Cook, and Marissa  Jones Friedman made key contributions to this report.
