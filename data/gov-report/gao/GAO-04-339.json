In general, reforms under the Secretary General's authority were progressing more quickly than those requiring member states' approval. Since 1997, the Secretariat has implemented reforms to provide more unified leadership and coordination across departments and offices. However, the Secretariat has implemented other reforms, such as developing a written plan or establishing a new office, that are only the first step in achieving the Secretary General's overall goals. Reforms in four key areas of U.N. operations are in various stages. First, the Secretariat has taken positive steps to strengthen its human capital management, but reforms in this area are ongoing and additional challenges remain. Second, the U.N. has begun to adopt results-oriented budgeting, but its monitoring and evaluation system does not measure program impact. Third, although the Secretariat reorganized its public information department, reforms of library management and publications are not fully in place. Fourth, the Secretariat's human rights office implemented the majority of its management reforms but does not have the authority to implement reforms outside the Secretariat. U.N. reform faces several challenges. For example, the Secretariat does not conduct comprehensive assessments of the status and impact of U.N. reforms. In addition, the reform agendas lack clearly stated priorities, interim goals, and target dates for overall completion. Other challenges include resistance to change from program managers and possible resource constraints."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The United Nations\u2019 regular budget for the 2004-2005 biennium exceeds   $3 billion for the first time.

In light of these  increasing demands, the Secretary General and member states have called  on the Secretariat to better define priorities and eliminate outdated  activities. These calls have also highlighted the need for more accountable  leadership and improvements in key management practices. In 1997, the  Secretary General launched a major reform initiative to restructure U.N.  leadership and operations, develop a results-oriented human capital  system, and introduce a performance-based programming and budgeting  process. In May 2000, we reported that, while the Secretary General had  substantially reorganized the Secretariat\u2019s leadership and structure, he had  not yet completed reforms in human capital management and planning  and budgeting.

The United Nations\u2019 human capital  management had long been criticized by U.N. officials and external  observers for the extensive time required for recruiting and hiring, the  need for increased accountability for performance, and limited  development and promotion opportunities. In his 1997 plan, the Secretary  General stated that human capital management has been characterized by  labor-intensive day-to-day staff administration and cumbersome rules and  processes. He further stated that these rules and processes were seen as  impeding program delivery and not maximizing staff contributions.

Soon after  taking office, the Secretary General developed the 1997 reform plan for the  Secretariat. He established a new leadership and management structure  and began overhauling human capital policies to align the organization\u2019s  human capital capacity with its mission and structure. The Secretary  General also established core organizational values and competencies to  develop a results-oriented culture and has used this model to improve  recruitment, staff development, and performance management processes.

The Secretariat\u2019s  Office of Human Resources Management (OHRM) has begun to take on  additional responsibilities, including developing human capital policies,  monitoring compliance with these policies, and providing guidance on  human capital issues. In addition, OHRM has begun to provide more  automated services to employees. For example, the office has streamlined  human capital rules and procedures and has made the Human Resources  Handbook and personnel forms available online.

Program managers have been able  to electronically track these and other indicators daily using a new tool  developed by the Department of Management.", "The Secretary General also implemented a new electronic performance  appraisal system, introduced in 2002. Rather than having performance  management take place once a year, the new system emphasizes regular  conversations and feedback between staff and supervisors related to staff  performance.

In addition, although the Secretariat has an overall reform strategy  in place, this strategy does not include specific time frames to complete  reform actions.

For example, U.N. officials  stated that offices and programs working on humanitarian or development  assistance often needed to hire staff quickly during crisis situations around  the world. However, according to these officials, U.N. rules and  procedures have been a barrier to the hiring process. These officials  pointed out that the delegated hiring authority is only for employees under  regular budget positions on longer-term contracts. Field-based programs  and offices often hire staff under short-term contracts. U.N. officials stated  that the authority to hire these staff has not been decentralized. In his 2002  reform plan, the Secretary General also acknowledged the need to further  delegate responsibilities to managers.", "Second, one of the Secretary General\u2019s major reform initiatives was the  implementation of a staff mobility policy intended to facilitate the  movement of staff within and between offices and duty stations. The  policy establishes time limits of either 5 or 6 years for staff to occupy a  position, depending on the staff\u2019s grade level. Although the human capital  office is developing incentives for staff to move to hardship duty stations,  U.N. officials have identified key challenges that may impede the  successful implementation of the mobility policy when the requirements  go into effect in 2007. U.N. staff, for example, are employed under  different types of contracts, some of which place restrictions on the  duration of employment and the type of work an employee can undertake.  U.N. officials stated that the differences in employment contracts would  make it difficult to move staff to certain positions or locations. Another  barrier to staff mobility is spousal employment. Some countries place visa  and work permit restrictions on hiring U.N. employees\u2019 spouses. The  Secretary General has begun to negotiate with countries to ease the  restrictions on the employment of U.N. spouses.", "A related challenge is the need for further improvements in strategic  workforce planning, linked to strategic goals and objectives. Long-range  workforce planning will enable the organization to remain aware of and be  prepared for its current and future needs as an organization. The Secretary  General has recognized the need for building this capacity, emphasizing  the need for more systematic succession planning to account for the  expected increase in retirement of U.N. staff. Ultimately, the success of an  organization\u2019s workforce planning process can be judged by its results\u2014 how well it helps the agency attain its mission and strategic goals. We  have reported that other countries\u2019 succession planning and management  initiatives have addressed specific human capital challenges, such as  retention and the identification of staff with critical skills.", "Finally, U.N. officials stated that the Secretariat\u2019s new recruiting and  placement system has made screening the increased number of incoming  applications a challenge. These officials stated that the organization now  receives an average of approximately 1,000 applications for each vacancy  announcement, compared with a previous average of about 100  applications per opening.

This office also created a Web  site, which is updated regularly, to post information on best practices and  lessons learned. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and  Budgetary Questions noted an improvement in the clarity and detail of  expected results and performance indicators between the 2002-2003  biennium budget, which was the first submitted in a results-based format,  and the 2004-2005 budget.

Program managers are responsible  for monitoring and evaluating programs to assess their impact and to  determine the extent to which changes are needed to meet expected  results. However, in 2002, the Office of Internal Oversight Services  (OIOS) found that program managers and department and office heads  were not complying with U.N. regulations. For example, both OIOS and  oversight committees reported in 2002 that nearly half of program  managers were not regularly monitoring and evaluating program  performance. In addition, program managers were not held directly  accountable for meeting program objectives because U.N. regulations  prevent linking program effectiveness and impact with program managers\u2019  performance. U.N. officials told us that a more mature program monitoring  and evaluation system is needed before program managers can be held  responsible for program performance.", "We found that there were a variety of problems related to the Secretariat\u2019s  monitoring and evaluation of program results and impact. Most programs  do not have comprehensive monitoring and evaluation plans and, in many  cases, no systematic management review of evaluations. For example,  department heads and program managers did not directly review the  results of evaluation activities, consistent with U.N. guidance, in 13 out of  25 programs surveyed in 2001. OIOS reported that, overall, evaluation  findings were not used to improve program performance. In some cases,  such as with the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights,  monitoring and evaluation responsibilities were assigned to low-level staff  with minimal oversight from program managers. Further, adequate levels  of staff time and other resources needed to conduct evaluations have  never been assessed and programs were not regularly monitored and  evaluated, according to the U.N.\u2019s oversight office. For example, all U.N.  programs supporting the economic and social development of Asia and the  Pacific, which cost approximately $25 million for the biennium, were not  evaluated in 2000 and 2001.

As part of its strategy, OIOS  introduced an Internet-based system that allows program managers to  prepare periodic assessments of program impact against stated objectives.  Program managers are required to submit performance assessments after  12 and 18 months, and at the end of the budget period. OIOS officials  stated that this would allow them to adjust the direction of their program  to meet objectives before the end of the budget cycle.

In December 2003, the General Assembly passed a resolution changing the  role of the Committee for Program and Coordination, the first step toward  shifting the focus of oversight responsibility to assessing program impact.  The committee now focuses exclusively on reviewing activities planned to  meet program objectives and no longer reviews budgeting information.

In addition, the costs of  preparing and printing documents, servicing close to 300 meetings, and  staff time for this review have exceeded $20 million a biennium, with little  emphasis placed on evaluating program performance. To shift the focus to  evaluating results, the General Assembly in December 2003 required the  Committee for Program and Coordination to submit a proposal on ways to  improve its ability to monitor and evaluate program impact. The Secretary  General recommended that the committee assess the results achieved at  the end of the budget period and establish priorities to guide the allocation  of resources. This would support performance-oriented budgeting,  according to Joint Inspection Unit officials.", "In August 2003, the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary  Questions concluded that the General Assembly could not eliminate  programs and shift resources until it received evaluations that addressed  program impact. Performance information is necessary for decision- making bodies to determine whether programs are meeting their stated  objectives. Program performance reports provided to member states  focused on outputs (such as the number of staff recruited, reports issued,  meetings held, or computers purchased), instead of measuring program  impact. To address this concern, OIOS changed the format of the  performance report, which now requires program managers to link  resources to program activities and to use performance indicators to  measure program impact.

Therefore, the Department of Public Information was devoting a large  amount of funding to information activities in countries where available  technology permitted greater online access to its services in the field. In  2003, internal auditors concluded that the department should evaluate  these offices and consider options such as consolidation, regionalization,  or closure.

For example, in 2002, OIOS concluded that the human rights office had  poor financial controls and human capital management, as well as weak  internal oversight procedures. According to a senior human rights official,  for example, the office did not accurately track its unused voluntary  funding in the past. According to the human rights office, this problem  has been rectified and the office is tracking voluntary funding levels. In  addition, the office relies heavily on voluntary funding to administer its  core activities. Regular budget funding accounted for about 38 percent, or  $24.2 million, of the office\u2019s activities in 2002, whereas voluntary  contributions accounted for about 62 percent, or $40 million (see fig. 6 for  funding trends for the human rights office). Human rights officials stated  that the heavy reliance on voluntary funding poses management  challenges, including the resulting uncertainty of funding for future  projects and low morale among staff unsure about job security.", "As shown in figure 8, the human rights office also provides administrative,  technical, and substantive support to parts of the human rights program  outside the Secretariat, including  the U.N. Commission on Human Rights, which is a functional commission  of the Economic and Social Council that meets annually to discuss human  rights issues and standards and governments\u2019 adherence to them; independent reporters and working groups, appointed by the commission  to examine, monitor, and publicly report on human rights situations in  specific countries or territories or on major human rights themes\u2014there  are reporters who focus on the right to education and on the situation of  human rights in the Democratic Republic of the Congo; and independent committees, established by international human rights  treaties, comprising independent experts that monitor governments\u2019  compliance with treaty obligations.", "The workload generated by these independent groups affects the human  rights office\u2019s management. For example, the office provides  administrative support, such as report processing, to the monitoring  committees and national governments to ensure compliance with treaty  reporting requirements. As the number of signatories increases, the  Secretariat\u2019s administrative burden increases. In addition, the Secretary  General reported in 2002 that the more than 40 human rights reporters and  working groups pose a management burden for the human rights office  because they have grown in recent years in an ad hoc fashion and without  clear rules for their responsibilities. The fragmentation and lack of clear  working guidelines complicated the office\u2019s support to these individuals  and groups in the preparation of reports to the commission. As an  independent body, the Commission on Human Rights appoints new human  rights reporters. However, OIOS reported that the General Assembly has  not provided commensurate additional regular budget funding to the  human rights office for their support.

For example, it established both the senior-level Management  Board and Project Review Committee, in 1997 and 1998, respectively, to  monitor the planning, budgeting, and implementation of the office\u2019s  programs and to identify outdated or nonpriority activities. The human  rights office reported that it strengthened its program oversight and  planning throughout 2003. Officials stated that the 2004 annual appeal, for  example, presented a more strategic work plan than in prior years, which  resulted in a 12 percent decline in voluntary funding requirements for the  2004 annual appeal, from $62.5 million in 2003 to $54.8 million in 2004. In  addition, the office established the Advisory Panel on Personnel Issues in  March 1999 to evaluate the office\u2019s use of temporary staff and staff funded  with voluntary resources and ensure the equitable geographic distribution  of staff from member states. It also restructured its three main branches to  reduce duplicative activities and leverage its personnel and financial  resources.", "We found that the human rights office has also implemented reforms that  indirectly address areas of the U.N. human rights program outside the  Secretary General\u2019s authority. For example, to help improve the quality of  human rights reports, the office developed an induction kit for human  rights reporters and working groups. The kit is updated regularly and used  to brief new reporters on their rules and procedures. In addition, the office  is working to keep them informed about the latest General Assembly  resolutions that may affect reporting procedures, such as page limits and  submission deadlines. In December 2003, the General Assembly also  approved the Secretary General\u2019s request for funding in the 2004-2005  budget for additional staff to improve the office\u2019s ability to respond to  increasing demands from the Commission on Human Rights and its human  rights reporters and working groups.", "Nevertheless, the implementation of the Secretary General\u2019s proposals is  incomplete because he does not have authority over human rights  activities outside the Secretariat\u2019s human rights office.

Moreover, only the commission can determine standard  entrance criteria for its reporters and working groups. Thus, any reform  related to the human rights reporters is dependent upon the support of  commission members. In addition, in his September 2002 reform agenda,  the Secretary General stated that governments should be allowed to  submit a single report to the monitoring committees summarizing their  adherence to human rights treaty obligations. Given his lack of authority  over the monitoring committees, the Secretary General requested that the  human rights office consult with the committees on methods of  streamlining the governments\u2019 various treaty-reporting requirements.

Without such assessments, the Secretariat is not able to  determine where further improvements are needed. In 1998 and 2003, the  Secretary General issued reports on the status of the 1997 and 2002  reforms, respectively. These reports, however, did not include a  comprehensive impact assessment. We found that individual departments  and offices within the Secretariat oversee specific reforms within their  area of work; for example, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human  Rights oversees the implementation of reforms of the U.N. human rights  program. However, the Deputy Secretary General, who is responsible for  overseeing the overall reform process, has only one full-time professional  staff member dedicated to this effort. The Steering Committee on Reform  and Management\u2014comprising department heads within the Secretariat  and chaired by the Deputy Secretary General\u2014also tracks key reform  issues and policy implementation. However, the Deputy Secretary  General\u2019s office neither systematically assesses departments\u2019 performance  in implementing reforms nor holds managers directly accountable.  Furthermore, OIOS only monitors and evaluates the impact of select  reforms and is not responsible for overseeing the implementation of the  overall reform agendas.", "Second, the Secretary General has not differentiated between short- and  long-term goals in his 2002 reform plan, and he has not consistently  established time frames or milestones for their completion. GAO has  identified the setting of implementation goals and a timeline to build  momentum and show progress as key practices for organizations  undertaking change management initiatives. We found that a few reforms  required departments and offices to conduct evaluations and report their  findings to the Secretary General by a certain date, but many reforms did  not specify time frames for completing these actions. For example, the  Secretary General called for the Department of Public Information and  OIOS to complete an evaluation of the impact and cost effectiveness of the  department\u2019s activities within a three-year period (which started in 2003).  However, when the Secretary General called for a review of the feasibility  and cost of increasing the Secretariat\u2019s delivery of online versus printed  publications, he did not specify a deadline. Without prioritizing efforts and  establishing deadlines, it is difficult to hold managers accountable for  completing the reforms.", "Third, according to budget and human capital officials, some program  managers and staff have resisted implementing certain reform initiatives.  Human capital officials stated that program managers, for example, have  raised concerns about the staff mobility policy because they fear losing  expertise when staff rotate to new positions. In addition, OIOS reported  that about half of program managers across the Secretariat have not  complied with U.N. regulations to monitor and evaluate the performance  of program activities. The Secretariat lacks clear rules and procedures for  conducting regular monitoring and evaluation exercises, according to  OIOS officials. Some managers also stated that they lacked resources to  support this work and were concerned that these evaluation requirements  would detract time and money from their regular work responsibilities.  Consequently, the Secretariat is providing training to all departments to  assist managers and staff in conducting self-monitoring and evaluation  exercises to comply with performance-oriented budgeting and overcome  resistance. Managers\u2019 support is critical for the institutionalization of  reforms in the long term.", "Fourth, U.N. officials stated that they have encountered delays in  implementing reforms due to a lack of available regular budget resources.  For example, public information officials stated that their department did  not have a specific budget for new monitoring and evaluation activities\u2014a  key aspect of public information reform. In addition, human capital  officials stated that they developed the online recruiting and hiring system  after receiving resources from another department in the Secretariat. The  Secretary General stated that departments would need to implement  reforms within existing resources because additional funding would not be  available in the regular budget. He also stated that program managers  should streamline operations and eliminate obsolete activities to make  resources available to implement reforms. According to U.N. officials, the  Secretariat did not complete a comprehensive assessment of the personnel  and budgetary implications during the development of his 2002 reform  agenda.

A detailed assessment of the reforms for peacekeeping  and improving the coordination among U.N. departments and offices and  between the U.N. and civil society was beyond the scope of this review.", "To assess the status of human capital management reforms, we compared  the Secretariat\u2019s human capital reform strategy with criteria from GAO\u2019s  model of strategic human capital management. This model provides a  framework for examining an organization\u2019s human capital practices and is  based upon the actions that are characteristic of high-performing  organizations. To collect information on the Secretariat\u2019s progress in  implementing its reform strategy, we reviewed internal and public human  resources documents detailing the new recruitment and hiring system, the  performance appraisal system, human resources action plans, and a  survey of U.N. staff views on human capital reforms. We discussed human  capital management reforms with OHRM officials who are planning and  implementing the office\u2019s reform initiatives. We also met with the chief  personnel officer for the U.N. Geneva Office, as well as personnel officers  at the Office for the High Commissioner for Human Rights, the U.N. High  Commissioner for Refugees, and the Internal Labour Organization, to  discuss the status and problems of human capital reforms in their  organizations.

We  also examined budget-related documents prepared by the Committee for  Program and Coordination and the Advisory Committee on Administrative  and Budgetary Questions. In addition, we examined Secretariat documents  on program monitoring and evaluation activities to determine the U.N.\u2019s  ability to report on and assess program results and impact, as well as  strategies the Secretariat developed to strengthen the monitoring and  evaluation system. We discussed performance-oriented budgeting reforms  with OPPBA, JIU, and OIOS officials from the Monitoring, Evaluation, and  Consulting Division. We also met with budget officers at the International  Labour Organization and the World Health Organization to discuss the  status and lessons learned from implementing performance-oriented  budgeting at their organizations.", "To determine the status of reforms of U.N. public information activities,  including DPI\u2019s reorganization, the restructuring of the department\u2019s  branch offices, library management, and publications, we reviewed reports  from OIOS, the General Assembly\u2019s Committee on Information, and the  Secretary General. We also spoke with DPI officials, including the Under  Secretary General, the department\u2019s senior managers, and senior library  officials in New York. In addition, we interviewed officials from DPI\u2019s  branch office and U.N. library in Geneva to determine the extent to which  operations in the field have been affected by these reforms.", "To determine the status of efforts to reform the U.N. human rights  program, we reviewed official reports from the Office of the High  Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR)\u2014 including annual appeals  and reports\u2014detailing the steps the office is taking to implement these  reforms. We also reviewed internal audit reports and external reviews by  independent contractors highlighting the key management challenges  facing OHCHR and its efforts to improve in these areas. In addition, we  interviewed human rights officials in Secretariat offices in Geneva and  New York. To assess the Secretariat\u2019s efforts to improve the management  of the human rights program, we spoke with the Acting High  Commissioner for Human Rights and senior management officials  responsible for implementing the Secretary General\u2019s reforms. To  determine the status of reforms related to the monitoring committees and  human rights reporters and working groups, we analyzed relevant  Secretary General, General Assembly, and Commission on Human Rights  reports, resolutions, and other official documentation, and we spoke with  OHCHR officials. We did not review the work or membership of the  Commission on Human Rights or the performance of individual human  rights reporters.", "To determine the challenges facing the implementation of U.N. reforms,  we reviewed reports and documentation of the Secretariat, General  Assembly, OIOS, and JIU. We also reviewed reports from outside  observers of the U.N. system, including nongovernmental organizations  and members of academia.
