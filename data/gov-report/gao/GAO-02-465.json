Under a CRADA, the partner and DOE laboratory agree to jointly conduct research and typically share the research costs. By fiscal year 1992, DOE\u2019s national laboratories were among the leading federal laboratories participating in CRADAs with businesses, universities, and other partners. In addition to CRADAs, DOE\u2019s laboratories have participated in technology partnerships by providing technical assistance to small businesses. DOE\u2019s laboratories have also transferred technology to businesses and other nonfederal entities without using partnerships by (1) \u201cwork-for-others\u201d agreements, in which laboratory scientists perform specified research and the business pays full costs; (2) licensing their technology to businesses; and (3) making specialized user facilities available.", "To further encourage DOE\u2019s laboratories to enter into CRADAs and provide technical assistance, the Congress began providing funding specifically designated for technology partnerships in fiscal year 1991. However, in fiscal year 1996, the Congress began to phase out these dedicated funds, relying instead on program managers at the laboratories to use their regular research funds for CRADAs that would significantly benefit their programs. While the use of regular research funds instead of dedicated funds ensures that a CRADA project will have primary benefits to DOE\u2019s research mission, it has raised concerns that DOE\u2019s laboratories will be less likely to support CRADAs.", "In July 2001, we reported a substantial drop in the number of CRADAs and technical assistance agreements that DOE\u2019s National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) laboratories and production facilities have entered into in recent years. Concerned that a similar decline might have occurred among all of DOE\u2019s laboratories, you requested that we expand our analysis to include the 12 DOE laboratories that have historically been most active in transferring technology to U.S. businesses. Specifically, you asked that we (1) examine these laboratories\u2019 participation in and funding for technology transfer activities with nonfederal entities during the past 10 years and (2) obtain laboratory managers\u2019 views on any barriers that may limit technology transfer activities between DOE\u2019s laboratories and potential nonfederal partners.", "To address the first objective, we surveyed the following 12 laboratories, which have accounted for almost all of DOE\u2019s technology transfer activities and funding, according to DOE:   Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Los Alamos National Laboratory, and Sandia National Laboratories within NNSA;   Ames Laboratory, Argonne National Laboratory, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory within DOE\u2019s Office of Science;   National Renewable Energy Laboratory within DOE\u2019s Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Program; Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory within DOE\u2019s Environmental Management Program; and   National Energy Technology Laboratory within DOE\u2019s Fossil Energy Program.", "DOE\u2019s other laboratories have been less active in technology transfer primarily because they (1) conduct basic research in the fields of high energy and nuclear physics and nuclear fusion, which have little near-term potential for commercial applications; (2) conduct classified research with little, if any, commercial application; or (3) are small."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["DOE laboratories have primarily used the following types of agreements to transfer technology to U.S. businesses and other organizations:   CRADAs: A DOE laboratory and its nonfederal partner(s) agree that their scientists will collaborate on a research project of mutual interest and consistent with the laboratory\u2019s mission. Both parties may contribute personnel, services, and property to the CRADA project, and the partner(s) can provide funding for the laboratory\u2019s research. However, the DOE laboratory cannot provide funding to the partner(s). Intellectual property rights to technology developed under the CRADA are negotiated in advance. In general, the inventing partner retains ownership rights, while the other partner receives appropriate licensing rights.", "Technical assistance for small businesses: Both NNSA\u2019s and the Office of Science\u2019s laboratories used dedicated funds (provided by the Technology Partnership Program and the Laboratory Technology Research Program, respectively) to provide technical assistance to small businesses.", "Work-for-others agreements: A DOE laboratory agrees to conduct a defined scope of work or list of tasks that is consistent with DOE missions and which does not place the laboratory in direct competition with the private sector. The nonfederal entity pays for the entire cost of the project. While intellectual property rights are negotiable, the nonfederal entity typically retains title rights to any inventions.", "Technology licensing agreements: A DOE laboratory grants a business an exclusive or nonexclusive license to use its intellectual property in return for a licensing fee and/or royalties.", "User facility agreements: A DOE laboratory permits outside organizations to use its unique research equipment and/or facilities to conduct research. For nonproprietary research, almost all of the users are supported by federal grants, typically through the National Science Foundation or DOE. For proprietary research, the private organization pays the full cost for using research equipment or facilities and retains title rights to any intellectual property.", "Table 1 shows the dedicated funding that the Congress has made available for technology partnerships through the Technology Partnership Program for NNSA\u2019s laboratories and weapons production facilities and the Laboratory Technology Research Program for DOE\u2019s Office of Science laboratories. The Technology Partnership Program, which provided funding for DOE\u2019s nuclear weapons laboratories and production facilities, peaked at $214 million in fiscal year 1996 and was subsequently phased out by fiscal year 2001. The Laboratory Technology Research Program, which provided funding for DOE\u2019s Office of Science laboratories, also declined from a peak of $47 million in fiscal year 1995 to $3 million in fiscal year 2002. DOE requested $3 million for the Laboratory Technology Research Program for fiscal year 2003 and has announced that it will terminate this program once previously approved projects have been funded.", "In the early 1990s, DOE created the Office of Research and Development Management within the Office of the Under Secretary to promote and oversee technology transfer at DOE\u2019s laboratories and production facilities. In March 1996, at the direction of the Congress, DOE disestablished this office and eliminated all of its staff positions. Subsequently, in 1999, DOE established a Technology Transfer Working Group, composed of representatives from 25 DOE organizations, to oversee and coordinate technology transfer policies. The working group has no permanent staff positions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOE Laboratories Have Substantially Reduced Technology Transfer Activities Not Fully Funded by Nonfederal Partners", "paragraphs": ["The 12 DOE laboratories surveyed have substantially reduced their participation in CRADAs and technical assistance to small businesses in recent years, primarily because DOE research program funding has not replaced dedicated funding for technology partnerships.

In particular, CRADAs that continued from the prior year dropped from 861 in fiscal year 1996 to 440 in fiscal year 2001. Much of this decline occurred in fiscal year 2000, when 360 CRADA projects ended. (See table 7 in app. I for each laboratory\u2019s newly executed and continuing CRADAs.)", "The initial growth and subsequent decline in CRADAs over the past 10 years mirrors the change in DOE\u2019s dedicated funding for technology partnerships through NNSA\u2019s Technology Partnership Program and the Office of Science\u2019s Laboratory Technology Research Program. Since peaking in fiscal year 1996, the drop in CRADAs has been greatest at the laboratories for which dedicated funding constituted a substantial share of partnership funding. For example, from 1996 through fiscal year 2001, the number of new CRADAs dropped from 12 to 7 and total active CRADAs dropped from 55 to 30 at the Office of Science\u2019s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The Laboratory Technology Research Program was the DOE source of funding for 68 percent of these CRADAs. The termination of Technology Partnership Program funding resulted in more than a 60-percent drop in active CRADAs at NNSA laboratories.", "According to technology transfer managers at the DOE laboratories we visited, their laboratories are likely to have fewer CRADAs in the future because of DOE funding constraints. For example, the number of CRADAs at Oak Ridge National Laboratory dropped from 256 in fiscal year 2000 to 79 in fiscal year 2001 primarily because of funding constraints. In addition, as a result of unanticipated cuts in fiscal year 2002 funding for the Laboratory Technology Research Program\u2014from $10 million in fiscal year 2001 to $3 million in fiscal year 2002\u2014the Office of Science funded only 5 of the 12 multi-year CRADA proposals previously approved for funding by its peer review process. The partners for the other seven approved CRADAs were informed that funding for their projects would not be available in fiscal year 2002. The Office of Science has announced that these 12 CRADAs will be the last ones funded by the Laboratory Technology Research Program, which will be terminated.", "The three laboratories that have historically relied on DOE program funds to support CRADAs have participated in at most 50 CRADAs per year each. For example, total CRADAs at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory have grown from 14 in fiscal year 1996 to 21 in fiscal year 2001, primarily because the Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Program, whose mission includes working with industry, has provided funding support for most of these CRADAs. CRADAs at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory peaked at 50 in fiscal year 1996 and subsequently fell to 32 in fiscal year 2001.", "Figure 1 shows that CRADA funding from all sources peaked at over $500 million in fiscal year 1995. Since then, DOE funding has declined while partners have provided a greater proportion of CRADA support through funding and in-kind contributions. These trends reflect the decline in the total number of active CRADAs and the fact that DOE\u2019s research programs generally have not provided the funding support for CRADAs that NNSA\u2019s Technology Partnership Program and the Office of Science\u2019s Laboratory Technology Research Program had previously provided. Funding from some DOE programs has increased, however. For example, the Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Program, which provided $16.6 million for CRADAs in fiscal year 1996, provided $40.1 million of the $81 million in total DOE funds for CRADAs in fiscal year 2001. (See tables 8 and 9 in app. I for the financial support of CRADAs by DOE research programs and partners.)", "With the decline in DOE funding support for CRADAs, the bulk of support for CRADAs has come from the laboratories\u2019 partners. Before fiscal year 1997, CRADA partners primarily provided in-kind contributions that covered the costs incurred by their scientists. Since then, CRADA partners have provided more funding to cover part, or all, of the DOE laboratory\u2019s costs for CRADAs. In fiscal year 2001, CRADA partners provided 76 percent of the total financial support for CRADAs through funding and in-kind contributions\u2014specifically, partners paid all of the costs for 23 percent of active CRADAs and jointly funded the DOE laboratory\u2019s costs for 15 percent of active CRADAs. (See table 10 in app. I for the type of financial support that partners provided.)", "While these funds enabled the DOE laboratories to leverage their resources, technology transfer managers at several laboratories noted that many ongoing CRADAs were terminated early and potentially beneficial CRADA projects were stopped during negotiations because a business learned that it would have to pay a substantial part, or all, of the laboratory\u2019s research costs in addition to its own costs. In recent years, about 33 percent of the CRADAs were with small businesses, 50 percent were with large or intermediate businesses, and 13 percent were with universities or consortia.

Businesses and other nonfederal entities have provided more funding for work-for-others agreements than for all other types of technology transfer activities combined. Funding from nonfederal entities for work-for-others agreements increased from $31 million in fiscal year 1992 to over $188 million in fiscal year 1999. In fiscal year 2001, there were 1,527 work-for-others agreements funded at $147 million.", "Although the nonfederal entity is required to pay all of the project costs, many businesses use a work-for-others agreement, rather than a CRADA. The work-for-others program allows them to obtain title, in most cases, to any intellectual property developed under the agreement while the title and licensing rights to any intellectual property developed under a CRADA are subject to negotiations. (See table 12 in app. I for work-for-others agreements by laboratory.) In contrast, the research under a work-for- others agreement typically is less beneficial for the DOE laboratory than research under a CRADA because (1) it is not required to provide direct benefit to the program missions, although it must be consistent with them; (2) the laboratory\u2019s scientists typically do not collaborate on research with the nonfederal entity\u2019s scientists; and (3) the laboratory does not normally have rights to any resulting intellectual property.", "During the past 10 years, the laboratories\u2019 technology licensing activities significantly increased, from 189 licenses with $4.7 million in license income in fiscal year 1992 to 1,720 licenses with $19.3 million in license income in fiscal year 2001. The growth in technology licensing can be traced to the 1984 amendments to the Patent and Trademark Amendments of 1980, commonly known as the Bayh-Dole Act, which allowed DOE\u2019s laboratories operated by universities or nonprofit organizations to retain title to inventions that their scientists made. Subsequently, the National Competitiveness Technology Transfer Act of 1989 added technology transfer as a mission of the DOE laboratories. (See table 13 in app. I for technology licenses by laboratory.)", "User facility agreements, which provide access to unique DOE research equipment and facilities, increased from 252 in fiscal year 1992 to more than 2,000 in fiscal year 2001.

More recently, two laboratories have used other, non-DOE sources of funding to provide technical assistance to local small businesses. Sandia National Laboratories have an agreement with the state of New Mexico that entitles Sandia to up to $1.8 million per year in tax relief for assistance provided to small businesses in the state.

As a result, research managers have been reluctant to substitute limited research funds for the dedicated technology transfer funding that was phased out in recent years. Because DOE funding was not available, several laboratories had to advise many of their CRADA partners that they would either have to pay the project\u2019s full costs, including those incurred by the DOE laboratory\u2019s scientists, or the laboratory would terminate the CRADA. Sandia National Laboratories managers told us that they had terminated 18 CRADAs early in fiscal year 2000 because of such funding constraints.", "Three laboratories stated that the lack of dedicated DOE funding was a \u201cshow stopper\u201d for CRADAs. For example, managers at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory told us that because many of the laboratory\u2019s research program budgets have been squeezed in recent years, research managers have little flexibility to support CRADAs or other types of technology partnerships. Alternatively, CRADA partners\u2014 particularly small businesses\u2014are unwilling or unable to fund all of the research costs. The Lawrence Berkeley managers believe that dedicated funding is important for maintaining a critical mass of CRADAs\u2014without the likelihood of funding support, scientists will not invest the effort to develop strong funding proposals for potentially useful collaborations. Moreover, according to managers at several laboratories, previous DOE funding support for CRADAs likely led to an increase in work-for-others agreements and CRADAs funded by nonfederal partners in recent years. These managers believe that dedicated funds have provided the laboratories with an opportunity to \u201cget their foot in the door\u201d with companies. Once the partners are familiar with the capabilities of the national laboratories, they are more likely to want to continue working with the laboratories, according to the managers.", "Several managers cited the importance of dedicated funding for commercializing many of their laboratories\u2019 technological innovations because there often is a gap in the funding needed to translate the innovation into possible commercial applications, a gap that some managers referred to as the \u201cvalley of death.\u201d The Lawrence Berkeley managers told us that CRADAs have enabled technology licensees to collaborate with the laboratory\u2019s scientists to develop commercial applications.

Managers stated that technology partnerships, which cut across DOE programs, need an advocate in DOE headquarters who is not tied to a specific research area and has sufficient visibility within DOE to effectively foster technology partnerships. More specifically, managers at several Office of Science laboratories cited the need for an advocate because they believe that funding technology partnerships is a low priority within the Office of Science. They noted that when the Congress reduced the fiscal year 2002 funding for the Office of Advanced Scientific Computing Research, funding for the Laboratory Technology Research Program was disproportionately cut\u2014from the president\u2019s budget request of $6.9 million to $3 million\u2014compared with other research programs in this office.

They noted that technology partnerships often provide important results and fulfill DOE\u2019s broader responsibility to disseminate knowledge, but the partnerships may not always be directly tied to the specific goals of a single DOE research program. As a result, these partnerships are likely to be a lower priority for research managers responsible for meeting specific goals. Because DOE\u2019s research budgets have declined in recent years, it is even less likely that these managers will be willing to fund research activities that, while potentially valuable, extend beyond their immediate programs, according to the laboratory managers.", "Finally, DOE officials noted that DOE\u2019s Technology Transfer Working Group is not an internal advocacy group for technology transfer, but a virtual organization with no full-time permanent staff. The working group was established after DOE eliminated its full-time technology transfer organization in 1996 at the Congress\u2019 direction. The working group, which convenes monthly by teleconference, oversees technology transfer policy and practices, identifies issues, and coordinates the DOE headquarters response to these issues.

(For shorter or less costly projects, the partner is required to pay its entire share in advance.) Some laboratory managers told us that the advance payment requirement has presented problems in negotiating, for example, work-for-others agreements or jointly funded CRADAs with small or large businesses or with universities. While the requirement rarely stops an agreement from being signed, it has delayed negotiations, particularly when a small business cannot readily provide an upfront payment. The advance payment requirement typically is more burdensome for small businesses than large businesses because small businesses are less likely to have the funds available to prepay work, according to laboratory managers. DOE\u2019s policy permits exceptions to this requirement; for example, the contractor operating the laboratory may negotiate with DOE a smaller advance payment for a small business that is unable to meet the standard requirement.", "Some laboratory managers told us that the advance payment requirement had created serious problems for small businesses that sought the laboratory\u2019s assistance as a subcontractor for a project under either the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program or the Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) program. While DOE requires an advance payment for conducting research, the SBIR and STTR programs typically provide payments for completed work, leaving the small business with the problem of providing funding to bridge this gap. Managers at one laboratory questioned the need for the advance payment requirement for an SBIR or STTR project when the payment is coming from another federal program. In some cases, the federal agency funding the SBIR or STTR project has agreed to provide some funding upfront to help cover the DOE laboratory\u2019s work.

DOE also noted that a considerable amount of technology transfer takes place in the normal course of executing technical work associated with mission-related contracts and financial assistance, and that this work was not included in the report as technology transfer. While we agree with DOE that the laboratories\u2019 technology transfer activities are not limited to the five types of agreements discussed, we note that the laboratories\u2019 role in other forms of technology transfer was outside the scope of our review.
