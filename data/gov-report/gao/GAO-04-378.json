For example, one program recognizes more than 1,000 worksites with exemplary records and practices while another focuses on hazardous industries, encouraging more than 200 employers to eliminate serious hazards. The agency plans to significantly expand its voluntary compliance programs over the next few years, although such expansion may tax its limited resources. OSHA's voluntary compliance programs appear to have yielded many positive outcomes, but the agency does not yet have adequate data to assess their individual and relative effectiveness. Employers and employees at nine worksites we visited attested to reductions in injuries and illnesses and improved relationships with one another and with OSHA. However, the agency has just begun to evaluate its programs and much of its data are insufficient for evaluation. For example, data on one program are inconsistent, making comparisons difficult, and goals for another program are individually developed and not readily measurable. The lack of such data makes it difficult for OSHA to articulate priorities and necessary resource allocations. The additional strategies that researchers and specialists suggested generally fell into four categories: providing more incentives to encourage additional employers to voluntarily improve workplace safety and health; promoting more systematic approaches to workplace safety and health; focusing more specifically on high-hazard, high-injury workplaces; and using third-party approaches to achieve voluntary compliance."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Workplace injuries and illnesses affect millions of workers each year,  often changing their lives and reducing employers\u2019 profitability through  higher costs and lowered productivity.

However,  OSHA can only inspect a small fraction of all worksites each year. In 2002,  for example, the agency and its state counterparts conducted almost  96,000 inspections. Furthermore, the growth in the number of worksites  over time, as well as changes in the workplace, have added to OSHA\u2019s  challenge. To help meet its responsibilities, the agency has increasingly  supplemented its enforcement efforts with \u201cvoluntary compliance  strategies.\u201d These are initiatives in which OSHA invites employers to work  cooperatively with the agency to protect the safety and health of workers.

OSHA has responsibility for enforcing the provisions of the act, including  overseeing most worksites, with the exception of some small employers in  low-hazard industries and small farming operations. OSHA has direct  enforcement responsibility for about half the states; the remainder have  been granted authority for their own enforcement. At present, 22 states  have been approved by OSHA to operate their own programs covering all  worksites; 4 are approved for covering public sector employee worksites  only; and OSHA directly oversees all worksites in the remaining states.", "OSHA uses two approaches to ensure compliance with federal safety and  health laws and regulations\u2014enforcement and voluntary compliance.  Enforcement, which represents the preponderance of agency activity, is  carried out primarily by using compliance officers to inspect employer  worksites. Worksites and employers whose conditions fail to meet federal  safety and health standards face sanctions, such as paying penalties for  violations of health and safety standards. In this enforcement capacity,  OSHA targets employers for inspection using injury and illness rates for  industries and specific worksites. For example, it has targeted the  construction industry for inspections because of high injury and illness  rates. OSHA also conducts inspections when employers report fatalities or  serious injuries and when workers file complaints about serious safety and  health hazards. The voluntary compliance approach, in contrast, invites  employers to collaborate with the agency and uses a variety of incentives  to encourage them to reduce hazards and institute practices that will  foster safer and healthier working conditions. Such incentives include free  consultations, exemption from routine inspections, and recognition for  exemplary safety and health systems.", "To participate in voluntary compliance programs, employers must also  meet certain requirements, which often include the adoption of some form  of safety and health management program\u2014a program that takes a  systems approach to preventing and controlling workplace hazards.  OSHA has four basic requirements for a safety and health management  program:  (1) Management Leadership and Employee Involvement\u2014Top-level  management must be committed to carrying out written comprehensive  safety and health programs. Employees must be actively involved in the  execution of the program.  (2) Worksite Analysis\u2014Employers must have a thorough understanding  of all hazardous situations to which employees may be exposed, as well as  the ability to recognize and correct these hazards.  (3) Hazard Prevention and Controls\u2014The program must have clear  procedures for preventing and controlling hazards identified through  worksite analysis, such as a hazard tracking system and a written system  for monitoring and maintaining workplace equipment.  (4) Safety and Health Training\u2014Training is necessary to reinforce and  complement management\u2019s commitment to safety and health and to  ensure that all employees understand how to avoid exposure to hazards.", "To keep pace with the increasing demands on OSHA staff to help  administer and promote voluntary compliance programs, in 2001 OSHA  created the new position of \u201ccompliance assistance specialist.\u201d According  to OSHA officials, funding for this position was authorized in fiscal year  2002. Compliance assistance specialists provide general information about  OSHA standards and promote voluntary compliance programs, as well as  OSHA\u2019s compliance assistance resources, such as training and Web site  resources. They also respond to requests for help from a variety of groups  and participate in numerous seminars, workshops, and speaking events.

States provide free consultation visits at employers\u2019  requests to identify safety and health hazards and discuss techniques for  their abatement. In fiscal year 2003, state agents conducted about 28,900  consultation visits. The names of employers receiving consultation visits  are kept confidential and separate from OSHA enforcement officials.  Depending on an employer\u2019s request, a state consultant may conduct a full  safety and health hazard assessment of all working conditions, equipment,  and processes at the worksite, or he or she may focus solely on one  particular hazard or work process.

Participants in SHARP  must have safety and health programs, which are management programs,  in place to prevent and control occupational hazards. In fiscal year 2003,  there were 699 SHARP worksites in both federal OSHA states and state- plan states.

While the VPP does not specifically target large  businesses, they tend to be the businesses that attain VPP status.  According to an OSHA official, this trend is due to the fact that large  businesses tend to have staff and expertise available for a comprehensive  safety and health program.", "To participate in VPP, employers must have worksites that exceed OSHA  standards and they must commit to a process of continual improvement.  Employers achieving all VPP requirements are designated as Star VPP  worksites, which signifies the highest level of workplace safety and  health. As of September 30, 2003, 92 percent of all VPP worksites in  federal OSHA states have Star designation. To be eligible for this  exemplary status, employers must meet a number of specific requirements  for their worksite: (1) worksite injury and illness rates must be below the  average rate for their industry sector for at least 1 of the 3 most recent  years; (2) a safety and health program must have been implemented and  maintained for at least 1 year; and (3) worksites must undergo and pass a  comprehensive review by OSHA personnel, including an on-site review of  the facility and interviews with management officials and employees.

This partnership provided a template from  which other construction partnerships were developed. Additionally,  OSHA officials informed us that, because it was originally difficult for  construction worksites to enter into VPP, employers in the industry who  wanted to enter into a voluntary compliance program with OSHA had  tended to form a strategic partnership.

In contrast to the other  three voluntary compliance programs which typically include safety and  health programs at specific employer worksites, alliance agreements focus  on goals such as training, outreach, and increasing awareness of  workplace safety and health issues. To date, alliances have participated in  a variety of activities, such as (1) creating electronic informational tools  that have been posted on the OSHA Web site, (2) developing industry- specific voluntary guidelines and training materials, and (3) improving  OSHA\u2019s training courses. Alliance members are not exempt from OSHA  inspections and do not receive any enforcement-related incentives for  joining an alliance. Instead, OSHA officials informed us that trade and  professional associations have used the Alliance Program as a proactive  method of addressing existing and emerging workplace safety and health  issues, such as ergonomic issues. As of September 2003, 41 percent of  OSHA\u2019s national alliances were ergonomic-related. See figure 7 for an  example of an ergonomic-related alliance.", "In addition to its voluntary compliance programs, OSHA conducts  numerous training and outreach activities on a variety of safety and health  issues. These activities augment both the voluntary compliance programs  and OSHA\u2019s enforcement program, according to OSHA officials. For  example, outreach activities can be conducted in relation to inspections,  in an attempt to help employers ready themselves for an inspection. The  OSHA Training Institute offers 80 courses on a range of safety and health  issues, most of which are available to the public as well as to OSHA  employees for training. In fiscal year 2003, however, the majority of its  almost 5,000 students were OSHA employees. In addition to the Training  Institute, OSHA has 33 Education Centers, nonprofit organizations (mostly  universities), which have agreements with OSHA to teach 16 of the most  popular Training Institute courses. An agency official told us that using  these Education Centers around the country has allowed OSHA to greatly  expand the amount of nonagency personnel who receive training in safety  and health issues. In fiscal year 2003, these centers trained almost 16,000  students, approximately 98 percent of whom were non-OSHA personnel.  Through a grant program, the agency also distributes some funds to  nonprofit organizations to develop training or educational programs about  safety and health issues of current emphasis in OSHA\u2019s Strategic  Management Plan.

OSHA also mails materials on specific safety  and health issues to target audiences. Regional officials we spoke with  said that several OSHA staff are called upon to conduct outreach efforts  because it requires specialized skills and knowledge of standards. OSHA  also works in cooperation the U.S. Small Business Administration\u2019s Small  Business Development Centers. Additionally, OSHA recently revised its  Web site, which provides informational tools and referrals on a variety of  safety and health issues.

The percentage  of resources dedicated to voluntary compliance programs and compliance  assistance activities has increased by approximately 8 percent since 1996,  when these programs represented about 20 percent of the agency\u2019s  budget. During this same period, the proportion of resources OSHA  dedicated to its enforcement activities fell by 6 percent, from about 63  percent to about 56 percent of the agency\u2019s total budget, although the total  funds devoted to enforcement have remained fairly constant because of  increases in OSHA\u2019s total budget over this period. In addition,  enforcement efforts, as measured by the number of inspections, have  remained constant or increased slightly each year, according to agency  officials. While it cannot be determined that resources were directly  redistributed from enforcement to compliance assistance activities,  funding for OSHA\u2019s other programs remained relatively stable, with only  small increases or decreases in funding since 1996 (see fig. 9).", "Notwithstanding their voluntary nature, all of OSHA\u2019s voluntary  compliance programs require agency oversight to ensure that participants  comply with requirements or agreements and this growing administrative  responsibility requires concerted agency resources. For example:    To certify a worksite as a VPP worksite requires a comprehensive on-site  review that usually lasts 1 week and involves approximately three to five  OSHA personnel. In contrast to the SHARP on-site review, VPP employers  use their own resources to implement their safety and health programs  and the program must be functional before OSHA personnel come to the  worksite to conduct the on-site review for Star approval. Additionally,  OSHA reviews participants\u2019 yearly self-evaluations to ensure that injury  and illness rates have not increased beyond program requirements and any  changes that have been made to the safety and health program.  Furthermore, VPP worksites must be recertified every 1 to 5 years,  depending on their VPP designation.

Additionally,  OSHA training staff reviews all alliance training materials to ensure their  accuracy with OSHA standards.", "Furthermore, while the State Consultation Program is run by the states,  OSHA largely funds the program, and its plans to expand the SHARP  program will require additional agency resources and oversight on the part  of state consultants. State consultants must work closely with employers  to help them improve and implement their safety and health programs  because most small employers do not have the resources necessary to  attain SHARP status on their own. The consultant also must conduct a  one-or-more day on-site review of the worksite to ensure that the  employer has addressed all workplace hazards and properly implemented  a safety and health program. Additionally, SHARP worksites are  reevaluated every 1 to 2 years, depending on the amount of time a  worksite has been in the program and the recommendation of the state  consultant. These reevaluations require another on-site review of the  worksite by the state consultants.", "Expansion of OSHA\u2019s voluntary compliance programs as planned will  further require such resources, particularly for the oversight of a much  larger number of program participants. According to national and regional  OSHA officials we spoke with, expanding the voluntary compliance  programs to the intended levels will be difficult given OSHA\u2019s current  resources, and some expressed concern that too much expansion of some  programs may compromise program quality. Of particular concern to  them, they said, has been the agency\u2019s continued focus on increasing the  number of VPP worksites. Several regional officials\u2014whose offices are  responsible for conducting on-site reviews\u2014said that increasing the  number of VPP worksites would strain their resources because of the  number of staff required to conduct reviews of new worksites and re- certifications of existing worksites.", "To date, regional offices have been creative in their methods of handling  the increasing number of participants in voluntary compliance programs.  For instance, the offices have relied increasingly on the use of the Special  Government Employee Program and the Mentoring Program, both a part  of the VPP. The first allows employees from VPP worksites, at the expense  of their employers, to assist OSHA employees in conducting on-site  reviews. OSHA uses the Mentoring Program to match VPP candidates with  VPP employers, who assist the candidates in improving their safety and  health programs and preparing for the on-site reviews. These two  programs allow OSHA to leverage its resources by using employees at VPP  worksites to assist OSHA in carrying out the responsibilities involved in  operating the program, decreasing the number of OSHA personnel needed.", "While several regional OSHA officials said these strategies have allowed  them to manage the increase in VPP applicants, they are unsure how many  more they can accommodate without obtaining additional resources."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Voluntary Strategies Appear to Have Many Positive Outcomes, but the Absence of Comprehensive Data Limits Assessment", "paragraphs": ["While OSHA\u2019s voluntary compliance strategies have increased the number  of worksites the agency reaches, and participants and others have  provided enthusiastic testimony regarding their ability to foster better  safety and health practices, the lack of comprehensive data on the  outcomes of the programs has hindered our ability to assess their  effectiveness.

The State Consultation Program, which is designed to  provide guidance on specific problems or, more generally, employers\u2019  health and safety management programs, is targeted to small employers.  The three sites we visited that utilized this program had initially sought  consultations because they needed expert advice on safety and health  practices that was not available from their own staff. According to several  specialists, the Alliance Program also connects with small businesses by  working through the trade associations that they participate in, because  the associations build on already existing relationships. In addition, the  OSHA regional offices we visited had used several outreach approaches to  reach out to small employers, for example, a free forum where small  contractors could learn the proper use of cranes and scaffolding.

Developing outcome measures is  difficult, particularly when factors other than program participation can  affect key indicators such as injury and illness rates. However, agencies  are required to develop such measures and it is especially important for  OSHA, given its limited resources, to be able to evaluate the effectiveness  of these programs. Currently, OSHA does not collect complete,  comparable data needed to measure the value of its programs, including  their relative impact, resource use, and effect on the agency\u2019s mission. In  OSHA\u2019s current strategic management plan, one of the agency\u2019s three  goals includes increasing the number of participants in voluntary  compliance programs and improving the programs\u2019 effectiveness. Another  goal includes improving the agency\u2019s access to accurate, timely data, and  enhancing its measures for assessing the effectiveness of its programs.  However, OSHA has not yet developed a comprehensive strategic  framework that articulates how the programs fit together in accomplishing  the agency\u2019s goals or how its resources should be allocated among the  various programs. While OSHA or its state representatives ensure that  voluntary program participants are complying with the programs\u2019  requirements, and often obtains some information on program  effectiveness, such as data on injuries and illness, it does not assess the  overall impact of the programs on worksites\u2019 safety and health.", "Currently, OSHA\u2019s assessments of each program are at a different stage of  development and the approaches vary:    VPP\u2014Presently, OSHA\u2019s analysis of the program is limited to reviewing  VPP sites\u2019 annual injury and illness rates in the years immediately before  they are approved for the program. However, because worksites often  make safety and health improvements over a longer period in anticipation  of their participation in the program but before they are approved, the  rates OSHA reviews may not reflect changes in injury and illness rates  from improvements made as a result of their participation. To assess the  impact of VPP, OSHA contracted with a private firm in October 2003 to  conduct an evaluation of the changes in participating employers\u2019 injury  and illness rates resulting from the program. The evaluation, to be  completed in September 2004, will evaluate the impact of VPP from the  point at which employers decide to apply for VPP until they are designated  a VPP site. It will also determine the impact of VPP on other worksites  through participating employers\u2019 outreach and mentoring efforts and  provide data on dollars spent by VPP sites on safety and health programs  and cost savings from reduced workers\u2019 compensation costs. However,  because VPP does not require applicants to provide data on their injury  and illness rates for the years prior to participation, OSHA will still be  unable to systematically assess whether improvements in their injury and  illness rates resulted from program participation.", "State Consultation Program\u2014OSHA has been assessing possible  approaches for obtaining data on these programs, but it has been difficult  because of the confidentiality that state programs provide to program  participants. In an October 2001 report on the program, we suggested that  OSHA collect additional data to use in evaluating its impact. In 2002, an  OSHA-sponsored evaluation of the program concluded that the program  resulted in some positive outcomes, including that participating worksites  (1) were cited for fewer serious violations if inspected by OSHA within   2 years of the consultation visit and (2) had larger average declines in lost  workday injury and illness rates than other worksites. The report,  however, noted that factors other than the consultation program might  have contributed to these positive outcomes and that further analysis,  particularly the long-term effects of the program, would require the  collection of more data. OSHA attempted to collect such information  through a data initiative it uses to obtain information on the impact of its  enforcement efforts. However, in 2002, the Office of Management and  Budget denied OSHA permission to extend this data collection effort to  collect data from all employers, including those with less than 40  employees. These employers represent a significant portion of the  employers that participate in the State Consultation Program, but are not  presently addressed in the data initiative.", "Strategic Partnership Program\u2014Currently, OSHA requires program  participants to file annual evaluation reports. However, according to an  OSHA-requested study of reports submitted through September 30, 2002,  the agency did not collect consistent information from partnerships or use  common performance measures. For example, some partnerships did not  submit evaluation reports, while others provided incomplete or  inconsistent information because OSHA allowed participants to select the  types of data reported. Similarly, the U. S. Department of Labor\u2019s Office of  Inspector General, which also assessed the program, reported in  September 2002 that there was insufficient information on five of the nine  partnerships it analyzed to evaluate their impact. For example, one  partnership only provided data on injuries and illnesses for 25 of its 222  participants. In response to these studies, OSHA officials said that they  were obtaining comments on a revised format for these reports that would  include common data elements for all partnerships and that OSHA would  then be able to establish a new database designed to track consistent  measures across partnerships. The revised format for the partnership  reports will be available in Spring 2004, according to an OSHA official.", "Alliance Program\u2014Goals for each alliance are individually developed  and are often not readily measurable. Currently, OSHA monitors goals and  accomplishments of individual alliances by participating in quarterly  meetings and preparing annual evaluations. OSHA officials told us that  OSHA has not yet developed an evaluation approach for the national  program. Several individual Alliance Program representatives from  alliances established in 2002 told us that they have not established a  system for assessing the impact of their alliances, and some commented  that this would be difficult, given the nature of their goals. For example,  one alliance\u2019s goals are to provide information and guidance to help  protect employees\u2019 safety and health\u2014particularly from hazards likely to  result in amputations and ergonomic hazards\u2014and to provide training to  employers to help identify and correct these hazards.

The strategies that researchers  and specialists proposed generally fell into four categories: (1) providing  more incentives to encourage additional employers to voluntarily improve  safety and health in the workplace; (2) promote more systematic  approaches to workplace safety and health; (3) focusing more specifically  on high-hazard, high-injury workplaces; and (4) using third-party  approaches to achieve voluntary compliance. While these strategies could  be potentially useful and effective, according to specialists, they could also  entail the need for safeguards, oversight, and enforcement. (See table 2.)"], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Provide More Incentives for Employers to Make Safety and Health Improvements", "paragraphs": ["Specific suggestions for additional financial incentives included   (1) providing information to employers on the possible financial and other  benefits of improving safety and health, (2) encouraging the use of  workers\u2019 compensation incentives for employers that participate in  OSHA\u2019s voluntary compliance programs, and (3) creating tax incentives  for improvements. Another suggestion was to deter employers from  continuing poor safety and health practices by publishing injury and  illness rates for such worksites.", "Develop and Publicize Information on Financial Benefits\u2014To  counter employer assumptions that safety and health improvements would  necessarily be costly, some specialists called for the agency to develop and  publicize more industry-specific data about the financial and other  benefits possible by investing in safety and health improvements. OSHA  provides general information about the direct and indirect costs of injuries  and illnesses on its Web site and is working to develop more industry data  through its alliances and other voluntary programs. As useful as industry- specific information might be, especially to small employers, such  proprietary data are difficult to obtain and expensive to develop,  according to specialists. Developing this information might also be a better  role for industry than for government. In addition, improving safety and  health could cost employers more money, not less.", "Encourage Workers\u2019 Compensation Incentives\u2014OSHA could  encourage state programs and private insurers to consider employers\u2019  participation in voluntary compliance programs when they calculate  premiums for employers. Such incentives could include, for example,  reductions in employers\u2019 insurance premiums or credits for participation.  For many employers, the possibility of achieving lower insurance  premiums could be a significant motivator for improving workplace safety  and health. However, because each state has its own laws governing  workers\u2019 compensation programs, it could prove challenging to create  such financial incentives. Furthermore, although some insurers offer rate  reductions to employers that participate in OSHA\u2019s voluntary compliance  programs, according to OSHA officials, the agency\u2019s other attempts to  work with insurers have not succeeded because they did not want to have  clients perceive them as an agent of OSHA. Figure 10 describes the  relationship between workers\u2019 compensation and occupational safety and  health programs in two states.", "Offer Tax Incentives for Capital and Other Improvements\u2014Tax  incentives, which would require changes in the tax code, may be especially  useful for helping small employers who might lack resources make safety  and health improvements. Having a tax incentive also signals to businesses  that the government values such investments in safety and health.  However, distinguishing business purposes from safety and health  purposes can be difficult with tax incentives. Tax incentives could also  tend to favor capital-intensive solutions to safety and health problems\u2014 such as the purchase of equipment\u2014rather than behavioral or systematic  solutions. They may also subsidize improvements that employers might  have made in any case. Finally, in addition to the potential for  manipulation, using tax incentives could entail lost tax revenues, without  OSHA knowing their impact on safety and health.", "Publish Injury and Illness Rates for Employers\u2019 Worksites\u2014 Gathering and publishing the injury and illness rates for employers\u2019  worksites could build on market incentives to pressure employers to  change their practices. For example, a subcontractor might find it  difficult to obtain a contract because of liability concerns if it were known  that the company had a high rate of workplace injuries. Right now, OSHA  publishes the names of about 3,200 worksites identified through its site- specific targeting program as having high rates of injuries and illnesses,  but it does not publish the actual rates for these worksites. However, there  are several potential problems with this approach. First, injury and illness  rates for one particular year may not accurately capture the performance  of employers, especially small employers. Second, businesses would  likely oppose the publication of these data because they view worksite  injury and illness rates as confidential business information that, if  published, could allow business competitors to glean information about  the company\u2019s productivity. In fact, OSHA took this position when it  denied, in July 2003, a Freedom of Information Act appeal that sought to  obtain rates for specific worksites: OSHA relied on an exemption  protecting trade secrets and commercial or financial information and  refused to disclose the information unless the parties in question  approved. Finally, publicizing injury and illness data might also pressure  employers to underreport injuries and illnesses, creating the need for  further policies or legislation requiring full and accurate reporting and  recording."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Promote More Systematic Approaches to Workplace Safety and Health", "paragraphs": ["Specific suggestions from researchers and specialists included   (1) encouraging employers that participate in OSHA\u2019s voluntary programs  to influence their contractors and suppliers to make safety and health  improvements, (2) requiring certain employers to have a safety and health  management program, and (3) requiring employers to have an employee- management safety and health committee.", "Encourage Employers to Influence Contractors and Suppliers\u2014To  \u201cinfluence the supply chain,\u201d OSHA could encourage employers  participating in its voluntary programs to consider suppliers and  contractors\u2019 safety and health records before making contracting decisions  and encourage their suppliers and contractors to have a safety and health  program. OSHA currently requires this approach of employers  participating in VPP. Because employers are increasingly using  contractors and temporary workers, focusing employers\u2019 attention on  contractors\u2019 and suppliers\u2019 safety and health records was considered a  useful way to achieve some leverage in a changing economy. Safety and  health problems at contractors and suppliers could also entail potential  costs for employers or could also indicate other forms of poor  management, such as poor product quality. As an example of the  effectiveness of this approach, one automaker grouped its suppliers into  three tiers according to their safety and health records, and then each tier  of suppliers pressured the lower tier to improve, according to a specialist  we interviewed. However, the degree of an employer\u2019s potential influence  over suppliers and contractors could vary by employer size as well by  industry. For example, a Fortune 500 employer could have far more  influence on its supply chain than a small body shop, and the construction  industry, which relies on numerous subcontractors working under a  general contractor, may be better able to influence subcontractors than  other industries. Implementing this approach may be difficult because  suppliers and contractors may be unwilling to share their safety and health  records or plans and employers would need staff to conduct such reviews  of its suppliers and contractors. It may be similarly difficult for OSHA to  monitor and verify this process through employers participating in its  voluntary programs.", "Require Certain Employers to Have Safety and Health Management  Programs\u2014As discussed in a previous GAO report and testimony, OSHA  could require certain employers\u2014such as those with high injury and  illness rates\u2014to have safety and health management programs. The  establishment of safety and health programs, including elements such as  hazard prevention and control, is currently required for participants in the  VPP, Strategic Partnership, and SHARP programs. Extending this  approach to other employers could help prevent additional injuries and  illnesses. It could also help employers respond more flexibly to advances  in technology and other workplace issues than with specific standards. On  the other hand, it could be difficult for OSHA to enforce employers\u2019 use of  safety and health programs, and small and mid-size employers may not  have the information or tools to implement these programs without  assistance. In our earlier testimony, we noted that reservations about  these programs stem primarily from concern about implementation issues,  rather than about their value.", "Require Employee-Management Safety Committees\u2014OSHA could  issue a regulation requiring employers to have an employee-management  safety committee at every worksite to investigate accidents, settle  disputes, and provide information to management. The VPP does not  require employers to have such a committee at every worksite, but does  consider it one way to achieve employee involvement. If required for all  employers, such committees might raise additional issues, including the  determination of who would represent workers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Focus More on High- Hazard, High-Injury Workplaces", "paragraphs": ["Specific suggestions for focusing more on high-hazard, high-injury  workplaces included targeting employers with the highest levels of injury  and illness for voluntary programs and having such employers choose  between likely inspection and cooperative approaches with the agency.", "Target Employers with Highest Levels of Injury and Illness\u2014OSHA  could classify employers according to their level of injury and illness and  focus the agency\u2019s voluntary compliance efforts on those with the highest  rates. While this suggestion was seen as a way for OSHA to best use its  limited resources, according to specialists, it might also entail additional  costs for data development.", "Allow Employers to Choose between Likely Inspection and  Cooperative Approaches\u2014Another suggestion was for OSHA to pursue  a previously attempted strategy targeting employers with the highest rates  of injury and illness. The agency informed these employers that they had  been placed on a primary inspection list, but that they could reduce the  likelihood of inspection if they chose to work cooperatively with the  agency by fulfilling certain requirements. Now, when OSHA informs  selected employers that they have among the highest injury and illness  rates in the country, the agency refers employers to outside consultants,  insurance carriers, and state workers\u2019 compensation offices for advice on  improving safety and health; employers with fewer than 250 employees are  also referred to the State Consultation Program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Use Third-Party Approaches", "paragraphs": ["Specific suggestions for third-party approaches included (1) supporting  the development of a voluntary national or international standard for  workplace safety and health and (2) using private consultants to conduct  safety and health evaluations of worksites.", "Support Development of a Voluntary National or International  Standard for Workplace Safety and Health\u2014Having a voluntary  national or international standard could help strengthen the infrastructure  for workplace safety and health and could build on some employers\u2019  desire for a widely recognized credential that could be useful to them in  competing with other companies, especially in global markets. For  example, employers can seek certification from independent organizations  for achieving International Organization for Standardization standards.  To a certain extent, OSHA is currently playing a role in the development of  a voluntary standard, according to OSHA, since some OSHA staff members  are assisting a national standards committee that is working on a safety  and health standard. In addition, many industry associations are involved  on this committee, OSHA staff noted. Limitations of this approach are that:  (1) such standards are not mandatory, but serve more as flexible guidance,  because they reflect agreements reached by committees; (2) although  large employers competing in the international marketplace tend to seek  out international standards credentials, these are not necessarily the  employers needing OSHA\u2019s attention; and (3) it can be difficult to set  voluntary standards because organizations need to invest resources and  provide appropriate expertise.", "Use Private Consultants to Conduct Safety and Health  Evaluations\u2014This suggestion would entail allowing employers to  voluntarily use private consultants to conduct worksite safety and health  evaluations and certify worksites, in return for incentives, such as a  limited exemption from future inspections or reduced civil penalties.  Using third-party, private-sector consultants to certify workplace safety  and health was also proposed in the late 1990s as an amendment to the  OSH Act\u2014known as the SAFE Act. Using consultants could leverage  existing OSHA resources by helping workplaces that might never  otherwise see an OSHA inspector, especially small employers, and  possibly also by enabling employers to address additional safety and  health issues that might not be covered under an OSHA inspection for  compliance with standards. At the same time, using consultants also raises  various implementation, oversight, and legal issues described below. (a) Implementation\u2014A key issue is that consultants\u2019 independence may  be compromised if employers paid consultants directly for conducting  audits and certifying employers. Employers might also need more than  one consultant to conduct a comprehensive review of both safety and  health issues. Finally, the use of consultants would set the federal program  in competition with the State Consultation Program, according to OSHA  officials.  (b) Oversight\u2014One issue is what kind of oversight is possible when  employers will not\u2014or cannot\u2014make improvements that consultants  recommend. Another is that differences in consultants\u2019 focus would create  inconsistencies in the certification process, since a workplace evaluation  could focus on compliance with OSHA standards or on the broader safety  and health environment, as under OSHA\u2019s VPP, Partnership, and SHARP  programs.  (c) Legality\u2014Finally, constitutional issues have been raised as to whether  OSHA can use private consultants, as envisioned by the SAFE Act, to  conduct safety and health evaluations of employers\u2019 worksites and to issue  certificates of compliance, exempting employers from civil penalties for a  limited period of time. For example, when Congress was considering the  SAFE Act, the Justice Department argued that the act might be  unconstitutional because, among other things, it delegated executive  functions to private entities without providing adequate supervision or  accountability for their activities. The Senate Committee on Health,  Education, Labor, and Pensions, which had jurisdiction over the  legislation, disagreed with Justice\u2019s arguments, asserting that they  reflected a misunderstanding of the proposed role and authority of third- party consultants."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["By many accounts, OSHA\u2019s voluntary compliance strategies have  improved employers\u2019 safety and health practices by allowing the agency to  play a collaborative, rather than a policing, role with employers.

The agency has begun to  develop performance measures and collect data on some program  outcomes, as well as undertake efforts to evaluate its programs, such as  contracting for a VPP evaluation and revising the performance evaluation  format for the Partnership program. However, because OSHA does not yet  have comprehensive data on its voluntary compliance programs, the  agency cannot fully assess the effectiveness of any single program or  compare the relative effectiveness of the programs. OSHA should position  itself to know, for example, the relative effectiveness of programs that  focus on employers predisposed to following good safety and health  practices as compared to those that attempt to reach employers and  industries with poor safety and health records. Without such information,  the agency is also limited in its ability to make sound decisions about how  to best allocate its resources among individual programs, or between  voluntary compliance programs and its other activities, particularly  enforcement.", "After several years of experimentation and growth, this is an opportune  time for OSHA to determine how to best target its voluntary compliance  efforts.
