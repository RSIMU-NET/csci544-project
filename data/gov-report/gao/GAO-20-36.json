Detentions at facilities staffed by ICE medical personnel of individuals with mental disorders and women who are nursing varied from calendar years 2015 to 2018. We found that ICE does not collect or maintain readily available data on detained parents or legal guardians of U.S. citizen or legal permanent resident minors, as required by ICE policy. Without such information, ICE headquarters officials cannot ensure that ICE officers are collecting and entering this information into the system as required by policy.

ICE conducts civil immigration enforcement actions,  which includes administrative arrests for civil violations of U.S.  immigration laws (arrests), detentions, and removals. ICE is also  responsible for providing accommodations and medical care to individuals  in detention with special needs or vulnerabilities, such as those who are  pregnant, elderly, or who have certain medical conditions. To maximize  its limited resources, ICE has prioritized certain groups of aliens for removal from the United States, such as individuals with criminal  convictions.", "From January 5, 2015 through February 20, 2017, the Priority  Enforcement Program (PEP) directed DHS personnel to prioritize the  apprehension, detention, and removal of aliens from the United States  who pose a threat to national security, border security, and public safety,  among others. On January 25, 2017, the President issued Executive  Order 13768, Enhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United States,  instructing federal agencies, including DHS, to ensure that U.S  immigration law is enforced against all removable individuals without  exempting classes or categories, among other things. In response, the  Secretary of Homeland Security issued a memorandum establishing  policy and providing guidance related to Executive Order 13768 in  February 2017 (2017 DHS memo). In accordance with both Executive  Order 13768 and the 2017 DHS memo, although aliens with criminal  history are prioritized for enforcement action, the department is  authorized to take action against any removable aliens encountered  during operations.", "In 2018, we reported on ICE\u2019s initial actions to implement Executive Order  13768.

For the purposes of our report, we selected eight  populations including aliens who are: lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender,  and intersex (LGBTI); individuals with disabilities; individuals with mental  disorders; juveniles; parents or legal guardians of minors; pregnant;  women who are nursing; or individuals who are elderly. We selected  these eight populations based on ICE policies that identify aliens with  special vulnerabilities and input from nongovernmental organizations  (NGOs) that serve or represent aliens with special vulnerabilities.", "To address our first question, we analyzed individual-level data from the  ICE Integrated Decision Support (IIDS) database to determine the total  number of ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) arrests by  gender, country of citizenship, criminality, arresting program, and area of  responsibility between January 2015 (the start of PEP) and December  2018 (to include the first two years for the 2017 DHS Memo). We also  analyzed individual-level IIDS data to determine the total number of ERO  detentions and removals by gender, country of citizenship, arresting  agency, and criminality between January 2015 and December 2018.

To identify any changes ICE made to align its policies with the 2017 DHS  memo, we reviewed specific provisions in the executive order and  implementing memoranda. We then analyzed existing policies as well as  policies that ICE revised or rescinded to align with the 2017 DHS memo,  including policies related to prosecutorial discretion and selected  populations. We conducted interviews with officials from ICE  headquarters offices, including the Office of the Principal Legal Advisor,  Office of Policy, Homeland Security Investigations, as well as program  officials within ERO, including Domestic Operations, Fugitive Operations,  and Custody Management Divisions. We also conducted interviews with  representatives from NGOs that serve or represent our selected  populations to obtain their perspectives on how, if at all, the policies  affected the individuals they represent.", "We conducted site visits to six selected ICE ERO areas of responsibility  (Atlanta, Dallas, Los Angeles, San Diego, St. Paul, and Washington,  D.C.) and interviewed ICE officials to obtain their perspectives on the  policy revisions.

In each location we met with  ERO liaisons and officers responsible for monitoring and implementing  policy provisions for certain selected populations, as well as ICE medical  staff, among others. We met with six national organizations that serve or  represent immigrants as well as six state or regional organizations that  serve or represent immigrants in the locations we visited. We selected  these NGOs to reflect a range of types of populations served or  represented as well as based on their proximity to ICE areas of  responsibility we visited. The information obtained from our site visits  and interviews with the NGOs is not generalizable and may not be  indicative of the care provided to all populations at all detention facilities,  but provided insights into how the selected ICE areas of responsibility  conduct enforcement activities and implement immigration enforcement  policies.", "To address our third question, we reviewed multiple data sources that  ICE uses to track information on certain aliens with special vulnerabilities  in detention and matched these data with individual-level detention data  from IIDS to determine what ICE data show about detentions of selected  populations between January 2015 and December 2018. We analyzed  this information, for six of the eight selected populations (aliens who are:  transgender, individuals with disabilities, pregnant, individuals with mental  disorders, women who are nursing, or individuals who are elderly), to  determine the total number of detentions; the number of detentions  resulting from ICE versus U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP)  arrests; detentions by criminality; and the length of detention. We  excluded juveniles\u2014aliens under the age of 18\u2014from our analysis  because ERO is generally not responsible for detaining juveniles, unless  they were detained with their parent or legal guardian at an ICE Family  Residential Center. To determine the extent to which ICE maintains data  on detained parents or legal guardians of minors, we reviewed ICE  policies pertaining to detained parents, including those that set forth  requirements for tracking detained parents or legal guardians of U.S.  citizens and legal permanent resident minors. We interviewed ERO  officials about ICE\u2019s data collection processes and any limitations with the  data it collects and maintains. We assessed ICE\u2019s efforts to track this  population against agency policy.", "To assess the reliability of the data used in each of our analyses, we  analyzed available documentation, such as related data dictionaries;  interviewed ERO officials knowledgeable about the data; conducted  electronic tests to identify missing data, anomalies, or erroneous values;  and followed up with officials, as appropriate.

ICE issued a memo  further directing efforts to implement the executive order and apply the  guidance from the 2017 DHS memo. The ICE memo stated that ICE was  to review all existing policies and guidance documents and revise or  rescind relevant policies in order to ensure consistency with the executive  order.

To inform custody decisions for aliens who are  arrested and not subject to mandatory detention, ICE guidance  requires officers to consider certain factors, including risk of flight, risk  of harm to public safety, and special vulnerabilities. For example,  individuals with a physical or mental illness or disability, or individuals  who fear being harmed in detention based on their sexual orientation  or gender identity may be considered for release or alternatives to  detention (ATD) based on these special vulnerabilities.

These obligations include  maintaining a process to identify these detainees through observation,  assessments, screenings, and self-identification; notifying detainees of  their right to request accommodations; and establishing a process to  inform a detainee of the final decision on the request for  accommodations, including whether the facility will provide alternative  accommodations that are equally effective as those requested; among  other things.", "In addition, this directive requires ERO to designate an ERO disability  access coordinator who is to serve as the primary point of contact and  subject matter expert for ERO headquarters and the field regarding the  accommodation of, and communication with, detainees with disabilities in  ERO custody. Among other duties, the ERO disability access coordinator  is responsible for evaluating information from all relevant ICE data  systems regarding the identification, care, approved accommodations and  custody of detainees with disabilities; as well as maintaining records of  detainees with communication and mobility impairments, including  records of denials of detainee requests for accommodations by facilities.  According to the directive, detainees with communication impairments  include detainees with hearing, visual, and speech impairments (e.g.,  detainees who are deaf or hard of hearing, blind, or nonverbal).  Detainees with mobility impairments include detainees with physical  impairments who require a wheelchair, crutches, prosthesis, cane, other  mobility device, or other assistance. Accommodations for these  impairments may include accessible showers, Braille material, or note  takers for persons with physical and sensory impairments, among other  things. The ERO disability access coordinator is also responsible for  helping to ensure compliance with the provisions of this directive.", "Field office directors are required to appoint at least one supervisory-level  employee to serve as the supporting disability access coordinator for  each area of responsibility. Supporting disability access coordinators are  responsible for serving as the main point of contact for their field office  regarding compliance with federal law and DHS, ICE, and ERO  regulations, detention standards, policies, and procedures related to  detainees with disabilities. Supporting disability access coordinators are  also responsible for collaborating and communicating with ERO  headquarters, field office, detention facility, and health care personnel to  monitor the care and treatment of detainees with disabilities, among other  things. In all six areas of responsibility we visited, supporting disability  access coordinators and medical staff told us that they track detainees  who receive accommodations for communication and mobility  impairments by recording the accommodation on a form that they submit  to ERO headquarters.", "According to ICE, the Assessment and Accommodations for Detainees  with Disabilities directive did not need to be revised to align with the 2017  DHS Memo. This directive states that it is meant to implement and  complement the requirements of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of  1973 and states that detainees with disabilities will be provided an equal  opportunity to access, participate in, or benefit from in-custody programs,  services, and activities, and that detainees with disabilities will be  provided with auxiliary aids and services as necessary to allow for  effective communication. Further, the directive states that a field office  director may consider releasing from ICE custody a detainee with an  impairment or disability who is not subject to mandatory detention. ERO  officers in five areas of responsibility we visited reported that they consult  with the supporting disability access coordinator, medical staff, or a  supervisor to determine whether local detention facilities are able to  provide appropriate accommodations. Our analysis of ICE data shows  that the number of detentions of individuals with communication and  mobility impairments increased from 434 to 530 in calendar years 2017 to  2018.", "Parents or Legal Guardians of Minors. In August 2017, ICE issued a  policy titled Detention and Removal of Alien Parents or Legal Guardians,  which provides guidance regarding the detention and removal of alien  parents and legal guardians, including those with children who are U.S.  citizens and legal permanent residents and parents with ongoing cases in  family court or child welfare proceedings in the United States. This  policy directs ERO to designate a child welfare coordinator to serve as  the primary point of contact and subject matter expert for all ICE  personnel regarding child welfare issues related to detained alien parents.  The child welfare coordinator is also responsible for evaluating  information from all relevant ICE data systems regarding detained alien  parents or legal guardians of U.S. citizen and legal permanent resident  minors and sharing appropriate information with field points of contact,  among other things. Specifically, this policy directs field office directors to make appropriate arrangements for detained parents to attend child  welfare proceedings. ERO officers in three of the six areas of  responsibility we visited stated that they coordinate visits to family courts  for the detained parent to appear at these hearings. The field office  director in each area of responsibility is to designate a field point of  contact to communicate with the child welfare coordinator and address  public inquires related to detained parents or legal guardians in ERO  custody.", "The August 2017 policy superseded an August 2013 policy titled  Facilitating Parental Interests in the Course of Civil Immigration  Enforcement Activities, which ERO revised to align with the 2017 DHS  memo. In the revised policy, ERO removed language indicating that field  office directors should weigh whether an exercise of prosecutorial  discretion may be warranted for an alien who is a parent or legal guardian  of a U.S. citizen or legal permanent resident minor or is a primary  caretaker of a minor, and to exercise such discretion as early as possible.  ERO officers in five of the six areas of responsibility we visited stated that  they typically do not detain parents of minors, unless criminal history  warrants detention. Attorneys we met with from a NGO that provides  services to immigrant families and refugees stated that they have  observed an increase in the number and length of detentions of parents  or legal guardians of minors since January 2017. We were not able to  identify trends in detention of detained parents because ERO does not  collect or maintain data on this population in a readily available format.", "Pregnant Women. In December 2017, ICE issued a directive titled  Identification and Monitoring of Pregnant Detainees, which sets forth  policy and procedures to ensure pregnant detainees in ICE custody for  immigration violations are identified, monitored, tracked, and housed in an  appropriate facility to manage their care. According to ICE policy on  women\u2019s health, pregnant women are identified upon arrival to a  detention facility because all women of childbearing age undergo a  pregnancy test during intake processing. According to the December  2017 directive, IHSC personnel are responsible for notifying the field  office director and IHSC headquarters, as soon as practical, when a  pregnant detainee is identified; monitoring the condition of pregnant  detainees, including the general health of the pregnant detainee and  medical condition of the fetus; and communicating with the field office  director about any specific risk factors or concerns. In addition, IHSC  personnel are to provide oversight and review of facility capabilities to  determine if the needs of a pregnant detainee can be accommodated and  recommend to the field office director when a transfer to another facility is  necessary for appropriate medical care. Further, IHSC personnel are to  develop and maintain a system for tracking and monitoring all pregnant  detainees.", "This policy superseded an August 2016 version with the same title, which  ERO revised to align with the 2017 DHS memo, according to ICE officials.  In the revised version, ERO removed language stating that absent  extraordinary circumstances pregnant women will generally not be  detained by ICE. In five of the six areas of responsibility we visited, ERO  officers stated that unless mandatory detention is required, they still  generally avoid detaining pregnant women. In addition, ERO officers in all  six areas of responsibility we visited stated that they are less likely to  detain and may release a woman who is having a high risk pregnancy or  in the third trimester of her pregnancy. However, an official in the sixth  area of responsibility noted that under the revised policy, pregnant  women may be detained during the third trimester, if she is likely to be  removed quickly and has medical clearance to fly. Officers in two of the  six areas of responsibility we visited noted that pregnant women may also  be released on bond, under an order of supervision, or other non- detention options, after assessing the facts of the case. Attorneys and  policy advocates we met with from three NGOs that represent a range of  immigrant populations stated that they have observed increases in the  detention of pregnant women since January 2017. Attorneys from another  NGO we met with provided anecdotes of cases of pregnant detainees  who experienced medical challenges, including miscarriages while in  custody. Our analysis of ICE data shows that the number of detentions  of pregnant women varied, but increased overall, from 1380 in calendar  year 2016 to 2098 in calendar year 2018.", "Juveniles. In April 2018, ICE issued the Field Office Juvenile Coordinator  Handbook to guide ERO staff in processing, transporting, managing, and  removing juveniles\u2014persons encountered by ERO who have not reached  18 years of age. Field office juvenile coordinators, who serve as local  subject-matter experts on juvenile matters for each area of responsibility,  provide policy guidance to ERO personnel within their areas of  responsibility, and assist with case review and custody redeterminations.  Field office juvenile coordinators are also required to coordinate with  other federal agencies including the Office of Refugee Resettlement,  where juveniles designated as unaccompanied alien children are typically  transferred. According to ERO policy, unaccompanied alien children  apprehended by ERO or transferred into ERO custody by CBP are to be  placed in the care of the Office of Refugee Resettlement within 72 hours  of identification, if they are not repatriated at the border. The Field Office  Juvenile Coordinator Handbook was released after the 2017 DHS memo  and aligns with the 2017 DHS Memo.", "According to officers in four of the six areas of responsibility we visited,  ERO does not target juveniles for arrests, unless they have criminal  records. For example, officers we met with in one area of responsibility  stated that ERO typically does not target juveniles in that location, unless  they are affiliated with gangs, because they are unlikely to pose a public  safety threat. Our analysis of ICE data shows that the number of arrests  of juveniles varied, but increased overall, from calendar years 2015  through 2018. We excluded juveniles from our analysis of individual ICE  detention data because ICE is generally not responsible for detaining  juveniles, as discussed above.", "Nursing Women. While ICE does not have a separate policy on the care,  detention, or removal of women who are nursing, the 2017 Directive on  Women\u2019s Health Services provides guidance to IHSC staff on the delivery  and administration of health services to this population. According to this  directive, women who are nursing are identified during initial processing  before being placed into custody at a detention facility because ERO  officials and medical personnel are required to ask women if they are  breastfeeding. Medical personnel make recommendations pertaining to  the detention of women who are nursing, and in most cases, these  detainees are placed in IHSC-staffed facilities. IHSC personnel record  and use this information to monitor the care and needs of women who are  nursing, according to IHSC officials. In five of the six areas of  responsibility we visited, officers stated that they typically do not detain  women who are nursing, unless their criminal histories warrant  detention. Specifically, health officials in one of the five areas of  responsibility explained that if a nursing mother is detained, she is  typically released within a few hours or placed on bond or order of  supervision. Our analysis of ICE data shows that the number of  detentions of nursing women at IHSC-staffed facilities varied from  calendar years 2015 through 2018 but increased overall from 157 in 2015  to 381 in 2018.", "Elderly Individuals. ICE no longer has a policy guiding the detention or  care of elderly detainees. According to ICE guidance on assessing individuals with special vulnerabilities during the intake process, ICE  generally considers someone to be elderly starting at age 65. However,  the guidance instructs agents and officers to assess whether these  individuals have physical indicators of infirmity or fragility caused by old  age when making decisions regarding detaining or releasing them. In  February 2018, as part of its effort to align internal policies with the 2017  DHS memo, ERO rescinded a 2009 policy directing officers to  administratively close cases of non-criminal fugitives who are 70 years  old or older for humanitarian/health reasons. ERO officers in five of the  six areas of responsibility we visited reported that they do not target  individuals who are elderly and continue to consider criminal history and  medical condition when deciding whether to detain them. For example,  officials in one of these five areas of responsibility explained that  someone who committed an aggravated felony would be subject to  mandatory detention regardless of age, but if the individual has a serious  medical condition, such as advanced cancer, ERO may decide to release  them from custody because the agency would be responsible for the cost  of their medical treatments while they are in custody. Officers in the sixth  area of responsibility said they have started to detain individuals who are  elderly following the issuance of the 2017 DHS memo, but noted that they  coordinate with the courts to expedite these hearings before an  immigration judge who may order the release of an elderly detainee.  Attorneys we met with from a NGO that provides services to immigrant  families and refugees stated that they have observed an increase in  detentions of individuals who are elderly, and only those with serious  medical issues were considered for release.

To what extent does ICE collect data on selected populations in  detention and what do these data show?", "To address our first question, we analyzed individual-level data from the  U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Integrated Decision  Support (IIDS) database, to determine the total number of ICE  Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) administrative arrests  (arrests), detentions, and removals from January 2015 (the start of the  Priority Enforcement Program) through December 2018 (to include the  first two years for the 2017 DHS Memo). ERO conducts civil immigration  enforcement actions, which includes arrests for civil violations of U.S.  immigration laws, detentions, and removals.", "Arrests. We analyzed individual-level arrest data from IIDS to  determine the total number of ERO arrests for each calendar year  2015 through 2018. We examined multiple data fields from the  individual-level arrest data, including alien file number, family name,  given name, gender, country of citizenship, arrest date, area of  responsibility, and criminality, among other variables. Because aliens  may have multiple arrests, we used alien number and arrest date to  identify the unique number of arrests rather than the number of unique  aliens who were arrested. We excluded from our analysis arrest  records that had a missing alien number, an invalid alien number\u2014 i.e., that included all zeroes or had duplicate alien number and arrest  date combinations\u2014or records that indicated test in the name fields.  We analyzed these data to determine total numbers of arrests by  gender, country of citizenship, criminality, arresting program, and area  of responsibility.", "To determine the number of arrests by gender, we analyzed IIDS  individual-level arrest data. We also analyzed these data to  determine the number of arrests by criminality for each gender,  using ICE\u2019s determination of criminality for our analysis, as  discussed below.", "To determine the number of arrests by country of citizenship, we  analyzed IIDS individual-level arrest data. ICE obtains country of  citizenship data from arrest reports, which may be based on  documentation or self-reported.", "To determine the number of arrests by criminality, we analyzed  IIDS individual-level arrest data. For the purposes of this report  and our presentation of ICE data, we refer to potentially  removable aliens without criminal convictions known to ICE as  \u201cnon-criminals\u201d and aliens with criminal convictions known to ICE  as \u201cconvicted criminals.\u201d According to ERO officials, arrests of  non-criminals include individuals who have been charged but not  convicted of a crime as well as those with no prior criminal history.  According to ICE, ICE officers electronically request and retrieve  criminal history information about an alien from the FBI\u2019s National  Crime Information Center (NCIC) database, which maintains a  repository of federal and state criminal history information. ICE  officers are also able to manually enter criminal history information  in ICE\u2019s data system if they discover additional criminal history  information that was not available in NCIC. ICE officers may also  check for criminal convictions committed outside the United  States, on a case-by-case basis. Most of the ICE data we  reviewed indicated criminal or non-criminal history, where criminal  included convictions, and non-criminal included both pending  criminal charges and other immigration violations. Therefore,  wherever we referred to criminality, we used ICE\u2019s determination  of criminality\u2014criminal or non-criminal\u2014for our analysis.", "To determine the number of arrests by arresting program, we  analyzed IIDS individual-level arrests data to determine the  number of arrests at-large in the communities by ICE\u2019s fugitive  operations teams and those resulting from an incarceration in  federal, state, and local prisons and jails through the Criminal  Alien Program.", "To determine the number of arrests by ERO area of responsibility,  we analyzed IIDS individual-level arrests data for calendar years  2015 through 2018. We also used these data to calculate the  proportion of arrests of convicted criminals by ERO area of  responsibility. We compared the number of arrests across the 24  ERO areas of responsibility to examine the differences in  enforcement actions between the years the Priority Enforcement  Program were in effect (2015-2016) and the years immediately  following implementation of the DHS memo (2017-2018). We  excluded from our analysis arrest records that had a missing or  unknown area of responsibility.", "We also analyzed IIDS individual-level arrest data to determine the  total number of arrests of juveniles during calendar years 2015  through 2018. Because aliens may have multiple arrests, we used  alien number and arrest date to identify the unique number of arrests  rather than the number of unique aliens who were arrested. We  excluded from our analysis arrest records that had a missing alien  number, an invalid alien number\u2014i.e., that included all zeroes or had  duplicate alien number and arrest date combinations. We used these  data to determine the total number of arrests of juveniles by age and  gender.", "Detentions. We analyzed individual-level detention data from IIDS to  determine the total number of ERO detentions during calendar years  2015 through 2018. We examined multiple data fields from the  individual-level detention data, including alien file number, person id,  family name, given name, gender, country of citizenship, arresting  agency, criminality, detention facility, book-in date, book-out date,  release reason, and length of stay, among other variables. Because  aliens may have multiple detentions, we used alien number and initial  book-in date fields\u2014i.e., the first date the individual is taken into ICE  custody\u2014to identify the unique number of detentions rather than the  number of unique aliens who were detained. We excluded from our  analysis arrest records that had a missing alien number or had an  invalid alien number\u2014i.e., that included all zeroes. We analyzed  these data to determine total numbers of detentions by gender,  country of citizenship, arresting agency, and criminality.", "To determine the number of detentions by gender, we analyzed  IIDS individual-level detention data. We also analyzed these data  to determine the number of detentions by arresting agency\u2014ICE  or U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP)\u2014and criminality for  each gender. We included all detentions resulting from both ICE  and CBP arrests because ICE is responsible for detaining certain  aliens apprehended by CBP at or between ports of entry. To  conduct our analysis, we used ICE\u2019s determination of criminality\u2014 criminal or non-criminal\u2014which ICE determines by conducting  electronic criminal history checks, as previously discussed.", "To determine the number of detentions by country of citizenship,  we analyzed IIDS individual-level detention data. ICE obtains  country of citizenship data from arrest reports, which may be  based on documentation or self-reported.", "To determine the number of detentions by arresting agency, we  analyzed IIDS individual-level detention data for detentions  resulting from ICE arrests and those resulting from CBP arrests at  or between ports of entry.", "To determine the number of detentions by criminality, we analyzed  IIDS individual-level detention data. We also examined the extent  to which detentions varied by criminality and arresting agency. To  conduct our analysis, we used ICE\u2019s determination of criminality\u2014 criminal or non-criminal\u2014which ICE determines by conducting  electronic criminal history checks, as previously discussed.", "Removals. We analyzed individual-level removal data from IIDS to  determine the total number of ERO removals during calendar years  2015 through 2018. We examined multiple data fields from the  individual-level removal data, including alien file number, family name,  given name, gender, country of citizenship, criminality, arresting  agency, and removal date, among other variables. Because aliens  may have multiple removals, we used alien number and removal date  to identify the unique number of removals rather than the number of  unique aliens. We excluded from our analysis removal records that  had a missing alien number, an invalid alien number\u2014i.e., that  included all zeroes, or had duplicate alien number and removal date  combinations, or records that indicated test in the name fields. We  analyzed these data to determine total numbers of removals by  gender, country of citizenship, arresting agency, and criminality.", "To determine the number of removals by gender, we analyzed  IIDS individual-level removal data. We also analyzed these data to  determine the number of removals by arresting agency and  criminality for each gender. To conduct our analysis, we used  ICE\u2019s determination of criminality\u2014criminal or non-criminal\u2014which  ICE determines by conducting electronic criminal history checks,  as previously discussed.", "To determine the number of removals by country of citizenship,  we analyzed IIDS individual-level data.

To conduct our analysis, we  used ICE\u2019s determination of criminality\u2014criminal or non-criminal\u2014 which ICE determines by conducting electronic criminal history  checks, as previously discussed.", "We determined that the data used in each of our analyses were  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report by analyzing available  documentation, such as related data dictionaries; interviewing ICE  officials knowledgeable about the data; conducting electronic tests to  identify missing data, anomalies, or erroneous values; and following up  with officials, as appropriate.", "We also analyzed arrest data from Homeland Security Investigations  (HSI) worksite enforcement to determine the total number of criminal and  administrative arrests conducted by HSI worksite enforcement between  January 2015 and December 2018. We were unable to use these data for  the purposes of reporting the total number of arrests by HSI worksite  enforcement for each calendar year. Specifically, we identified  combined arrest, charge, and conviction dates in the same field, among  other issues, which limited our ability to identify the number of aliens  arrested by HSI as a result of worksite enforcement operations each year.", "To address our second question, we reviewed a master list of ICE  policies and interviewed policy officials to identify policies related to  individuals with special vulnerabilities. Based on this review as well as  input from nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) that serve or  represent various populations, we selected eight populations including  aliens who are: lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex (LGBTI),  individuals with disabilities, juveniles, parents or legal guardians of  minors, pregnant, individuals with mental disorders, women who are  nursing, or individuals who are elderly. To identify the changes ICE made  to align these policies with the 2017 DHS memo, we reviewed specific  provisions in the executive order and implementing memoranda. We then  analyzed existing policies as well as policies that ICE revised or  rescinded to align with the 2017 DHS memo, including policies related to  prosecutorial discretion and selected populations. We conducted  interviews with officials from ICE headquarters offices, including the  Office of the Principal Legal Advisor, Office of Policy, Homeland Security  Investigations, as well as program officials within ERO, including  Domestic Operations, Fugitive Operations, and Custody Management  Divisions. We met with six national organizations that serve or represent  immigrants as well as six state or regional organizations that serve or  represent immigrants in the locations we visited to obtain their  perspectives on how the policies affected the individuals they represent.  The perspectives of NGOs are not generalizable and my not be indicative  of care provided at all detention facilities. We selected these NGOs to  reflect a range of types of populations served or represented as well as  based on their proximity to ICE areas of responsibility we visited, see  table 8 for more information on the organizations we interviewed.", "We conducted site visits to six selected ICE ERO areas of responsibility  (Atlanta, Dallas, Los Angeles, San Diego, St. Paul, and Washington,  D.C.) and interviewed ICE officials to obtain their perspectives on the  policy revisions. We selected these locations based on the prevalence of  arrests in fiscal year 2017, percent changes in arrests from fiscal year  2016 to 2017, and geographical dispersion. Specifically, we identified  locations that had the highest arrest numbers in fiscal year 2017 or the  largest percentage increases in arrests from fiscal years 2016 to 2017,  and then selected locations that provided wide geographical  representation. In each location we met with ERO liaisons and officers  responsible for monitoring and implementing the provisions of policies for  certain selected populations, as well as detention and deportation officers  and supervisors who oversee the detention and removal of aliens,  including those with special vulnerabilities. We also met with ICE medical  staff in areas of responsibility with this position. In one area of  responsibility, we limited our visit to a detention facility and met with the  staff at that facility due to its proximity to another area of responsibility we  visited. The information obtained from these site visits is not generalizable  and may not be indicative of care provided to all populations at all  detention facilities, but provided insights into how selected ICE areas of  responsibility conduct enforcement activities and implement immigration  enforcement policies.", "To address our third question, we reviewed multiple data sources that  ICE uses to track information on certain aliens with special vulnerabilities  in detention and matched these data with IIDS individual-level detention  data to determine what ICE data show about detentions of selected  populations between January 2015 and December 2018. To conduct our  analysis, we first excluded records that contained missing alien numbers  or alien numbers that were all zeroes. Then, we matched each data  source to the IIDS detention data using alien number and excluded  additional records we were unable to match. Because aliens may have  multiple detentions, we compared the admission or book-in date from  each data source with the book-in dates from the IIDS detention data, and  excluded additional records with dates beyond 30 days apart. We  analyzed this information to determine the total number of detentions for  six of the eight selected populations (aliens who are: transgender,  individuals with disabilities, pregnant, individuals with mental disorders,  nursing, and elderly); and the number of detentions resulting from ICE  versus CBP arrests; as well as detentions by criminality and the length of  detention for each of these six populations. We excluded juveniles from  our analysis because ERO is generally not responsible for detaining  juveniles. To determine the extent to which ICE maintains data on  detained parents or legal guardians of minors, we reviewed ICE policies  pertaining to detained parents, including those that set forth requirements  for tracking detained parents or legal guardians of U.S. citizens and legal  permanent resident minors. We also interviewed ERO officials about  ICE\u2019s data collection processes and any limitations with the data it  collects and maintains. We assessed ICE\u2019s efforts to track this population  against agency policy.", "To conduct our analysis of criminality for each population, we used ICE\u2019s  determination of criminality\u2014criminal or non-criminal\u2014which ICE  determines by conducting electronic criminal history checks, as previously  discussed. We also analyzed IIDS data on criminal charges for detentions  of aliens that resulted from ICE arrests to determine the type of charges  (e.g., immigration-related or other criminal charges) associated with these  detentions. To conduct our analysis on length of detention, we  compared initial book-in date with the most recent book-out date to  calculate the total days in detention for each of our selected populations.", "Transgender Individuals: We matched ERO records for transgender  detainees from calendar years 2016 through 2018 with IIDS  individual-level detention data to determine the total number of  detentions of transgender individuals, as well as the number of  detentions by arresting agency, criminality, and length of detention.  We excluded 4 of the unique transgender detainee records for 2016,  33 for 2017 and 27 for 2018. These records were excluded because  we were unable to match these records to the IIDS individual level- detention data using alien number and book-in date combinations.  According to ICE officials, this may be due to data entry errors. Our  analysis is based on those records we were able to match: 228 for  2016, 241 for 2017, and 277 for 2018. ICE also recorded 55  transgender detainees in 2015; however, we excluded these records  from our analysis since ICE did not collect complete data on this  population in 2015. For the LGBTI population, ICE only collects and  maintains data on transgender individuals in detention. Therefore, we  were only able to analyze data for this subset of the LGBTI  population.", "Individuals with Disabilities: We matched ERO records for  individuals with communication and mobility impairments in ERO  custody during calendar years 2017 and 2018 with IIDS individual- level detention data to determine the total number of detentions of  these individuals, as well as the number of detentions by arresting  agency, criminality, and length of detention. We excluded 5 of the  unique detainee records for 2017, and 1 for 2018 because we were  unable to match these records to the IIDS individual level-detention  data using alien number and book-in date combinations. According to  ICE officials, this may be due to data entry errors. Our analysis is  based on those records we were able to match: 424 for 2017, and 516  for 2018. When ICE began collecting these data, it included aliens  who were placed in detention prior to January 2017. We excluded 99  records for this reason from our analysis since ICE did not collect  complete data on this population prior to January 2017.", "Pregnant Women: We matched ICE Health Service Corps (IHSC)  records for pregnant women in ERO custody during calendar years  2016 through 2018 with IIDS individual-level detention data to  determine the total number of detentions of pregnant women, as well  as the number of detentions by arresting agency, criminality, and  length of detention. We excluded 60 of the unique pregnant  detainee records for 2016, 20 for 2017 and 32 for 2018 because we  were unable to match these records to the IIDS individual-level  detention data using alien number and book-in date combinations.  According to ICE officials, this may be due to data entry errors. Our  analysis is based on those records we were able to match: 1,377 for  2016, 1,150 for 2017, and 2,094 for 2018. ICE also recorded 675  pregnant detainees in 2015; however, we excluded these records  from our analysis since ICE did not collect complete data on this  population in 2015.", "Elderly Individuals: We analyzed data records in IIDS for elderly  individuals (those 65 years or older at the time of initial book-in) in  ERO custody during calendar years 2015 through 2018 to determine  the total number of detentions of elderly individuals, as well as the  number of detentions by arresting agency, criminality, and length of  detention. According to ERO, the agency does not maintain separate  data records for elderly individuals in ERO custody; however, ERO  officials were able to identify these detainees by calculating their age  at the time they were detained. We excluded 4 of the unique elderly  detainee records for 2015, 3 for 2016 and 4 for 2018 because we  were unable to match these records to the IIDS individual-level  detention data using alien number and book-in date combinations.  According to ICE officials, this may be due to data entry errors. Our  analysis is based on those records we were able to match: 863 for  2015, 736 for 2016, 763 for 2017, and 1,132 for 2018.", "Individuals with Mental Disorders and Nursing Women: We  matched IHSC records for individuals with mental disorders and  nursing women detained at IHSC-staffed facilities during calendar  years 2015 through 2018 with IIDS individual-level detention data to  determine the total number of detentions of each of these populations,  as well as the number of detentions by arresting agency, criminality,  and length of detention. Because ICE did not maintain data on  individuals with mental disorders or nursing women detained at the  over 200 non-IHSC staffed facilities, our findings for these two  populations are not generalizable, but provided valuable insights into  these detentions. We excluded 207 of the unique detainee with  mental disorders records for 2016, 850 for 2017, and 1,233 for 2018  because we were unable to match these records with the IIDS  individual-level detention data using alien number and book-in date  combinations. Our analysis is based on the unique detainee with  mental disorders records we were able to match: 8,138 for 2015,  9,466 for 2016, 8,643 for 2017, and 8,501 for 2018. Similarly, we  excluded 2 of the unique nursing detainee records for 2015, 3 for  2017 and 5 for 2018 for the same reason. Our analysis is based on  the unique nursing detainee records we were able to match: 157 for  2015, 399 for 2016, 564 for 2017, and 381 for 2018. According to ICE  officials, this may be due to data entry errors.", "We assessed the reliability of the data used in each of our analyses by  analyzing available documentation, such as related data dictionaries;  interviewing ERO officials knowledgeable about the data; conducting  electronic tests to identify missing data, anomalies, or erroneous values;  and following up with officials, as appropriate. We determined the data  were sufficiently reliable for depicting general trends in detentions for the  selected populations.", "We conducted this performance audit from November 2017 to December  2019 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.
