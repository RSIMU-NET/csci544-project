The law permits banks to tie credit and traditional banking products, such as cash management, and does not prohibit banks from considering the profitability of their full relationship with customers in managing those relationships. Some corporate customers and officials from an investment bank not affiliated with a commercial bank have alleged that commercial banks illegally tie the availability or terms, including price, of credit to customers' purchase of other services. However, with few exceptions, formal complaints have not been brought to the attention of the regulatory agencies and little documentary evidence surrounding these allegations exists, in part, because credit negotiations are conducted orally. Further, our review found that some corporate customers' claims involved lawful ties between traditional banking products rather than unlawful ties. These findings illustrate a key challenge for banking regulators in enforcing this law: while regulators need to carefully consider the circumstances of specific transactions to determine whether the customers' acceptance of an unlawfully tied product (that is, one that is not a traditional banking product) was made a condition of obtaining credit, documentary evidence on those circumstances might not be available. Therefore, regulators may have to look for indirect evidence to assess whether banks unlawfully tie products and services. Although customer information could have an important role in helping regulators enforce section 106, regulators generally have not solicited information from corporate bank customers. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) recently reviewed antitying policies and procedures of several large commercial banks. The Federal Reserve and OCC, however, did not analyze a broadly-based selection of transactions or generally solicit additional information from corporate borrowers about their knowledge of transactions. The agencies generally found no unlawful tying arrangements and concluded that these banks generally had adequate policies and procedures intended to prevent and detect tying practices. The agencies found variation among the banks in interpretation of the tying law and its exceptions. As a result, in August 2003, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, working with OCC, released for public comment new draft guidance, with a goal of better informing banks and their customers about the requirements of the antitying provision."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In the 70 years since the passage of the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, which  prohibited commercial banks from engaging in investment banking  activities such as securities underwriting, changes in legislation and  regulatory interpretations have relaxed some of the restrictions imposed  on bank holding companies and their subsidiaries that served to distance  commercial banks from investment banking. For example, one effect of the  1970 amendments to the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 was to permit  bank holding companies to own subsidiaries engaged in limited  underwriting activities, but only if the subsidiary was not \u201cprincipally  engaged\u201d in such activities. More recently, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of  1999, among other things, substantially removed that limitation. As a result  of these and other developments, commercial banks and their investment  bank affiliates (investment affiliates) can provide complementary financial  products and services. Despite these developments, commercial banks  have remained subject to certain restrictions on their activities. Among  them is the prohibition against tying arrangements. In general, section 106  of the Bank Holding Company Act Amendments of 1970 (section 106)  prohibits banks from tying the availability or price of a product or service  to a customer\u2019s purchase of another product or service or the customer\u2019s  providing some additional credit, property or service.", "In recent years, investment bank affiliates of large commercial banks have  gained an increasing share of the annual $1.3 trillion debt underwriting  market. A controversy has arisen over whether or not unlawful tying has  contributed to this increased market share. Some unaffiliated investment  banks (investment banks) and some corporate borrowers contend that  commercial banks have facilitated investment affiliates\u2019 increased market  share of debt underwriting by unlawfully tying the availability of bank  credit to debt underwriting by the bank\u2019s affiliate, a violation of section 106.  In addition, some investment bankers assert that large commercial banks  engage in unlawful tying by offering reduced rates for corporate credit only  if the borrower also purchases debt underwriting services from the bank\u2019s  investment affiliate. If such a reduced rate were conditioned only on the  borrower\u2019s purchase of debt underwriting services from the commercial  bank\u2019s investment affiliate, the arrangement would constitute unlawful  tying. Should the reduced rate constitute an underpricing of credit (that is,  the extension of credit below market rates), the underpricing could also  violate section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 (section 23B).", "Section 23B generally requires that certain transactions between a bank  and its affiliates occur on market terms; that is, on terms and under  circumstances that are substantially the same, or at least as favorable to  the bank, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with  unaffiliated companies. Section 23B applies to any transaction by a bank  with a third party if an affiliate has a financial interest in the third party or if  an affiliate is a participant in the transaction. The banking regulators  suggest that the increase in debt underwriting market share by the  investment affiliates of large commercial banks can be explained by a  number of market and competitive factors not associated with tying, such  as industry consolidation and acquisition of investment banking firms by  bank holding companies. In addition, representatives from large  commercial banks with investment affiliates contend that they sell a range  of products and services to corporate customers, including credit, but do  not unlawfully tie bank credit or credit pricing to underwriting services.  Furthermore, officials from large commercial banks, federal banking and  securities regulators, and investment bankers observe that ties between  credit and other banking products are often customer-initiated, and thus  exempt from the laws governing tying.", "To more fully examine the issues raised by the allegations about unlawful  tying and underpricing of corporate credit, you asked us to determine (1)  what evidence, if any, suggests that commercial banks with investment  affiliates engage in unlawful tying; (2) what steps the federal banking  regulators have taken to examine for unlawful tying and the results of these  efforts; (3) what evidence, if any, suggests that commercial banks with  investment affiliates unlawfully discount the price of corporate credit to  obtain underwriting business for their investment affiliates; and (4) what, if  any, competitive advantages accounting rules, capital standards, and  access to the federal safety net create for commercial banks over  investment banks.", "In our review of possible unlawful tying practices by large commercial  banks, we focused on wholesale corporate lending and did not address  retail banking. We conducted a legal review of section 106 of the Bank  Holding Company Act Amendments of 1970, section 23B of the Federal  Reserve Act, and relevant federal regulations, and interviewed legal experts  and academics. To describe the recent concerns about possible unlawful  tying practices, we reviewed the results of a 2003 survey on corporate  borrowers\u2019 views about credit access conducted by the Association for  Financial Professionals and reviewed recent media coverage of tying. We  also interviewed several large corporate borrowers, and officials at several  investment banks and commercial banks with investment affiliates. We  also met with officials from NASD to discuss that organization\u2019s Special  Notice to its members and its ongoing investigation related to tying. NASD  is a self-regulatory organization that sets and enforces market conduct  rules governing its members, which are securities firms, including those  affiliated with commercial banks.", "To determine what steps the federal banking regulators have taken to  examine for unlawful tying, we reviewed the results of the Board of  Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve) and the Office  of Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) joint review on tying and  interviewed commercial bankers to describe the measures that large  commercial banks take to comply with the tying law. We also reviewed  federal guidance on sections 106 and 23B and Federal Reserve and OCC  examination procedures related to tying. In addition, we interviewed  officials from the Federal Reserve, OCC, and the Federal Deposit Insurance  Corporation (FDIC).", "To identify possible credit pricing abuses and factors that affect overall  prices in wholesale credit markets, we interviewed commercial bankers,  credit market experts, academics experts, industry observers, and officials  at the Federal Reserve and OCC.

We also solicited  feedback from FASB and AICPA officials on appendix I of our draft report  and incorporated their technical comments in this report as appropriate.

Federal Reserve and OCC examinations are intended  to assess the safety and soundness of large banks and identify conditions  that might require corrective action."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Section 106 of the Bank Holding Company Act Amendments of 1970", "paragraphs": ["Congress added section 106 to the Bank Holding Company Act in 1970 to  address concerns that an expansion in the range of activities permissible  for bank holding companies might give them an unfair competitive  advantage because of the unique role their bank subsidiaries served as  credit providers.Section 106 makes it unlawful, with certain exceptions,  for a bank to extend credit or furnish any product or service, or vary the  price of any product or service (the \u201ctying product\u201d) on the \u201ccondition or  requirement\u201d that the customer obtains some additional product or service  from the bank or its affiliate (the \u201ctied product\u201d). Under section 106, it  would be unlawful for a bank to provide credit (or to vary the terms for  credit) on the condition or requirement that the customer obtain some  other product from the bank or an affiliate, unless that other product was a  traditional bank product.Thus, it would be unlawful for a bank to  condition the availability or pricing of new or renewal credit on the  condition that the borrower purchase a nontraditional bank product from  the bank or an affiliate.", "In contrast, section 106 does not require a bank to extend credit or provide  any other product to a customer, as long as the bank\u2019s decision was not  based on the customer\u2019s failure to satisfy a condition or requirement  prohibited by section 106. For example, it would be lawful for a bank to  deny credit to a customer on the basis of the customer\u2019s financial  condition, financial resources, or credit history, but it would be unlawful  for a bank to deny credit because the customer failed to purchase  underwriting services from the bank\u2019s affiliate.", "Section 106 does not prohibit a bank from cross-marketing products that  are not covered by the \u201ctraditional banking product\u201d exemption or from  granting credit or providing any other product or service to a customer  based solely on the hope that the customer obtain additional products from  the bank or its affiliates in the future, provided that the bank does not  require the customer to purchase an additional product. Also, section 106  generally does not prohibit a bank from conditioning its relationship with a  customer on the total profitability of its relationship with the customer.", "Section 106 authorizes the Federal Reserve to make exceptions that are not  contrary to the purposes of the tying prohibitions. The Federal Reserve has  used this authority to allow banks to offer broader categories of packaging  arrangements, where it has determined that these arrangements benefit  customers and do not impair competition. In 1971, the Federal Reserve  adopted a regulation that extended antitying rules to bank holding  companies and their nonbank affiliates and approved a number of  nonbanking activities that these entities could engage in under the Bank  Holding Company Act. Citing the competitive vitality of the markets in  which nonbanking companies generally operate, in February 1997, the  Federal Reserve rescinded this regulatory extension. At the same time, the  Federal Reserve expanded the traditional bank products exception to  include traditional bank products offered by nonbank affiliates.", "In the mid-1990s, the Board also added two regulatory safe harbors. First,  the Board granted a regulatory safe harbor for combined-balance discount  packages, which allowed a bank to vary the consideration for a product or  package of products\u2014based on a customer\u2019s maintaining a combined  minimum balance in certain products\u2014as long as the bank offers deposits,  the deposits are counted toward the combined-balance, and the deposits  count at least as much as nondeposit products toward the minimum  balance. Furthermore, according to the Board, under the combined- balance safe harbor, the products included in the combined balance  program may be offered by either the bank or an affiliate, provided that the  bank specifies the products and the package is structured in a way that  does not, as a practical matter, obligate a customer to purchase  nontraditional bank products to obtain the discount. Second, the Board  granted a regulatory safe harbor for foreign transactions. This safe harbor  provides that the antitying prohibitions of section 106 do not apply to  transactions between a bank and a customer if the customer is a company  that is incorporated, chartered, or otherwise organized outside of the  United States, and has its principal place of business outside of the United  States, or if the customer is an individual who is a citizen of a country other  than the United States and is not resident in the United States."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Violations of Section 106", "paragraphs": ["On August 29, 2003, the Board published for public comment its proposed  interpretation and supervisory guidance concerning section 106. In this  proposed interpretation, the Federal Reserve noted that determining  whether a violation of section 106 occurred requires a detailed  understanding of the facts underlying the transaction in question. In this  proposed interpretation, the Federal Reserve also noted what it considers  to be the two key elements of a violation of section 106:  (1) The arrangement must involve two or more separate products: the  customer\u2019s desired product(s) and one or more separate tied products;  and  (2) The bank must force the customer to obtain (or provide) the tied  product(s) from (or to) the bank or an affiliate in order to obtain the  customer\u2018s desired product(s) from the bank.", "A transaction does not violate section 106 unless it involves two separate  products or services. For example, a bank does not violate section 106 by  requiring a prospective borrower to provide the bank specified collateral to  obtain a loan or by requiring an existing borrower to post additional  collateral as a condition for renewing a loan. Assuming two products or  services are involved, the legality of the arrangement depends on, among  other things, which products and services are involved and in what  combinations. It would be unlawful for a bank to condition the availability  of corporate credit on a borrower\u2019s purchase of debt underwriting services  from its affiliate, because a bank cannot condition the availability of a bank  product on a customer\u2019s purchase of a nontraditional product or service.  According to the Board\u2019s proposed interpretation, a bank can legally  condition the availability of a bank product, such as credit, on the  customer\u2019s selection from a mix of traditional and nontraditional products  or services\u2014a mixed-product arrangement\u2014only if the bank offered the  customer a \u201cmeaningful choice\u201d of products that includes one or more  traditional bank products and did not require the customer to purchase any  specific product or service. For example, according to the Federal Reserve,  a bank could legally condition the availability of credit on a customer\u2019s  purchase of products from a list of products and services that includes debt  underwriting and cash management services, provided that this mixed- product arrangement contained a meaningful option to satisfy the bank\u2019s  condition solely through the purchase of the traditional bank products  included in the arrangement.  However, it would be a violation of section  106 for a bank to condition the availability of credit on a mixed-product  arrangement that did not contain a meaningful option for the customer to  satisfy the bank\u2019s condition solely through the purchase of a traditional  bank product.", "When a bank offers a customer a low price on credit, it might or might not  be a violation of law. If a bank reduced the cost of credit on the condition  that the customer purchase nontraditional bank products or services  offered by its investment affiliate, this arrangement would violate section  106. However, if a bank offered a low price on credit to attract additional  business but did not condition the availability of the price on the purchase  of a prohibited product, it would not violate section 106. Additionally, if a  reduced interest rate were to constitute underpricing of a loan, such a  transaction, depending on the circumstances, could violate section 23B of  the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, which we discuss later in this section.", "Whether the arrangement constitutes an unlawful tie under section 106 also  depends upon whether a condition or requirement actually exists and  which party imposes the condition or requirement. Determining the  existence of either element can be difficult. The question of whether a  condition or requirement exists is particularly difficult because of  uncertainties about how to interpret that aspect of the prohibition.  According to the Board\u2019s proposal, section 106 applies if two requirements  are met: \u201c(1) a condition or requirement exists that ties the customer\u2019s  desired product to another product; and (2) this condition or requirement  was imposed or forced on the customer by the bank.\u201d Thus, according to  the Board\u2019s proposal, if a condition or requirement exists, further inquiry  may be necessary to determine whether the condition or requirement was  imposed or forced on the customer by the bank: \u201cIf the condition or  requirement resulted from coercion by the bank, then the condition or  requirement violates section 106, unless an exemption is available for the  transaction.\u201d This interpretation is not universally accepted, however. As  the Board\u2019s proposal has noted, some courts have held that a tying  arrangement violates section 106 without a showing that the arrangement  resulted from any type of coercion by the bank. Uncertainties about the  proper interpretation of the \u201ccondition or require\u201d provision of section 106  have lead to disagreement over the circumstances that violate section 106.", "It has been suggested that changes in financial markets that have occurred  since the enactment of section 106, particularly a decreased corporate  reliance on commercial bank loans, also are relevant in considering  whether banks currently can base credit decisions on a \u201ccondition or  requirement\u201d that corporate customers buy other services. At the end of  1970, according to the Federal Reserve\u2019s Flow of Funds data, bank loans  accounted for about 24 percent of the total liabilities of U.S. nonfarm,  nonfinancial corporations. At the end of 2002, bank loans accounted for  about 14 percent of these liabilities.", "Because section 106 applies only to commercial and savings banks,  investment banks and insurance companies, which compete in credit  markets with banks, are not subject to these tying restrictions. Thus,  under section 106, a bank\u2019s nonbank affiliate legally could condition the  availability of credit from that nonbank affiliate on a customer\u2019s purchase  of debt underwriting services. Where a transaction involves a bank as well  as one or more affiliates, uncertainties could exist over whether the  affiliate or the bank imposed a condition or requirement. It should be  noted, however, that all of these financial institutions are subject to the  more broadly applicable antitrust laws, such as the Sherman Act, that  prohibit anticompetitive practices, including tying arrangements. In  addition, under section 106 it is lawful for bank customers to initiate ties.  For example, a customer could use its business leverage to obtain  favorable credit terms or require a bank to extend a corporate loan as a  condition for purchasing debt underwriting services."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 Prohibits Transactions That Benefit Bank Affiliates at the Expense of the Bank", "paragraphs": ["Section 23B requires that transactions involving a bank and its affiliates,  including those providing investment-banking services, be on market  terms.

The activities judged by the regulatory agencies to pose the greatest risk to  a bank are to receive the most scrutiny by examiners under the risk-based  approach, and transaction testing is generally intended to validate the use  and effectiveness of risk-management systems. The effectiveness of this  examination approach, however, depends on the regulators\u2019 awareness of  risk. In the case of tying, the regulators are confronted with the disparity  between frequent allegations about tying practices and few, if any, formal  complaints. Further, the examiners generally would not contact customers  as part of the examinations and thus would have only limited access to  information about transactions or the practices that banks employ in  managing their relationships with customers.", "In response to the controversy about allegations of unlawful tying, in 2002  the Federal Reserve and OCC conducted joint reviews targeted to assessing  antitying policies and procedures at large commercial banks that,  collectively, are the dominant syndicators of large corporate credits. The  Federal Reserve and OCC exam teams found limited evidence of  potentially unlawful tying in the course of the special targeted review. For  example, one bank\u2019s legal department uncovered one instance where an  account officer proposed an unlawful conditional discount. The officer  brought this to the attention of the legal department after the officer  attended antitying training. The customer did not accept the offer, and no  transaction occurred.", "In addition, the teams noted that the commercial bank\u2019s interpretation of  section 106 permitted some activities that the teams questioned; one of the  banks reversed a transaction in response to examiner questions. Attorneys  on the exam teams reviewed documents regarding lawsuits alleging  unlawful tying, but they found that none of the suits contained allegations  that warranted any follow-up. For example, they found that some of the  suits involved customers who were asserting violations of section 106 as a  defense to the bank\u2019s efforts to collect on loans and that some of the ties  alleged in the suits involved ties to traditional bank products, which are  exempted from section 106.", "Federal Reserve and OCC officials noted that it would be unusual to find a  provision in a loan contract or other loan documentation containing an  unlawful tie. Some corporate borrowers said that there is no documentary  evidence because banks only communicate such conditions on loans orally.  According to members of the review team, they did not sample  transactions during the review because past reviews suggested that this  would probably not produce any instances of unlawful tying practices. The  targeted review did include contacting some bank customers to obtain  information on specific transactions. The Federal Reserve noted that  without examiners being present during credit negotiations, there is no  way for examiners to know what the customer was told. Given the complex  nature of these transactions, the facts and circumstances could vary  considerably among individual transactions. Federal Reserve officials,  however, noted that customer information could play an important role in  enforcing the law, because so much depends on whether the customer  voluntarily agreed with the transaction or was compelled to agree with the  conditions imposed by the bank. As the officials noted, this determination  cannot be made based solely on the loan documentation.", "During the targeted review, Federal Reserve and OCC officials found that  all of the banks they reviewed generally had adequate procedures in place  to comply with section 106. All banks had specific antitying policies,  procedures, and training programs in place. The policies we reviewed from  two banks encouraged employees to consult legal staff for assistance with  arrangements that could raise a tying-related issue. According to the  Federal Reserve and OCC, at other banks, lawyers reviewed all  transactions for tying-related issues before they were completed. The  training materials we reviewed from two banks included examples that  distinguished lawful from unlawful tying arrangements. Banking regulators  noted that some banking organizations had newly enhanced policies,  procedures, and training programs as a result of recent media and  regulatory attention.", "However, examiners also found that the oversight by internal audit  functions at several banks needed improvement. In one case, they found  that bank internal auditors were trained to look for the obvious indications  of tying, but that banks\u2019 audit procedures would not necessarily provide a  basis to detect all cases of tying. For example, recent antitying training  programs at two banks helped employees identify possible tying violations.  Officials at one large banking organization also said that banks\u2019 compliance  efforts generally are constrained by the inability to anticipate every  situation that could raise tying concerns. They also noted that banks could  not monitor every conversation that bank employees had with customers,  and thus guarantee that mistakes would never occur.", "In addition, examiners were concerned that certain arrangements might  cause customer confusion when dealing with employees who work for  both the bank and its investment affiliate. In those cases, it could be  difficult to determine whether the \u201cdual\u201d employee was representing the  bank or its affiliate for specific parts of a transaction. However, the  examiners noted that in the legal analysis of one banking organization, the  use of such dual employees was not necessarily problematic, given that the  tie was created by the investment affiliate, rather than the bank, and that  section 106 addresses the legal entity involved in a transaction and not the  employment status of the individuals involved. Proposed Federal Reserve  guidance did not add clarification to this matter beyond emphasizing the  importance of training programs for bank employees as an important  internal control. \u201cthe determination of whether a violation of section 106 has occurred often requires a  careful review of the specific facts and circumstances associated with the relevant  transaction (or proposed transaction) between the bank and the customer.\u201d", "Customers could provide information on the facts and circumstances  associated with specific transactions and provide a basis for testing  whether the bank actions were in compliance with its policies and  procedures. If the banks\u2019 actions are not consistent with their policies and  procedures, there could be violations of section 106. A review of the  transactions would provide direct evidence of compliance or  noncompliance with section 106. Further, information from analysis of  transactions and information obtained from customers could provide the  bank regulatory agencies with more information on the circumstances  where there could be a greater risk of tying, contributing to their risk-based  examination strategies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Reserve and OCC Identified Several Interpretive Issues", "paragraphs": ["The examiners and attorneys participating in the targeted review found  variations in banks\u2019 interpretation of section 106 in areas where  authoritative guidance was absent or incomplete at the time of the review.", "One interpretative issue was the extent to which a bank could consider the  profitability of the overall customer relationship in making credit  decisions, particularly whether a bank could consider a customer\u2019s use of  nontraditional banking services in deciding to terminate the customer  relationship without violating section 106. This issue also encompassed the  appropriateness of the language that a bank might use when entering into  or discontinuing credit relationships\u2014including whether a bank could  appropriately use language implying the acceptance of a tied product in a  letter formalizing a commitment for a loan and communication protocols  that a bank might use to disengage clients who did not meet internal  profitability targets.", "Examiners found that all banks in the joint targeted review had undergone  a \u201cbalance sheet reduction,\u201d disengaging from lending relationships with  their least desirable customers. An official at one commercial bank  acknowledged that, when banks discontinue relationships, their decision  might appear to be unlawful tying from the perspective of the customer.  However, it would not be unlawful for a bank to decline to provide credit to  a customer as long as the bank\u2019s decision was not based on the customer\u2019s  failure to satisfy a condition or requirement prohibited by section 106.", "Examiners questioned whether it would be appropriate for a banking  organization to provide both a bridge loan and securities underwriting to  vary the amount of fees it charged for services that would normally be done  independently for each service. For example, a bank conducting a credit  analysis for both commercial and investment banking services and  reducing the overall fees to only include one credit analysis might raise  tying considerations. Banks and their outside counsels believed that this  price reduction would be appropriate. However, the Federal Reserve staff  said that whether or not a price reduction would be appropriate would  depend on the facts and condition of the transaction, including whether or  not the bank offered the customer the opportunity to obtain the discount  from the bank separately from the tied product.", "Examiners were also concerned that some bank transactions might appear  to circumvent section 106. For example, the examiners found one instance  in which a nonbank affiliate had tied bridge loans to the purchase of  securities underwriting and syndicated some or all of the loans to its  commercial bank. The examiners noted that although this issue had not  been addressed in the guidance available at the time, this arrangement  created the appearance of an attempt to circumvent the application of  section 106. The bank thereupon discontinued the practice. As mentioned  previously, because section 106 applies only to banks, it is not a violation of  the section for most nonbank affiliates of commercial banks to tie together  any two products or services. The proposed interpretation of section 106  recently issued by the Federal Reserve addresses this issue.", "Finally, the examiners found that one bank might be overstating the relief  gained from the foreign transactions safe harbor. The Federal Reserve  adopted a safe harbor from the antitying rules for transactions with  corporate customers that are incorporated or otherwise organized and that  have their principal place of business outside the United States. This safe  harbor also applies to individuals who are citizens of a foreign country and  are not resident in the United States. The new guidance developed by the  banking regulators does not address the examiners\u2019 specific concerns.

The proposed  guidance outlines, among other things, some of the information that would  be considered in determining whether a transaction or proposed  transaction would be lawful or unlawful under section 106.

Specifically, they pointed to several transactions, including one in  which they questioned the pricing but participated because the borrower  insisted that underwriters provide loan commitments. The investment bank  officials said that when they subsequently attempted to sell part of their  share of the credits, the pricing was unattractive to the market and that  they could not get full value.

Officials from the Federal Reserve noted  that the triggering mechanisms for the two products differed. Although the  trigger for the exercise of a credit default swap is a clearly defined  indication of the borrower\u2019s credit impairment, the exercise of a  commercial paper back-up line is triggered by the issuer\u2019s inability to  access the commercial paper market\u2014an event that could occur without  there necessarily being any credit impairment of the issuer.

In addition, loan market  experts and officials from a commercial bank also said that the loan market  and the credit default swap market involve different participants with  different motivations. Loan market experts noted that lead originators of  loans and loan commitments have an advantage gained from knowledge of  the borrower through direct business relationships.

Whether a commercial  bank using the historic carrying value model or an investment bank using  the fair-value model would recognize more revenue or loss on a given loan  commitment earlier or later would depend on changes in the borrower\u2019s  credit pricing, which reflects overall market trends and customer-specific  events, as well as on the accounting model that the firm follows.", "In addition, when similar loan commitments held by a commercial bank  and an investment bank are exercised and become loans, both firms would  be subject to the same accounting standards if they had the intent and  ability to hold the loan for the foreseeable future or to maturity.

The primary purposes  of commercial bank regulatory capital requirements are to maintain the  safety and soundness of the banking and payment systems and to protect  the deposit insurance funds. Under the bank risk-based capital guidelines,  off-balance sheet transactions, such as loan commitments, are converted  into one of four categories of asset equivalents. Unfunded loan  commitments of one year or less are assigned to the zero percent  conversion category, which means that banks are not required to hold  regulatory capital for these commitments. In contrast, the primary  purposes of broker-dealers\u2019 capital requirements are to protect customers  and other market participants from losses caused by broker-dealer failures  and to protect the integrity of the financial markets. The SEC net capital  rule requires broker-dealer affiliates of investment banks to hold 100- percent capital against loan commitments of any length. However,  nonbroker-dealer affiliates of investment banks are not subject to any  regulatory capital requirements, and are therefore not required to hold  regulatory capital against loan commitments of any length.", "It is costly for banks or other institutions to hold capital; thus, to the extent  that the level of regulatory capital requirements determines the amount of  capital actually held, lower capital requirements can translate into lower  costs.

They said that because banks\u2019 regulatory capital  requirements for unfunded credits of 1 year or less were zero, commercial  banks had the opportunity to adjust the length of credit commitments to  avoid capital charges. Furthermore, officials said that the ability to avoid  capital charges allowed commercial banks to underprice these loan  commitments, because they could extend the commitments without the  cost of assigning additional regulatory capital. They pointed to the high  percentage of credit commercial banks structured in 364-day facilities as  evidence that banks structure underpriced credit in short-term  arrangements to avoid capital charges.", "We found no evidence that bank regulatory capital requirements provided  commercial banks with a competitive advantage. Although investment  banks could face a 100-percent regulatory capital charge if they carried  loan commitments in their broker-dealer affiliates, investment bank  officials and officials from the SEC said that, in practice, investment banks  carried loan commitments outside of their broker-dealer affiliates, and thus  avoided all regulatory capital charges. Furthermore, banking regulators did  not think that the current regulatory capital requirements adversely  affected the overall amount of capital banks held, because commercial  banks generally carried internal risk-based capital on instruments\u2014  including loan commitments\u2014that were in excess of the amount of  regulatory capital required. In addition, the banking regulators said that  bank regulatory capital requirements had not affected banks\u2019 use of loan  commitments of 1 year or less.

Regulatory guidance has noted  that some tying arrangements involving corporate credit are clearly lawful,  particularly those involving ties between credit and traditional bank  products. The targeted review conducted by the Federal Reserve and OCC,  however, identified other arrangements that raise interpretive issues that  were not addressed in prevailing guidance. The Federal Reserve recently  issued for public comment a proposed interpretation of section 106 that is  intended to provide banks and their customers a guide to the section. As  the proposed interpretation notes, however, the complexity of section 106  requires a careful review of the facts and circumstances of each specific  transaction. The challenge for the Federal Reserve and OCC remains that  of enforcing a law where determining whether a violation exists or not  depends on considering the precise circumstances of specific transactions;  however, information on such circumstances is inherently limited.  Customers have a key role in providing information that is needed to  enforce section 106. However, the Federal Reserve and OCC have little  information on customers\u2019 understanding of lawful and unlawful tying  under section 106 or on customers\u2019 knowledge of the circumstances of  specific transactions.", "The available evidence did not clearly support contentions that banks  violated section 106 and unlawfully tied credit availability or underpriced  credit to gain investment banking revenues. Corporate borrowers generally  have not filed complaints with the banking regulators and attribute the lack  of complaints, in part, to a lack of documentary evidence and uncertainty  about which tying arrangements section 106 prohibits. The Federal Reserve  and OCC report that they found only limited evidence of even potentially  unlawful tying practices involving corporate credit during a targeted review  that began in 2002, and they found that the banks surveyed generally had  adequate policies and procedures in place to deter violations of section  106. However, while the teams conducting this review analyzed some  specific transactions, they did not test a broad range of transactions, or  outreach widely to bank customers. Information from customers could be  an important step in assessing both implementation of and compliance  with a bank\u2019s policies and procedures. While regulators could take further  steps to encourage customers to provide information, in addition to the  recent Federal Reserve proposal, bank customers themselves are crucial to  enforcement of section 106."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["Distinguishing lawful and unlawful tying depends on the specific facts and  circumstances of individual transactions.

We  therefore recommend that the Federal Reserve and the OCC consider  taking additional steps to ensure effective enforcement of section 106 and  section 23B, by enhancing the information that they receive from corporate  borrowers. For example, the agencies could develop a communication  strategy targeted at a broad audience of corporate bank customers to help  ensure that they understand which activities are permitted under section  106 as well as those that are prohibited. This strategy could include  publication of specific contact points within the agencies to answer  questions from banks and bank customers about the guidance in general  and its application to specific transactions, as well as to accept complaints  from bank customers who believe that they have been subjected to  unlawful tying. Because low priced credit could indicate a potential  violation of section 23B, we also recommend that the Federal Reserve  assess available evidence regarding loan pricing behavior, and if  appropriate, conduct additional research to better enable examiners to  determine whether transactions are conducted on market terms and that  the Federal Reserve publish the results of this assessment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We requested comments on a draft of this report from the Federal Reserve  and OCC.

This appendix does not assess the differences in  accounting that would occur if a loan was made by both a commercial bank  and an investment bank when one entity decided to hold the loan to  maturity and the other opted to hold the loan as available for sale, because  the basis for these actions and the resulting accounting treatment are not  similar.", "The examples in this appendix demonstrate that, as of a given financial  statement reporting date, differences would likely exist between  commercial and investment banks in the reported value of a loan  commitment and a loan resulting from an exercised commitment, as well  as the recognition of the related deferred revenue. In addition, the volatility  of the fair value of loan commitments and the related loan, if the  commitment were exercised, would be reflected more transparently in an  investment bank\u2019s financial statements, because an investment bank must  recognize these changes in value in earnings as they occur in net income.In contrast, commercial banks are not allowed to recognize changes in the  fair value of the loan commitment, its related deferred revenue, or the  related loan (if drawn). The differences in accounting between commercial  banks and investment banks are temporary; and, as the examples in the  following sections show, whether a commercial bank or an investment  bank recognizes more fee revenue first would depend on various market  conditions, including interest rates and spreads. Similarly, any differences  between the fair value of a loan or loan commitment on an investment  bank\u2019s book and the net book value of a similar loan or loan commitment  on a commercial bank\u2019s books would be eliminated by the end of the loan  term or commitment period.Given that loan commitment terms are  usually for less than 1 year, any accounting differences between the  commercial and investment banks would be for a relatively short period of  time.

In accounting for loan commitments, banks follow the guidance in  Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) Number 91  Accounting for Nonrefundable Fees and Costs Associated with  Originating or Acquiring Loans and Initial Direct Costs of Leases.Broker-dealer affiliates and investment banks whose primary business is to  act as a broker-dealer follow the AICPA\u2019s Audit and Accounting Guide,  Brokers and Dealers in Securities, where the inventory (that may include  loan commitments) are recorded at the current fair value and the change in  value from the prior period is recognized in net income. Further, FASB  currently has a project on revenue recognition that includes the accounting  for loan commitment fees by investment banks and others. The purpose of  that project includes addressing the inconsistent recognition of  commitment fee income and may eliminate some of the accounting  differences that exist between commercial banks and investment banks  described in this appendix.", "FASB has stated that it is committed to work diligently toward resolving, in  a timely manner, the conceptual and practical issues related to determining  the fair values of financial instruments and portfolios of financial  instruments. Further, FASB has stated that while measurement at fair value  has conceptual advantages, all implementation issues have not yet been  resolved; and the Board has not yet decided when, if ever, it will be feasible  to require essentially all financial instruments to be reported at fair value in  the basic financial statements. Although FASB has not yet issued  comprehensive guidance on fair-value accounting, recent literature has  stated that the fair-value accounting model provides more relevant  information about financial assets and liabilities and can keep up with  today\u2019s complex financial instruments better than the historical cost  accounting model. The effect of the fair-value accounting model is to  recognize in net income during the current accounting period amounts  that, under the historical cost model, would have been referred to as  unrealized gains or losses because the bank did not sell or otherwise  dispose of the financial instrument. Further, proponents of the fair-value  accounting model contend that unrealized gains and losses on financial  instruments are actually lost opportunities as of a specific date to realize a  gain or loss by selling or settling a financial instrument at a current price.  However, a disadvantage of fair-value accounting exists when there is not  an active market for the financial instrument being valued.
