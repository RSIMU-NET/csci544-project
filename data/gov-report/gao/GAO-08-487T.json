With respect to aviation security, TSA has focused its efforts on, among other things, more efficiently allocating, deploying, and managing the Transportation Security Officer (TSO) workforce--formerly known as screeners; strengthening screening procedures; developing and deploying more effective and efficient screening technologies; strengthening domestic air cargo security; and developing a government operated watch-list matching program, known as Secure Flight. For example, in response to GAO's recommendation, TSA developed a plan to periodically review assumptions in its Staffing Allocation Model, and took steps to strengthen its evaluation of proposed procedural changes. TSA has also explored new passenger checkpoint screening technologies to better detect explosives and other threats, and has taken steps to strengthen air cargo security, including conducting compliance inspections of air carriers. Finally, TSA has instilled more discipline and rigor into Secure Flight's systems development, including preparing key documentation and strengthening privacy protections. With regard to surface transportation security, TSA has, among other things, taken steps to develop a strategic approach for securing mass transit, passenger and freight rail, commercial vehicles, and highways; established security standards for certain transportation modes; and conducted threat, criticality, and vulnerability assessments of surface transportation assets, particularly related to passenger and freight rail. While these efforts should be commended, GAO has identified several areas that should be addressed to further strengthen transportation security. For example, TSA has made limited progress in developing and deploying checkpoint technologies due to planning and management challenges. In addition, TSA has not revised screening exemptions for air cargo transported into the United States that may leave the air cargo system unacceptably vulnerable. GAO further identified that TSA experienced some program management challenges in the development of Secure Flight, including developing cost and schedule estimates consistent with best practices; fully implementing the program's risk management plan; developing a comprehensive testing strategy; and ensuring that information security requirements are fully implemented. In addition, DHS and TSA lack performance measures to fully evaluate the effectiveness of current processes for passengers who apply for redress due to inconveniences experienced during the check-in and screening process. GAO recently made recommendations to address these issues. Additionally, although TSA has recently taken actions in a number of areas to help secure surface modes of transportation, particularly passenger and freight rail, the agency has not fully defined its role with respect to securing other transportation modes, such as commercial vehicles and highway infrastructure. We are continuing to assess TSA's efforts to secure surface modes of transportation as part of our ongoing work and will report on our results later this year."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I appreciate the opportunity to participate in today\u2019s hearing to discuss the  security of our nation\u2019s transportation system.

Since  that time, TSA has developed a Staffing Allocation Model to determine  TSO staffing levels at airports.  In August 2005, TSA determined that the  Staffing Allocation Model contained complete and accurate information on  each airport from which to estimate staffing needs, and the agency used  the model to identify TSO allocations for each airport.", "FSDs we interviewed during 2006 as part of our review of TSA\u2019s staffing  model generally reported that the model is a more accurate predictor of  staffing needs than TSA\u2019s prior staffing model. However, FSDs expressed  the following concerns about assumptions used in the fiscal year 2006  model:  the model assumed that airports could achieve a 20 percent part-time  TSO level, even though it was difficult for airports to achieve this;  the model did not specifically account for the recurrent training  requirement for TSOs of 3 hours per week averaged over a fiscal year  quarter; and the model did not account for TSO\u2019s time away from screening to  perform operational support duties.", "To help ensure that TSOs are effectively utilized, we recommended that  TSA establish a policy for when TSOs can be used to provide operational  support. Consistent with our recommendation, in March 2007, TSA issued  a management directive that provides guidance on assigning TSOs,  through detail or permanent promotion, to duties of another position for a  specified period of time. Further, in response to FSDs\u2019 input and the  various mechanisms TSA had implemented to monitor the sufficiency of  the model\u2019s allocation outputs, TSA made changes to some assumptions in  the Staffing Allocation Model for fiscal year 2007, including assumptions  related to part-time TSOs, training, and operational support to address the  issues identified above. In our February 2007 report, we recommended  that TSA establish a formal, documented plan for reviewing all of the  model assumptions on a periodic basis to ensure that the assumptions  result in TSO staffing allocations that accurately reflect operating  conditions that may change over time.

We reported that TSA has not fully followed  best practices for developing a reliable and valid life-cycle cost estimate.  Using our Cost Assessment Guide\u2019s 12-step process for creating cost  estimates, we assessed the Secure Flight cost estimate against these best  practices. DHS\u2019s Cost - Benefit Analysis Guidebook, which TSA program  officials stated that TSA used to develop the life-cycle cost estimate for  Secure Flight, contains most of the best practices outlined in our Guide.  TSA followed some of these practices in developing its cost estimate,  including defining the purpose of the program and estimate purpose;  identifying many program cost elements, including expenditures for  facilities, hardware, and software; and identifying the numbers of staff,  their pay, and associated travel and training costs, among other elements.  However, it is unclear whether TSA followed other best practices or did  not address the practices in developing its estimate. For example, it is  unclear whether the cost estimate had been updated to reflect the current  program because the detailed support for the estimate was produced  between 2004 and 2006, and does not reflect the current program plan. In  addition, the cost estimate does not capture all key costs. For example, the  estimate does not capture costs beyond 2012 even though the system is  expected to be operational beyond that date.

We reported in March 2005 on the importance  of Secure Flight end-to-end testing and recommended that TSA perform  such testing. TSA agreed with this recommendation. However, Secure  Flight\u2019s current test and evaluation master plan only outlines plans for  partner organizational entities (e.g., CBP for integration of international  watch-list functions) to test their respective parts of the system on their  own\u2014rather than a coordinated end-to-end test involving all parties. TSA  developed a preliminary working draft of an end-to-end testing strategy,  called the parallel testing strategy.

Federal standards and guidance identify the need to  address information security throughout the life-cycle of information  systems, and specifies a minimum set of security steps needed to  effectively incorporate security into a system during its development. The  Secure Flight program has performed several steps that incorporate  security into the system\u2019s development, including performing a security  risk assessment, identifying and documenting recommended security  control requirements, and testing and evaluating security controls for the  system and incorporating identified weaknesses in remedial action plans.  However, other steps pertaining to ensuring that security requirements are  tested, preparing security documentation, and conducting certification and  accreditation activities were not adequately completed. For example,  security requirements planned for Release One did not always trace to test  activities for this release. Program officials stated that some security  requirements were deferred until future releases due to delays in funding  for acquiring specific hardware and other requirements require  coordination with the information system security official to verify  whether they were tested as part of security test and evaluation. In  addition, security documentation contained incorrect or incomplete  information. To illustrate, the systems security plan did not identify all  interconnecting systems that Secure Flight will interface with, such as  those operated by the DHS Watch-List Service, the organization that will  transmit the watch-list to Secure Flight. Program officials stated that  security documentation was outdated or incorrect because there was  insufficient time to update the documentation for changes in the  computing environment and security requirements.", "Furthermore, program officials granted an authorization to operate\u2014one  of three possible accreditation decisions made in the certification and  accreditation process\u2014although the system had 46 known vulnerabilities,  including 11 high-risk and 27 moderate-risk vulnerabilities and the controls  had not yet been implemented. Federal guidance as well as DHS policy  provide for an interim authority to operate accreditation when significant  restrictions or limitations exist and certain deficiencies and corrective  actions need to be addressed within a specified period. Although security  officials identified plans of actions and milestones for addressing the  vulnerabilities within 60 and 90 days for the high and moderate risks,  respectively, given their significance, an interim authorization to operate  would be the more appropriate determination. In addition, hardware  components used to implement controls over user identity and account  management (i.e., authentication, logins and passwords, and user roles  and privileges), as well as the alternate processing site had not yet been  implemented. Once implemented, the security controls over these  components could have an impact on the information security and,  therefore, may require a re-accreditation. Program officials chose the  authority to operate accreditation because they asserted that the DHS  Chief Information Security Officer does not allow interim authorizations. If  these security activities are not completed, there is an increased risk that  key security controls and requirements may not be fully developed, tested,  implemented or documented.

We will continue assessing  surface transportation related grant programs as part of our ongoing  work."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["DHS and TSA have undertaken numerous initiatives to strengthen the  security of the nation\u2019s transportation system, and should be commended  for these efforts. Regarding commercial aviation, TSA has developed  processes to more efficiently allocate and deploy the TSO workforce,  strengthened screening procedures, is working to develop and deploy  more effective screening technologies, strengthened the security of air  cargo, and improved the development of a program to prescreen  passengers against terrorist watch-lists. Further, TSA has more recently  taken actions in a number of areas to help secure surface modes of  transportation. More work, however, remains. For example, TSA\u2019s surface  transportation security efforts are still largely in the early stage, and the  nature of its regulatory role, and relationship with transportation  operators, is still being defined. Opportunities therefore exist to further  strengthen these efforts, in particular in the areas of risk management and  program planning and monitoring. Our work has shown\u2014in homeland  security and in other areas\u2014that a comprehensive risk management  approach can help inform decision makers in the allocation of finite  resources to the areas of greatest need. We are encouraged that risk  management has been a cornerstone of DHS and TSA policy, and that TSA  has implemented risk-based decision making into a number of its efforts.  Despite this commitment, however, TSA will continue to face difficult  decisions and trade-offs\u2014particularly as threats to transportation systems  evolve\u2014regarding acceptable levels of risk and the need to balance  security and its investments among all transportation modes. We recognize  that doing so will not be easy.", "Mr. Chairman this concludes my statement.
