This legislation is scheduled for reauthorization in 2003.", "This report focuses on two components of the legislation: one that provides grants and another, called the \u201caccountability provisions,\u201d that requires collecting and reporting information on the quality of teacher training programs and qualifications of current teachers. The grants are given on a competitive basis to states or partnerships between higher education institutions and local school districts to fund activities that recruit and prepare new teachers, and develop and retain current teachers.

The accountability provisions require all institutions that enroll students who receive federal student financial assistance and train teachers to provide information to their states on their teacher training programs and program graduates. States are required to consolidate some of this information into a report, supplement it with additional statewide education data, and submit it to Education. Using this information, Education is required to report annually to the Congress on the nationwide quality of teacher training programs and the qualifications of current teachers.", "To prepare for the reauthorization of this legislation, the Congress wants to know whether the grants and reporting requirements are contributing to improving the quality of teaching in the classroom.

Grantees in these states were selected because they represented almost half of the total grant funding at the time of our site visits, were providing a range of grant activities, and were geographically dispersed. We also interviewed Education officials and experts on teaching and teacher training. In addition, we reviewed relevant literature, regulations, and department documents.

The legislation requires that states may receive a state grant only once and that the grants must be competitively awarded. Three types of grants were made available: (1) State grants are available for states to implement activities to improve teacher quality in their states. (2) Partnership grants are available to eligible partners to improve teacher quality through collaborative activities. Eligible partnerships must include at least three partners\u2014teacher training programs, colleges of Arts and Sciences, and eligible local school districts. Partnerships may also include other groups, such as state educational agencies, businesses and nonprofit educational organizations as partners (see fig. 1). (3) Recruitment grants are available to states or partnerships to use their funding for activities to help recruit teachers.", "Recruitment (states and partnerships)", "The legislation requires monitoring and evaluation of activities supported by these grants. Each grantee is required to submit an annual report to Education on its progress toward meeting program goals specified in the legislation, which must include performance objectives and measures to determine if grant activities were successful. The legislation also required Education to evaluate all grant activities and to broadly disseminate information about successful and unsuccessful practices.", "In addition to the grants, the 1998 HEA amendments include an annual reporting requirement on the quality of teacher training programs and the qualifications of current teachers. This component of the legislation, called the \u201caccountability provisions,\u201d requires an annual three-stage process to collect and report information in a uniform and comprehensible manner. The reporting requirements under the accountability provisions mandated, for the first time, that colleges and universities who train teachers be held accountable for how well they prepared teachers. The legislation requires that Education, in consultation with states and teacher training institutions, develop definitions for key terms\u2014including definitions for the consistent reporting of pass rates\u2014and uniform reporting methods related to the performance of teacher training programs. Education officials told us that they made significant efforts to define key terms so that the terms reflected the uniqueness of teacher training programs, state reporting procedures, and data availability.", "In the first stage, nearly every institution that prepares teachers\u2014not just those receiving teacher quality enhancement grants\u2014is required to collect and report specific information to its state, including the pass rate of the institution\u2019s graduates on state teacher certification examinations. Then in the second stage, states are required to report to Education the pass rate information institutions reported in the first stage, supplemented with additional statewide information, including a description of state certification examinations and the extent to which teachers in the state are allowed to teach without being fully certified. The third and final stage is comprised of a report to the Congress from the Secretary of Education on the quality of teacher training programs and the qualifications of current teachers. The first round of institutional reports were submitted to states in April 2001; subsequently, state reports were submitted to Education in October 2001. Using this information, the Secretary of Education reported to the Congress in June 2002.", "How one determines the quality of teacher training programs and the qualifications of current teachers has long been debated. The debate is currently centered on the best way to train teachers: the traditional approach, which typically includes extensive courses in subject matter and pedagogy, or alternative training methods that either (1) accelerate the process of training teachers by reducing courses in pedagogy or (2) allow uncertified teachers to teach while receiving their training at night or on weekends. This debate is further complicated because the quality of teacher training programs and the qualifications for current teachers varies by state. Every state sets its own requirements for teacher certification, such as which certification examination(s) a teacher candidate must take, what score is considered passing on this examination, and how many hours teacher candidates must spend student teaching\u2014practice teaching during their teacher preparation program\u2014in order to become a fully certified teacher in that state. In this way, a teacher who is fully certified in one state may not meet the qualifications for certification in another state. For example, in Virginia, Minnesota and Mississippi, teacher candidates are required to take the same test to be certified to teach high school mathematics. But teacher candidates in Virginia must score 178 (50th percentile of all test takers) to pass the examination, whereas in Minnesota and Mississippi teacher candidates must score 169 (20th percentile of all test takers).", "While the 1998 HEA amendments provided grants and reporting requirements to improve the quality of teacher training programs and the qualifications of teachers, it was not until the recent No Child Left Behind Act that the Congress defined a highly qualified teacher. For the purposes of that act, the legislation defines highly qualified teachers as those who demonstrate competence in each subject they teach, hold bachelors degrees, and are fully certified to teach in their state.

However, it left the implementation of the grant program to Education. The department established the Teacher Quality Enhancement Grant Office to determine the procedures by which the grants were to be awarded and administered.

When the office was first established, it conducted focus groups with representatives from different areas\u2014states, local school districts, institutions that train teachers, and community groups\u2014to decide how to implement the legislation. Education officials used this input to develop applications for the state, partnership, and recruitment grants. Education officials advertised the grants and provided opportunities for potential applicants to receive technical assistance on the application procedures. These technical assistance sessions, which grantees told us were helpful, were offered across the country and allowed Education officials to answer questions and explain the criteria by which applications would be judged.", "In accordance with the legislation, the office provided funding to state agencies and partnerships between higher education institutions and local school districts with three types of grants\u2014state, partnership, and recruitment\u2014through a competitive process. The legislation required Education to use peer reviewers to determine which applicants would receive grant funding. The office convened panels of peer reviewers to judge the applications. Each peer review panel consisted of representatives from local school districts, states, community groups, teacher training programs, and colleges of Arts and Sciences. In 1999, the first year grants were available, the peer review panel reviewed 371 applications: 41 for state grants, 222 for partnership grants, and 108 for recruitment grants. Of these applications, the office awarded 24 state grants, 25 partnership grants, and 28 recruitment grants (see fig. 3). Since then an additional 21 state, 8 partnership, and 17 recruitment grants have been awarded or approved using the same process. Between 1999 and 2002, the office awarded or approved a total of 123 grants.", "Grant duration and funding amount vary depending on the type of grant.

Partnership grant awards ranged from $1.2 million awarded to Graceland University in Iowa to over $13.2 million awarded to Arizona State University. Recruitment grants ranged from $523,890 awarded to Norfolk State University to $1.4 million awarded to the San Diego University Foundation (see fig. 4). When we divided total grant awards by the duration of the grants, the average annual award for state grants ($1.6 million) was larger than the average annual award for partnership grants ($1.2 million), and the average annual award for recruitment grants ($340,054) was the smallest.", "Forty-five of 59 eligible states have already been approved for or awarded state grants, and because the legislation specifically requires that these grants can only be awarded once, only 14 states will be eligible to receive future state grants under the current authorizing legislation (see fig. 5).

Communication from Education to the grantees, specifically the frequency and accuracy of Education\u2019s efforts, was problematic. Education officials and grantees reported that in the beginning of the grant program, staff assigned to assist grantees communicated with them regularly, informing them of reporting deadlines and answering specific questions related to the grant program. However, the office experienced several disruptions in staff and management, and grantees told us that this level of communication with Education was not maintained. Since the grant program began 4 years ago, the Teacher Quality Enhancement Grant Office has had five different managers, and staff in the office has fallen from nine to two. Several officials at Education told us that the constant changes in the office led to a lack of program continuity, which affected the communication with grantees. Almost 75 percent of the grantees reported that the management and staff turnover at Education had been a problem.", "In addition, grantees reported that some information received from Education was inaccurate, which led to additional work for the grantees when they were eventually informed of the right information. For example, grantees needed to be informed of what information to include in their required annual report and when to submit it to Education. Many grantees we visited told us that because Education failed to maintain an effective system of communicating this information, they were given incorrect information on what data to include in their annual reports, making it necessary for the grantee to collect and analyze data twice.", "Further, the legislation requires Education to broadly disseminate information about successful and unsuccessful practices, but we found that Education did not adequately carry out this requirement. Grantees told us that having access to information about successful and unsuccessful practices would save them time and money in administering their grants. Although a national conference of grantees has been held each year since the grants began and some grantees have been able to participate in a few multigrantee telephone conference calls, grantees reported that these efforts did not adequately allow them to share ideas on successful and unsuccessful practices. For example, some grantees told us that requiring teacher candidates to attend classes on the weekends was an unsuccessful strategy, because few candidates could attend at that time. However, because Education did not broadly disseminate this information, several grantees told us that they wasted time and money learning this on their own by offering Saturday courses only to have them sparsely attended."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Grantees Used Funds for a Range of Activities, but Their Effectiveness Will Be Difficult to Determine", "paragraphs": ["Grantees are using the flexibility the grant program allows to support activities they believe will improve teaching in their locality or state, but no system is in place to determine if these activities will affect the quality of teaching in the classroom.

Grantees could focus on only one activity, but all grantees responding to our survey focused on a combination of activities. In our survey, we found that 85 percent of the respondents were using their grant funds to reform the requirements for teachers, 85 percent of the respondents were using their grant funds for professional development and support for current teachers, and 72 percent of the respondents were using their grant funds for recruitment efforts. Table 1 shows the activities grantees we visited told us they provided.", "Most grantees reported using their funds to reform requirements for teachers. Since every state sets its own requirements for teacher certification, such as how many hours a teacher candidate must spend student teaching to become a fully certified teacher in that state, some state grantees reported using their funds to reform the certification requirements for teachers in their state. Grantees also reported using their funds to allow teacher training programs and colleges of Arts and Sciences to collaborate with local school districts to reform the requirements for teacher training programs to ensure that teacher candidates are trained appropriately. Some examples of these reforms include the following:   Requirements for teacher certification\u2014During our site visits, we found that many state grantees are reforming their state certification requirements to ensure that new teachers have the necessary teaching skills and knowledge in the subject areas in which they will teach. For example, Illinois does not currently have a separate middle school (grades 5 through 9) certification. Most middle school teachers in Illinois are instead certified to teach elementary or high school. However, recognizing that this does not adequately address the preparation needs of middle school teachers, state officials intend to use the grant to create a new certification for middle school teachers. This new certification would require middle school teachers to demonstrate specialized knowledge on how to best instruct adolescents.", "Requirements for teacher training programs\u2014To improve the quality of teachers, states reported reforming their requirements for teacher training programs. For example, Wisconsin used some of its grant funds to develop a strategy to hold institutions accountable for the quality of the preparation they provide their teacher candidates. This strategy ensured that teacher candidates in every teacher training program receive instruction that prepares them to meet state standards. To begin this effort, the state developed a handbook of standards, procedures, and policies for teacher training programs. In addition, the state plans to enforce these requirements by conducting a thorough review of each teacher training program. Wisconsin and other states we visited are also ensuring that training provided through alternative routes\u2014routes to certification that are not provided by regular teacher training programs\u2014are meeting similar requirements.", "Requirements for teacher candidates\u2014Many teacher training programs reported that they were reforming the requirements for teacher candidates by revising the required coursework. For example, the grant officials from the Massachusetts Coalition for Teacher Quality and Student Achievement reported that they wanted to provide teacher candidates with exposure to schools earlier than was typical in training programs. To do so, they revised their curriculum so that some of their required teacher preparation courses were set in public schools, giving teacher candidates an opportunity to experience the school environment prior to student teaching. Grant officials expressed that this strategy would increase the chances that these teachers would be successful because the teachers would be better prepared for the realities of the classroom."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Providing Professional Development and Support for Current Teachers", "paragraphs": ["Many grantees reported having high teacher turnover and saw a need for providing professional development and other support in order to retain current teachers. The primary goal of professional development activities is to provide training and support for current teachers with the intention of improving their skills and retaining them in the classroom. Grantees used their funds for a variety of activities that provided professional development and support, such as providing coursework towards an advanced degree and assigning mentor teachers to new teachers.", "During our site visits, we found that mentoring was the most common professional development activity. Of the 33 grant sites we visited, 23 grants were providing mentoring activities. Many of the grantees we visited reported that mentoring programs are beneficial to the mentor teacher as well as the new teacher. The mentor can coach the new teacher on how to best instruct students and adjust to his or her job. In return, a mentor teacher may benefit from additional training and compensation. Some grantees used their funds to establish a mentor training program to ensure that mentors had consistent guidance. For example, Rhode Island used its grant funds to allow two experienced teachers to tour the state to provide training to future mentor teachers and help schools set up mentoring programs. Officials in Rhode Island believed this was an effective way to ensure that new teachers receive quality support."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recruiting New Teachers", "paragraphs": ["Many grantees reported having a teacher shortage in their area and used the grant funds to develop various teacher-recruiting programs. Of the grant sites we visited, many grantees were using their funds to fill teacher shortages in urban schools or to recruit new teachers from nontraditional sources\u2014mid-career professionals, community college students, and middle and high school students.", "The following are examples of grantees using their funds to fill shortages in urban areas or to recruit new teachers from nontraditional sources:   Recruiting for urban school districts\u2014Grantees that were experiencing a teacher shortage in their urban schools often provided various incentives for teacher candidates to commit to teaching in urban environments. For example, \u201cProject SITE SUPPORT\u201d housed at the Johns Hopkins University recruits teacher candidates with an undergraduate degree to teach in a local school district with a critical need for teachers while, at the same time, earning their masters in education. The program offers tuition assistance, and in some cases, the district pays a full teacher salary. As part of the terms of the stipend, teachers are required to continue teaching in the local school district for 3 years after completing the program. Grant officials told us that this program prepared teacher candidates for teaching in an urban environment and makes it more likely that they will remain in the profession.", "Recruiting mid-career professionals\u2014Many grantees targeted mid- career professionals by offering an accelerated teacher training program. For example, the Teacher Recruitment and Induction Project at Southwest Texas State University offered scholarships to mid-career professionals to offset the cost of classes required for teacher certification. The scholarships paid for a 1-year, full-time program that results in teaching certificates and 18 hours of graduate level credits for teacher candidates. Grantee officials told us that because the grant covers the Austin, Texas, area\u2014an area with many technology organizations\u2014they have been able to recruit highly skilled individuals who can offer a variety of real-life applications to many of the classes they teach.", "Recruiting from community colleges\u2014Some grantees have used their funds to recruit teacher candidates at community colleges. For example, National Louis University, one of the largest teacher training institutions in Illinois, has partnered with six community colleges around the state of Illinois so that the community colleges can offer training that was not previously available. The grant pays for a University faculty member to teach on each of the community college campuses. This program allows community colleges in smaller, rural communities to provide teacher training without teacher candidates incurring the cost of attending National Louis University\u2014a large private university. A grant program official told us that school districts in these areas will have a greater chance of recruiting new teachers trained at one of these community colleges because they were most likely to be from that community.", "Recruiting middle and high school students\u2014Other grantees target middle and high school students. For example, the Los Angeles Unified School District develops programs to attract high school students to the field of teaching. The majority of its grant resources has been used to fund a paid 6-week high school internship for students to work in the classroom with a teacher. The high school intern spends most days with a teacher in the classroom (see fig. 6). The intern\u2019s activities could include helping the teacher correct papers and plan activities. Once a week, interns have a class with a grant-funded teacher on curriculum and lesson planning. The grant official told us that the internship introduces younger people to teaching as a profession and, therefore, may increase the chances that they will become teachers in the future."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "The Extent to Which Grant Activities Will Affect the Quality of Teaching in the Classroom Will Be Difficult to Determine", "paragraphs": ["The extent to which grant activities will affect the quality of teaching in the classroom will be difficult to determine.

Education officials cited the change in the department\u2019s administration when explaining why the evaluation was abandoned. Education has also been conducting a 5-year study of some grants. Although this evaluation is designed to take a comprehensive look at grant activities, it is only looking at partnership grants awarded in 1999, making this study too limited for its result to apply to all grant activities. Because the grants last only 3 to 5 years, Education may have lost its only opportunity to collect the necessary information to determine if some grant activities have affected the quality of teaching in the classroom.", "In addition, Education did not provide adequate guidance to grantees on what types of information to collect in order to determine the results of their grant activities. For example, in order to determine results, a grantee would need to collect information before and after the activity for the group benefiting, as well as for a comparison group. Many grantees told us that they did not collect this information because Education did not provide them guidance on what types of information to collect. The legislation required grantees to submit an annual report on their progress toward meeting the program\u2019s purposes\u2014such as increased student achievement\u2014and its goals, objectives, and measures (see table 2). Education officials provided only limited guidance\u2014through brief descriptions in the application packet and intermittent conversations with grantees that requested assistance\u2014on what information to include in the annual report.

The accountability provisions required states and institutions to report information, such as the percentage of an institution\u2019s graduates who pass the state certification examination, also known as the pass rate. In order to gather information on the pass rate, Education first needed to define graduate. Education officials told us that in many teacher training programs, candidates do not graduate with a degree in teacher training, but rather receive a certificate. Therefore, Education did not define graduate but rather created the term \u201cprogram completer\u201d to encompass all those who met all the requirements of a state- approved teacher preparation program. Table 3 explains our analysis of the information HEA required to be collected, the way that Education defined selected terms to collect the information, and the reporting implications of Education\u2019s definitions. Our survey indicated that 41 percent of respondents found compliance with reporting requirements a challenge due to ambiguous definitions.", "Thus, using definitions provided by Education, states and institutions could report information that made their programs seem more successful than they might have been. Institutions could inflate their pass rate by reporting only on those teacher candidates who completed all coursework and passed the state teacher certification examination without including any information on teacher candidates who completed all coursework but failed the examination\u2014thus ensuring a 100-percent pass rate. During our review, we found that a few states and many institutions are inflating their pass rates to 100-percent. For instance, we found that in at least three state reports to Education, every institution reported 100-percent pass rates. Those institutions included in their calculations only those teacher candidates they determined to be program completers\u2014those who passed the state certification examination and met the state\u2019s other requirements\u2014excluding those who failed the examination. While requiring teacher candidates to pass the state certification examination as part of a teacher training program is not a problem, in and of itself, reporting on only those candidates who pass the test does not provide the basis to assess the quality of teacher training programs. For example, some institutions in Georgia reported 100-percent pass rates in their institutional report to the state, and Georgia, in turn, included these 100- percent pass rates in its state report to Education. However, as part of a state effort\u2014separate from the federal accountability provisions\u2014to hold institutions accountable for how well they prepare teachers, Georgia requires institutions to submit pass rates that include those who fail the examination to the state each year. This resulted in lower institutional pass rates than those included in the report to Education but is a calculation closer to what the Congress intended Education to collect as part of the accountability provisions.", "In other instances, Education allowed states to define some key terms from the legislation in a way that was applicable to their state because of the variability in how states defined terms and collected information. This allowed states to define terms so that they could cast the quality of their teacher training programs and the qualifications of their current teachers in the most positive light. For example, the accountability provisions required that states report on the number of teachers on waivers\u2014defined by Education as those teachers currently teaching without having received an initial certificate or license. Because Education allowed each state to define initial certificate or license for itself, each state reported different information in its waiver count. Figure 7 presents information from three neighboring states\u2014Maryland, Virginia, and Washington, D.C.\u2014with different definitions of certification leading to variations in who was included in their waiver count.

The contractor told us that this was done to make the reporting process easier on the state agencies. Once received, this information was put into a standard format in order to report to the Congress. Although states were required to certify the information they reported was accurate, errors occurred because of the way the information was collected. Therefore, it was even more important that the information be verified.

For example, because Education has not always disseminated information to grantees effectively, grantees without knowledge of successful ways of enhancing the quality of teaching in the classroom might be wasting valuable resources by duplicating unsuccessful efforts. In addition, because Education does not have a system to thoroughly evaluate grant activities\u2014including providing guidance to grantees on the types of information needed to determine effectiveness\u2014information on what activities improve the quality of teaching in the classroom will not be available. Also, due to the lack of clearly defined key terms by Education and adequate time for verification of data by its contractor, the information Education collected and reported to the Congress under the accountability provisions provided an inaccurate picture of the quality of teacher training programs and the qualifications of current teachers.", "Furthermore, 45 of 59 eligible states have already been approved for or awarded state grants, and because the authorizing legislation specifically requires that these grants can only be awarded once, only 14 states will be eligible to receive future state grants under the current authorizing legislation.

The practical difficulties of conducting any survey may introduce errors, commonly referred to as nonsampling errors. For example, difficulties in how a particular question is interpreted or in the sources of information that are available to grantees can introduce unwanted variability into the survey results. We took steps in the development of the questionnaires, the data collection, and the data editing and analysis to minimize nonsampling errors.
