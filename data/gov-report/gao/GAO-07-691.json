NASA has also taken steps to improve its processes for managing IEMP--including implementing improved requirements management and testing processes, enhancing its performance metrics related to tracking system defects, and developing an IEMP risk mitigation strategy. Further, NASA has developed quantitative entry and exit criteria for moving from one phase of an IEMP project to another--a recognized industry best practice. However, NASA has not yet addressed weaknesses in the areas of requirements development and project scheduling, which ultimately caused the agency to assume a greater risk that it would not identify significant system defects prior to implementation of the core financial upgrade. Despite these difficulties, NASA financial managers have stated that the core financial upgrade is now functioning as expected for most transactions. As of the end of GAO's audit work in May 2007, NASA was working to correct a number of system errors, including posting errors for certain types of transactions. Because NASA was still working to stabilize the system, GAO was unable to determine the significance of these weaknesses. Further, NASA has not yet fully considered higher-level strategic issues associated with developing an agencywide concept of operations and defining standard business processes. With a planned investment of over $800 million for IEMP, NASA must immediately and effectively address these strategic building blocks if IEMP is to successfully address long-standing management challenges--including overseeing contractor performance and properly accounting for NASA's property, plant, and equipment. NASA officials stated that they have begun developing a concept of operations to describe how all of its business processes should be carried out. According to NASA officials, they expect to complete the concept of operations by the summer of 2008. Ideally, a concept of operations should be completed before system development begins so that it can serve as a foundation for system planning and requirements development. Nonetheless, while NASA's IEMP efforts are already well under way, the completion of such a document remains essential for guiding the development of the remaining IEMP modules as well as any future upgrades. As part of developing a concept of operations, NASA should also define standard business processes that are supported by its IEMP software. NASA needs to ensure that its business processes and the information that flows from those processes support the enterprise's needs. Efforts that primarily focus on the parochial needs of a specific organizational unit, such as accounting, do not provide reasonable assurance that NASA's agencywide management information needs are addressed."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["As we and others have reported in the past, the National Aeronautics and  Space Administration (NASA) has fundamental problems with its financial  management operations that undermine its ability to effectively manage its  major programs and to report externally on its financial operations.

In April 2000, NASA began a program expected to  address many of its financial and management challenges. This program,  now known as the Integrated Enterprise Management Program (IEMP),  has been focused on implementing a new integrated financial management  system.

Entry criteria are the  minimum essential items considered necessary to enter into a given  project phase, while exit criteria are the minimum essential items  necessary to consider a given project phase successfully completed. For  example, the NASA entry criterion for moving into the regression testing  phase requires that all remaining significant defects from the integration  testing phase be resolved and successfully retested before regression  testing can begin. NASA demonstrated application of this criterion when it  implemented the contract management module. About 3 weeks before the  scheduled start date of regression testing, the project had not yet  successfully completed all test scenarios, and several significant defects  had not been fully resolved. In addition, a series of critical corrections  from the software vendor had not yet been delivered, and the project team  agreed that there would not be adequate time to test the corrections prior  to beginning the scheduled regression testing.

However, NASA did not document the dependencies among  the detailed project tasks for the core financial upgrade and therefore, did  not have reasonable assurance that the project schedule established at the  start of the project was realistic. According to NASA officials, they  recognized this risk and adopted several processes to identify and mitigate  the weakness, such as having knowledgeable project officials review the  schedule and holding weekly status meetings to determine whether the  tasks were on schedule.", "While the techniques used by NASA to constantly evaluate and adjust the  schedule are considered best practices and allowed NASA to gain  confidence in the schedule as the core financial upgrade project  progressed, they were not sufficient to ensure that the original schedule  was reasonable because they relied on ad hoc processes rather than a  formal task dependency analysis. If NASA had also identified the task  dependencies for the core financial upgrade, it would likely not have had  to rely on extraordinary efforts to complete the project.

Our review identified an important opportunity for  NASA to leverage its investment in IEMP by using the system\u2019s inherent  business processes to meet the enterprise\u2019s needs.", "Agencies such as NASA that invest in ERP solutions to meet their  enterprise needs often face difficulty in shifting from the stovepiped  processes of the past to the enterprise processes that underlie the ERP  concept. According to technical experts, a key benefit of an effective ERP  system is that the system provides the entire entity consistent data  regardless of which entity component generates a request or for what  purpose; the system maintains data based on the concept of \u201cone truth.\u201d In  other words, in non-ERP environments, one system may have one amount  for an agency\u2019s obligations while another system has another amount for  the same obligations. While either of these systems may be the \u201cofficial  system,\u201d actions and plans may be based on information in the other  system. In order for all of an organization\u2019s actions and plans to be  consistent, the same information needs to be available and used by all  segments of that organization. Under the ERP concept, it does not matter  whether an individual is in budget, accounting, procurement, or any other  organizational component; the answer to the question of \u201chow much  money has been obligated and how much is still available\u201d is consistent.", "One example of an opportunity for NASA to use enterprise processes to  accomplish multiple needs is in the area of program oversight and  accounting for PP&E. NASA typically spends about 85 percent of its  budget procuring goods and services from its contractors each year.", "Therefore, much of the cost information NASA needs to oversee its  programs and compile its external financial reports resides with its  contractors. For its larger contracts, NASA generally obtains cost data  from monthly contractor financial management reports, commonly  referred to as NASA Form 533s. NASA Form 533 captures planned and  actual contract costs and, according to NASA officials, is used for  budgeting, monitoring contract costs, and controlling program resources.  The Office of the Chief Financial Officer (OCFO) also uses NASA Form  533 to capture the costs reported on the agency\u2019s financial statements.  However, NASA Form 533 does not contain information related to the  status of work performed on a contract. Therefore, for all major  acquisitions and for development or production contracts and  subcontracts valued at $20 million or more, in addition to NASA Form  533s, NASA\u2019s contractors are also required to provide monthly contract  cost performance reports. Each of these reports is treated as a stovepiped  activity; that is, they provide cost information for a given contract in two  different formats and are used by different organizations and for different  purposes within NASA.", "For those contracts for which NASA receives contract cost performance  reports in addition to Form 533s, program managers use the cost  performance reports to monitor contract performance, while the OCFO  uses NASA Form 533 to accrue costs that, among other things, are  reported on the agency\u2019s financial statements. Although NASA Form 533  and the cost performance report reflect cost data pertaining to the same  contract, the level of detail provided in each report may vary considerably  depending on the contractor cost reporting requirements negotiated as  part of the contract. For example, the cost data required by program  managers to manage major acquisitions are often more detailed than those  required by the OCFO. In addition, because neither the cost performance  report nor NASA Form 533 contains the information needed by the OCFO  to properly account for equipment and other property acquired from  contractors, NASA also relies on periodic, summary-level information  provided by its contractors to report property amounts on its financial  statements.", "When NASA initially implemented its IEMP core financial module in June  2003, it did not adequately consider program managers\u2019 needs and did not  design the system to accommodate the more detailed cost data contained  in contractor cost performance reports. Since that time, NASA has  redesigned the coding structure embedded in the core financial module to  be more consistent with the work breakdown structure (WBS) coding  used by program managers. However, NASA continues to use cost data  from NASA Form 533\u2014generally reported by contract line items\u2014to  populate the core financial module. As a result, as shown in figure 1, NASA  uses a complex, NASA-specific process to allocate the costs reported on  NASA Form 533 to the WBS codes in IEMP based on available funding.", "In a very simplified example, if NASA received a Form 533 showing  $1,000 of cost incurred for a particular contract line item and two WBS  codes pertained to that line item, NASA would allocate the costs to those  two WBS codes. Assuming WBS 1 had more funding available than WBS 2,  NASA might allocate $600 to WBS 1 and $400 to WBS 2. However, the  contract cost performance report might show that the actual costs were  $500 for WBS 1 and $500 for WBS 2. Although this allocation process  reorganizes cost data reported on NASA Form 533 into the same reporting  structure that is used by program managers, it still results in different  costs, maintained in different systems, used for different purposes.  Accordingly, these separate processes do not result in the \u201cone truth\u201d that  is provided when an ERP view is taken.", "Further, this dual reporting approach has not addressed one of NASA\u2019s  long-standing financial reporting weaknesses: reporting on its PP&E. For  example, NASA\u2019s processes do not allow the agency to identify capital  costs\u2014that is, those that should be recorded as assets\u2014as they are  incurred. Instead, as we recently reported, the agency performs a  retrospective review of transactions entered into its property system to  determine which costs should be capitalized. This subsequent review is  labor-intensive and error-prone, and therefore increases the risk that not  all related costs will be properly captured and capitalized.", "Figure 2 provides an example of how NASA could use IEMP to implement  an enterprise process that (1) provides the necessary data for the  enterprise operations and (2) reduces the burden on NASA and contractor  officials.", "As shown in figure 2, if NASA received only one monthly report containing  contract cost data reported in sufficient detail for both program  management and financial reporting purposes, then it could record these  costs directly in IEMP without first going through an allocation process as  it does now. All individuals and components throughout NASA could then  use the same cost data that reside within IEMP for a given contract; IEMP  could provide different arrays of cost information based on each user\u2019s  needs, but all cost information for a given contract would come from one  source. For example, as shown in figure 2, the program manager could use  the cost data from IEMP along with other supplemental contractor  performance information, such as labor hours used, to see if the project is  meeting expectations. In addition, if discrete WBS codes were established  to identify the costs associated with the acquisition of property, then IEMP  could automatically capitalize those costs and financial managers could  readily determine how much cost has been recorded for property. The  key is that under the enterprise process concept, single data entry is used  for multiple purposes. Since the enterprise view provides \u201cone truth,\u201d an  adequate audit trail over the data used to report property can be  maintained simply by reviewing the cost reports that were provided by the  contractors. Thus, NASA can take advantage of the efficiencies inherent in  an ERP solution by allowing the data needed for external financial  reporting to be produced as a by-product of the processes it uses to  manage its mission."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["NASA has made significant strides in developing and implementing more  disciplined processes for supporting its IEMP efforts since our last report  in 2005. NASA has recognized the need for the disciplined processes  necessary to reduce risks to acceptable levels, as evidenced by its  implementation of several of our recommendations. More importantly,  NASA officials recognize that improving system implementation processes  is a continuous effort and that certain processes\u2014particularly  requirements development and project scheduling\u2014may need more  attention. However, the real key to realizing NASA\u2019s IEMP vision is for  NASA\u2019s management to develop an overarching strategy for managing its  agencywide management system development effort. We are encouraged  that NASA has begun to develop a concept of operations. As part of the  development of this document, it will be critical for NASA to define (1) the  agency\u2019s business processes and information needs and (2) the types of  systems that will be used to carry out these processes and produce the  necessary information. Another critical factor in developing a concept of  operations will be analyzing the agency\u2019s current business processes and  determining how these processes can be made more efficient and  effective. For example, NASA can take advantage of the efficiencies  inherent in the solution it has selected by utilizing an enterprise view to  produce the data needed for external financial reporting as a by-product of  the processes it uses to manage its mission. Unless NASA devotes  immediate, focused attention to taking these critical strategic planning  steps, it will continue to face the risk that its planned $800 million  investment in IEMP will not achieve the transformational changes  necessary to provide NASA with the information needed to make well- informed business decisions and to effectively manage its operations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To help ensure that disciplined processes are effectively implemented for  future IEMP modules, upgrades, or other business systems, we  recommend that the NASA Administrator direct the IEMP Program  Director to take the following two actions.", "Establish requirements development policies and procedures regarding  (1) how customer needs will be elicited, developed, and validated;   (2) how to identify and ensure the involvement of relevant  stakeholders; and (3) required training in such topics as requirements  definition and analysis to be provided to people involved in the  requirements process.", "Develop policies and procedures that require project schedules to  include the identification and documentation of dependencies among  various project tasks.", "To help ensure that future IEMP projects are designed to carry out NASA\u2019s  mission in an efficient manner that meets the needs of all users, we  recommend that the NASA Administrator establish as a high priority the  completion of a concept of operations that addresses NASA\u2019s business  operations for both its mission offices and administrative offices (such as  financial management and human capital) before any new implementation  efforts begin.", "Once the concept of operations is complete, we recommend that the NASA  Administrator review the functionality of previously implemented IEMP  modules for the purpose of determining whether enhancements or  modifications are needed to bring them into compliance with the concept  of operations.", "To help ensure that NASA receives the maximum benefit from its reported  $800 million investment in IEMP, we recommend that the NASA  Administrator establish policies and procedures requiring approval to  establish or maintain business processes that are inconsistent with the  processes inherent in the COTS solutions selected for IEMP. The reasons  for any decisions made to not implement the inherent COTS processes  should be well-documented and approved by the Administrator or his  designee.
