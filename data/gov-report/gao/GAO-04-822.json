However, the agency's senior IT investment board does not regularly review investments that are in the \"in-service management,\" or operational, phase of their life cycles, and this creates a weakness in FAA's ability to oversee more than $1 billion of its IT investments. In addition, the agency has not yet established the key practices that would allow it to manage all of its investments as one portfolio--an integrated set of competing options. Until FAA has established the practices that would enable it to effectively manage its annual IT budget of about $2.5 billion, agency executives lack assurance that they are selecting and managing the mix of investments that best meets the agency's needs and priorities. The agency has initiated efforts to improve its investment management processes, but it has not yet developed and implemented a comprehensive plan--supported by management--to guide all of its improvement efforts. Such a plan is crucial in helping FAA to coordinate and prioritize its improvement efforts and sustain its commitment to the efforts it already has under way.

AMS was intended to reduce the time and cost  for fielding new products and services by introducing (1) a new investment  management system that spans the entire life cycle of an acquisition, (2) a  new procurement system that provides flexibility in selecting and  managing contractors, and (3) organizational and human capital reforms  that support the new investment and procurement systems.", "AMS provides high-level acquisition policy and guidance for selecting and  controlling FAA\u2019s NAS investments through all phases of the acquisition life  cycle, which is organized into a series of phases and decision points that  include (1) mission analysis, (2) investment analysis, (3) solution  implementation, and (4) in-service management. To select investments,  FAA has established two processes\u2014mission analysis and investment  analysis\u2014which together constitute a set of policies, procedures, and  guidance that enhance the agency\u2019s ability to screen projects that are  submitted for funding. Also, through these two processes FAA is to assess  and rank each project based on its relative costs, benefits, risks, and  contribution to FAA\u2019s mission, and a senior, corporate-level decision- making group selects projects for funding. After a project has been  selected, FAA officials are required to formally establish the life cycle cost,  schedule, benefits, and performance baselines that are used to monitor the  project\u2019s status throughout the remaining phases of the acquisition  management life cycle.

For  example, through the mission analysis phase, FAA identifies critical needs  that the agency must meet for improving the safety, capacity, efficiency,  and effectiveness of the NAS. Approval of a mission need statement by the  JRC signifies that the agency agrees that the need is critical enough to  proceed to the next phase\u2014investment analysis. During the investment  analysis phase, the IAT is to analyze and recommend a solution that best  satisfies FAA\u2019s performance goals and customer service needs. This team is  then to rank each proposed project based on a number of factors, including  how well it meets mission needs compared to other projects and whether it  has a favorable cost-benefit ratio. As part of the JRC selection process, the  life cycle cost, schedule, benefits, and performance baselines are  established in a formal document called the acquisition program baseline  (APB), which is designed to be used by program offices to monitor a  project\u2019s status in achieving those baselines throughout the remaining  phases of the acquisition management life cycle.", "The solution implementation phase begins when the JRC approves and  funds a project, establishes its acquisition program baseline, and authorizes  the service organizations to implement and manage the project over its life  cycle. After the project has been implemented and is in operation (FAA\u2019s in- service management phase), the service organizations monitor and assess  operational performance. Also during this phase, the project is monitored  to determine whether the current capability satisfies the demand for  services or whether another solution offers the potential for improving  safety or effectiveness or for significantly lowering costs. If the current  capability is lacking, FAA initiates a process whereby the mission need  would be revalidated and the investment analysis process begun again,  possibly leading to a new investment decision.

It  also uses the AMS process when a system\u2019s capability shortfall is identified,  and it treats the correction of the shortfall as a new investment. The  managers of the three projects we reviewed confirmed that their projects  were selected using the AMS process. One project\u2019s officials stated that this  included market, alternatives, investment, and affordability analyses. The  program managers also stated that the annual F&E budget formulation  process is used to reselect their projects.

Taking an  agencywide perspective enables an organization to consider its  investments comprehensively, so that collectively the investments  optimally address the organization\u2019s missions, strategic goals, and  objectives. Managing IT investments with a portfolio approach also allows  an organization to determine priorities and make decisions about which  projects to fund, and continue to fund, based on analyses of the relative  organizational value and risks of all projects, including projects that are  proposed, under development, and in operation. For an organization to  reap the full benefits of the portfolio process, it should collect all of its  investments into an enterprise-level portfolio that is overseen by its senior  investment board.

We did not perform  a detailed assessment of these practices because they most likely will be  superseded by a new process (when it is defined) for managing non-NAS  investments, and non-NAS investments are of lower cost and impact to  FAA.", "As part of our analysis, we selected three IT projects as case studies to  verify that the critical processes and key practices were being applied. We  selected projects that (1) supported different FAA functional areas,  (2) were in different life cycle phases, and (3) required different levels of  funding. The three projects are described below:  FAA Telecommunications Infrastructure (FTI)\u2014FTI is a performance- based telecommunications services contract for voice, video, and data  point-to-point support for telecommunications for the National Airspace  System and its support system. It contributes to both the separation of  aircraft (the mission-support network) and other FAA uses (the  operational network, e.g., e-mail and phone). FTI will replace the  current telecom system. FTI will eliminate the need for other  subnetworks, of which there are currently eight or nine, and therefore  eliminate the management overhead associated with operating so many  networks. The integration of multiple networks and subnetworks will  provide a single source and single vehicle for telecom. FTI is in the  Technical Operations unit and has estimated life cycle costs of  $2 billion. The contract for FTI was awarded in June 2002.", "En Route Communications Gateway (ECG)\u2014ECG is a mission critical  gateway, or interface, for data from radar sites to Air Route Traffic  Control Centers. ECG will serve as a single domain communications  gateway and will provide the path for exchanging flight plan data from  outside sources and transfer data among systems. ECG provides a  commercial-off-the-shelf nondevelopmental item digital gateway using a  modern, open and extensible platform consisting of modular scalable  hardware components. ECG will incorporate interface capability to  support legacy and future systems and will provide the capability to  transition to modern network communications and access more  surveillance sources. The flexibility provided by the ECG system  architecture will facilitate the evolution of the En Route domain  modernization. ECG will replace the Peripheral Adapter Module  Replacement Item system and provide a modern domain gateway that  will support the current and future En Route infrastructure. ECG is in  the En Route & Oceanic Service group and has estimated life cycle costs  of $442.5 million through September 2015.", "Voice Switching and Control System (VSCS)\u2014In our review of the VSCS  program, we focused our review on one of VSCS\u2019s subcomponents, the  VSCS Control Subsystem Upgrade (VCSU). The VCSU program, part of  the Technical Operations Communications service group, is designed to  maintain overall supportability of VSCS by replacing the hardware for  the existing control subsystem, associated VSCS operational and  application software, required software licenses, and supporting  software and hardware documentation. Deliverables for the VCSU  program include all hardware, spare parts, software, software licenses,  system baseline documentation, training, and other technical  documentation necessary to support the product at 21 locations.  According to FAA, the VCSU program has a funding baseline of over $59  million and is in the operations and maintenance phase.", "For these projects, we reviewed project management documentation, such  as mission needs statements, acquisition program baselines, and integrated  program plans. We also interviewed the project managers for these  projects.", "We compared the evidence collected from our document reviews and  interviews to the key practices in ITIM. We rated the key practices as  \u201cexecuted\u201d on the basis of whether the agency demonstrated (by providing  evidence of performance) that it had met the criteria of the key practice. A  key practice was rated as \u201cnot executed\u201d when we found insufficient  evidence of a practice during the review or when we determined that there  were significant weaknesses in FAA\u2019s execution of the key practice.", "To address our second objective, we obtained and evaluated documents  showing what management actions had been taken and what initiatives had  been planned by the agency. This documentation included JRC records of  decisions, the agency\u2019s capital investment guidance, and the recently  formed ITEB charter and meeting minutes. We also interviewed the Chief  Information Officer, other members of the JRC, and the Chief Operating  Officer to determine what efforts FAA had undertaken to improve IT  investment management processes.", "To address our third objective, we reviewed documentation on DOT\u2019s  process for reviewing FAA\u2019s budget proposals and capital planning and  investment control reviews.
