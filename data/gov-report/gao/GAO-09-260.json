DHS developed an improvement plan that focused on eliminating its backlog of overdue requests, implementing enhanced training requirements, and deploying more advanced technology. Further, the DHS Privacy Office has initiated actions to ensure policy compliance and provide oversight of FOIA operations throughout the department's component agencies, including developing a departmentwide handbook, monitoring monthly data processing statistics, and instituting relevant training for employees. As a result, DHS has reported reducing its backlog by about 24 percent since implementing its plan. However, opportunities exist for DHS to improve the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of FOIA processing across the department. Specifically, implementation of the following practices could facilitate the processing of information requests at a number of its major components: (1) Internal monitoring and oversight. Establishing mechanisms for monitoring and oversight of processing efficiency may help reduce the backlog of open requests. (2) Component-specific training. Component-specific training could enhance the efficiency of processing within component agencies. (3) Online status-checking services. Providing requesters with online access to information concerning the status of their requests could contribute to better customer service and higher staff productivity. (4) Electronic dissemination of records. Releasing records in an electronic format could provide cost savings and increase efficiency. (5) Electronic redaction. By adopting electronic redaction more broadly, DHS may be able to reduce the staff time otherwise spent manually redacting records, while also improving the consistency of its responses to requests. By implementing these practices--which are already being used by certain DHS components and other agencies--across major DHS components, the department could further reduce its backlog, increase efficiency, improve customer service, and respond to information requests in a more timely fashion"]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) establishes that federal agencies  must generally provide the public with access to government information,  thus enabling them to learn about government operations and decisions.

The component took a variety of  actions, including centralizing its program and implementing a new  electronic tracking system. The FOIA Officer stated that centralization of  the program allowed for greater consistency in processing procedures and  the use of technology. In addition, ICE was able to eliminate  approximately 1,200 overdue requests by determining that the requesters  were no longer interested in them.", "As part of its operational improvements in FOIA processing, DHS officials  reported that they had improved the way the department handles requests  relating to Alien-File (A-File) records, which are processed by USCIS and  ICE. Both components experienced a large reduction of their backlogs by  streamlining the approach used for processing these requests. Previously,  a major hurdle these components faced was the sharing of the existing 55  million hardcopy A-Files. Because the A-Files contain both benefit and  enforcement documents, an individual file may be in the possession of  either component at any given time. When either one of the components  received a request for the contents of a file, that component had to locate  the file and determine whether it should have responsibility for processing  the request. After November 2006, the ownership of all A-Files was  transferred to USCIS. In order to facilitate faster processing, ICE provided  USCIS with a processing guide containing the policies, procedures, and  background information necessary to enable USCIS to process A-File  requests on behalf of ICE. This process eliminated the need to refer  records to ICE for review and determination of releasability, which could  result in unnecessary delays.", "USSS reported a 23 percent reduction in its backlog of overdue requests  since September 2006, reducing the number of overdue requests by 170.

According to  component officials, since it was initiated in May 2008, the USCIS service  has contributed to improved staff productivity and provided requesters  with faster access to status information. The system allows requesters to  access status information by entering their unique tracking number into a  form on USCIS\u2019s FOIA Web site. The Web site then returns real-time status  information extracted from the component\u2019s tracking system.", "Agency officials reported that the service has improved the efficiency of  their program.

Before USCIS deployed the service, requesters seeking  information about their requests needed to call the service center and  speak directly with staff.", "Like USCIS, ICE has also developed and implemented an online status- check service. Deployed in December 2008, it allows requesters to query  the tracking system regarding the status of their requests by filling out a  form on the agency\u2019s Web site. ICE\u2019s FOIA Officer described the online  status-check service as part of an effort to enhance customer service and  reduce the number of status request phone calls ICE receives. At the time  of our review, the ICE service had not been in operation long enough for  data to be collected on the benefits it has yielded.", "In contrast to USCIS and ICE, the other five major DHS components have  not yet deployed online status-check services.

The other two neither provide an online service nor possess a sufficiently  comprehensive tracking system to support one.", "USSS is an example of a component that has not deployed an online  status-check service, even though it operates a comprehensive tracking  system. The agency instructs requesters who are seeking status  information to call the FOIA service center or submit their request\u2019s  unique tracking number through its Web site. Once a status inquiry is  received, staff search the tracking system to provide requesters with status  information. Agency officials stated that, in response to Executive Order  13392, USSS is considering the feasibility of deploying an online status  system. By deploying such a service, the component may be able to reduce  the staff resources it currently devotes to responding to status inquiries.", "Like USSS, FEMA does not provide an online service, despite operating a  comprehensive tracking system. Currently, when requesters call or e-mail  FEMA\u2019s central office seeking status information, staff must contact the  relevant program offices to determine the status of the request and relay  that information to the requester. Agency officials stated that responding  to requester calls to its FOIA Helpline was a full-time job, and that  transitioning to an online status service would be cost-effective and  efficient for both the agency and requesters. Although agency officials  stated that FEMA is developing a database feature to allow requesters to  view status information through its FOIA Web site, they did not provide an  estimate of when the service would be available. Until the online status  service is made available, FEMA will likely continue to devote significant  staff resources to responding to status inquiries.", "TSA also continues to use staff to manually search its tracking system to  determine a request\u2019s status. TSA officials stated that, for technical  reasons, it would not be feasible to develop an online status service based  on its current comprehensive tracking system. Instead, staff reply to  requester inquiries in the same format (e-mail or phone) that the inquiry  was received, typically within 24 to 48 hours. Agency officials also stated  that the FOIA office is exploring adopting other case management  software applications that could support an online status service. If TSA  ultimately develops such a capability, it might be able to reduce the staff  resources devoted to responding to status inquiries.", "Currently, the FOIA tracking systems at the Coast Guard and CBP are not  sufficiently comprehensive to support an online status service. The Coast  Guard operates separate tracking systems for each of its 1,300 field  offices. Requesters seeking the status of their requests must inquire  directly with the Coast Guard field office responsible for processing the  request. Similarly, CBP cannot yet provide a component-wide online status  service because its tracking system does not capture current status  information for commercial or financial requests processed by offices or  ports other than its central office. For such requests, CBP\u2019s tracking  system, which is manually updated each month, records when the request  was received and to which office or port it was referred. The tracking  system is also updated when the office or port notifies the central office  that the request was processed. CBP officials stated that they had not  deployed an online service for noncommercial and nonfinancial requests  because CBP does not provide outside entities access to its tracking  system. As a result, requesters seeking status information for  noncommercial or nonfinancial requests, which account for approximately  95 percent of CBP\u2019s requests, must phone their inquiry to personnel at  CBP\u2019s central office.
