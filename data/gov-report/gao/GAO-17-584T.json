It will be important for the Bureau to fully test these activities under census-like conditions during the 2018 End-to-End Test scheduled to begin August 2017 and make appropriate modifications.", "The Bureau continues to face challenges in managing and overseeing the information technology (IT) programs, systems, and contracts supporting the decennial census. These challenges include managing internal coordination and governance, contracts, schedule, scope, and IT costs. For example, GAO expects that the IT costs will rise due to increases in the scope of work for the integration contract. In addition, the Bureau needs to address several security risks and challenges to secure its systems and data, including ensuring that security assessments are completed in a timely manner. Given that the 2018 End-to-End test begins in August 2017, it will be important that the agency work to address these challenges quickly. GAO has ongoing work that is reviewing each of these challenges.", "The Bureau's October 2015 cost estimate for the 2020 Census does not fully reflect characteristics of a high-quality estimate and cannot be considered reliable.

The 2010 decennial was the costliest U.S. Census in history  at about $12.3 billion, and was about 31 percent more costly than the  $9.4 billion 2000 Census (in 2020 dollars). The average cost for counting  a housing unit increased from about $16 in 1970 to around $92 in 2010  (in 2020 dollars). According to the Bureau, the total estimated cost of the  2020 Census is approximately $12.5 billion dollars (in 2020 dollars).  Meanwhile, the return of census questionnaires by mail (the primary  mode of data collection) declined over this period from 78 percent in 1970  to 63 percent in 2010 (see figure 1).", "Declining mail response rates\u2014a key indicator of a cost-effective  census\u2014are significant and lead to higher costs. This is because the  Bureau sends temporary workers to each non-responding household to  obtain census data. As a result, non-response follow-up is the Bureau\u2019s  largest and most costly field operation. In many ways, the Bureau has  had to invest substantially more resources each decade to match the  results of prior enumerations.", "The 2020 Decennial Census is not the first decennial census to be on  GAO\u2019s High- Risk-List. Both the 2000 and the 2010 Decennial Censuses  were also high-risk areas. All three of these censuses have had issues  related to technology and design changes.", "Achieving a complete and accurate census is becoming an increasingly  daunting task, in part because the nation\u2019s population is growing larger,  more diverse, and more reluctant to participate. When the census misses  a person who should have been included, it results in an undercount; an  overcount occurs when an individual  is counted more than once. Such  errors are particularly problematic because of their differential impact on  various subgroups. Minorities, renters, and children, for example, are  more likely to be undercounted by the census.", "The Bureau faces an additional challenge of locating unconventional and  hidden housing units, such as converted basements and attics. For  example, as shown in figure 2, what appears to be a small, single-family  house could contain an apartment, as suggested by its two doorbells. If  an address is not in the Bureau\u2019s address file, its residents are less likely  to be included in the census. The Bureau estimated a net undercount of  790,000 housing units in 2010."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Bureau Has Redesigned the 2020 Census to Help Control Costs", "paragraphs": ["The basic design of the enumeration\u2014mail out and mail back of the  census questionnaire with in-person follow-up for non-respondents\u2014has  been in use since 1970. A key lesson learned from 2010 and earlier  enumerations is that this \u201ctraditional\u201d design is no longer capable of cost- effectively counting the population. In response to its own assessments,  our recommendations, and studies by other organizations, the Bureau  has fundamentally reexamined its approach for conducting the 2020  Census. Its plan for 2020 includes four broad innovation areas (re- engineered field operations, administrative records, verifying addresses  in-office, and the Internet self-response option). The Bureau believes  these innovations will save it over $5 billion (2020 dollars) when  compared to what it estimates conducting the census with traditional  methods would cost. However, in June 2016, we reported that the  Bureau\u2019s life-cycle cost estimate of $12.5 billion cost was not reliable and  did not adequately account for risk.", "To help drive these innovations, the Bureau plans to rely on about 50 IT  systems that are being developed or are already in production. Eleven of  these systems are expected to be provided by an enterprise-wide  initiative called Census Enterprise Data Collection and Processing  (CEDCaP),  which is managed within the Bureau\u2019s IT Directorate. This  initiative is a large and complex modernization program intended to  deliver a system-of-systems to support all the Bureau\u2019s survey data  collection and processing functions, rather than continuing to rely on  unique, survey-specific systems with redundant capabilities.

Specifically, the Bureau said it would stop all planned field  activity, including local outreach and hiring, at its test sites in Puerto Rico,  North and South Dakota, and Washington State. The Bureau is not  carrying out the planned field tests of its mail-out strategy and follow up  for non-response in Puerto Rico or its door-to-door enumeration.", "However, the Bureau is continuing with other planned testing in fiscal  year 2017, such as tests focusing on systems readiness and Internet  response. One of these tests, which began in March 2017, included 28 of  the roughly 50 systems to be used in 2020 operations. Further, the  Bureau said it would consider incorporating the canceled field activities  elements within the 2018 End-to-End Test, which is expected to begin in  August 2017. The Bureau maintains that stopping the 2017 Field Test will  help prioritize readiness for the 2018 End-to-End Test and mitigate risk.  Nevertheless, as we reported in November 2016, it also represents a lost  opportunity to test, refine, and integrate operations and systems, and it  puts more pressure on the 2018 test to demonstrate that enumeration  activities will function as needed for 2020."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "New Uses of Administrative Records Are Promising but Introduce Challenges", "paragraphs": ["Administrative records\u2014information already provided to the government  as it administers other programs, such as mail collection by the U.S.  Postal Service\u2014have been discussed and used for the decennial census  since the 1970s, but the Bureau plans a more significant role for them for  2020 to reduce fieldwork and control costs. For example, the Bureau  plans to use administrative records to help determine vacant and  occupied housing units and thus improve the efficiency of following-up  with non-respondents. The Bureau has estimated that using these  records could save up to $1.4 billion compared to traditional census  methods. In 2015, we found that the Bureau has already demonstrated  the feasibility of using administrative records. However, it still faces  challenges with using them for the 2020 Census. For example, although  the Bureau has no control over the accuracy of data provided to it by  other agencies, it is responsible for ensuring that data it uses for the 2020  Census are of sufficient quality for their planned uses.", "Another challenge we identified is the extent to which the public will  accept government agencies sharing personal data for the purposes of  the census. Related concerns involve trust in the government and  perceptions about burden on respondents as well the social benefits of  agencies sharing data. Moreover, in addition to using administrative  records to reduce fieldwork, the Bureau is considering several additional  opportunities to leverage administrative records to help improve the cost  and quality of the 2020 Census. It will be important for the Bureau to set  deadlines for deciding which records it will use and for which purposes for  those records.

We reported in 2016 that during the Bureau\u2019s 2016 Census Site  Test, the Bureau experienced about 20 and 30 percent of its test  workload as non-interviews at its two test sites in Harris County, Texas,  and Los Angeles County, California, respectively. According to the  Bureau, non-interviews are cases where no data or insufficient data are  collected, either because enumerators make six attempted visits without  success (the maximum number the Bureau allows), or interviews are not  completed due to, for example, language barriers or dangerous  situations. Identifying  root causes of problems is something we look for  when determining progress within a high-risk area. Accordingly, while the  2016 Census Test non-interview rate is not necessarily a precursor to the  2020 non-interview rate, because of its relationship to the cost and quality  of the census, it will be important for the Bureau to better understand the  factors contributing to it."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The Bureau Is Not Fully Prepared to Implement Key IT Capabilities", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Bureau Continues to Face Challenges in Managing and Overseeing IT Programs, Systems, and Contractors Supporting the Decennial", "paragraphs": ["The Bureau is managing the acquisition and development of new and  modified IT systems, which adds complexity to the design of the census.

Different divisions are  responsible for acquiring and developing different systems and technology supporting the 2020 Decennial Census. Eleven of the roughly 50 systems planned to be used in the 2018 End-to-End test are being delivered by the Chief Information Officer\u2019s (CIO) IT Directorate through the CEDCaP program, with the other 39 being managed and developed within the 2020 Census Directorate or other Bureau divisions. We have reported the Bureau has had challenges in coordinating and governing between these divisions. In August 2016 we reported that the two programs lacked effective processes for managing their schedule, risk, and requirements interdependencies.We stated that until the two programs establish schedules that are completely aligned, develop an integrated list of all interdependent risks, and finalize processes for managing requirements, both  programs are at risk of not delivering their programs as expected.", "Effective IT governance can drive change, provide oversight, and ensure accountability for results. Further, effective IT governance was what Congress had in mind when it enacted the provisions known as the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA), which reinforced the role of the agency CIO. To ensure executive-level oversight of the key systems and technology, the Bureau\u2019s CIO (or a representative) is a member of governance boards that oversee all of the operations and technology for the 2020 Census. Moving forward, it will be important that the CIO and other agency executives continue to use a collaborative governance approach to effectively manage risks and ensure that the IT solutions meet the needs of the agency within cost and schedule.", "Contract management. The Bureau is relying on contractor support  in many key areas of the 2020 Census, including for integrating all of  the key systems and infrastructure and developing many of the key  data collection systems. In August 2016, the Bureau hired a  contractor to integrate the 2020 Census systems and infrastructure.  The contractor\u2019s work was to include evaluating the systems and  infrastructure and acquiring the infrastructure (e.g., cloud or data  center) to meet the Bureau\u2019s scalability and performance needs. It  was also to include integrating all of the systems, supporting technical  testing activities, and developing plans for ensuring the continuity of  operations. Since the contract was awarded, the scope has grown to  also include assisting with operational testing activities, conducting  performance testing for two Internet self-response systems, and  technical support for the implementation of the paper data capture  system.", "In addition, the Bureau is relying on contractors to develop a number  of key systems and components of the IT infrastructure. These  activities include (1) developing the IT platform that is to be used to  collect data from a majority of respondents\u2014those using the Internet,  telephone, and non-response follow-up activities; (2) procuring the  mobile devices and cellular service to be used for non-response  follow-up; and (3) developing the IT infrastructure in the field offices.  As we reported in November 2016, a greater reliance on contractors  for these key components of the 2020 Census requires the Bureau to  focus on sound management and oversight of the key contracts,  projects, and systems.", "Schedule management. In November 2016, we noted that a great  deal of development work remained to be completed for the roughly  50 systems and that the Bureau was still developing the plans and  schedules for the integration and testing of these systems leading up  to the 2018 End-to-End test. This is still the case. In addition, the  Bureau has delayed key milestone dates by about 2 months due to  issues with developing the systems. This delay reduces the time  available for the integration and security testing activities leading up to  the 2018 End-to-End test. The Bureau is evaluating options to  decrease the impact on those testing activities, and we have ongoing  work reviewing the Bureau\u2019s schedule changes and the impacts of  those changes.", "Scope and requirements management. The Bureau is still in the  midst of determining the full complement of systems to be used for the  2018 End-to-End Test (beginning in August 2017) as well as the 2020  Census. For example, the Bureau is evaluating whether to remove  several systems from the End-to-End Test. In addition, the agency is  evaluating whether to change direction on certain systems and  capabilities for the 2018 End-to-End Test. For example, it is  evaluating whether to use the newly developed internet self-response  system or a legacy prototype. Time is running out before the 2018  End-to-End Test begins, so it will be important for the Bureau to make  these decisions with enough time to implement the chosen solutions.  IT cost growth. The Bureau has identified at least $2 billion in IT  costs for the 2020 program. These costs are associated with (among  other things) contracts for the integration of 50 systems into a \u201csystem  of systems,\u201d the infrastructure on which these systems reside, the call  centers for phone responses, the mobile devices and cellular service  for field staff who conduct the door-to-door enumeration, and a portion  of the costs for the CEDCaP program.", "However, our ongoing work suggests that IT costs are likely to rise.  For example, the scope of work for the integration contract has  increased since the contract was awarded in August 2016, and the  corresponding costs are likely to rise as well. Also, the Bureau  recently reported that the overall costs for the CEDCaP program are  expected to increase by at least 10 percent. In addition, the program  is still trying to determine the full complement of systems for the 2018  test and 2020 operations, so these costs may also change. Bureau  officials reported that the agency is developing a new cost estimate  for the entire 2020 Census program, which they expect to publish later  in the spring of 2017."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Bureau\u2019s Information Security Challenges Have Been Exacerbated by Short Time Frames", "paragraphs": ["In November 2016, we described the significant challenges that the  Bureau faced in securing systems and data, and we noted that tight time  frames could exacerbate these challenges. One such challenge was  making certain that security assessments were completed in a timely  manner and that risks were at an acceptable level.", "To determine the level of risk present in a system, guidance from the  National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) states that, as  part of their information security programs, agencies should develop  security plans, assess security controls, and develop plans of action and  milestones to address any deficiencies. The security plans, assessment  results, and plans to address deficiencies are key artifacts that  authorizing officials use to determine if the risks are acceptable. By  issuing an authorization to operate, the authorizing official accepts both  the plans to reduce identified deficiencies and any residual risk (e.g.,  unaddressed vulnerabilities) remaining from unaddressed deficiencies.  Each of the systems that the 2020 Census IT architecture plans to rely on  will need to develop security plans that identify controls to be  implemented, undergo a full security assessment, remediate critical  deficiencies, and obtain authorization to operate before being used for the  2020 Census.", "However, development and acquisition delays compressed the time to  conduct the security reviews and approvals for the 28 systems being  used in the 2017 test. For 2 of the 28 systems in the test, the authorizing  officials (the CIO and the Associate Director for Decennial Census  Programs) accepted security risks and uncertainty due to these  compressed time frames. For one of the systems, Bureau officials noted  that they did not have time to thoroughly assess the low-impact  components. The officials stated that, as a result, they had low  confidence in the confidentiality, integrity, and availability  of these  components. To mitigate the risk, Bureau officials stated that they secured these components in a private network with limited user access.  In another case, the Bureau did not have the time to complete penetration  testing prior to the 2017 test. According to Bureau officials, the  authorizing officials accepted these risks because they wanted to meet  the deadline of March 20, 2017, to begin the test in order to meet the  Census Day of April 1, 2017. Bureau officials noted that they were  informed of the security situation and were comfortable with the approach  and mitigations proposed to authorize these systems for the 2017 test.", "Because many of the systems that will be a part of the 2018 End-to-End  test are not yet fully developed, the Bureau has not finalized all of the  controls to be implemented; assessed those controls; developed plans to  remediate control weaknesses; and determined whether there is time to  fully remediate any deficiencies before the system test. As we previously  reported, while the large-scale technological changes (such as Internet  self-response) introduce great potential for efficiency and effectiveness  gains, they also introduce many information security challenges.

Cost estimates that appropriately account for risks facing an agency can help an agency manage large, complex  activities like the 2020 Census, as well as help Congress make funding  decisions and provide oversight. Cost estimates are also necessary to  inform decisions to fund one program over another, to develop annual  budget requests, to determine what resources are needed, and to  develop baselines for measuring performance.", "In 2016, we reported that although the Bureau had taken significant steps  to improve its capacity to carry out an effective cost estimate, such as  establishing an independent cost estimation office, its October 2015  version of the estimate for the 2020 Census only partially met the  characteristics of two best practices (comprehensive and accurate) and  minimally met the other two (well-documented and credible).

We reported that the estimate partially met best practices for this  characteristic, in part because we could not independently  verify the  calculations the Bureau used within its cost model, which the Bureau did  not have documented or explained outside its cost model. The Bureau\u2019s  cost-estimate was also not well-documented. Cost estimates are  considered valid if they are well-documented to the point they can be  easily repeated or updated and can be traced to original sources through  auditing, according to best practices.
