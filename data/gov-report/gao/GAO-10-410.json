In October 2009, CFTC and SEC issued this report in response to the Department of the Treasury's recommendation that the two agencies assess conflicts in their rules and statutes with respect to similar financial instruments. GAO's objectives were to review (1) how CFTC and SEC identified and assessed harmonization opportunities, (2) the agencies' progress toward implementing the joint report's recommendations, and (3) additional steps the agencies could take to reduce inconsistencies and overlap in their oversight. To meet these objectives, GAO reviewed the joint report and related documentation, interviewed agency officials, and obtained and analyzed written comments on the report from market participants."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["CFTC and SEC conducted joint analyses and sought public input to inform their efforts to identify and assess significant differences in their rules and statutes and develop recommendations to address such differences. The agencies obtained public input through joint public meetings and a public comment period and worked together to analyze this input. In drafting the joint report on harmonization of their regulatory approaches, CFTC and SEC focused their analysis on eight potential areas for harmonization and made at least one recommendation in all but one of these areas. The joint report also includes several recommendations to enhance coordination between the agencies. For example, the report recommended the creation of a Joint Advisory Committee to be tasked with considering and developing solutions to issues of common interest in the futures and securities markets. The joint report did not cover gaps in the agencies' authorities to oversee over-the-counter derivatives, which were the subject of congressional deliberation at the time of their study. The joint report's recommendations for statutory changes have yet to be enacted, and the recommendations for agency action remain in the planning stages. According to agency staff, since issuing the joint report in October 2009, the agencies have been focused on working with Congress on drafting legislation to address recommended statutory changes. Congress authorized CFTC and SEC to fund the Joint Advisory Committee, as requested in the joint report, and proposed legislation includes provisions that would partially address recommended statutory changes in areas including oversight of exchange rules and enforcement. CFTC and SEC have drafted a charter for the Joint Advisory Committee and expect to have this committee functioning by early summer 2010. Agency staff said the agencies have not set firm timelines for the implementation of the other recommendations for agency action. Additional harmonization opportunities exist beyond those addressed by the joint report's recommendations, and future efforts by CFTC and SEC to assess these opportunities could benefit from clearer goals and accountability requirements. With only a few months to complete their report, agency staff said the agencies could not address all differences in their rules and statutes through the joint report's recommendations. Market participants identified several areas they believe could benefit from additional harmonization efforts, including portfolio margining and investor definitions and categories. The agencies plan to coordinate future harmonization efforts through the Joint Advisory Committee, but they have not yet developed clear goals for harmonization or developed requirements for the agencies to evaluate and report their progress toward meeting such goals. Without a clearer vision to guide future harmonization efforts and mechanisms to ensure accountability for these efforts, CFTC and SEC may not be strategically positioned to implement the joint report's recommendations and address remaining harmonization opportunities."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["When Congress created the Commodity Futures Trading Commission  (CFTC) in 1974 to oversee the commodity futures markets, the futures  markets were relatively distinct from the securities markets overseen by  the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). As early as the 1970s,  however, the emergence of derivative products with characteristics of  both futures and securities led to periodic disputes concerning which  agency should have regulatory jurisdiction over certain new products.  These jurisdictional disputes have at times consumed significant agency  resources and resulted in lengthy delays in introducing product  innovations to the markets. Moreover, the futures and securities markets  have increasingly overlapped in terms of market participants, raising  concerns about duplicative or inconsistent regulation of entities that  engage in similar activities. Despite efforts by CFTC and SEC in recent  decades to resolve these issues, concerns about remaining overlaps, gaps,  and inconsistencies in their oversight have led to calls for a merger of the  two agencies, or absent a merger, greater harmonization of their  regulatory approaches.", "In its June 2009 white paper on financial regulatory reform, the  Department of the Treasury (Treasury) recommended that CFTC and SEC  report to Congress by September 30, 2009, on existing conflicts in their  rules and statutes with respect to similar types of financial instruments.  Treasury recommended that the agencies either explain why such  differences are essential to achieving underlying policy objectives or make  recommendations for changes to statutes and rules that would eliminate  the differences. In October 2009, CFTC and SEC responded to Treasury\u2019s  recommendation by issuing a joint report in which the agencies examined  harmonization opportunities and made recommendations to reduce  inconsistencies in their oversight and enhance cooperation between them.", "The conference report accompanying the Consolidated Appropriations Act  of 2010 mandated that GAO review the joint report of CFTC and SEC on  harmonization of their rules and statutes. Accordingly, in this report, we  examine (1) how CFTC and SEC identified and assessed significant  differences in their rules and statutes and developed recommendations to  address such differences, (2) what progress CFTC and SEC have made  toward implementation of the joint report\u2019s recommendations, and (3)  what additional steps CFTC and SEC could take to eliminate or reduce  inconsistencies in regulatory oversight and to enhance regulatory  efficiency and effectiveness, as well as market transparency.", "To satisfy our responsibility under the mandate to report the results of this  work by March 1, 2010, we provided an interim report in the form of a  briefing to the subcommittees\u2019 staffs on February 26, 2010. Appendix II  contains the full briefing slides. This letter represents the final report.", "To address our objectives, we reviewed and analyzed the joint report of  CFTC and SEC on harmonization (joint report), documentation of public  input collected by CFTC and SEC through joint public meetings and a  public comment period, CFTC and SEC analyses of relevant differences in  their statutes and regulations, and provisions of proposed legislation that  address statutory changes recommended in the joint report. We  interviewed CFTC and SEC staff about steps taken by the agencies to  identify and assess harmonization opportunities, progress the two  agencies have made toward implementing the joint report\u2019s  recommendations, and additional harmonization opportunities that may  exist. In addition, to identify additional steps the agencies could take to  harmonize their rules and statutes, we obtained and analyzed written  comments on the joint report from representatives of securities and  futures market participants, the investor community, and other experts  who participated in the joint public meetings hosted by the agencies to  discuss harmonization opportunities. Finally, we reviewed prior GAO  work on futures and securities markets regulation, financial regulatory  reform, and practices that can enhance and sustain collaboration among  federal agencies.", "We conducted this performance audit from January 2010 to April 2010 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those  standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient,  appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence  obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives. A more extensive discussion of our scope  and methodology appears in appendix I."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Prior to the 1930s, securities markets were overseen by various state  securities regulatory bodies and the securities exchanges themselves. In  the aftermath of the stock market crash of 1929, the Securities Exchange  Act of 1934 (SEA) created SEC as a new federal agency and gave it  authority to register and oversee securities broker-dealers, as well as  securities exchanges, to strengthen securities oversight and address  inconsistent state securities rules. SEC\u2019s mission is to protect investors;  maintain fair, orderly and efficient markets; and facilitate capital  formation. In addition to regulation by SEC and state agencies, securities  markets and the broker-dealers that accept and execute customer orders  in these markets continue to be regulated by self-regulatory organizations  (SRO), including the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, that are  funded by the participants in the industry. Among other things, these SROs  establish rules and conduct examinations related to market integrity and  investor protection. SEC also registers and oversees investment  companies and advisers, approves rules for the industry, and conducts  examinations of broker-dealers and mutual funds. State securities  regulators are generally responsible for registering certain securities  products and, along with SEC, investigating securities fraud. SEC is also  responsible for overseeing the financial reporting and disclosures that  companies issuing securities must make under U.S. securities laws.", "Oversight of the trading of futures contracts has changed over the years in  response to changes in the marketplace. Under the Grain Futures Act of  1922, the trading of futures contracts was overseen by the Grain Futures  Administration, an office within the Department of Agriculture, reflecting  the nature of the products for which futures contracts were traded.  However, futures contracts were later created for nonagricultural  commodities, such as energy products like oil and natural gas, metals such  as gold and silver, and financial products such as Treasury bonds and  foreign currencies. In 1974, as a result of the Commodity Exchange Act  (CEA), CFTC was created as a new independent federal agency to oversee  the trading of futures contracts. CFTC\u2019s mission is to protect market users  and the public from fraud, manipulation, and abusive practices related to  the sale of commodity and financial futures and options, and to foster  open, competitive, and financially sound futures markets. Like SEC, CFTC  oversees the registration of intermediaries, including futures commission  merchants (FCM), and relies on SROs, including the futures exchanges  and the National Futures Association, to establish and enforce rules  governing member behavior. The Commodity Futures Modernization Act  of 2000 (CFMA) established a principles-based structure for the regulation  of futures exchanges and derivatives clearing organizations, and clarified  that some off-exchange derivatives trading\u2014and in particular trading on  facilities accessible only to large, sophisticated traders\u2014was permitted  and would be largely unregulated or exempt from regulation.", "In recent decades, CFTC and SEC have sought ways to resolve  jurisdictional disputes and address other emerging areas of overlap in  their respective oversight of futures and securities markets. For example,  in 1981, CFTC and SEC reached an agreement, called the Shad-Johnson  Jurisdictional Accord, to clarify their respective jurisdictions over  securities-based options and futures. The accord was enacted into law in  January 1983 and, among other things, confirmed SEC\u2019s jurisdiction over  securities-based options, including stocks and stock indexes; provided  CFTC with jurisdiction over futures (and options thereon) on certain  securities and securities indexes; and prohibited futures trading on single  stocks, as well as on securities indexes that did not meet specific  requirements. In 2000, CFMA lifted the ban on futures on single stocks  and narrow-based securities indexes, allowing them to be traded on  securities or futures exchanges but subject to joint regulation of CFTC and  SEC. Pursuant to the CFMA, the two agencies worked together to jointly  create margin requirements for single stock futures. Exchanges that list  and trade security futures are subject to the jurisdiction of both CFTC and  SEC; this is one example of how the securities and futures markets have  overlapped in terms of regulated entities. In addition, financial  intermediaries must register with both CFTC and SEC if they serve  investors trading in instruments subject to the jurisdiction of the two  agencies. According to the joint report, approximately 45 percent of  futures commission merchants are also registered with SEC as broker- dealers. The joint report provides additional examples of the agencies\u2019  efforts to collaborate in various areas. For example, in March 2008, the  two agencies entered into a memorandum of understanding with the goal  of creating a closer relationship between the agencies on a broad range of  issues affecting their jurisdictions. The agreement identified points of  contact for coordination, outlined a protocol for addressing novel  derivative products, and generally contemplated enhanced information  sharing between the two agencies on areas of mutual concern and interest.", "Despite efforts by the agencies to define their respective regulatory  jurisdictions, jurisdictional disputes have periodically delayed the  introduction of novel derivative products to the marketplace. The joint  report notes that the governing statutes do not definitively address the  fundamental question of whether certain derivative instruments qualified  as futures contracts or options. In one recent example, in January 2005 the  Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) filed a proposal with SEC to list  and trade a new option on an exchange-traded fund holding investments  involving gold, but introduction of this product was delayed by over 3  years as CFTC and SEC could not reach agreement on jurisdiction. In  another instance, according to the Chief Executive Officer of CBOE, an  option on a credit default product was placed on hold for 7 months, while  a European derivatives exchange introduced a similar product within  weeks of the announcement of the proposal to list this similar product.  These examples illustrate the potential for such delays to create domestic  and international competitive disadvantages for U.S. exchanges and  clearinghouses attempting to introduce novel products.", "In its June 2009 white paper on financial regulatory reform, Treasury  noted that the broad public policy objectives of futures and securities  regulation are the same and that many of the differences in the regulation  of the markets are no longer justified. Specifically, Treasury expressed the  following concerns:    Economically equivalent instruments may be regulated in different  manners, depending on which agency has jurisdiction. For example, many  futures products and financial options regulated as securities are similar,  and the returns to one can often be replicated with the other.", "Jurisdictional disputes consume significant agency resources, and  uncertainty about the outcome of such disputes may impede innovation.", "Jurisdictional distinctions may have unnecessarily limited competition  between markets and exchanges. Under existing law, financial instruments  with similar characteristics may be forced to trade on different exchanges  that are subject to different regulatory regimes.", "The agencies follow different approaches to the regulation of exchanges,  clearing organizations, and intermediaries. Pursuant to the CEA, CFTC  employs a more principles-based approach to regulation, under which  market participants can have greater flexibility in complying with  regulatory requirements than under a more rules-based approach.  Treasury suggested that the two agencies seek agreement on principles of  regulation that are significantly more precise than the CEA\u2019s current \u201ccore  principles.\u201d", "As noted earlier, Treasury recommended that the agencies make  recommendations to address differences in statutes and regulations that  are not justified by the agencies\u2019 policy objectives. In the joint report, the  agencies note that broad differences in futures and securities regulation  reflect, in part, fundamental differences in the roles played by the two  markets. Because of the role of certain securities markets in capital  formation, for example, securities regulation is more concerned with  disclosure than commodities regulation is. For example, securities with  returns that depend on the issuer\u2019s financial performance\u2014such as stocks  issued by institutions to raise capital\u2014require more detailed disclosure to  protect investors than futures products with returns that depend on  changes in the price of a physical commodity. The primary purpose of the  futures markets is to facilitate the management and transfer of risk, and  certain securities markets, such as securities options and other securities  derivatives markets, also facilitate the management and transfer of risk. As  noted above, Treasury expressed concern that certain securities options  and futures products are subject to different regulatory requirements  although they serve similar purposes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CFTC and SEC Obtained Public Input and Conducted Joint Analyses to Identify and Assess Significant Differences in Their Statutes and Rules", "paragraphs": ["To respond to Treasury\u2019s recommendation, CFTC and SEC obtained  public input and conducted independent and joint analyses to identify and  assess significant differences in their statutes and rules. In July and August  2009, the agencies collaborated to prioritize and categorize issues on  which to solicit public input. Through joint public meetings held in early  September 2009 and a request for public comments, CFTC and SEC  collected views on harmonization opportunities from a range of market  participants and experts. The agencies worked together to analyze the  information collected, develop recommendations, and draft the joint  report. On the basis of their analysis of the public input, CFTC and SEC  grouped issues of regulatory conflict into eight areas, and in the joint  report made at least one recommendation in all but one of these  categories. The agencies also made five recommendations intended to  enhance operational coordination between them.

As a first step, the agencies  worked separately and together in July and August 2009 to analyze  differences between them regarding their statutes and regulations. For  example, CFTC and SEC staff completed a side-by-side analysis of the  agencies\u2019 respective statutes and rules in nine areas: (1) exchanges and  markets, (2) clearance and settlement, (3) trading practices, (4)  intermediaries, (5) Securities Act of 1933 and applicable provisions of the  Exchange Act, (6) financial responsibility rules, (7) enforcement, (8)  investment companies, and (9) investment advisers. According to CFTC  and SEC staff, the agencies used this analysis to identify significant  statutory and regulatory differences and to prioritize and categorize issues  on which to solicit public input.", "Following these independent and joint analyses, CFTC and SEC sought  input from the public in two ways. First, the agencies jointly arranged and  hosted public meetings on September 2 and 3, 2009. For the joint public  meetings, CFTC and SEC invited members of the investor community,  academics, industry experts, and futures and securities market  participants to participate in a series of panel discussions and provide  their views on regulatory differences and harmonization opportunities.  The agencies organized the meetings into five panel discussions, with each  panel focused on one of five broad categories: (1) exchanges and markets,  (2) intermediaries, (3) clearance and settlement, (4) enforcement, and (5)  investment funds. Including the participation of all nine CFTC and SEC  Commissioners and 30 panelists, these joint public meetings were  unprecedented in the history of the two agencies, according to the joint  report. Second, CFTC and SEC provided an opportunity for public  comment from August 19 to September 14, 2009, on the issues to be  discussed at the joint public meetings.

For each of the eight areas, the joint report includes discussion of statutes  and regulations relevant to SEC oversight, followed by discussion of  statutes and regulations relevant to CFTC oversight. For each area, the  joint report also includes an analysis section in which the two agencies  analyze the differences between their regulatory approaches.

Importantly, some remaining statutory and regulatory differences may  create opportunities for regulatory arbitrage\u2014that is, the potential for  market participants to use a particular market or product instead of a  competing market or product to exploit regulatory differences.

However,  the joint report\u2019s recommendations do not address all inconsistencies in  oversight of similar products and institutions. For example, the joint  report\u2019s recommendations do not explicitly address the potential for  different margin requirements for certain economically equivalent  instruments when used for similar purposes. In a joint comment letter  submitted to the agencies following the joint public meetings, several  securities options exchanges and the Options Clearing Corporation said  that differences between the agencies\u2019 approaches to regulating margin  can result in significantly different margin requirements for comparable  securities options and futures products, creating a competitive  disadvantage for certain options regulated as securities. The joint report  notes that CFTC, unlike SEC, generally does not have authority to set  margin levels for futures contracts or options on futures, but does not  recommend a statutory change to harmonize the agencies\u2019 authority over  margin requirements. In addition, SEC staff noted that all securities  transactions are subject to a small fee under the SEA and that there is no  comparable fee for futures transactions. The joint report did not include a  discussion of this difference, and according to SEC staff, a statutory  change would be required to achieve harmonization on this matter.

Moreover, regulatory  differences with respect to similar products or institutions do not  necessarily indicate that either futures or securities market requirements  provide insufficient investor protection or impose excessive burdens on  market participants. Nevertheless, when such differences exist, it is  important to consider whether they can create incentives for market  participants to engage in economically costly activities in order to take  advantage of more favorable regulations.", "As part of our review, we contacted the 30 panelists who participated in  the joint public meetings to ask them about their views on the joint report  and its recommendations.

Echoing views expressed at the  joint public meetings and discussed in the joint report, some respondents  recommended that SEC adopt or consider adopting a process similar to  CFTC\u2019s more rapid process for reviewing and approving exchange and  clearinghouse rules, under which most proposed rules are immediately  effective upon self-certification by the exchange or clearinghouse that the  rule complies with the CEA. Exchanges noted that the self-certification  process is competitively important because it allows them to implement  rule changes quickly. A few respondents also urged the two agencies to  reach agreement on an overarching set of principles to govern their  oversight of exchange and clearinghouse rules. This view also was  reflected in the joint public meetings and the joint report. As noted in the  joint report, SEC recently approved a new process for streamlining review  of rule changes, and SEC staff noted that about two-thirds of rule changes  proposed by securities exchanges are effective immediately upon filing.  SEC staff acknowledged that despite the recent streamlining, differences  remain between the two agencies\u2019 rule approval processes. Under the  SEA, for example, rule changes that are not effective under self- certification, in contrast to the approach under the CEA, must be approved  by SEC before they are effective. In addition, all proposed rule changes on  the securities side are published for comment. SEC staff noted that  differences in the agencies\u2019 rule approval processes in part reflect  differences in the structures of the futures and securities markets. For  example, in the securities markets, multiple exchanges compete to provide  a trading venue for products that are fungible across the exchanges; thus  proposed securities exchange rules can have implications for competition  among the exchanges.", "Portfolio margining and insolvency regimes: The joint report\u2019s  recommendation to facilitate portfolio margining neither explicitly  addresses differences in the portfolio margining methods used for futures  and securities portfolio margining accounts nor fully addresses issues  related to the insolvency of an intermediary that is dually registered as a  broker-dealer and a futures commission merchant. Two respondents  suggested that the agencies adopt a uniform portfolio margining regime.  Currently, the portfolio margining method approved by SEC for securities  portfolio margining accounts is different from the method for futures  portfolio margining accounts. Agency staff said these differences could  result in different margin requirements for similar, or economically  equivalent, instruments when used for similar purposes. SEC staff said  they are aware of the potential for regulatory arbitrage as a result of these  different methods. CFTC and SEC staff agreed that there are issues related  to portfolio margining that merit further consideration. In addition, a few  market participants recommended that CFTC and SEC work with  Congress to harmonize the bankruptcy and customer protection rules  applicable to joint broker-dealer/FCMs. These respondents noted that  harmonization of these rules is needed to help ensure the orderly  unwinding of customer positions in the event of a joint broker-dealer/FCM  bankruptcy. One respondent observed that while addressing these  insolvency issues cannot be characterized as a \u201cquick win,\u201d CFTC and SEC  should begin the process soon considering its importance and the  volatility of today\u2019s markets.", "Market structure: At the joint public meetings, panelists presented  mixed views on the need to resolve differences in the futures and  securities market structures, and the joint report discusses these views.  Noting the absence of a joint report recommendation, a few respondents  recommended actions to promote greater competition in the U.S. futures  markets. Two respondents told us that Congress and CFTC should take  steps to introduce features of the securities market structure to the futures  markets to improve competition and lower costs for investors in these  markets. For example, one securities market participant recommended  that CFTC encourage listing of fungible products to allow trading of  products on multiple exchanges and mandate interoperability of clearing  organizations to permit market participants to clear trades at a  clearinghouse regardless of the facility on which the trade was executed.  Another respondent suggested that regulators take a more aggressive  stance in using their antitrust authorities to ensure that futures exchanges  and clearinghouses and their rules are not anticompetitive. In written  comments provided in response to our questions, one futures market  participant opposed mandated interoperability among futures  clearinghouses, citing the potential for interoperability to inhibit  innovation, eliminate competition among clearinghouses, and contribute  to greater systemic risk by linking and exposing futures clearinghouses to  one anothers\u2019 risks. The joint report states that securities options  exchanges have been both competitive and innovative in developing new  products, notwithstanding the use of central clearing. Although the joint  report did not include a recommendation related to market structure, it  noted that the agencies have supported provisions for nondiscriminatory  access to clearing organizations for the over-the-counter derivatives  market. Moreover, in 2007, in response to Treasury\u2019s request for  comments on the regulatory structure associated with financial  institutions, the Department of Justice expressed support for a review of  exchange-controlled clearing of financial futures, the regulatory structure  that underlies it, and its alternatives. The joint report notes that the  Futures Industry Association, in its comment letter to the agencies, stated  that it would welcome a comprehensive study of how best to improve  competition in the market structures for both futures and listed options  markets.", "Investor definitions: Some market participants recommended that  CFTC and SEC harmonize their respective customer categories and  definitions with respect to oversight of intermediaries to help ensure  greater consistency in the application of customer protection rules. One  dually registered broker-dealer/FCM said that because essentially the same  entities transact business across asset classes, the agencies could simplify  definitions to include fewer categories based on net worth (rather than  financial assets) and investment experience. For example, this respondent  suggested that the agencies agree on the definition of \u201cretail\u201d investor. SEC  and CFTC staff said the agencies did not cover this issue for the purposes  of the joint report and that it merits further consideration by the agencies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Clearer Goals and Reporting Requirements Could Enhance CFTC and SEC\u2019s Future Harmonization Efforts", "paragraphs": ["CFTC and SEC staff told us that the agencies may use the Joint Advisory  Committee to coordinate their efforts to address harmonization issues  involving differences between the two agencies\u2019 approaches to regulation.

These practices include  defining and articulating a common outcome; developing mechanisms to  monitor, evaluate, and report on results; and reinforcing agency  accountability for collaborative efforts through agency plans and reports.

However, the agencies could not address all harmonization opportunities  through this time-constrained study, and additional areas for  harmonization may emerge as the markets continue to evolve. With the  joint report completed, sustained coordination between CFTC and SEC is  crucial as the agencies work to implement the report\u2019s recommendations  and to assess remaining harmonization opportunities.

As the agencies continue to work  toward implementation, setting appropriate goals, including time frames,  and reporting progress toward these goals could help to ensure that the  agencies take timely actions to address these recommendations.  Moreover, the agencies have not established a formal plan for identifying  and assessing remaining harmonization opportunities as well as additional  areas for harmonization that may emerge as a result of regulatory reform  and market developments. Such a plan could establish clear objectives for  assessing remaining harmonization opportunities, such as eliminating  inconsistencies and gaps in oversight of similar products and entities.
