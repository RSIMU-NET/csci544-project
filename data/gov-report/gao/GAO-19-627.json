Beneficiaries have two main options for their  Medicare health coverage: original fee-for-service Medicare or Medicare  Advantage (MA), the private plan alternative. Within the two main  Medicare options, beneficiaries have many choices; for example, in 2019  a beneficiary could choose from an average of 24 MA plans, each with  different coverage, costs, and providers. Beneficiaries may need to  consider some key differences when deciding among these options. For  example, beneficiaries in original Medicare may receive covered services  from any Medicare provider while beneficiaries who enroll in MA plans  may have a limited choice of providers. Beneficiaries in MA plans may  receive coverage for additional items and services, such as vision or  dental care, which are generally not covered under original Medicare.

Beneficiaries may be responsible for  several specific types of health care costs, including the following:", "Premiums\u2014Beneficiaries generally make monthly payments to  purchase coverage. Medicare Part A generally does not require  beneficiaries to pay a premium. Part B premiums are established by  statutory formula and are means-tested so that beneficiaries with  higher incomes pay higher premiums. The premiums charged by MA  plans and Part D plans are established by each plan and can vary  widely.

All 13 stakeholder groups we interviewed  reported that MPF is challenging for Medicare beneficiaries to use.  Specifically, most stakeholders cited difficulty navigating as beneficiaries  click through multiple complex pages in order to find and compare  coverage options. For example, two stakeholders noted that beneficiaries  must answer questions about their current Medicare health and drug  coverage and then go through a series of pages and steps before they  can view detailed information on their coverage options. One of these  stakeholders also told us that MPF navigation is cumbersome because  users cannot jump directly to certain pages or sections that address their  needs, such as viewing the availability of preferred pharmacies. One of  the stakeholders we interviewed also noted the lack of prominent  instructions on how to use MPF contributed to difficulties navigating the  four steps. Finally, in our interviews two stakeholders also noted that  navigation is difficult because beneficiaries are uncertain of the  information needed to make different comparisons or identify specific  plans. For example, the ability to filter and sort plan information does not  appear until later in the plan search process, where users are refining  plan results. This makes it hard for users to narrow options specific to  their needs because they first must go through all the options presented.  Specifically, beneficiaries will first see a list of plans available in their zip  code\u2014on average 24 plans\u2014and then must narrow down that list before  they can compare up to three selected plans.", "A 2018 report conducted jointly by two advocacy groups cited difficulties  locating the filter and sort functions in MPF, which contributed to  navigation problems. CMS user testing conducted on MPF found that  overall beneficiaries are confused about how to find a MA plan on MPF.  For example, this testing showed that some users had difficulties with the  steps for refining plan results because they overlooked or ignored the  filters. A 2017 CMS study noted that MPF navigation is difficult and is  better suited for specialist users who assist beneficiaries in determining  their coverage options, such as 1-800 MEDICARE customer service  representatives and SHIP counselors. Further, CMS officials said the  study found that beneficiaries would benefit if navigation through the site  were more tailored to the tasks they were undertaking.", "Our survey of SHIP directors, who provide assistance to Medicare  beneficiaries and therefore are familiar with MPF usability, also found that  it is difficult for beneficiaries to navigate and find information. Specifically,  73 percent (29 of 40) of the SHIP directors who responded to our survey  reported that it is difficult or very difficult for beneficiaries to find  information in MPF. While SHIP directors reported that it is easier for  SHIP counselors to find information, they noted that some also  experience difficulty.

All seven  beneficiary advocacy groups interviewed reported that beneficiaries find it  challenging to understand information in MPF. For example, some  stakeholders noted that beneficiaries do not always understand  terminology, such as the differences between cost sharing, copayment,  and out-of-pocket costs. Most stakeholders also noted that beneficiaries  struggle to understand cost estimates and interpret how much they will  have to pay. CMS user testing of MPF in 2018 found that beneficiaries  were overwhelmed by the number and complexity of options from which  they had to choose.
