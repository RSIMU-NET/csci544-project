VHA's National Center for Patient Safety (NCPS) officials told GAO they were aware of the decrease, but were not certain why the number of completed RCAs had decreased over time, especially in light of a 7 percent increase in reports of adverse events over the same time period. NCPS officials suggested several potential factors that could contribute to the decrease, including VAMCs' use of processes other than RCAs to address adverse events. However, NCPS is unaware of how many VAMCs use these other processes or their results. VHA's lack of analysis is inconsistent with federal internal control standards which state that agencies should compare data to analyze relationships and take appropriate actions. Because NCPS has not conducted an analysis of the relationship between the decrease in RCAs and possible contributing factors, it is unclear whether the decrease indicates a negative trend in patient safety at VAMCs or a positive one.

Officials at one of  these VAMCs told us the reason they had completed fewer RCAs  was because the VAMC director supported the use of a Lean  method to understand and act on the root cause of an adverse  event when an RCA was not required. Officials at this VAMC also  told us that they thought their Lean method was sometimes more  appropriate for reviewing low-severity events because it yielded  similar results to an RCA and allowed for a broader, more  complete view of the issue being examined. NCPS officials told us  they support VAMCs\u2019 use of these alternative processes when  appropriate, but acknowledged loss of information as the results of  these processes are not required to be entered into WebSPOT, or  otherwise shared with NCPS.", "Increasing numbers of VAMCs conducting the minimum of   4 individual RCAs each fiscal year. NCPS officials told us they  were aware that by setting a requirement in 2007 that VAMCs  conduct a minimum of 4 individual RCAs each fiscal year, VAMCs  that had previously completed many more than 4 might decrease  the number of individual RCAs they completed over time. Our  analysis of RCA data shows that from fiscal years 2010 through  2014, the number of VAMCs completing more than 4 individual  RCAs declined by 8 percent (from 135 to 124 VAMCs). In  addition, the number of VAMCs completing exactly 4 individual  RCAs in this time period more than doubled, from 4 VAMCs in  fiscal year 2010 to 10 VAMCs in fiscal year 2014. All 10 of these  VAMCs completed more than 4 individual RCAs in fiscal year  2010, with totals ranging from 5 to 14 individual RCAs. Officials  stated that the selection of 4 individual RCAs as a minimum (as  well as the selection of 8 as a minimum total of individual and  aggregated RCAs), was arbitrary but seemed reasonable. They  expressed concern that raising the annual individual RCA  minimum requirement may result in lower-quality RCAs.", "Because NCPS has not conducted an analysis to understand the  relationship between the decrease in RCAs and possible contributing  factors, such as the increase in adverse event reports and use of  alternative processes, it is unclear whether the decrease indicates a  negative trend in patient safety at VAMCs or a positive one. For example,  the decrease can indicate a negative trend of VAMCs not reporting  severe adverse events that would require RCAs, or a positive trend  reflecting fewer severe adverse events occurring.

Not all initiatives  are based solely on RCAs, but officials told us that RCAs are a  contributing factor to NCPS\u2019s larger patient safety improvement efforts.  Officials told us that they focus their initiatives on problems that pose the  greatest risk to patients or are the most prevalent in VA\u2019s health care  system, such as suicide. Officials explained that their choice of which  initiative to pursue is determined by what will have the greatest impact on  a problem. Examples of NCPS\u2019s initiatives include Patient Safety Alerts  and Advisories, topic summaries, and Clinical Team Training.", "Patient Safety Alerts and Advisories. Patient Safety Alerts and  Advisories are urgent notifications sent to VAMCs that contain a  description of a safety issue, instructions for implementing actions  to prevent recurrence of the problem, and due dates for  completion of actions. NCPS officials told us that alerts and  advisories can come from several sources, including reports from  VAMCs, other VHA offices, and medical device manufacturers.  Patient Safety Alerts and Advisories are developed by NCPS and  then issued by the VHA Deputy Under Secretary for Health for  Operations and Management. For example, VHA issued a Patient  Safety Alert after a patient in a VAMC behavioral health unit  hanged himself from an air conditioning vent. The RCA team  recommended a structural change to the vents to prevent  recurrence, which VHA then required to be implemented at all  VAMCs. NCPS also tracks the date that VAMCs completed  implementation of actions. From fiscal year 2010 through fiscal  year 2014, NCPS has developed 57 alerts and 7 advisories.", "Topic summaries. Officials told us that NCPS may issue an RCA  topic summary if they identify a trend in adverse events or RCAs  in WebSPOT. An RCA topic summary provides background  context for the relevant adverse event, discusses root causes that  were identified through the RCAs conducted, and describes  corrective actions taken by VAMCs. For example, NCPS officials  told us that after their review of RCAs identified a trend in adverse  events caused by the misidentification of patients, they  determined that system-wide improvements were needed. NCPS  prepared topic summaries on misidentification related to  specimens and transporting patients, as well as a guidance  document on patient wristbands, which included best practices for  VAMCs. NCPS officials told us topic summaries are distributed to  VAMCs as part of the agenda for monthly conference calls that  NCPS conducts with patient safety staff at VAMCs and VISNs,  and that they are also made available through NCPS\u2019s internal  website and via e-mail. From fiscal year 2010 through fiscal year  2014, NCPS has issued 12 topic summaries.", "NCPS may also determine the need for a topic summary on the  basis of requests for WebSPOT searches from VAMC and VISN  patient safety staff interested in knowing whether RCAs have  been conducted for similar adverse events at other VAMCs.", "NCPS officials estimated that they conduct about 200 such  searches annually, and that these searches provide VAMC and  VISN staff with information on similar adverse events, such as the  corrective actions identified at other locations to address the  adverse event. According to officials, NCPS may determine  through these searches that several locations are encountering  similar patient safety issues, prompting the preparation of a topic  summary.", "Clinical Team Training.
