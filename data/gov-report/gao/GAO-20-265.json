Conducted Internal Assessments  In response to the service disruption, in early May 2017, the FCC CIO  initially stated that the cause was a cyberattack on the ECFS.  However, upon further assessment, FCC Information Technology  Center officials later determined that the disruption was caused by a  surge in comment traffic to the system and existing system  performance and capacity deficiencies.", "In response to multiple congressional inquiries, in late July 2017, FCC  Information Technology Center officials assessed the extent to which  malicious intent was involved in causing the disruption based on  whether: (a) internet protocol (IP) addresses from foreign sources  were present on the commission\u2019s network at the time of the May  2017 event; (b) comment submissions were denied (i.e., dropped)  from the commission\u2019s network, (c) observable botnet traffic was  present; and (d) duplicate comment submissions were accepted into  ECFS. The assessment concluded that the commission did not have  sufficient information and tools to determine whether there was any  malicious intent.  2. Deployed Additional Virtual Hardware", "Following the disruption, in early May 2017, FCC deployed additional  virtual hardware to address system performance issues and support  system stabilization efforts of ECFS during the period in which service  was disrupted.", "In early July 2017, the commission installed security sensors and  forwarding agents on the ECFS virtual servers. These devices are  intended to provide additional layers of security capability for the  system.", "In mid-July 2017, FCC automated the process for deploying virtual  hardware resources to support system availability subsequent to the  May 2017 service disruption.  3. Optimized and Acquired System Software", "From late May 2017 to early June 2017, FCC acquired a diagnostic  tool to measure system performance. According to the commission,  this tool is used to determine the maximum amount of simultaneous  user capacity within ECFS during periods of high web traffic.", "In early June 2017, the commission optimized the search functionality  within the ECFS database to reduce the system response time.", "In mid-June 2017, FCC removed redundant internal processes for  ECFS web requests to increase the responsiveness of the system.", "During late July 2017, the commission acquired a security information  and event management tool to collect and analyze security-related  events that may indicate a cybersecurity incident.", "In late August 2017, FCC established rate control limits within ECFS  to safeguard against potential distributed denial-of-service attacks  aiming to flood one target with network traffic.  4. Updated Incident Response Policy and Procedures  In January 2018 and March 2018, during its annual policy review,  FCC Information Technology Center officials updated the  commission\u2019s incident response and reporting policy and procedures  to incorporate lessons learned from the May 2017 ECFS service  disruption and clarify their processes. For example, FCC Information  Technology Center officials revised the commission\u2019s incident  response procedures to document internal escalation time frames for  notifying management of potential security incidents and reporting the  incidents to the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team  within 1 hour of identification of an incident.", "Figure 2 shows a chronological sequence of the hardware and software  improvements that FCC officials implemented after the May 2017 event.", "FCC provided evidence that indicated its actions to add additional  hardware and software resources increased ECFS\u2019s capacity and  performance and demonstrated that the system was stable from June  2017 through December 2017. For example, FCC acquired a  performance diagnostic tool in late May 2017, which was designed to  determine the maximum number of potential simultaneous public users  within ECFS during periods of high web traffic. Using the diagnostic tool,  FCC Information Technology Center officials determined in June 2017,  that the system became unstable when the number of simultaneous  simulated public users reached 500. However, by December 2017, the  system had demonstrated that it could accept a capacity of over 3,000  simultaneous public users without a service disruption.", "FCC data showed that the increased capacity and improved performance  of the ECFS prevented further service disruptions during periods of sharp  spikes in the volume of comments received. For example, on May 8,  2017, service was disrupted on the system when it received a peak of  about 249,000 comments in 1 day, whereas on July 12, 2017, the system  accepted and processed at least 1.4 million comments in 1 day without a  reported service disruption. Similar spikes in traffic volumes that occurred  through December 2017 also did not result in service disruptions.
