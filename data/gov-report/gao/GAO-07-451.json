Moreover, when an enterprise architecture is  employed in concert with other important management controls, such as  portfolio-based capital planning and investment control practices,  architectures can greatly increase the chances that an organization\u2019s  operational and IT environments will be configured to optimize mission  performance. Our experience with federal agencies has shown that  investing in IT without defining these investments in the context of an  architecture often results in systems that are duplicative, not well  integrated, and unnecessarily costly to maintain and interface.", "One approach to structuring an enterprise architecture is referred to as a  federated enterprise architecture. Such a structure treats the architecture  as a family of coherent but distinct member architectures that conform to  an overarching architectural view and rule set. This approach recognizes  that each member of the federation has unique goals and needs as well as  common roles and responsibilities with the levels above and below it.  Under a federated approach, member architectures are substantially  autonomous, although they also inherit certain rules, policies, procedures,  and services from higher-level architectures. As such, a federated  architecture enables component organization autonomy, while ensuring  enterprisewide linkages and alignment where appropriate. Where  commonality among components exists, there are also opportunities for  identifying and leveraging shared services.", "A service-oriented architecture (SOA) is an approach for sharing business  capabilities across the enterprise by designing functions and applications  as discrete, reusable, and business-oriented services. As such, service  orientation permits sharing capabilities that may be under the control of  different component organizations.

According to the strategy, this environment will build on existing  Enterprise Information Environment Mission Area capabilities and provide  the standards, policies, and technology needed to permit BMA services to  be shared with the other DOD mission areas.", "However, the strategy does not describe how this will be accomplished,  including respective roles and responsibilities of those involved, the range  of services to be shared and developed, and the standards to be used.  Moreover, component officials told us that the details behind the strategy\u2019s  SOA concepts need to be defined before a systems view federation can be  achieved. More specifically:    The strategy does not clearly describe how interoperable services will be  defined, developed, exposed, and subscribed to. For example, it does not  delineate the specific roles and responsibilities of the military departments  and defense agencies relative to defining, providing, and employing shared  systems and applications. As a result, the military departments and  defense agencies may pursue duplicative efforts. This is of particular  concern due to the various service orientation activities already under way  in the military departments and defense agencies. For example, the Air  Force has chartered a Transparency Integrated Product Team to guide  their SOA initiatives, and the Navy has established a Transformation  Group to support its service orientation activities. This is important  because a key aspect of the BMA federation strategy is reusing and  leveraging both enterprise-level and component-level systems and  applications.", "The strategy does not relate system federation activities and capabilities to  its existing ETP. In particular, while the strategy describes a number of  \u201cleave-in-place\u201d pilots (systems and applications) that will be implemented  during the next year to demonstrate the use of shared services, it does not  describe how these relate to programs in the ETP. This is important  because the chief technical officer told us that many of the enterprise-level  programs being managed by the BTA and included in the ETP are to  evolve into shared services.", "The strategy does not describe how interface standards will be established  and used for obtaining and delivering shared services. Defining and  enforcing such standards are important aspects of having services that are  interoperable and reusable. According to the BTA chief technical officer,  these standards will need to align with the yet-to-be-issued Enterprise  Information Environment Mission Area standards. Officials from the Air  Force and DISA agreed that more needs to be done to define the  infrastructure standards that will enable user subscription to reusable  systems and applications, particularly since the military departments and  DOD are moving ahead with their own SOA initiatives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Strategy Does Not Include Milestones", "paragraphs": ["The strategy outlines what it refers to as a high-level road map by listing  activities, capabilities, products, and services that are to be produced. (See  table 2 for this high-level road map.)", "However, the strategy does not specify the milestones or provide specific  completion dates for the activities and related capabilities, products, and  services listed in its high-level road map. Instead, the strategy states that  the road map began in October 2006 and that milestones will occur at  approximately 3-month increments, without identifying, for example,  which steps have begun and what is to be accomplished over 3 months for  each of the steps."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["DOD is in the early, formative stage of federating its BEA, with much  remaining to be decided and accomplished before it achieves its goals.  While the goals, concepts, and related activities; capabilities; products;  and services discussed in the strategy have merit and hold promise, the  strategy lacks sufficient specificity for it to be executed and, therefore,  must be viewed as a beginning. To the department\u2019s credit, it recognizes  the need for greater detail surrounding how it will extend (federate) its  BEA. One key to making this happen is for the department to implement  our prior recommendation for having a BEA development management  plan. However, the department has yet to address this recommendation.  Until it does, the likelihood of effectively extending the BEA to include the  military departments and defense agencies is greatly reduced."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To further assist the department in evolving its BEA, we are reiterating our  prior recommendation for a BEA development management plan, and  augmenting it by recommending that the Secretary of Defense direct the  Deputy Secretary of Defense, as the chair of the DBSMC, to task the  appropriate DOD organizations, to ensure that this plan describes, at a  minimum, how the BMA architecture federation will be governed; how the  BMA federation strategy alignment with the DOD EA federation strategy  will be achieved; how component business architectures\u2019 alignment with  incremental versions of the BEA will be achieved; how shared services  will be identified, exposed, and subscribed to; and what milestones will be  used to measure progress and results."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In written comments on a draft of this report, signed by the DOD Deputy  Chief Information Officer and the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense  (Business Transformation) and reprinted in appendix II, the department  stated that it largely disagrees with our recommendation and added that  while the BMA played a leading role in defining the department\u2019s approach  to architecture federation and a service-oriented architecture, the impact  of the issues discussed in this report goes beyond the scope of the  business systems modernization. DOD also stated that any analysis of  architecture federation should begin with the department\u2019s approach and  not the BMA, since the BMA federation strategy was written as an  addendum to an enterprise approach. However, DOD added that it  recognizes that our analysis was complicated by the fact that many of the  enterprise-level strategy and governance documents, to which the BMA  must comply, have yet to be issued.", "The department also made the following specific comments on the five  elements in our recommendation.", "First, DOD stated that it partially concurs with the element relating to  architecture federation. According to DOD, responsibility for developing  the policy and guidance regarding how architectures are to be managed  within its federated environment lies with the ASD(NII)/CIO; officials  acknowledge the current lack of such guidance and stated that this will be  addressed with the issuance of the DOD EA federation strategy. As such,  the department recommends that we address our recommendation to  ASD(NII)/CIO. We agree on the current lack of and the need to develop  policies and guidance describing how the federation will be governed;  however, our recommendation is not intended to dictate who should  develop the policies or guidance for managing architectures within a  federated environment. Rather, it is focused on developing plans that  describe how the BMA will adopt and implement the policies and guidance  relating to federation governance.", "Second, the department stated that it nonconcurs with the element  relating to ensuring alignment with other federation strategies. According  to DOD, there is a single architecture federation strategy for the  department\u2014the DOD EA federation strategy\u2014and other architecture  federation strategies supplement this overarching strategy. As such, it  stated that this element of our recommendation is not needed. We  disagree. While we do not question the department\u2019s comment about the  relationships among the strategies, we believe that this element of our  recommendation is needed because its intent is to recognize these  relationships by promoting collaboration and ensuring linkages among the  various strategies.", "Third, DOD stated that it nonconcurs with the element relating to  component architecture alignment with incremental versions of the BEA.  According to DOD, this element has been implemented both in policy and  execution to comply with legislative requirements, to include DOD\u2019s  development and use of the Architecture Compliance and Requirements  Traceability tool. It also added that the Departments of the Air Force,  Army, and Navy have mandated the use of this tool to assess compliance  of their systems and architectures with the BEA. We disagree. The  National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005 includes a  requirement for ensuring that all business systems in excess of $1 million  be certified as being in compliance with the BEA; the architecture  traceability tool provides a mechanism for asserting only system  compliance and not component architecture compliance. In addition,  according to officials from the Air Force and Army, while they are  encouraging the use of the tool for assessing compliance of their systems  with the BEA, they have not mandated its use and are not using it to assess  compliance of their architectures with the BEA. Moreover, officials from  the Air Force further stated that they have not mandated the use of this  tool because it does not provide the capability to map the Air Force  architecture with the BEA. While we recognize DOD\u2019s efforts to align  programs to the BEA, our recommendation focuses on the lack of a  discussion in the BMA federation strategy on how component  architectures (military departments and defense agencies) will be linked  to the BEA, including the lack of component architecture alignment  guidance, criteria, and tools.", "Fourth, the department stated that it partially concurs with the element  relating to the identification and management of shared services.  According to DOD, each mission area or component is responsible for  identifying its own services requirements, and the ASD(NII)/CIO is  responsible for defining the overall approach to how these services will be  managed. As such, the department recommends that our recommendation  be directed to the ASD(NII)/CIO. We agree on the need for guidance  describing how shared services will be identified and managed; however,  our recommendation is not intended to dictate who should develop the  policies or guidance for managing shared services within a federated  environment. Rather, it is focused on developing plans that describe how  the BMA will adopt and implement the policies and guidance relating to  service orientation. As stated in the report, this is important because a key  aspect of the BMA federation strategy is to reuse and leverage both  enterprise-level and component-level systems and applications.", "Fifth, DOD stated that it nonconcurs with the element relating to  milestones. According to DOD, milestones for gauging progress are and  will continue to be monitored in the department\u2019s enterprise transition  plan. As such, it stated that it is unclear how the need to describe what  milestones will be used relates to the topics in the report. While we have  previously recognized that the transition plan provides information on  progress on major investments over the last 6 months\u2014including key  accomplishments and milestones attained, this element of our  recommendation is intended to address the lack of measures (e.g., return  on investment of service-oriented architecture service reuse) or specific  completion dates for the activities and related capabilities, products, and  services that are to be produced for federating the Business Mission Area.", "To further ensure that our recommendation is properly interpreted and  implemented, and to address DOD\u2019s comments about directing the  recommendation to the appropriate parties, we have slightly modified our  recommendation.", "We are sending copies of this report to interested congressional  committees; the Director, Office of Management and Budget; the Secretary  of Defense; the Deputy Secretary of Defense; the Under Secretary of  Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics; the Under Secretary of  Defense (Comptroller); the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Networks and  Information Integration)/Chief Information Officer; the Under Secretary of  Defense (Personnel and Readiness); and the Director, Defense Finance  and Accounting Service.
