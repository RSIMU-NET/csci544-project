To gain an understanding of what today's workers might expect to receive in terms of retirement income, GAO was asked to examine (1) how the personal wealth of Baby Boom (born between 1946 and 1964) and Generation X (born between 1965 and 1976) workers compare with what current retirees had at similar ages, (2) how workers from the Baby Boom and Generation X compare in terms of the pension and Social Security benefits they can expect to receive, and (3) the likely distribution of pension and Social Security benefits across workers within the Baby Boom and Generation X."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Baby Boom and Generation X households headed by an individual aged 25 to 34 have greater accumulated assets, adjusted for inflation, than current retirees had when they were the same age, but also more debt. Most of the large increase in assets between current retirees and the Baby Boom is due to increased ownership and equity in housing. Contributions to defined contribution pension plans play a role in explaining the modest increase in assets between the Baby Boom and Generation X, in part, because GAO's data do not allow it to consider the value of benefits from defined benefit pension plans. Workers from Generation X are estimated to have similar levels of retirement income in real terms (adjusted for inflation) at age 62 as their counterparts in the Baby Boom, but Generation X may be able to replace a smaller percentage of their pre-retirement income. Whether Social Security benefits for Generation X are higher or lower than those for the Baby Boom will depend on how the Social Security funding shortfall is resolved. With regard to pensions, Generation X and the Baby Boom are estimated to have similar levels of pension income even with a continued shift from defined benefit to defined contribution pension coverage. Retirement income will vary within both Generation X and the Baby Boom households, and certain groups will be more likely to have lower retirement incomes. As one might expect, given significant variation in workers' earnings, if households were arrayed from lowest to highest in terms of estimated total retirement income, those in the top 20 percent would receive a substantially larger proportion of income compared with those in the bottom 20 percent. Retirement income is lower for the less educated and single women."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Today\u2019s workers will rely to a large extent on Social Security, private  pensions, and personal wealth for their retirement income. But some  analysts question whether these sources will provide sufficient retirement  income to maintain workers\u2019 standards of living once they leave the labor  force. Indeed, the Social Security trust funds are projected to become  exhausted in 2042, at which time, unless action is taken, Social Security  will not be able to pay scheduled benefits in full. Pension coverage has  remained at about 50 percent of the workforce for decades while the  composition of that coverage has shifted from defined benefit (DB) plans  to defined contribution (DC) plans. As a result of this shift, an increasing  share of the responsibility for providing for one\u2019s retirement income has  shifted from the employer to the employee. Finally, workers today are  saving a smaller proportion of their incomes than earlier generations did.  Yet, if current workers are to maintain their standards of living and meet  increasing health care costs in retirement, they need to save more.", "These trends suggest that today\u2019s younger workers might reach retirement  unable to maintain the standards of living they had achieved while  working. Additionally, there may be a greater strain on retirement assets if  younger workers spend more years in retirement due to greater life  expectancy. To gain an understanding of what today\u2019s workers might  expect to receive in terms of retirement income, you asked us to examine  (1) how the wealth of Baby Boom and Generation X workers compares  with what current retirees (pre-Baby Boom generation) had as young  adults, (2) how workers from the Baby Boom and Generation X compare  in terms of the pension and Social Security benefits they can expect to  receive, and (3) the likely distribution of pension benefits and Social  Security benefits for all workers within the Baby Boom and Generation X.  The Baby Boom generation includes those born between 1946 and 1964,  Generation X includes those born between 1965 and 1976, and we define  the Pre-Baby Boom generation as those born between 1925 and 1945.", "To compare wealth across all three generations, we used the Federal  Reserve Board\u2019s Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF), a nationally  representative database containing detailed information on assets and  debt, and compared the ownership and median levels of different types of  assets and debt for 25- to 34-year olds in each generation. We selected this  age group because it is important to compare each of the generations at  the same life-cycle stage and this is the only age group for which we have  data on wealth for all three generations. This comparison enabled us to  assess the extent to which the Baby Boom and Generation X have been  able to accumulate wealth, some or all of which can be used to finance  consumption in retirement. However, our wealth measure does not  include the future values of Social Security or pensions. Therefore, to  complement our analysis of the younger generations\u2019 wealth, we simulated  future retirement income for the Baby Boom and Generation X. To  illustrate the levels and distribution of retirement income that current  workers can expect to receive at age 62, we used the Policy Simulation  Group\u2019s (PSG) models to simulate some components of retirement  income\u2014Social Security benefits, pension income, and the earnings of  spouses not yet retired. Under contract to us, the PSG used Pension  Simulator (PENSIM) to estimate pension benefits and Genuine  Microsimulation of Social Security and Accounts (GEMINI) to estimate  Social Security benefits for two illustrative birth cohorts\u2014Baby Boomers  born in 1955 and Generation Xers born in 1970. These simulations are  based on the Social Security Trustees\u2019 2001 intermediate economic and  actuarial assumptions. While our simulations provide estimates of future  retirement income, there is a considerable amount of uncertainty involved  with these estimates. Since these estimates could change significantly,  depending on assumptions used and behavioral responses, they should not  be considered predictions.", "In order to bound our estimates of retirement income, we considered  different scenarios for Social Security and pensions. We used two  scenarios for estimating Social Security benefits: (1) scheduled benefits  are paid and (2) funded benefits are paid. We also considered two  scenarios for pension benefits, one assuming that both the Baby Boom and  Generation X had the same DB and DC pension plan coverage and the  other that Generation X workers with pensions had only DC pensions. We  compared the two younger generations under these various scenarios  because the retirement income of these younger generations will be  affected by policy decisions on Social Security and pensions. Changes in  Social Security and pension benefits, in turn, will affect the amount that  the Baby Boom and Generation X need to save.", "We conducted our work between April 2002 and April 2003 in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards. A more detailed  discussion of our scope and methodology appears in appendix I."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Retirement income in the United States includes Social Security benefits,  asset income, pension benefits, and earnings. Over the last 40 years,  receipt of Social Security has become almost universal while receipt of  asset income has increased modestly, receipt of private pensions has  tripled, and receipt of government pensions has increased by 50 percent.  However, a smaller proportion of aged households received earnings in  2000 than in 1962. (See fig. 1.) All of these components of retirement  income have been affected by the major regulatory, labor market, and  demographic changes that have taken place in the last 40 years.", "Legislative changes have expanded the pension and personal saving  options available to workers. The Employee Retirement Income Security  Act (ERISA) of 1974 provided certain minimum standards and broad new  protections of employee benefits plans, including provisions for individual  retirement accounts (IRA). Subsequent legislation revised some provisions  of ERISA, further expanding the possibilities for workers to have access to  pension income in retirement and established new types of employer- sponsored pension plans, such as 401(k) plans.", "Legislative changes have also focused on the financing problems of Social  Security. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, legislative action regarding  Social Security attempted to solve this financing problem by raising taxes,  curtailing future benefits, raising the retirement age, and trying to increase  work incentives. However, the financing of future Social Security benefits  is still an issue, and further action will need to be taken to either increase  the program\u2019s revenues, decrease its expenditures, or both.", "The labor market conditions facing young workers today differ  significantly from those facing earlier generations of workers. Changes in  earnings, women\u2019s labor force participation, and pension coverage over  the last 40 years have altered the context within which workers save for  retirement. Real earnings increased throughout the 1960s, slowed  considerably in the 1970s, remained relatively stagnant during the 1980s  and much of the 1990s, and may have started to rise in the late 1990s. For  some groups of workers, such as production or nonsupervisory workers,  average weekly earnings adjusted for inflation declined over most of the  time period following the early 1970s. (See fig. 2.) For young workers  facing stagnant or declining real earnings, saving for retirement might have  become more difficult than it was for those who entered the labor market  when real earnings were growing.", "In addition, over the last 40 years, more women have entered the labor  force. They entered regardless of their marital status\u2014the labor force  participation rates of married women, for example, increased from   32 percent in 1960 to 61 percent in 1999. (See fig. 3.) This means a larger  share of women in younger cohorts is working and likely to qualify for  Social Security and pensions based on their own earnings. This also means  an increase in the share of married couple households that have two  earners, which could increase the potential for household retirement  saving.", "The composition of pension coverage also changed during this period. The  estimated share of private wage and salary workers participating in a DB  plan as their primary pension plan declined from 39 percent in 1975 to   21 percent in 1997, while the share participating in a DC plan as their  primary pension plan increased from 6 percent to 25 percent. (See fig. 4.)  The decline in DB pension plan coverage and the increase in DC pension  plan coverage over the past 3 decades means that more of the  responsibility for retirement saving has shifted to individual workers from  employers.", "Demographic changes over the last 40 years have also altered the  circumstances of workers as they save for retirement. Educational  attainment, for example, has increased over time. In 1960, only about   8 percent of the population 25 years of age and older had a college degree.  By 1999, 25 percent of the population 25 years or older were college  graduates. (See fig. 5.) The increase in educational attainment over time  could facilitate increased saving among those younger workers who attain  higher education. The composition of households has also changed over  this period with the share of households headed by a married couple  decreasing. In 1960, 74 percent of all households were comprised of  married couple families. By 1999 this had fallen to 53 percent. At the same  time, the percentage of one-person households increased from 13 percent  to 26 percent of all households. (See fig. 6.) Median incomes are typically  lower for families headed by a single female or for single person  households. In addition, life expectancy has increased across the  generations. The greater life expectancy of the younger generations could  mean that the retirement income of the Baby Boom and Generation X  would need to support a larger number of years.", "The retirement security of today\u2019s workers will also be affected by  changes in the cost and provision of health care. Over the last 40 years, the  provision of health benefits has become more expensive for employers as  generous benefits have combined with higher utilization rates, a growing  elderly population, and a rapidly increasing cost of service. In response to  these increased costs, many employers have begun to limit the health  benefits provided, either by terminating their plans, restricting benefits, or  reducing their share of the premium. As a result, future retirees are likely  to pay more of the costs of their health care. Consequently, today\u2019s  workers might have to work longer, save more, or both, to ensure  sufficient access to health benefits. In addition to paying more for  privately sponsored health benefits, today\u2019s current workers might also  pay more in retirement for Medicare. Medicare costs are continuing to rise  with the result that either benefits will have to be reduced or monthly  premiums will have to be increased.", "Given all these demographic changes, as well as regulatory and economic  changes, analysis of retirement income is increasingly dependent on good  estimates, which in turn require adequate data. In a recent report on  needed improvements in retirement income data, we identified data  improvements that experts say are a priority for the study of retirement  income. In particular, experts cited data from employers on employee  benefits, as well as linkages between individual and household surveys  and administrative data, as being helpful for estimating future retirement  income."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Baby Boom and Generation X Workers Have More Assets and More Debt Than Current Retirees Had at Similar Ages", "paragraphs": ["Baby Boom and Generation X households headed by individuals aged 25 to  34 have greater accumulated assets, adjusted for inflation, than current  retirees had when they were the same age but they also have more debt.

Yet, for most  young Baby Boom and Generation X households, assets exceed debts and  the net worth of these households with positive net worth is 60 percent  greater than that of current retirees at similar ages. However, particularly  for Generation X, greater life expectancy may require more assets to cover  more years in retirement and greater assets may also be required to  support higher standards of living.

While our analysis  indicates that asset levels increase across the generations, it does not take  into account the expectation of rising standards of living. Generation X,  for example, could have greater assets than those of previous generations  and still feel that these assets are insufficient for the lifestyle they want or  expect.", "For households headed by a 25- to 34-year old, the increase in assets  across the generations can be attributed mainly to housing and DC  retirement accounts. (See fig. 7.) As we have noted, our measure of assets  does not include the value of benefits from DB pension plans and, to the  extent that a larger percentage of the Pre-Baby Boom and the Baby Boom  than Generation X is covered by DB plans, will underestimate the true  value of assets for the Pre-Baby Boom and the Baby Boom relative to  Generation X. The large increase in total asset accumulation between the  Pre-Baby Boom and the Baby Boom is largely due to increases in home  equity and increases in the rate of home ownership. The median value of  housing assets increased from $72,890 for the Pre-Baby Boom to $78,583  for the Baby Boom, while the percentage of households owning their own  home increased from 39 to 45 percent. The modest increase in total asset  accumulation between the Baby Boom and Generation X can be  accounted for in large part by the increase in the ownership and value of  retirement accounts. The median value of DC retirement accounts  increased from $2,947 for the Baby Boom to $8,003 for Generation X, while  the percentage of households with retirement accounts increased from   20 percent to 46 percent. The increased percentage of households with  retirement accounts reflects changes in the types of pension plans offered  by employers. Between 1983 and 1997, the percentage of workers covered  by primary DC pension plans, under which the worker has a retirement  account, increased from 11 percent to 25 percent while the percentage of  workers covered by DB pension plans declined from 35 percent to 21  percent.", "Financial and nonfinancial assets contribute only modestly to the increase  in total assets across the generations.

The median value of financial assets varies between less than $2,000 for  the Pre-Baby Boom generation and $4,000 for the Baby Boom. A greater  percentage of households in the younger cohorts have financial assets  than was the case for current retirees. The median value of nonfinancial  assets is greater than that for financial assets in each of the generations  and has increased across the cohorts.

Individuals have control over some  of these factors. For example, they can determine how much education  they receive, how long they work, whether both spouses in a couple work,  how much they save while they are working, and whether they stay  married or get divorced. On the other hand, individuals have no direct  control over the rate of growth of real wages, the performance of the  overall economy, the rate of return on financial assets, changes in housing  prices, shifts in pension coverage and generosity of benefits, the state of  the health care system, changes in life expectancy, and the resolution to  the funding shortfall for Social Security and Medicare. One of the  resolutions to the funding shortfall for both Social Security and Medicare  is to increase the payroll tax that employees and employers pay. An  increase in the payroll tax, of course, reduces the amount of an  individual\u2019s disposable income available to both consume and save. On the  other hand, if individuals expected Social Security benefits to be reduced,  they might increase their personal saving in order to offset this reduction  in benefits.

Our analysis also indicates that across the generations, similar  subgroups of the population are most vulnerable in retirement.", "The levels of retirement income that Baby Boom and Generation X  workers will actually receive depend in part upon their own behavior,  such as how long they work or how much they save, and in part upon  factors they cannot control, such as the performance of the overall  economy, the rate of return on financial investments, and changes in  Social Security and health care financing. Individuals\u2019 behavior, and future  economic events, may vary significantly from the assumptions underlying  our models, especially for those workers who still have many years to  work before retirement. In addition, estimates of future retirement income  depend on adequate data on individuals\u2019 earnings, wealth, and pensions,  not all of which are easily captured in existing data sets. Further, rising  expectations about consumption, leisure and health care in retirement  (and the costs of meeting these expectations) could require higher  replacement rates for Generation X than for the Baby Boom in order to  maintain the standards of living they achieved while working.", "Government policy can potentially have an important effect on individuals\u2019  retirement income. Policies that encourage individuals to acquire more  education and training, to work longer and to save more can help ensure  higher retirement incomes in the future. Also, any reform that  policymakers undertake with regard to the Social Security program or  health care financing will have repercussions for the retirement income of  Generation X and the younger half of the Baby Boom. Our work suggests  the importance of all these policy actions reflecting a coordinated  approach to future retirement income, and that they be made soon enough  so the affected individuals will have adequate time to adjust their work  and saving behavior accordingly. Finally, the continued vulnerability of  certain segments of the population to inadequate resources at retirement  suggests that successful retirement income policies would take potential  impacts on these groups into consideration."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to SSA, Labor, and Treasury.

The SCF has more detailed information about wealth  holding, better distributional characteristics, less item nonresponse, and  fewer imputed variables than the PSID or the SIPP. However, the SCF,  like all surveys, is subject to sampling errors, reporting errors, and  nonresponse errors. Sampling errors result from the fact that survey  estimates are based on a sample of the population rather than on a  complete census of the population. Reporting errors arise because  respondents may not understand what is wanted, may not know the  information requested, or may be reluctant to reveal their actual income or  wealth. Nonresponse errors arise when the family selected for  participation is not available to be interviewed, either because they refuse  to participate or cannot be contacted.", "Further, the sample sizes for the SCF are relatively small compared with  surveys such as the Current Population Survey.

A primary limitation of our analysis is that  our simulations do not include important components of retirement  income such as personal savings, earnings in retirement, health benefits,  and other public assistance programs such as SSI. Including personal  savings might reduce retirement income for Generation X relative to  retirement income for the Baby Boom if the post-1980 decline in personal  savings rates continues. Including earnings in retirement might increase  Generation X\u2019s retirement income relative to the Boomers income if wages  increase over time or if people in the future are more likely to work in  retirement. From a distributional perspective, including personal savings  would probably increase the upper quintile\u2019s share of retirement income  while including public assistance programs such as SSI would benefit the  bottom of the distribution. Another component of well-being in retirement  that we do not estimate are private and public health benefits. Including  health benefits might reduce Generation X\u2019s standard of living in  retirement relative to the Baby Boom due to falling health benefits and  rising health care costs over time  An important assumption driving our results is that real wages grow over  time. We assume real wages grow at 1.0 percent per year, following the  2001 Social Security Trustees Report\u2019s intermediate assumption. If,  instead, wages stagnate as in the 1980s and 1990s, then retirement income  for Generation X relative to retirement income for the Baby Boom might  be lower than our estimates.", "Another critical assumption is the relative rate of DB and DC pension  coverage. Over the last 25 years pension coverage has been shifting from  DB to DC pensions. However, due to the uncertainty in predicting future  relative coverage rates, our simulations either assume a constant rate of  DB and DC coverage over time or only DC coverage for Generation X. The  likely outcome is somewhere in between.", "An important omission under the scheduled Social Security benefit  scenario is the impact of higher taxes or general revenue transfers on  other sources of retirement income. Increased taxes or general revenue  transfers will most likely be necessary to pay Social Security benefits as  scheduled under current law. Tax increases might reduce saving for  retirement and general revenue transfers might reduce funding for other  government retirement programs such as SSI, Medicare, or Medicaid. The  impact of tax increases may be larger for Generation X than for the Baby  Boom because they will pay higher taxes for more years.", "Another limitation is the sensitivity of estimated DC benefits to our  assumptions about future rates of return. We assume individuals\u2019 rates of  returns vary randomly around average rates projected by the Office of the  Chief Actuary at SSA. If average rates of return in the future are  significantly different, then actual DC benefits could differ substantially  from our simulations. While the model allows returns to vary  stochastically by individuals, it cannot capture fluctuations in overall  market rates of return. An ill timed stock market downturn could result in  either generation\u2019s DC benefits being significantly lower than simulated.  Retirement income for Generation X could be more sensitive to future  rates of return than retirement income for the Baby Boom, if the trend  toward DC pensions continues.", "Another limiting assumption is that our simulations only include one kind  of DB and DC plan, which clearly does not capture the full complexity of  pension plans. We attempted to choose the characteristics of each to be  typical of today\u2019s pension plans. If they are not truly representative or if  the characteristics of DB and DC plans change over time, then our results  could be biased. In particular, the finding that the shift to DC plans only  has a very modest effect on pension benefits may depend on our choice of  plans.", "While educational attainment has been increasing over time, this is not  captured by the simulations. Both generations are assumed to achieve the  same level of education as 35- to 44-year olds in the 1997 Current  Population Survey. Higher levels of education for Generation X could  increase their retirement income relative to the Baby Boom.", "From a distributional perspective, the simulations are limited, in that they  do not capture differences across the generations in the variation of  earnings. By some measures, earnings disparity has been increasing over  the last 20 years, which could potentially lead to more variation in  retirement income for Generation X.", "The simulations assume the same cohort life expectancies as the 2001  Social Security Trustees Report\u2019s intermediate cost projection.

Assumed life expectancies may be too low, as  some have argued that the Trustees underestimate future improvements in  mortality rates. Increased life expectancies would reduce DC benefits in  our simulations because retirees would have to pay higher prices when  annuitizing their retirement accounts.", "Our simulations of retirement income do not take taxation into account.  Incorporating taxes would not only lower disposable income, but would  also reduce variation in income because federal tax rates are progressive  and because only relatively higher income households are required to pay  tax on their Social Security benefits.", "Finally, we are only able to simulate retirement income for two illustrative  birth cohorts as opposed to entire generations.
