Through our prior work, we have identified critical success factors and other key management issues that DHS should consider as it establishes systems and processes to facilitate information sharing among and between government entities and the private sector. These success factors include establishing trust relationships with a wide variety of federal and nonfederal entities that may be in a position to provide potentially useful information and advice on vulnerabilities and incidents. Further, as part of its information technology management, DHS should continue to develop and implement an enterprise architecture to integrate the many existing systems and processes required to support its mission and to guide the department's investments in new systems to effectively support homeland security in the coming years.

In addition, terrorists are gaining expertise in less  traditional means, such as cyber attacks. In response to these growing  threats, Congress passed and the President signed the Homeland Security  Act of 2002 creating the DHS.

Over the last decade, physical and cyber  events, as well as related analyses by various entities, have demonstrated  the increasing threat to the United States.", "With the coordinated terrorist attacks against the World Trade Center in  New York City and the Pentagon in Washington, D.C., on September 11,  2001, the threat of terrorism rose to the top of the country\u2019s national  security and law enforcement agendas. Even before these catastrophic  incidents, the threat of attacks against people, property, and  infrastructures had increased concerns about terrorism. The terrorist  bombings in 1993 of the World Trade Center in New York City and in 1995  of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, which killed  168 people and wounded hundreds of others, prompted increased  emphasis on the need to strengthen and coordinate the federal  government\u2019s ability to effectively combat terrorism domestically. The  1995 Aum Shinrikyo sarin nerve agent attack in the Tokyo subway system  also raised new concerns about U.S. preparedness to combat terrorist  incidents involving weapons of mass destruction. However, as clearly  demonstrated by the September 11, 2001, incidents, a terrorist attack  would not have to fit the definition of weapons of mass destruction to  result in mass casualties, destruction of critical infrastructures, economic  losses, and disruption of daily life nationwide.", "U.S. intelligence and law enforcement communities continuously assess  both foreign and domestic terrorist threats to the United States. Table 1  summarizes key physical threats to homeland security.", "In addition to these physical threats, terrorists and others with malicious  intent, such as transnational criminals and intelligence services, pose a  threat to our nation\u2019s computer systems. As dramatic increases in  computer interconnectivity, especially in the use of the Internet, continue  to revolutionize the way much of the world communicate and conducts  business, this widespread interconnectivity also poses significant risks to  the government\u2019s and our nation\u2019s computer systems and, more  importantly, to the critical operations and infrastructures they support.  For example, telecommunications, power distribution, water supply,  public health services, national defense (including the military\u2019s  warfighting capability), law enforcement, government services, and  emergency services all depend on the security of their computer  operations. If not properly controlled, the speed and accessibility that  create the enormous benefits of the computer age also allow individuals  and organizations to inexpensively eavesdrop on or interfere with these  operations from remote locations for mischievous or malicious purposes.", "Government officials are increasingly concerned about cyber attacks from  individuals and groups with malicious intent, such as crime, terrorism,  foreign intelligence gathering, and acts of war. According to the FBI,  terrorists, transnational criminals, and intelligence services are quickly  becoming aware of and are using information exploitation tools such as  computer viruses, Trojan horses, worms, logic bombs, and eavesdropping  sniffers that can destroy, intercept, degrade the integrity of, or deny access  to data. In addition, the disgruntled organization insider is a significant  threat, since these individuals often have knowledge that allows them to  gain unrestricted access and inflict damage or steal assets without  possessing a great deal of knowledge about computer intrusions. As  greater amounts of money are transferred through computer systems, as  more sensitive economic and commercial information is exchanged  electronically, and as the nation\u2019s defense and intelligence communities  increasingly rely on commercially available IT, the likelihood increases  that cyber attacks will threaten vital national interests. Table 2 summarizes  the key cyber threats to our infrastructure.", "As the number of individuals with computer skills has increased, more  intrusion or \u201chacking\u201d tools have become readily available and relatively  easy to use. A hacker can literally download tools from the Internet and  \u201cpoint and click\u201d to start an attack. Experts also agree that there has been  a steady advance in the sophistication and effectiveness of attack  technology. Intruders quickly develop attacks to exploit vulnerabilities  discovered in products, use these attacks to compromise computers, and  share them with other attackers. In addition, they can combine these  attacks with other forms of technology to develop programs that  automatically scan the network for vulnerable systems, attack them,  compromise them, and use them to spread the attack even further.", "Along with these increasing threats, the number of computer security  incidents reported to the CERT\u00ae Coordination Center has also risen  dramatically from just under 10,000 in 1999 to about 82,000 in 2002, and to  over 76,000 for the first and second quarters of 2003. And these are only  the reported attacks. The Director of CERT Centers stated that he  estimates that as much as 80 percent of actual security incidents goes  unreported, in most cases because (1) the organization was unable to  recognize that its systems had been penetrated or there were no  indications of penetration or attack or (2) the organization was reluctant  to report. Figure 1 shows the number of incidents reported to the CERT  Coordination Center from 1995 through the first half of 2003.", "According to the National Security Agency, foreign governments already  have or are developing computer attack capabilities, and potential  adversaries are developing a body of knowledge about U.S. systems and  methods to attack these systems. Since the terrorist attacks of September  11, 2001, warnings of the potential for terrorist cyber attacks against our  critical infrastructures have also increased. For example, in February 2002,  the threat to these infrastructures was highlighted by the Special Advisor  to the President for Cyberspace Security in a Senate briefing when he  stated that although to date none of the traditional terrorists groups, such  as al Qaeda, have used the Internet to launch a known assault on the  United States\u2019 infrastructure, information on water systems was  discovered on computers found in al Qaeda camps in Afghanistan. Also, in  his February 2002 statement for the Senate Select Committee on  Intelligence, the director of central intelligence discussed the possibility of  cyber warfare attack by terrorists. He stated that the September 11  attacks demonstrated the nation\u2019s dependence on critical infrastructure  systems that rely on electronic and computer networks. Further, he noted  that attacks of this nature would become an increasingly viable option for  terrorists as they and other foreign adversaries become more familiar with  these targets and the technologies required to attack them.", "Since September 11, 2001, the critical link between cyberspace and  physical space has also been increasingly recognized. In his November  2002 congressional testimony, the Director, CERT Centers at Carnegie- Mellon University, noted that supervisory control and data acquisition  (SCADA) systems and other forms of networked computer systems have  been used for years to control power grids, gas and oil distribution  pipelines, water treatment and distribution systems, hydroelectric and  flood control dams, oil and chemical refineries, and other physical  systems, and that these control systems are increasingly being connected  to communications links and networks to reduce operational costs by  supporting remote maintenance, remote control, and remote update  functions. These computer-controlled and network-connected systems are  potential targets for individuals bent on causing massive disruption and  physical damage, and the use of commercial, off-the-shelf technologies for  these systems without adequate security enhancements can significantly  limit available approaches to protection and may increase the number of  potential attackers.", "Not only is the cyber protection of our critical infrastructures important in  and of itself, but a physical attack in conjunction with a cyber attack has  also been highlighted as a major concern. In fact, the National  Infrastructure Protection Center (NIPC) has stated that the potential for  compound cyber and physical attacks, referred to as \u201cswarming attacks,\u201d  is an emerging threat to the U.S. critical infrastructure. As NIPC reports,  the effects of a swarming attack include slowing or complicating the  response to a physical attack. For example, cyber attacks can be used to  delay the notification of emergency services and to deny the resources  needed to manage the consequences of a physical attack. In addition, a  swarming attack could be used to worsen the effects of a physical attack.  For example, a cyber attack on a natural gas distribution pipeline that  opens safety valves and releases fuels or gas in the area of a planned  physical attack could enhance the force of the physical attack."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Information Sharing is Critical to Meeting DHS\u2019s Mission", "paragraphs": ["As our government and our nation has become ever more reliant on  interconnected computer systems to support critical operations and  infrastructures and as physical and cyber threats and potential attack  consequences have increased, the importance of sharing information and  coordinating the response to threats among stakeholders has increased.  Information sharing and coordination among organizations are central to  producing comprehensive and practical approaches and solutions to  combating threats. For example, having information on threats and on  actual incidents experienced by others can help an organization identify  trends, better understand the risk it faces, and determine what preventive  measures should be implemented. In addition, comprehensive, timely  information on incidents can help federal and nonfederal analysis centers  determine the nature of an attack, provide warnings, and advise on how to  mitigate an imminent attack. Also, sharing information on terrorists and  criminals can help to secure our nation\u2019s borders.", "The Homeland Security Act of 2002 created DHS with the primary  responsibility of preventing terrorist attacks in the United States, reducing  the vulnerability of the United States to terrorist attacks, and minimizing  damage and assisting in recovery from attacks that do occur.

CIP  involves activities that enhance the security of our nation\u2019s cyber and  physical public and private infrastructure that are critical to national  security, national economic security, and/or national public health and  safety. Information sharing is a key element of these activities. Over 80  percent of our nation\u2019s critical infrastructures are controlled by the private  sector. As part of its CIP responsibilities, IAIP is responsible for  (1) developing a comprehensive national plan for securing the key  resources and critical infrastructure of the United States and  (2) recommending measures to protect the key resources and critical  infrastructure of the United States in coordination with other federal  agencies and in cooperation with state and local government agencies and  authorities, the private sector, and other entities.", "Federal CIP policy has continued to evolve since the mid-1990s through a  variety of working groups, special reports, executive orders, strategies,  and organizations. In particular, Presidential Decision Directive 63 (PDD  63) issued in 1998 established CIP as a national goal and described a  strategy for cooperative efforts by government and the private sector to  protect the physical and cyber-based systems essential to the minimum  operations of the economy and the government. To accomplish its goals,  PDD 63 established and designated organizations to provide central  coordination and support. These included the Critical Infrastructure  Assurance Office (CIAO), an interagency office established to develop a  national plan for CIP, and NIPC, which was expanded to address national- level threat assessment, warning, vulnerability, and law enforcement  investigation/response. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 transferred  these and certain other CIP entities and their functions (other than the  Computer Investigations and Operations Section of NIPC) to DHS\u2019s IAIP  directorate.", "Federal CIP policy, beginning with PDD 63 and reinforced through other  strategy documents, including the National Strategy for Homeland  Security issued in July 2002, called for a range of activities intended to  establish a partnership between the public and private sectors to ensure  the security of our nation\u2019s critical infrastructures. To ensure coverage of  critical infrastructure sectors, this policy identified infrastructure sectors  that were essential to our national security, national economic security,  and/or national public health and safety. For these sectors, which now  total 14, federal government leads (sector liaisons) and private-sector  leads (sector coordinators) were to work with each other to address  problems related to CIP for their sector. In particular, they were to (1)  develop and implement vulnerability awareness and education programs  and (2) contribute to a sectoral plan by assessing the vulnerabilities of the sector to cyber or physical attacks;  recommending a plan to eliminate significant vulnerabilities; proposing a system for identifying and preventing major attacks; and developing a plan for alerting, containing, and rebuffing an attack in  progress and then, in coordination with the Federal Emergency  Management Agency as appropriate, rapidly reconstituting minimum  essential capabilities in the aftermath of an attack.", "CIP policy also called for sector liaisons to identify and assess economic  incentives to encourage the desired sector behavior in CIP. Federal grant  programs to assist state and local efforts, legislation to create incentives  for the private sector and, in some cases, regulation are mentioned in CIP  policy.", "Federal CIP policy also encourages the voluntary creation of information  sharing and analysis centers (ISACs) to serve as mechanisms for gathering,  analyzing, and appropriately sanitizing and disseminating information to  and from infrastructure sectors and the federal government through NIPC.  Their activities could improve the security posture of the individual  sectors, as well as provide an improved level of communication within and  across sectors and all levels of government. While PDD 63 encouraged the  creation of ISACs, it left the actual design and functions of the ISACs,  along with their relationship with NIPC, to be determined by the private  sector in consultation with the federal government. PDD 63 did provide  suggested activities, which the ISACs could undertake, including establishing baseline statistics and patterns on the various infrastructures;  serving as a clearinghouse for information within and among the various  sectors; providing a library for historical data for use by the private sector and  reporting private-sector incidents to NIPC.", "As we reported in our April 8, 2003, testimony, table 3 shows the sectors  identified in federal CIP policy, the lead agencies for these sectors, and  whether or not an ISAC has been established for the sector.", "The Interstate ISAC shown in table 3 was established by the National  Association of State Chief Information Officers (NASCIO) and is intended  to provide a mechanism for informing state officials about DHS threat  warnings, alerts, and other relevant information, and for state officials to  report information to DHS. According to a NASCIO official, currently,  there are limited resources available to provide suggested ISAC activities.  For example, there is not a watch operation, although notifications can be  sent out to members at any time and some states have their own watch  centers. He also stated that NASCIO\u2019s efforts have focused on working  with DHS to develop an intergovernmental approach, similar to other  federal and state efforts such as law enforcement task forces, where state  and federal agencies share resources and responsibilities.", "As called for by the National Strategy for Homeland Security, on  February 14, 2003, the President also released the National Strategy to  Secure Cyberspace and the complementary National Strategy for the  Physical Protection of Critical Infrastructures and Key Assets. These  two strategies identify priorities, actions, and responsibilities for the  federal government (including lead agencies and DHS) as well as for state  and local governments and the private sector. These two strategies also  emphasize the importance of developing mechanisms for the public and  private sectors to share information about vulnerabilities, incidents,  threats, and other security data. For example, the National Strategy to  Secure Cyberspace calls for the development of a National Cyberspace  Security Response System. To be coordinated by DHS, this system is  described as a public/private architecture for analyzing and warning,  managing incidents of national significance, promoting continuity in  government systems and private-sector infrastructures, and increasing  information sharing across and between organizations to improve  cyberspace security. The system is to include governmental and  nongovernmental entities, such as private-sector ISACs. The strategies  also encourage the continued establishment of ISACs and efforts to  enhance the analytical capabilities of existing ISACs.", "As we reported in April 2003, according to a DHS official, the department  is continuing to carry out the CIP activities of the functions and  organizations transferred to it by the Homeland Security Act of 2002.  Further, this official stated that the department is taking actions to  enhance those activities as it integrates them within the new department  and is continuing previously established efforts to maintain and build  relationships with other federal entities, including the FBI and other NIPC  partners, and with the private sector.", "To fulfill its mission, the IAIP directorate will need to ensure effective  information sharing with other federal entities. For example, information  sharing with the recently formed Terrorist Threat Integration Center  (TTIC) is a central function of the directorate. TTIC was created to merge  and analyze terrorist-related information collected domestically and  abroad to enhance coordination, facilitate threat analysis, and enable more  comprehensive threat assessments.

Since 1998, we have  reported on the need for such a plan and made numerous related  recommendations.", "In September 1998, we reported that developing a governmentwide  strategy that clearly defined and coordinated the roles of federal entities  was important to ensure governmentwide cooperation and support for  PDD 63.

The plan proposed achieving the twin goals of making the  U.S. government a model of information security and developing a  public/private partnership to defend our national infrastructures. However,  this plan focused largely on federal cyber CIP efforts, saying little about  the private-sector role.", "In September 2001, we reported that agency questions had surfaced  regarding specific roles and responsibilities of entities involved in cyber  CIP and the timeframes within which CIP objectives were to be met, as  well as guidelines for measuring progress. Accordingly, we made several  recommendations to supplement those we had made in the past.  Specifically, we recommended that the Assistant to the President for  National Security Affairs ensure that the federal government\u2019s strategy to  address computer-based threats define  specific roles and responsibilities of organizations involved in CIP and  related information security activities;  interim objectives and milestones for achieving CIP goals and a specific  action plan for achieving these objectives, including implementing  vulnerability assessments and related remedial plans; and performance measures for which entities can be held accountable.", "In July 2002, we issued a report identifying at least 50 organizations that  were involved in national or multinational cyber CIP efforts, including 5  advisory committees; 6 Executive Office of the President organizations; 38  executive branch organizations associated with departments, agencies, or  intelligence organizations; and 3 other organizations. Although our review  did not cover organizations with national physical CIP responsibilities, the  large number of organizations that we did identify as involved in CIP  efforts presents a need to clarify how these entities coordinate their  activities with each other. Our report also stated that PDD 63 did not  specifically address other possible critical sectors and their respective  federal agency counterparts. Accordingly, we recommended that the  federal government\u2019s strategy also  include all relevant sectors and define the key federal agencies\u2019 roles and  responsibilities associated with each of these sectors, and define the relationships among the key CIP organizations.", "In July 2002, the National Strategy for Homeland Security called for  interim cyber and physical infrastructure protection plans that DHS would  use to build a comprehensive national infrastructure plan. Implementing a  well-developed plan is critical to effective coordination in times of crises.  According to the strategy, the national plan is to provide a methodology  for identifying and prioritizing critical assets, systems, and functions, and  for sharing protection responsibility with state and local governments and  the private sector. The plan is also to establish standards and benchmarks  for infrastructure protection and provide a means to measure  performance. The plan is expected to inform DHS on budgeting and  planning for CIP activities and how to use policy instruments to coordinate  between government and private entities to improve the security of our  national infrastructures to appropriate levels. The strategy also states that  DHS is to unify the currently divided responsibilities for cyber and  physical security.

These strategies identify  priorities, actions, and responsibilities for the federal government,  including federal lead departments and agencies and the DHS, as well as  for state and local governments and the private sector. Both define  strategic objectives for protecting our nation\u2019s critical assets. The physical  protection strategy discusses the goals and objectives for protecting our  nation\u2019s critical infrastructure and key assets from physical attack. The  cyberspace security strategy provides a framework for organizing and  prioritizing the individual and concerted responsibilities of all levels of  government to secure cyberspace.", "According to the physical protection strategy, across government, there  are inconsistent methodologies to prioritize efforts to enhance critical  infrastructure protection. This problem is compounded with ineffective  communication among the federal, state, and local governments that has  resulted in untimely, disparate, and at times conflicting communication  between those who need it most. DHS has been given a primary role in  providing cross-sector coordination to improve communication and  planning efforts and serves as the single point of coordination for state and  local governments on homeland security issues. To fulfill its role as the  cross-sector coordinator, DHS will partner with state and local  governments and the private sector to institute processes that are  transparent, comprehensive, and results-oriented. This effort will include  creating mechanisms for collaborative national planning efforts between  the private and public sectors and for consolidating the individual sector  plans into a comprehensive plan that will define their respective roles,  responsibilities, and expectations.", "The cyberspace security strategy is the counterpart to the physical  protection strategy and provides the framework for organizing and  prioritizing the individual and concerted responsibilities of all levels of  government to secure cyberspace. DHS serves as the focal point for  managing cybersecurity incidents that could affect the federal government  or the national information infrastructure and, thus, plays a central role in  executing the initiatives assigned in this strategy. While the cyberspace  security strategy mentions the responsibility of DHS in creating a  comprehensive national plan for securing resources and key  infrastructures, much of the strategy\u2019s emphasis remains on coordinating  and integrating various plans with the private sector.", "Neither strategy (1) clearly indicates how the physical and cyber efforts  will be coordinated; (2) defines the roles, responsibilities, and  relationships among the key CIP organizations, including state and local  governments and the private sector; (3) indicates time frames or  milestones for their overall implementation or for accomplishing specific  actions or initiatives; nor (4) establishes performance measures for which  entities can be held responsible. Until a comprehensive and coordinated  plan is completed that unifies the responsibilities for cyber and physical  infrastructures; identifies roles, responsibilities, and relationships for all  CIP efforts; establishes time frames or milestones for implementation; and  establishes performance measures, our nation risks not having a  consistent and appropriate information sharing framework to deal with  growing threats to its critical infrastructure."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Better Information Sharing on Threats and Vulnerabilities Must Be Implemented", "paragraphs": ["Information sharing is a key element in developing comprehensive and  practical approaches to defending against potential cyber and other  attacks, which could threaten the national welfare.

However, as we have reported in recent  years, establishing the trusted relationships and information-sharing  protocols necessary to support such coordination can be difficult. In  addition, the private sector has expressed concerns about sharing  information with the government and the difficulty of obtaining security  clearances. Both the Congress and the administration have taken steps to  address information sharing issues in law and recent policy guidance, but  their effectiveness will largely depend on how DHS implements its  information sharing responsibilities.", "A number of activities have been undertaken to build information-sharing  relationships between the federal government and the private sector, such  as InfraGard, the Partnership for Critical Infrastructure Security, efforts by  the CIAO, and efforts by lead agencies to establish ISACs. For example,  the InfraGard Program, which provides the FBI and NIPC with a means of  securely sharing information with individual companies, has expanded  substantially. InfraGard membership has increased from 277 in October  2000 to almost 9,400 in September 2003. Members include representatives  from private industry, other government agencies, state and local law  enforcement, and the academic community.", "As stated above, PDD 63 encouraged the voluntary creation of ISACs to  serve as the mechanism for gathering, analyzing, and appropriately  sanitizing and disseminating information between the private sector and  the federal government through NIPC. In April 2001, we reported that  NIPC and other government entities had not developed fully productive  information-sharing relationships but that NIPC had undertaken a range of  initiatives to foster information-sharing relationships with ISACs, as well  as with government and international entities. We recommended that  NIPC formalize relationships with ISACs and develop a plan to foster a  two-way exchange of information between them.", "In response to our recommendations, NIPC officials told us in July 2002  that an ISAC development and support unit had been created, whose  mission was to enhance private-sector cooperation and trust so that it  would result in a two-way sharing of information. As shown previously in  table 3, as of April 2003, DHS reported that there are 16 current ISACs,  including ISACs established for sectors not identified as critical  infrastructure sectors. DHS officials also stated that they have formal  agreements with most of the current ISACs.", "In spite of progress made in establishing ISACs, additional efforts are  needed. All sectors do not have a fully established ISAC, and even for  those sectors that do, our recent work showed that participation may be  mixed, and the amount of information being shared between the federal  government and private-sector organizations also varies. Specifically, as  we reported in February 2003, the five ISACs we recently reviewed  showed different levels of progress in implementing the PDD 63 suggested  activities. For example, four of the five reported that efforts were still in  progress to establish baseline statistics, which includes developing a  database on the normal levels of computer security incidents that would  be used for analysis purposes. Also, while all five reported that they served  as the clearinghouse of information (such as incident reports and warnings  received from members) for their own sectors, only three of the five  reported that they are also coordinating with other sectors. Only one of the  five ISACs reported that it provides a library of incidents and historical  data that was available to both the private sector and the federal  government, and although three additional ISACs do maintain a library, it  was available only to the private sector. Table 4 summarizes the reported  status of the five ISACs in performing these and other activities suggested  by PDD 63.", "As also noted in our February 2003 report, some in the private sector  expressed concerns about voluntarily sharing information with the  government. Specifically, concerns were raised that industry could  potentially face antitrust violations for sharing information with other  industry partners, have their information subject to the Freedom of  Information Act (FOIA), or face potential liability concerns for information  shared in good faith. For example, the IT, energy, and the water ISACs  reported that they did not share their libraries with the federal government  because of concerns that information could be released under FOIA. And,  officials of the energy ISAC stated that they have not reported incidents to  NIPC because of FOIA and antitrust concerns.", "The recently established ISAC Council may help to address some of these  concerns. According to its chairman, the mission of the ISAC Council is to  advance the physical and cybersecurity of the critical infrastructures of  North America by establishing and maintaining a framework for  interaction between and among the ISACs. Activities of the council include  establishing and maintaining a policy for inter-ISAC coordination, a dialog  with governmental agencies that deal with ISACs, and a practical data and  information sharing protocol (what to share and how to share). In  addition, the council will develop analytical methods to assist the ISACs in  supporting their own sectors and other sectors with which there are  interdependencies and establish a policy to deal with matters of liability  and anti-trust. The chairman also reported that the council held an initial  meeting with DHS and the White House in June 2003 to, among other  things, understand mutual DHS and ISAC expectations.", "There will be continuing debate as to whether adequate protection is being  provided to the private sector as these entities are encouraged to disclose  and exchange information on both physical and cybersecurity problems  and solutions that are essential to protecting our nation\u2019s critical  infrastructures. The National Strategy for Homeland Security includes  \u201cenabling critical infrastructure information sharing\u201d in its 12 major  legislative initiatives. It states that the nation must meet this need by  narrowly limiting public disclosure of information relevant to protecting  our physical and cyber critical infrastructures in order to facilitate the  voluntary submission of information. It further states that the Attorney  General will convene a panel to propose any legal changes necessary to  enable sharing of essential homeland security related information between  the federal government and the private sector.", "Actions have already been taken by the Congress and the administration to  strengthen information sharing. For example, the USA PATRIOT Act  promotes information sharing among federal agencies, and numerous  terrorism task forces have been established to coordinate investigations  and improve communications among federal and local law enforcement.  Moreover, the Homeland Security Act of 2002 includes provisions that  restrict federal, state, and local government use and disclosure of critical  infrastructure information that has been voluntarily submitted to DHS.  These restrictions include exemption from disclosure under FOIA, a  general limitation on use to CIP purposes, and limitations on use in civil  actions and by state or local governments. The act also provides penalties  for any federal employee who improperly discloses any protected critical  infrastructure information. In April 2003, DHS issued for comment its  proposed rules for how critical infrastructure information volunteered by  the public will be protected. At this time, it is too early to tell what impact  the act will have on the willingness of the private sector to share critical  infrastructure information.", "Information sharing among federal, state and local governments also  needs to be improved. In August 2003 we reported the results of our  survey of federal, state, and city government officials\u2019 perceptions of the  effectiveness of the current information-sharing process. Performed  primarily before DHS began its operations, our survey identified some  notable information-sharing initiatives, but also highlighted coordination  issues and other concerns that many of the surveyed entities had with the  overall information-sharing process. For example, the FBI reported it had  significantly increased the number of its Joint Terrorism Task Forces and,  according to our survey, 34 of 40 states and 160 of 228 cities stated that  they participated in information-sharing centers. However, although such  initiatives may increase the sharing of information to fight terrorism, none  of the three levels of government perceived the current information- sharing process as effective, particularly when sharing information with  federal agencies. Respondents reported that information on threats,  methods, and techniques of terrorists was not routinely shared; and the  information that was shared was not perceived as timely, accurate, or  relevant. Further, 30 of 40 states and 212 of 228 cities responded that they  were not given the opportunity to participate in national policy making on  information sharing. Federal agencies in our survey also identified several  barriers to sharing threat information with state and city governments,  including the inability of state and city officials to secure and protect  classified information, the lack of federal security clearances, and a lack of  integrated databases.", "The private sector has also expressed its concerns about the value of  information being provided by the government. For example, in July 2002  the President for the Partnership for Critical Infrastructure Security stated  in congressional testimony that information sharing between the  government and private sector needs work, specifically, in the quality and  timeliness of cybersecurity information coming from the government. In  March 2003 we also reported that the officials from the chemical industry  noted that they need better threat information from law enforcement  agencies, as well as better coordination among agencies providing threat  information. They stated that chemical companies do not receive enough  specific threat information and that it frequently comes from multiple  government agencies. Similarly, in developing a vulnerability assessment  methodology to assess the security of chemical facilities against terrorist  and criminal attacks, the Department of Justice observed that chemical  facilities need more specific information about potential threats in order to  design their security systems and protocols. Chemical industry officials  also noted that efforts to share threat information among industry and  federal agencies will be effective only if government agencies provide  specific and accurate threat information. Threat information also forms  the foundation for some of the tools available to industry for assessing  facility vulnerabilities. The Justice vulnerability assessment methodology  requires threat information as the foundation for hypothesizing about  threat scenarios, which form the basis for determining site vulnerabilities.", "The Homeland Security Act, the National Strategy for Homeland  Security, the National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace, and the National  Strategy for the Physical Protection of Critical Infrastructures and Key  Assets all acknowledge the importance of information sharing and identify  multiple responsibilities for DHS to share information on threats and  vulnerabilities. In particular:", "The Homeland Security Act authorizes the IAIP Under Secretary to have  access to all information in the federal government that concerns  infrastructure or other vulnerabilities of the United States to terrorism and  to use this information to fulfill its responsibilities to provide appropriate  analysis and warnings related to threats to and vulnerabilities of critical  information systems, crisis management support in response to threats or  attacks on critical information systems, and technical assistance upon  request to private-sector and government entities to respond to major  failures of critical information systems.", "The National Strategy for Homeland Security specifies the need for DHS  to work with state and local governments to achieve \u201cseamless  communication\u201d among all responders. This responsibility includes  developing a national emergency communication plan to establish policies  and procedures to improve the exchange of information. Ensuring  improved communications also involves developing systems that help  prevent attacks and minimize damage. Such systems, which would be  accessed and used by all levels of government, would detect hostile intents  and help locate individual terrorists as well as monitor and detect  outbreaks.", "The cyberspace security strategy encourages DHS to work with the  National Infrastructure Advisory Council and the private sector to develop  an optimal approach and mechanism to disclose vulnerabilities in order to  expedite the development of solutions without creating opportunities for  exploitation by hackers. DHS is also expected to raise awareness about  removing obstacles to sharing information concerning cybersecurity and  infrastructure vulnerabilities between the public and private sectors and is  encouraged to work closely with ISACs to ensure that they receive timely  and actionable threat and vulnerability data and to coordinate voluntary  contingency planning efforts.", "The physical protection strategy describes DHS\u2019s need to collaborate with  the intelligence community and the Department of Justice to develop  comprehensive threat collection, assessment, and dissemination processes  that are distributed to the appropriate entity in a timely manner. It also  enumerates several initiatives directed to DHS to accomplish to create a  more effective information-sharing environment among the key  stakeholders, including establishing requirements for sharing information;  supporting state and local participation with ISACs to more effectively  communicate threat and vulnerability information; protecting secure and  proprietary information deemed sensitive by the private sector;  implementing processes for collecting, analyzing, and disseminating threat  data to integrate information from all sources; and developing  interoperable systems to share sensitive information among government  entities to facilitate meaningful information exchange.", "The National Strategy for Homeland Security also describes DHS\u2019s need  to engage its partners around the world in cooperative efforts to improve  security.

Such capabilities need to address both cyber and physical threats and  involve (1) gathering and analyzing information for the purpose of  detecting and reporting otherwise potentially damaging actions or  intentions and (2) implementing a process for warning policymakers and  allowing them time to determine the magnitude of the related risks.", "In April 2001, we reported on NIPC\u2019s progress and impediments in  developing analysis and warning capabilities for computer-based attacks,  which included the following:", "Lack of a generally accepted methodology for analyzing strategic cyber- based threats. For example, there was no standard terminology, no  standard set of factors to consider, and no established thresholds for  determining the sophistication of attack techniques. According to officials  in the intelligence and national security community, developing such a  methodology would require an intense interagency effort and dedication of  resources.", "Lack of industry-specific data on factors such as critical system  components, known vulnerabilities, and interdependencies. Under PDD  63, such information is to be developed for each of eight industry segments  by industry representatives and the designated federal lead agencies. In  September 2001, we reported that although outreach efforts had raised  awareness and improved information sharing, substantive, comprehensive  analysis of infrastructure sector interdependencies and vulnerabilities had  been limited.", "Another challenge confronting the analysis and warning capabilities of our  nation is that, historically, our national CIP attention and efforts have been  focused on cyber threats. As we also reported in April 2001, although PDD  63 covers both physical and cyber threats, federal efforts to meet the  directive\u2019s requirements have pertained primarily to cyber threats since  this is an area that the leaders of the administration\u2019s CIP strategy view as  needing attention. However, the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001,  have increased the emphasis of physical threats. In addition, in July 2002,  NIPC reported that the potential for concurrent cyber and physical  (\u201cswarming\u201d) attacks is an emerging threat to the U.S. critical  infrastructure. Further, in July 2002, the director of NIPC also told us that  NIPC had begun to develop some capabilities for identifying physical CIP  threats. For example, NIPC had developed thresholds with several ISACs  for reporting physical incidents and, since January 2002, has issued several  information bulletins concerning physical CIP threats. However, NIPC\u2019s  director acknowledged that fully developing this capability would be a  significant challenge. The physical protection strategy states that DHS will  maintain a comprehensive, up-to-date assessment of vulnerabilities across  sectors and improve processes for domestic threat data collection,  analysis, and dissemination to state and local governments and private  industry.", "The administration and the Congress continue to emphasize the need for  these analysis and warning capabilities. The National Strategy for  Homeland Security identified intelligence and warning as one of six  critical mission areas and called for major initiatives to improve our  nation\u2019s analysis and warning capabilities. The strategy also stated that no  government entity was then responsible for analyzing terrorist threats to  the homeland, mapping these threats to our vulnerabilities, and taking  protective action. The Homeland Security Act gives such responsibility to  the new DHS. For example, the IAIP Under Secretary is responsible for  administering the Homeland Security Advisory System, and is to  coordinate with other federal agencies to provide specific warning  information and advice to state and local agencies, the private sector, the  public, and other entities about appropriate protective measures and  countermeasures to homeland security threats.", "An important aspect of improving our nation\u2019s analysis and warning  capabilities is having comprehensive vulnerability assessments. The  National Strategy for Homeland Security also states that comprehensive  vulnerability assessments of all of our nation\u2019s critical infrastructures are  important from a planning perspective in that they enable authorities to  evaluate the potential effects of an attack on a given sector and then invest  accordingly to protect it. The strategy states that the U.S. government does  not perform vulnerability assessments of the nation\u2019s entire critical  infrastructure. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 states that the DHS\u2019s  IAIP Under Secretary is to carry out comprehensive assessments of the  vulnerabilities of key resources and critical infrastructures of the United  States.", "Another critical issue in developing effective analysis and warning  capabilities is to ensure that appropriate intelligence and other threat  information, both cyber and physical, is received from the intelligence and  law enforcement communities. For example, there has been considerable  public debate regarding the quality and timeliness of intelligence data  shared between and among relevant intelligence, law enforcement, and  other agencies. Also, as the transfer of NIPC to DHS organizationally  separated it from the FBI\u2019s law enforcement activities (including the  Counterterrorism Division and NIPC field agents), it will be critical to  establish mechanisms for continued communication to occur. Further, it  will be important that the relationships between the law enforcement and  intelligence communities and the new DHS are effective and that  appropriate information is exchanged on a timely basis. The act gives DHS  broad statutory authority to access intelligence information, as well as  other information relevant to the terrorist threat and to turn this  information into useful warnings. For example, DHS is to be a key  participant in the multiagency TTIC that began operations on May 1, 2003.  According to a White House fact sheet, DHS\u2019s IAIP is to receive and  analyze terrorism-related information from the TTIC. Although the  purpose of TTIC and the authorities and responsibilities of the FBI and  Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) counterterrorism organizations remain  distinct, in July 2003, the TTIC Director reported that initiatives are under  way to facilitate efforts within the intelligence community to ensure that  DHS has access to all information required to execute its mission. He also  reported other progress, such as updates to a TTIC-sponsored Web site  that provides terrorism-related information. For example, the Web site is  to increasingly include products tailored to the needs of state and local  officials, as well as private industry.", "In addition, according to NIPC\u2019s director, as of July 2002, a significant  challenge in developing a robust analysis and warning function is the  development of the technology and human capital capacities to collect and  analyze substantial amounts of information. Similarly, the Director of the  FBI testified in June 2002 that implementing a more proactive approach to  preventing terrorist acts and denying terrorist groups the ability to operate  and raise funds require a centralized and robust analytical capacity that  did not then exist in the FBI\u2019s Counterterrorism Division. He also stated  that processing and exploiting information gathered domestically and  abroad during the course of investigations require an enhanced analytical  and data mining capacity that was not then available. According to DHS\u2019s  reorganization plans, the IAIP Under Secretary and the chief information  officer (CIO) of the department are to fulfill their responsibilities as laid  out by the act to establish and uses a secure communications and IT  infrastructure.

However, the strategy also discusses the need to use all available policy  tools to protect the health, safety, or well-being of the American people. It  mentions federal grant programs to assist state and local efforts,  legislation to create incentives for the private sector, and, in some cases,  regulation. The physical protection strategy reiterates that additional  regulatory directives and mandates should only be necessary in instances  where the market forces are insufficient to prompt the necessary  investments to protect critical infrastructures and key assets. The  cyberspace security strategy also states that the market is to provide the  major impetus to improve cybersecurity and that regulation will not  become a primary means of securing cyberspace.", "Last year, the Comptroller General testified on the need for strong  partnerships with those outside the federal government and that the new  department would need to design and manage tools of public policy to  engage and work constructively with third parties.

We also reported on the efforts of federal  entities and regulators to partner with the financial services industry to  protect critical infrastructures and to address information security. We  found that although federal entities had a number of efforts ongoing,  Treasury, in its role as sector liaison, had not undertaken a comprehensive  assessment of the potential public policy tools to encourage the financial  services sector in implementing information sharing and other CIP-related  efforts. Because of the importance of considering public policy tools to  encourage private-sector participation, we recommended that Treasury  assess the need for public policy tools to assist the industry in meeting the  sector\u2019s goals. In addition, in February 2003, we reported on the mixed  progress five ISACs had made in accomplishing the activities suggested by  PDD 63.

In particular, federal  agencies that maintained information about terrorists and other criminals  had not consistently shared it. The strategy attributed these information- sharing limitations to legal, cultural, and technical barriers that resulted in  the watch lists being developed in different ways, for different purposes,  and in isolation from one another. To address these limitations, the  strategy provides for developing a consolidated watch list that would bring  together the information on known or suspected terrorists contained in  federal agencies\u2019 respective lists.", "As we reported, we found that the watch lists include overlapping but not  identical sets of data, and that different policies and procedures govern  whether and how these data are shared with others. As a general rule, we  found that this information sharing is more likely to occur among federal  agencies than between federal agencies and either state and local  governments agencies or private entities. Among other things, we also  found that the extent to which such information sharing is accomplished  electronically is constrained by fundamental differences in the watch lists\u2019  systems architecture.

In August 2002, we reported  on various existing technologies that could be more widely implemented  to facilitate information sharing. We reported that Extensible Markup  Language (XML) is useful for better information sharing. XML is a flexible,  nonproprietary set of standards for annotating or \u201ctagging\u201d information so  that it can be transmitted over a network such as the Internet and readily  interpreted by disparate computer systems. If implemented broadly with  consistent data definitions and structures, XML offers the promise of  making it significantly easier for organizations and individuals to identify,  integrate, and process information that may be widely dispersed among  systems and organizations. For example, law enforcement agencies could  potentially better identify and retrieve information about criminal suspects  from any number of federal, state, and local databases.", "We also reported that various technologies could be used to protect  information in shared databases. For example, data could be protected  through electronically secured entry technology (ESET). ESET would  allow users of separate databases to cross check or \u201cmine\u201d data securely  without directly disclosing their information to others, thus allowing  agencies to collaborate as well as address their needs for confidentiality or  privacy. Such technology could, for example, allow an airline to cross  check a passenger or employee against data held by government agencies  in a single-step process without actually disclosing the data to the airline.  In checking an individual, the airline would not receive any data from the  agencies\u2019 databases; rather, it would receive a \u201cyes or no\u201d type of response  and/or a referral for further action.

For the past several years, we have  analyzed audit results for 24 of the largest federal agencies, and our latest  analyses, of audit reports issued from October 2001 through October 2002,  continued to show significant weaknesses in federal computer systems  that put critical operations and assets at risk. In particular, we found that  all 24 agencies had weaknesses in security program management, which is  fundamental to the appropriate selection and effectiveness of the other  categories of controls and covers a range of activities related to  understanding information security risks, selecting and implementing  controls commensurate with risk, and ensuring that the controls  implemented continue to operate effectively.

In April 2003, we also reported that many  agencies still had not established information security programs consistent  with requirements originally prescribed by government information  security reform legislation and now permanently authorized by FISMA.", "Considering the sensitive and classified information to be maintained and  shared by DHS, it is critical that the department implement federal  information security requirements to ensure that its systems are  appropriately assessed for risk and that adequate controls are  implemented and working properly. Federal information security  guidance, such as that issued by the National Institute of Standards and  Technology (NIST), can aid DHS in this process. For example, NIST has  issued guidance to help agencies perform self-assessments of their  information security programs, conduct risk assessments, and use metrics  to determine the adequacy of in-place security controls, policies, and  procedures. In addition, as we have previously reported, agencies need  more specific guidance on the controls that they need to implement to  help ensure adequate protection. Currently, agencies have wide  discretion in deciding which computer security controls to implement and  the level of rigor with which to enforce these controls. Although one set of  specific controls will not be appropriate for all types of systems and data,  our studies of best practices at leading organizations have shown that  more specific guidance is important. In particular, specific mandatory  standards for varying risk levels can clarify expectations for information  protection, including audit criteria; provide a standard framework for  assessing information security risk; help ensure that shared data are  appropriately protected; and reduce demands for limited resources to  independently develop security controls. Responding to this need, FISMA  requires NIST to develop, for systems other than national security systems,  (1) standards to be used by all agencies to categorize all of their  information and information systems based on the objectives of providing  appropriate levels of information security according to a range of risk  levels; (2) guidelines recommending the types of information and  information systems to be included in each category; and (3) minimum  information security requirements for information and information  systems in each category.", "DHS has identified implementing its information security program as a  year-one objective.
