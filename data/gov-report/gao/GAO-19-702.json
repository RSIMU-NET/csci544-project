Defaults occur when borrowers fail to meet mortgage conditions such as paying property taxes. These borrowers risk foreclosure and loss of their homes. FHA allows HECM servicers to offer borrowers foreclosure prevention options. Most HECM servicers are supervised by CFPB.

In recent years, a growing percentage of HECMs insured by FHA have ended because borrowers defaulted on their loans. While death of the borrower is the most commonly reported reason why HECMs terminate, the percentage of terminations due to borrower defaults increased from 2 percent in fiscal year 2014 to 18 percent in fiscal year 2018 (see figure). Most HECM defaults are due to borrowers not meeting occupancy requirements or failing to pay property charges, such as property taxes or homeowners insurance. Since 2015, FHA has allowed HECM servicers to put borrowers who are behind on property charges onto repayment plans to help prevent foreclosures, but as of fiscal year-end 2018, only about 22 percent of these borrowers had received this option.", "FHA's monitoring, performance assessment, and reporting for the HECM program have weaknesses. FHA loan data do not currently capture the reason for about 30 percent of HECM terminations (see figure). FHA also has not established comprehensive performance indicators for the HECM portfolio and has not regularly tracked key performance metrics, such as reasons for HECM terminations and the number of distressed borrowers who have received foreclosure prevention options. Additionally, FHA has not developed internal reports to comprehensively monitor patterns and trends in loan outcomes. As a result, FHA does not know how well the HECM program is serving its purpose of helping meet the financial needs of elderly homeowners.", "FHA has not conducted on-site reviews of HECM servicers since fiscal year 2013 and has not benefited from oversight efforts by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). FHA officials said they planned to resume the reviews in fiscal year 2020, starting with three servicers that account for most of the market. However, as of August 2019, FHA had not developed updated review procedures and did not have a risk-based method for prioritizing reviews. CFPB conducts examinations of reverse mortgage servicers but does not provide the results to FHA because the agencies do not have an agreement for sharing confidential supervisory information. Without better oversight and information sharing, FHA lacks assurance that servicers are following requirements, including those designed to help protect borrowers."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO makes eight recommendations to FHA to, among other things, improve its monitoring and assessment of the HECM portfolio and oversight of HECM servicers, and one recommendation to CFPB to share HECM servicer examination information with FHA.

A reverse mortgage  is a type of loan that allows eligible seniors to convert part of their home  equity into payments from a lender while still living in their homes.  Congress authorized the Department of Housing and Urban Development  (HUD) to insure reverse mortgages to help meet the financial needs of  elderly homeowners. The vast majority of reverse mortgages are made  under the Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) program  administered by HUD\u2019s Federal Housing Administration (FHA). HECMs  are originated and serviced by private FHA-approved lenders and  servicers. FHA insures these entities against losses on the loans and  charges borrowers premiums to help cover the potential cost of insurance  claims. While not involved in administering the HECM program, the  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) collects consumer  complaints about reverse mortgages and supervises nonbank  (nondepository institution) reverse mortgage lenders and servicers for  compliance with, and enforces violations of, federal consumer financial  protection laws.", "Reverse mortgage servicing involves a range of activities, such as  making payments to borrowers, providing monthly account statements,  monitoring loan balances, and responding to borrower inquiries. If a  borrower falls behind on property charges (for example, taxes and  homeowners insurance), servicers must generally temporarily pay them  on the borrower\u2019s behalf (referred to in this report as servicer advances)  but may ultimately initiate foreclosure proceedings if the borrower does  not catch up.

We also analyzed FHA data on servicer  advances for unpaid property charges and other costs for HECMs in a  due and payable status. Additionally, we analyzed information from FHA  on HECM borrowers approved for selected foreclosure prevention  options. To assess the reliability of FHA\u2019s data, we reviewed FHA  documentation, performed electronic testing on the data to check for  missing values and obvious errors, corroborated the data with other  available sources (such as published FHA reports), and interviewed  agency officials and FHA\u2019s data system contractor about interpreting data  fields. We determined the data were sufficiently reliable for characterizing  loan terminations, servicer advances, and use of foreclosure prevention  options in the HECM program. We also reviewed FHA data and reports  and interviewed FHA officials to determine how the agency monitors and  analyzes the HECM portfolio, including the use of any performance  indicators or program evaluations.

We compared FHA\u2019s  oversight of HECM servicers to relevant parts of OMB Circular A-129.  Additionally, we interviewed FHA and CFPB officials to determine the  extent to which the agencies collaborate and share information on  oversight of HECM servicers. We compared their efforts to approaches  federal agencies use to enhance collaboration toward joint goals that we  identified in prior work.", "To address the fourth objective, we analyzed all reverse mortgage  consumer complaints received by CFPB through its Consumer Complaint  Database from calendar years 2015 through 2018 to determine the  number of complaints by year, state, submission method (for example,  internet, phone, or email), and company. We also analyzed a random  generalizable sample of 100 reverse mortgage consumer complaints to  identify patterns in consumer-described issues about reverse mortgages.  We determined the CFPB data were sufficiently reliable for the analysis  we conducted by reviewing CFPB documentation, performing electronic  testing of the data, and interviewing CFPB officials about our  interpretation of data fields. To determine the extent to which FHA  collects and analyzes complaints, we reviewed the nearly 105,000  HECM-related calls received by the National Servicing Center from  calendar years 2015 through 2018. We also reviewed the 147 HECM- related calls received by the FHA Resource Center during the same time.  However, we did not perform an analysis on these data similar to that  conducted on the CFPB data because of limitations in how the data were  collected. For example, data did not include information on whether the  call was a complaint or inquiry, and a large majority of the data did not  include information on who the caller was (e.g., a borrower, servicer, or  lender). Additionally, we reviewed CFPB and FHA policies and  procedures for collecting and addressing consumer complaints and for  incorporating consumer complaints into their oversight of HECM  servicers. Further, we interviewed officials from both agencies to better  understand their complaint processes. We compared CFPB\u2019s and FHA\u2019s  efforts against federal internal control standards and against criteria we  developed previously on leveraging related agency resources.", "To address the fifth objective, we analyzed FHA data from calendar years  1989 (the start of the HECM program) through 2018 to identify trends in  the volume of HECM originations.

We also developed an econometric model using FHA,  Census Bureau, and other data to examine the relationship between  HECM take-up rates and a number of explanatory variables. We also  reviewed relevant research and interviewed academic and HUD  economists about other factors (for example, consumers\u2019 perception of  reverse mortgages) that are difficult to directly include in the model but  that may influence HECM take-up rates.

According to FHA regulations, the borrowers or their heirs  generally have 30 days after being notified that the loan is due and  payable to satisfy the debt or bring the loan out of due and payable  status. Servicers generally have 6 months to take first legal action to  initiate foreclosure from the date that they, as applicable, notified, should  have notified, or received approval from FHA that the HECM is due and  payable. According to FHA regulations, the borrower is generally allowed  to correct the condition that resulted in the due and payable loan status  and reinstate the loan, even after foreclosure proceedings have begun.  Figure 2 illustrates the reasons why HECMs terminate and how borrowers  typically satisfy the debt under various termination scenarios.", "If the servicer experiences a loss because the loan balance exceeds the  recovery from selling the property, the lender can file a claim with FHA for  the difference.

Lenders can only assign HECMs in good  standing to FHA (that is, assignments can only be for HECMs not in a due  and payable status). FHA continues to service the assigned loans using a  contractor until the loans become due, either due to the death of the  borrower or for other reasons. Additionally, the FHA insurance  guarantees borrowers will be able to access their loan funds, even if the  loan balance exceeds the current value of the home or if the lender  experiences financial difficulty. Further, if the borrower or heir sells the  home to repay the loan, he or she will not be responsible for any loan  amount above the value of the home.", "As of the end of fiscal year 2018, FHA had insured over 1 million HECMs.  According to FHA data, these include an active HECM portfolio of  approximately 551,000 loans serviced by various FHA-approved  servicers, 79,000 FHA-assigned loans serviced by an FHA contractor,  and about 468,000 terminated loans (see fig. 3).

In recent years, FHA has responded with  several policy changes to help strengthen the portfolio\u2019s financial  performance and mitigate risks. Because FHA\u2019s projected losses on  HECMs depend on factors such as maximum claim amount, the length of  time the borrower stays in the home, changes in home prices, and  interest rates, most of FHA\u2019s policy changes have been aimed at better  aligning expected revenues (charging borrowers premiums) with  expected costs (cash outflows due to paying insurance claims). For  example, FHA has made changes to insurance premiums and principal  limits, the most recent of which took effect in fiscal year 2018. Effective  in fiscal year 2019, FHA also revised property appraisal practices for new  HECMs to guard against inflated property valuations.

As previously noted, property charge defaults and issues  surrounding nonborrowing spouses not being included on the mortgage  have been long-standing problems in the HECM program. Since 2015,  FHA has made program changes to allow servicers to offer different types  of foreclosure prevention options to distressed HECM borrowers and  nonborrowing spouses of deceased borrowers (see table 1). These  options can help delay and, in some cases, avoid foreclosure.", "According to officials from HUD\u2019s Office of General Counsel, HUD does  not have the statutory authority to require servicers to provide HECM  borrowers foreclosure prevention options. Our analysis of FHA data  found that servicers\u2019 use of selected foreclosure prevention options for  HECM borrowers was limited or that FHA did not have readily available  information to assess the extent of use, as follows:  Mortgagee optional election assignments. According to information  generated by FHA, HECM servicers submitted 1,445 requests for  mortgagee optional election assignments from June 2015 (when FHA  made this option available) through September 30, 2018 (see table 2). In  total, FHA approved roughly 70 percent (1,013) of the requests and  denied the remaining 30 percent (432).", "According to FHA officials, the top two reasons for denying mortgagee  optional election assignments were HECM servicers not meeting the  deadline for electing to pursue the assignment and not meeting the  deadline to initiate the assignment. FHA officials told us the third most  common reason for denial was a nonborrowing spouse not submitting  evidence of marketable title to the property or the legal right to remain in  the property for life within required time frames. With respect to the 432  denials, FHA provided information indicating that as of May 31, 2019, 79  percent (342) of the associated loans had not terminated; 14 percent (62  loans) terminated because the loan balance had been paid off; and the  remaining 7 percent ended in foreclosure (22 loans), deed-in-lieu of  foreclosure (four loans), or short sale (two loans).", "Estimating the universe of HECMs potentially eligible for mortgagee  optional election assignments is difficult because nonborrowing spouses  were not listed on loan documentation for HECMs originated prior to  August 4, 2014. As a result, FHA does not know how many eligible  nonborrowing spouses could have, but did not, apply for the mortgagee  optional election assignment, or how many are potentially eligible to apply  for it in the future. FHA officials told us they have relied on an industry  association and HECM servicers to estimate how many nonborrowing  spouses may be associated with pre-August 2014 HECMs.", "FHA officials told us they sent letters to borrowers with FHA-assigned  HECMs that were originated prior to August 4, 2014, to inform them of the  mortgagee optional election process and ask them to self-identify whether  there was a nonborrowing spouse associated with their loan. FHA officials  also noted they were drafting a similar letter for servicers to send to  borrowers with HECMs not assigned to FHA. As of August 2019, the  servicer letter was still in draft form, pending completion of an ongoing  internal review of FHA\u2019s mortgagee optional election assignment  processes and the related time frames. FHA officials said once the  ongoing review is complete, they anticipated that FHA would issue a new  mortgagee letter with revised time frames that would afford both HECM  servicers and borrowers more time to meet FHA requirements for  mortgagee optional election assignments.", "Repayment plans. Our analysis of FHA data showed that 22 percent of  borrowers with property charge defaults were granted a repayment plan  from April 2015 (the effective date of FHA\u2019s current repayment plan  policy) through the end of fiscal year 2018. All five legal aid organizations  we interviewed said the availability of repayment plans was a top  concern. For example, for some of their clients, repayment plans were  unavailable because the borrowers did not meet certain financial  requirements. In contrast, representatives of the top five HECM servicers  told us they generally do offer repayment plans when feasible to help  borrowers delay or avoid foreclosure. Servicers we interviewed noted that  while repayment plans can delay or avoid foreclosure, they are rarely  successful in the long-run and borrowers in such plans often miss  payments. Servicers said the same reasons that typically contribute to  initial defaults also explain why repayment plans are rarely successful.  For example, borrowers on limited incomes may struggle to pay  increasing property tax and insurance costs or may fall behind on  property charges when the death of a spouse reduces their income.", "At-risk extensions. Our analysis of FHA data found that from April 2015  (the effective date of FHA\u2019s at-risk extension policy) through the end of  fiscal year 2018, about 2 percent of borrowers with property charge  defaults received an at-risk extension. To grant an at-risk extension, FHA  requires HECM servicers to provide valid documentation that the  youngest living borrower is at least 80 years of age and has critical  circumstances such as a terminal illness, long-term physical disability, or  a unique occupancy need (for example, terminal illness of family member  living in the home). Representatives from one legal aid organization told  us that some HECM servicers have straightforward requirements for the  documentation borrowers must submit to obtain an at-risk extension,  while others do not. Representatives from another legal aid organization  said that meeting FHA\u2019s annual renewal requirement for at-risk  extensions was challenging for some borrowers because they have to  submit documentation to HECM servicers every year as they age and  continue to struggle with serious health issues or disabilities.", "Low-balance extensions. FHA officials told us they do not track how  often HECM servicers use the option to delay calling a loan due and  payable if the borrower has unpaid property charges of less than $2,000.  Our analysis of FHA data on servicer advances found that approximately  8,800 HECMs that terminated in fiscal years 2014 through 2018 had  unpaid property charges of less than $2,000 at the time of termination.  Some of these HECMs may have been eligible for a low-balance  extension when they terminated. Representatives from one legal aid  organization said they represented a HECM borrower who was at risk of  foreclosure for having 27 cents in unpaid property charges. HECM  servicers told us they use the low-balance extension option to varying  degrees. For example, representatives from one servicer said the servicer  follows instructions from the entity that owns the HECM and, in some  cases, the owners of the loan do not want to offer the low-balance  extension to the borrower. In these cases the servicer calls the loan due  and payable for any amount in unpaid property charges and initiates the  foreclosure process in accordance with FHA regulations. Another HECM  servicer told us it tries to use the low-balance extension every time a  borrower owes less than $2,000 in unpaid property charges."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Weaknesses Exist in HECM Termination Data, Performance Assessment, and Portfolio Monitoring FHA Lacks Comprehensive Data on Reasons for HECM Terminations", "paragraphs": ["Since fiscal year 2013, FHA has used the HERMIT system to collect data  on the servicing of HECMs, but the system does not contain  comprehensive and accurate data about the reasons why HECMs  terminate, a key servicing event.

However, as noted previously in figure 4, for about 30 percent of  HECM terminations from fiscal years 2014 through 2018 (roughly 78,000  loans), we were unable to determine the reason for termination.  Specifically, for these loans we could not identify in HERMIT any  associated borrower death or default, or evidence that the borrower  repaid, refinanced, moved, or conveyed title. Instead, these loans were  coded as terminating for \u201cother reasons\u201d or coded based on how the debt  was satisfied rather than an actual termination reason.", "The HERMIT User Guide provides a list of termination codes available in  the system, but the list and guide have shortcomings that limit analysis of  HECM terminations. First, the list includes codes servicers can use to  indicate that a loan terminated for \u201cother reasons,\u201d but the guide does not  specify what these other reasons are. However, servicers have been  using the \u201cother reasons\u201d code increasingly over the past 5 years. We  asked servicers how they used the \u201cother reasons\u201d code and found  inconsistency in and uncertainty about its use. For example, servicers\u2019  responses ranged from not using it at all, to using it when they did not  intend to file an insurance claim with FHA, to not being sure under what  circumstances they used it.", "Second, the list of termination codes consists of both reasons for  termination and descriptions of how the debt was satisfied. As a result,  the final status code of some loans in HERMIT shows only the way in  which the debt was satisfied\u2014for instance, a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure,  foreclosure, or short sale. These codes could apply to terminations  resulting from the borrower dying, defaulting, or moving and do not  ultimately provide a specific reason for loan termination.", "FHA officials were unaware of any proxy variables that we could use to  help identify the underlying termination reasons for these loans. The  officials said the termination reasons are available on an individual loan  basis in the HERMIT system but not in an extractable form. As  discussed later in this report, FHA does not regularly track and report on  HECM termination reasons, due partly to this system limitation.", "The limitations in FHA\u2019s data are inconsistent with federal internal control  standards, which require agencies to use quality information to achieve  their objectives.

Performance assessment can provide important  information about whether, and why, a program is working well or not.  Additionally, OMB Circular A-129 states that agencies must establish  appropriate performance indicators for federal credit programs, such as  the HECM program, and that such indicators should be reviewed  periodically. It states further that agency management structures should  clearly delineate accountability and responsibility for defining performance  indicators and monitoring and assessing program performance.", "We found limitations in FHA\u2019s performance assessment of the HECM  program, specifically a lack of performance indicators and recent program  evaluations:  Lack of HECM performance indicators. According to HUD\u2019s strategic  plan for fiscal years 2018\u20132022 and the agency\u2019s most recent annual  performance report, the HECM program falls under the strategic goal of  advancing economic opportunity and the strategic objective of supporting  fair, sustainable homeownership and financial viability. The strategic  plan and annual performance report include some strategies for achieving  this objective, such as modernizing FHA underwriting guidelines, lending  standards, and servicing protocols to serve the needs of borrowers,  protect taxpayers, and ensure the sustainability of FHA\u2019s program.  However, none of the six performance indicators associated with this  strategic objective and discussed in the strategic plan or corresponding  performance report are HECM-specific. Four of the indicators focus on  FHA-insured forward mortgages. Another indicator focuses on  construction of manufactured housing. The remaining indicator\u2014 maintaining a capital reserve ratio for FHA\u2019s Mutual Mortgage Insurance  Fund that meets or exceeds the statutory minimum requirement\u2014 encompasses both forward mortgages and HECMs but does not provide  specific information about HECM loan outcomes, risk factors, or loan  characteristics.", "Additionally, FHA\u2019s annual reports to Congress on the financial status of  the insurance fund contain multiple tables of HECM data but limited  information on loan outcomes. For example, among other things, the  fiscal year 2018 report provides the number of new HECM originations,  the average age of new borrowers, the amount of HECM insurance  claims paid, and estimates of the HECM portfolio\u2019s capital position.  However, the report does not include other information that would provide  insight into loan outcomes, such as the percentage of HECM terminations  due to borrower defaults, the proportion of active HECMs with delinquent  property charges, or the percentage of distressed HECM borrowers who  have received foreclosure prevention options.", "Limited program evaluations. The last comprehensive evaluations of  the HECM program were done in 2000 and 1995. Officials said they  were in the planning phase for a new evaluation of the HECM program  but had not set a start date and did not expect the evaluation to include  an analysis of reasons for HECM terminations or the use of foreclosure  prevention options for borrowers in default. Instead, the officials told us  the evaluation would focus on the impact of an FHA policy change  implemented in 2015 that requires prospective HECM borrowers to  undergo a financial assessment to evaluate their ability to pay ongoing  property charges. While financial assessments could help reduce tax and  insurance defaults, and ultimately foreclosures, they only apply to new  HECMs issued on or after the effective date of the policy (April 27, 2015)  and are not relevant to other HECMs within the portfolio. Therefore, for  most of the HECM portfolio, an equally important consideration is the  impact of FHA\u2019s policy changes that created foreclosure prevention  options for distressed borrowers. As previously noted, borrower defaults  have accounted for an increasing proportion of terminations in recent  years, and in fiscal year 2018, borrower defaults made up 18 percent of  terminations. Expanding the program evaluation to include the impact of  foreclosure prevention options would provide a more complete picture of  how well FHA is reducing defaults in the HECM portfolio and helping  HECM borrowers.", "FHA officials acknowledged the need for more performance assessment  of the HECM program. The officials said their recent focus has been on  financial aspects of the program, in particular losses associated with  insurance claims. According to the FHA Commissioner, a key challenge  for the HECM program is that FHA has historically administered it without  a designated program head. The 2000 program evaluation noted that  lenders and servicers found it frustrating that FHA did not have one  person with responsibility for the HECM program. Further, the 2000  program evaluation noted that the division of responsibility for the  program fell across many offices and that it was hard to find senior  managers with a sense of ownership for the HECM program. In January  2019, an economist from HUD\u2019s Office of Policy Development and  Research transferred to the Office of Housing (which includes FHA) to  serve as a Senior Advisor to the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Single  Family Programs, with a focus on the HECM program.", "Without more comprehensive performance indicators and program  evaluations, FHA lacks information that could be useful for monitoring the  effects of recent policy changes and may be missing evidence of the  need for further program improvements.

FHA officials told us that while  data on defaults and use of foreclosure prevention options have generally  been available in HERMIT since 2015, FHA was unable to obtain reports  on these topics until the summer of 2018 because of contract funding  limitations. FHA officials said that starting in September 2018, FHA began  receiving regular reports from its HERMIT system contractor on issues  such as HECMs assigned to FHA; HECM origination, assignment, and  termination activity by month; summary information on the number and  dollar amount of HECMs originated each year; and HECMs with a default  date. Additionally, around the same time, FHA requested and received ad  hoc reports (one-time reports created for specific purposes) from the  contractor that included spreadsheets of all active HECMs with a  repayment plan and all active HECMs for which there was an identified  nonborrowing spouse.", "FHA officials said the purpose of the reports generated from HERMIT is  to help FHA better manage HECM program performance.

However, FHA  officials told us they subsequently looked more closely into the issue and  redid the analysis using more reliable and updated information from  January 2013 through December 2017. The revised analysis showed that  61 percent of foreclosures over that period were due to borrower deaths,  37 percent were due to borrower defaults, and 2 percent were due to  conveyance of title.

However, our analysis of HERMIT data and reports generated by FHA\u2019s  HERMIT contractor suggest that the system can be used for this broader  purpose. Without more robust program analysis and internal reporting,  FHA is not well positioned to detect and respond to any emerging issues  and trends in the HECM portfolio. As previously discussed, these trends  include growing numbers of HECMs entering default and an increasing  number of loans being assigned to FHA.", "FHA has not evaluated its foreclosure prioritization process for FHA- assigned HECMs. As previously noted, FHA-assigned loans are a  growing part of the HECM portfolio. According to FHA officials, the  agency generally does not foreclose on borrowers whose HECMs have  been assigned to FHA and who are in default due to unpaid property  charges. According to FHA, the properties associated with these loans  are typically occupied. FHA officials said the agency prioritizes processing  foreclosures on assigned HECMs for which the property is vacant  (because the borrower passed away, for example). FHA officials said that  prioritizing foreclosure processing for those loans and delays by the  Department of Justice in completing those foreclosures has effectively  resulted in few foreclosures on assigned loans with property charge  defaults. However, FHA regulations state that servicers generally must  initiate foreclosure within 6 months of calling a loan due and payable due  to a death or default (if the borrower or heirs have not yet paid the debt  off).", "FHA\u2019s prioritization of processing vacant properties for foreclosure and  generally not foreclosing on FHA-assigned HECMs with a property  charge default raises issues and potential risks that FHA has not fully  analyzed. First, defaulted borrowers whose loans are privately owned  (that is, have not been assigned to FHA) face a greater risk of foreclosure  than defaulted borrowers with FHA-assigned loans. According to a  representative from one HECM servicer we interviewed, FHA\u2019s practice is  unfair because it treats HECM borrowers inconsistently. Second, FHA\u2019s  foreclosure prioritization processing may create a financial incentive for  HECM borrowers with assigned loans to not pay their property charges,  which, in turn, can have negative financial consequences for FHA,  localities, and taxpayers. For example, because FHA does not foreclose  on assigned loans in tax and insurance default, FHA advances tax and  insurance payments on behalf of the borrower and adds them to the loan  balance to secure and maintain its first-lien position on the mortgaged  property. This makes it more likely that the loan balance will increase to  a point that it exceeds the value of the home. When the borrower dies or  vacates such a property, FHA may not be able to recoup the loan balance  in a foreclosure sale, resulting in a loss to the insurance fund.", "As of August 2019, FHA had not evaluated the various risks of generally  not foreclosing on assigned HECMs with property charge defaults.

In two of the three reviews, FHA found deficiencies in  the servicers\u2019 filing of insurance claims. For example, in one review,  FHA identified multiple cases where the servicer submitted claims that  were greater than the amounts warranted, including excess attorney  and appraisal fees, property preservation and protection expenses,  and interest costs. In another review, FHA found numerous instances  where the servicer missed various deadlines\u2014including for submitting  claims, commencing foreclosure, and obtaining appraisals\u2014and  therefore was not entitled to the full claim amounts it received.", "Loan disbursements. One of the three reviews found numerous  instances in which the servicer did not respond to borrowers\u2019 requests  for payment plan changes within the required time frame of 5  business days, and therefore did not make timely loan disbursements  to borrowers.", "FHA required these servicers to take corrective actions, including  updating quality control plans, revising policies and procedures,  reimbursing FHA for unwarranted claim amounts, indemnifying FHA for  losses on a loan, and paying late charges to borrowers who did not  receive timely loan disbursements. FHA has the option of referring  violations of FHA requirements to HUD\u2019s Mortgagee Review Board, which  can take administrative actions such as issuing letters of reprimand,  suspending or withdrawing approval to participate in FHA programs,  entering into settlement agreements to bring an entity into compliance,  and imposing civil money penalties. FHA officials said they had not  referred any HECM servicers to the board as a result of findings from on- site reviews.", "According to FHA\u2019s current Director of the Quality Assurance Division,  under previous leadership, the division suspended on-site reviews of  HECM servicers after fiscal year 2016 because of servicers\u2019 concerns  about the clarity and consistency with which FHA was conducting the  reviews and applying enforcement remedies. He said the Quality  Assurance Division had intended to revise its guidance for conducting the  reviews and then resume them, but the effort had stalled during a change  in leadership. The current Director said he was not aware that HECM  servicing reviews had been suspended until the fall of 2017, when the  division began targeting on-site reviews for fiscal year 2018, and noticed  that HECM servicers were not included in the prior year\u2019s targeting  methodology.", "The lack of recent HECM servicer reviews is problematic for a number of  reasons. First, as previously noted, the number of HECM borrowers  defaulting on their loans has grown in recent years. As a result, knowing  whether servicers are providing borrowers with accurate and timely  communications about their mortgage obligations and the status of their  loans has become increasingly critical. Second, FHA has recently made  program changes and implemented foreclosure prevention options, such  as at-risk extensions and mortgagee optional election assignments, to  help struggling borrowers and nonborrowing spouses delay or avoid  foreclosure. But FHA does not know how effectively servicers inform  borrowers of these options and use these tools due to its lack of  oversight. Third, as discussed earlier, the majority of HECM servicers are  nonbank entities that may pose risks because they are not subject to the  same comprehensive federal safety and soundness regulations as banks  and rely on funding sources, such as lines of credit, that may be less  stable than deposits.", "The Director of the Quality Assurance Division said FHA plans to begin  conducting HECM servicer reviews in fiscal year 2020 but will first need to  revise its procedures for reviewing HECM servicers, which were last  updated in 2009. However, the Director told us the division decided not to  develop criteria for selecting HECM servicers for review. Instead, he said  FHA plans to review all HECM servicers with significant portfolios at least  once every 3 years, starting with the three servicers that account for 96  percent of the HECM portfolio.", "While FHA\u2019s plan to review HECM servicers with significant portfolios  captures one aspect of portfolio risk (loan volume), it does not account for  other risk indicators that OMB Circular A-129 says agencies should  consider. The circular also encourages agencies to develop risk-rating  systems that incorporate these indicators. While the current HECM  servicing market is dominated by a small number of companies, the ability  to prioritize on-site reviews based on risk ratings will be important if the  market becomes less concentrated in the future. Additionally, some  HECM servicers may warrant review more frequently than once every 3  years if their business volume or performance poses substantial risks to  FHA or to borrowers.

For example, CFPB\u2019s examiners are directed to determine  whether information provided to the borrowers about life expectancy set- aside accounts (an FHA requirement) is clear, prominent, and readily  understandable, and whether the borrower incurred penalties or  unnecessary charges in the event the servicer failed to make  disbursements of set-aside funds for insurance, taxes, and other charges  with respect to the property in a timely manner. CFPB examiners also are  directed to determine whether the servicer referred a HECM to  foreclosure improperly after the death of a borrower, such as when an  eligible nonborrowing spouse still occupies the home. If CFPB\u2019s reverse  mortgage examinations identify violations, CFPB may require the  examined entity to take corrective actions, which are recorded in the  examination results as matters requiring attention.", "CFPB examinations of reverse mortgage servicers have found  deficiencies in monitoring of servicing actions, compliance with consumer  protection laws, and communications with consumers. For example,  CFPB reported in the March 2019 edition of its Supervisory Highlights  that one or more reverse mortgage servicing examinations found cases  where the servicer did not provide the heirs of deceased borrowers a  complete list of the documents needed to evaluate their case for a  foreclosure extension. (Extensions can give heirs additional time to sell  or purchase the property and delay or avoid foreclosure.) As a result, in  some instances, one or more servicers foreclosed rather than seeking a  foreclosure extension from FHA. According to CFPB, in response to the  examinations, one or more servicers planned to improve communications  with borrowers\u2019 heirs, including specifying the documents needed for a  foreclosure extension and the relevant deadlines. CFPB officials said they  plan to continue examining reverse mortgage servicers.", "In addition to conducting examinations and issuing matters requiring  attention, CFPB officials said the bureau has other options\u2014including  issuing warning letters and taking enforcement actions\u2014to stop unlawful  practices or promote future compliance by supervised entities. Warning  letters advise companies that certain practices may violate federal  consumer financial law. Enforcement actions are legal actions against  an entity initiated through federal district court or by an administrative  adjudication proceeding. CFPB officials told us the bureau had not  issued any warning letters or enforcement actions against HECM  servicers as of August 2019.", "While CFPB has examined reverse mortgage servicers and plans to  continue doing so, CFPB officials said the bureau and FHA do not have  an agreement in place to share supervisory information, which inhibits  sharing of examination results. Information-sharing agreements may  address topics such as what and how information will be shared and  handling of sensitive information. CFPB officials said that an agreement  with FHA would be needed to ensure that supervisory information in the  bureau\u2019s examinations is kept confidential. Under the Dodd-Frank Wall  Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, CFPB must share results of  the examination of a supervised entity with another federal agency that  has jurisdiction over that entity, provided that CFPB received from the  agency reasonable assurances as to the confidentiality of the information  disclosed.", "In addition, in previously issued work, we noted that interagency  collaboration can serve a number of purposes, including, among other  things, policy development, oversight and monitoring, and information  sharing and communication.", "CFPB officials said CFPB and FHA had taken initial steps in 2017 toward  developing an information-sharing agreement. However, as of August  2019, an information-sharing agreement had not been completed. CFPB  officials told us there were existing ways for the two agencies to share  examination findings, but that an information-sharing agreement would  facilitate the process. CFPB officials said developing information- sharing agreements can be a lengthy process and that both agencies had  other competing priorities. However, because of the limited information  sharing between CFPB and FHA, FHA is not benefiting from oversight  findings about servicers it could rely on to help implement the HECM  program. Having this information is particularly important given that FHA  does not comprehensively review HECM servicers itself and CFPB\u2019s  examinations address a number of FHA requirements. Access to CFPB\u2019s  examination results could enhance FHA\u2019s oversight of HECM servicers  and potentially help it respond to consumer protection issues facing  HECM borrowers."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "CFPB Collects and Analyzes Consumer Complaints on Reverse Mortgages, but FHA Does Not Use All Available Data CFPB Has Received About 3,600 Reverse Mortgage Complaints since 2011", "paragraphs": ["CFPB collects, analyzes, and reports on consumer complaints related to  reverse mortgages.

Compared to the percentage of all  types of mortgage complaints filed during the 4-year period, the  percentage of reverse mortgage complaints filed through the website  (56 percent) was lower than the corresponding percentage for  complaints about all types of mortgages (67 percent). Representatives  from legal aid organizations representing HECM borrowers said that  reverse mortgage consumers may be less likely to file a complaint  through a website because of limitations sometimes related to aging\u2014 for example, lack of internet access or computer skills. Additionally,  representatives from three of the five organizations said seniors may  suffer from health or capacity issues, such as hearing, vision, or  memory loss, that may make it difficult for them to file or follow up on  a complaint. For these reasons, seniors may not be submitting  complaints through CFPB\u2019s website and seniors\u2019 complaints about  reverse mortgages may be underreported in general.", "By company. Companies that were the subject of reverse mortgage  complaints included both lenders and servicers. From 2015 through  2018, five companies were the subject of more than 100 complaints  each, ranging from a low of 116 to a high of 506. Together, these five  companies accounted for 61 percent (1,509) of the reverse mortgage  complaints CFPB received.

The largest  consumer-described issue category (47 percent) involved consumers  (or someone complaining on behalf of the consumer) who said they  were at risk of foreclosure or in the foreclosure process. For  example, some consumers said they or the borrower they represent  had received a notice of default, were in due and payable status, or  were at risk of foreclosure. Some consumers sought help in  preventing foreclosure or felt they were wrongly being foreclosed on.  In 16 of the 47 complaints about being at risk of or in foreclosure,  consumers also cited concerns about property taxes, insurance, or  other property charges.", "Poor communication on a servicing or lending issue. The second  largest consumer-described issue category (42 percent) involved  complaints about poor communication on a reverse mortgage  servicing or lending issue. These complaints included concerns about  a lack of communication or communications that were unclear or  unresponsive to the consumer\u2019s needs. Complaints in this category  often overlapped with those about being at risk of or in foreclosure.  For example, some of these complaints included consumers\u2019  concerns that they had not received information about the status of or  reason for a possible foreclosure from their servicer or did not get  responses to their inquiries.", "Loan origination issues. The third largest complaint category  involved problems occurring at loan origination (29 percent). These  complaints included consumers\u2019 concerns that the amount of funds  available from their reverse mortgage was less than expected or that  interest rates or fees were not disclosed or explained to them. The  complaints also included cases where the adult children of borrowers  said they felt the lender took advantage of their parents.", "Estate-management issues. Twenty-seven percent of consumer  complaints were about estate management issues. Complaints  involving estate-management were often submitted by deceased  borrowers\u2019 families or heirs.

Federal internal control standards state that agencies  should use quality information to achieve the entity\u2019s objectives, including  using relevant data from reliable internal and external sources.  Additionally, in prior work we identified practices to enhance collaboration  across agencies, including leveraging agency resources.", "According to agency officials, FHA\u2019s two main methods for collecting  customer inquiries and complaints are hotlines operated by the agency\u2019s  National Servicing Center and the FHA Resource Center. Historically,  the National Servicing Center was FHA\u2019s primary method for collecting  inquiries and complaints about the HECM program. From calendar  years 2015 through 2018, the National Servicing Center received about  105,000 HECM-related calls. During this same period, the FHA Resource  Center received 147 HECM-related calls. In April 2019, the FHA  Resource Center became the primary entity for collecting, recording, and  responding to all HECM-related calls. FHA officials told us they  transferred these responsibilities from the National Servicing Center to  the FHA Resource Center to help improve call management.", "While this change could help improve customer service, it would not fully  resolve limitations we found in FHA\u2019s approach to collecting and  recording HECM inquiries and complaints that diminish the usefulness of  the information for program oversight. These limitations include the  following:  Information is not suitable for thematic analysis. Both the National  Servicing Center and the FHA Resource Center do not collect call  information in a way that would allow FHA to readily analyze the data  for themes. For example, both centers do not reliably differentiate  between inquiries and complaints\u2014a potentially important distinction  for determining appropriate agency-level responses (for example,  creating informational materials to address frequently asked questions  from borrowers or investigating problematic servicing practices after  repeated complaints). Additionally, while both the centers collect data  on the reason for calls, neither did so in a systematic way that would  allow FHA to readily determine how frequently issues are being  raised. For example, neither centers\u2019 data systems contained  standardized categories or menus with options for recording reasons  for calls. As a result, the FHA Resource Center\u2019s data from 2015  through 2018 contained more than 100 separate reasons for 147  HECM-related calls. Some of the reasons the center recorded were  too specific (for example, a property address or a case number) to be  useful for identifying themes, while others were so similar that they do  not provide meaningful distinctions (but could be combined into fewer,  potentially more useful categories). We noted similar limitations in  the National Servicing Center\u2019s data, which included ambiguous call  reasons such as \u201chistory\u201d and \u201cdocuments,\u201d and categories that could  be collapsed, which hinders thematic analysis.", "Customer type is not recorded. The National Servicing Center,  which received the large majority of HECM-related calls to FHA, did  not record information on the type of customer that made the call.  National Servicing Center guidance for staff says customers include  borrowers, nonprofit organizations, government entities, real estate  brokers and agents, title companies, attorneys, lenders and servicers,  and HUD employees, but its data system does not include these  categories. Information on customer type could be useful in  identifying issues facing different populations of callers and could help  FHA tailor strategies for addressing their concerns. In contrast, the  FHA Resource Center\u2019s data system does include categories for  customer type for the smaller number of HECM-related inquiries and  complaints it received. Because the FHA Resource Center\u2019s system is  now FHA\u2019s primary repository for new HECM-related calls, information  on customer type should be available for future inquiries and  complaints. However, this information is not available for the bulk of  HECM-related calls FHA received in prior years.", "FHA officials said the agency uses customer complaint and inquiry data  to improve customer service. For example, FHA officials said the National  Servicing Center monitors calls on a daily basis to ensure that prompt  responses are provided. Similarly, FHA officials said they review call data  monthly to identify training needs of servicers or contractors and potential  process changes to improve customer experience with the call process.  However, FHA does not analyze data for other purposes that could  enhance program oversight, such as determining which HECM servicers  and lenders receive the most complaints, targeting entities for on-site  reviews, or identifying topics that may need additional borrower  education.", "FHA also does not use CFPB\u2019s consumer complaint data to inform  management and oversight of the HECM program, even though some of  the information could be useful to the agency. For example, according to  CFPB\u2019s complaint data for 2015 through 2018, approximately 6 percent of  reverse mortgage complaints were about FHA\u2019s servicing contractor. FHA  officials said they do not review CFPB\u2019s complaint data because they  believe the data are too limited to be useful and because they have  concerns about CFPB\u2019s controls over data integrity. However, as our  analysis shows, CFPB\u2019s data can be used to identify consumer  concerns\u2014such as difficulties avoiding or navigating foreclosure or  problems communicating with servicers\u2014that may merit additional  attention by FHA. Additionally, CFPB\u2019s Office of Inspector General  recently reviewed CFPB\u2019s management controls for the Consumer  Complaint Database and did not identify major data integrity issues that  would preclude use of the data for general oversight purposes.

This rate, which  provides an indication of how popular HECMs are among the population  of senior homeowners, has not reached 1 percent and has fallen in recent  years. In addition, since calendar year 2010, the volume of HECM  originations has declined and is about half of what originations had been  at their peak.

However, the popularity of reverse mortgages has declined in  recent years for a number of possible reasons. We developed an  econometric model to examine the relationship between HECM take-up  rates and a number of explanatory variables. For additional information  and detailed results from our econometric model of factors associated  with HECM take-up rates, see appendix II. Among other factors, our  model results indicate that house price changes, home equity, and prior  use of other home equity lending products were statistically significant (at  the 1 percent level) in explaining the decrease in HECM take-up rates  since 2010.", "Changes in house prices. The decline in take-up rates may reflect  lower house prices, which have limited the number of households with  sufficient home equity (as a percentage of home value) to benefit from  a HECM. Our model estimated that, controlling for other factors, take- up rates were higher when house price growth was large and there  was a history of house price volatility compared to either relatively low  house price appreciation or stable house prices. This result is  consistent with senior homeowners using reverse mortgages to insure  against house price declines. For example, researchers have noted  that in states where house prices are volatile and the current level is  above the long-term norm, seniors anticipate future reductions in  house prices and lock in their home equity gains by obtaining a  reverse mortgage.", "Home equity and prior home equity borrowing. Additionally, we  found that controlling for other factors, take-up rates were higher  where home equity (house value minus any mortgage debt) was high.  In these cases, senior homeowners tap into their high home equity to  help supplement income with proceeds from the HECM. Further, we  found that among seniors who had previously used other home equity  lending products, such as home equity loans, take-up rates were high.", "This result is consistent with seniors using HECMs to pay off these  loans.", "Academics and industry experts have also noted possible reasons why  the popularity of reverse mortgages is limited. For example, senior  homeowners can tap their home equity by other means, such as home  equity loans, home equity lines of credit, and cash-out refinancing.  Some of these options may be less expensive than reverse mortgages.  Seniors can also downsize\u2013\u2013sell their current home and buy or rent a  less expensive one\u2014and keep the difference to supplement retirement  savings. Seniors have other ways to supplement their retirement income  and age in place\u2014for example, one academic noted that some seniors  rent out rooms in their homes, potentially using online marketplaces such  as Airbnb. Additionally, our literature review and interviews with  academics identified other factors that have may have contributed to  limited interest in reverse mortgages, including the following:", "Exit of large bank lenders. As previously noted, banks, thrifts, and  credit unions were historically the primary lenders and servicers of  mortgage loans. Following the 2007\u20132009 financial crisis and  subsequent revisions to regulatory bank capital requirements, banks  reevaluated the benefits and costs of being in the mortgage lending  market, as well as retaining mortgages and the right to service them.  Today, the reverse mortgage market is dominated by a relatively  small number of nonbank entities. The exit of large, well-known  lenders, such as Bank of America and Wells Fargo, from the HECM  market created opportunities for smaller nonbank lenders to enter the  market. According to an academic we spoke with, in addition to  new capital requirements, large banks may have exited the market  partly out of concern that they risked damage to their reputations if  they foreclosed on seniors who defaulted on their HECMs.  Additionally, a 2018 survey of lenders found a variety of reasons why  lenders have stopped originating HECMs, including potential  reputation risk and concerns about HECMs being a distraction from  their forward mortgage business. Although the HECM market is  currently served by several nonbank lenders, their smaller scale,  limited access to capital, and limited name recognition may limit their  ability to reach more potential borrowers.", "FHA policy changes to the HECM program. FHA has made several  policy changes in recent years to help stabilize the financial  performance of the HECM portfolio and strengthen financial criteria for  HECM borrowers. Although many of the HECM policy changes  introduced since 2010 were intended to minimize program losses,  they also may have reduced take-up rates. For example, in 2010 FHA  reduced the amount of money a borrower can get from a HECM.  Some academics we interviewed said reductions in the loan amounts  that borrowers can receive likely reduced demand for HECMs. In  2015, FHA changed financial requirements for HECMs to include a  financial assessment of the prospective borrower prior to loan  approval. Some academics said these changes made other home  equity extraction options that already had similar requirements more  competitive with HECMs.", "Consumers\u2019 misunderstanding and product complexity. A 2013  survey of U.S. homeowners aged 58 and older revealed a lack of  knowledge of reverse mortgages. The survey found that awareness of reverse mortgages is high, but knowledge of mortgage terms is  limited. Additionally, the survey found that respondents perceived  reverse mortgages to be fairly complex.", "Consumers\u2019 perception of the product. Academics we spoke with  told us that consumers\u2019 negative perception of reverse mortgages  likely has a negative influence on take-up rates. For example, three  academics elaborated that consumers build their perception of the  product based on the industry\u2019s marketing and advertising, which  includes television commercials with celebrity spokespeople that may  appeal to individuals facing economic hardship. Additionally, a 2016  survey of Americans aged 55 to 75 found that many respondents had  reservations about reverse mortgages, including that they are often  considered a financial tool of last resort. For example, only 27  percent of survey respondents stated that, in general, it was better to  use a reverse mortgage earlier in retirement as opposed to using it as  a last resort.", "Relatively high origination costs and fees. HECMs also may be  unpopular with borrowers because they can be more expensive than  other home equity lending products, such as home equity lines of  credit. For example, HECM borrowers are charged various fees,  such as the up-front insurance premiums that FHA charges as  compensation for its insurance guarantee and origination fees lenders  charge. The up-front insurance premium is 2 percent of the  mortgage\u2019s maximum claim amount. Also, for origination fees, lenders  can charge the greater of $2,500 or 2 percent of the first $200,000 of  the mortgage\u2019s maximum claim amount plus 1 percent of the  maximum claim amount over $200,000. However, origination fees are  currently capped at $6,000. Further, because borrowers do not make  monthly payments on the loans, the interest will accumulate over time,  and compounding the interest, the loan balance can rise quickly.", "Seniors\u2019 attitudes toward debt and desire to leave a bequest.", "Some academics have noted that seniors tend to be financially  conservative and avoid debt in old age\u2013\u2013behavior driven by their  desire to leave a bequest or save for emergency expenses or long- term care costs. For example, academics have noted that some  impediments to home equity extraction are behavioral and have to do  with seniors\u2019 long-held values, beliefs, and attitudes, such as to  maximize wealth transfer to heirs by leaving a bequest.

Regarding our recommendation on HECM  performance indicators and program evaluation, FHA agreed that  periodic review and reporting of HECM performance indicators is  critically important and said it would work to expand its reporting to  include the level of foreclosure prevention activity. However, FHA  added that there were no HECM metrics for early default or  delinquency rates, as those measures are linked to the amortizing  nature of forward mortgages. We agree that early default and  delinquency rates are not suitable metrics for HECMs, and our draft  report did not suggest that they are. Our report focuses on metrics  that would be pertinent to HECMs and that would provide additional  insight into HECM loan performance. These include the percentage of  HECM terminations due to borrower defaults, the proportion of active  HECMs with delinquent property charges, and the amount of funds  servicers have advanced on behalf of borrowers. We revised the  recommendation in our final report to more specifically describe the  types of performance indicators that FHA should establish and report  on. In addition, FHA disagreed with a statement in our draft report that  its evaluation of the HECM program has been limited. FHA said it  engages in robust HECM program evaluation and cited an example  that led to recent changes in FHA\u2019s appraisal practices for HECMs.  While our draft report described the change in FHA\u2019s appraisal  practices, we updated our final report to include reference to the FHA  study that prompted the appraisal change. However, we maintain that  FHA\u2019s evaluation of the HECM program has been limited because the  last comprehensive program evaluation was completed 19 years ago  and FHA has not assessed the impact of HECM foreclosure  prevention options.", "Recommendations 3 and 4. FHA agreed with our recommendations  to develop analytic tools for monitoring HECM loan outcomes and to  evaluate its foreclosure prioritization process for FHA-assigned loans.  Regarding the latter, FHA said that it is evaluating alternative  disposition options to reduce the number of loans that must go  through foreclosure and that it would take steps to evaluate the impact  of its prioritization process to assist in future decision-making.", "Recommendation 5. FHA agreed with our recommendation to  develop and implement procedures for conducting on-site reviews of  HECM servicers, including a risk-rating system for prioritizing and  determining the frequency of reviews. As noted in our draft report,  FHA said it is in the process of updating procedures for on-site  reviews and plans to implement them in fiscal year 2020. FHA  disagreed with a statement in our draft report that FHA\u2019s oversight of  HECM servicers is limited. FHA said the HECM servicing community  is small, which allows the agency to maintain regular communication  with HECM servicers, including through training sessions and industry  working group meetings. Our draft report acknowledged FHA\u2019s  communications with servicers, but these activities are not a  substitute for in-depth compliance reviews of servicers\u2019 operations. As  our draft report stated, FHA has not conducted on-site HECM servicer  reviews since fiscal year 2013. Given the 5-year lapse in FHA\u2019s use of  this key oversight tool, we maintain that FHA\u2019s oversight of HECM  servicers has been limited.", "Recommendation 9. FHA agreed with our recommendation to  periodically analyze internal and external consumer complaint data  about reverse mortgages. FHA said it is expanding its data and  reporting capabilities as part of an information technology  modernization initiative. FHA also said that routing consumer inquiries  through the FHA Resource Center should improve data collection and  analysis.", "FHA did not explicitly agree or disagree with our recommendations to  work with CFPB to complete an agreement for sharing examination  results and to collect and record consumer inquiries and complaints in a  manner that facilitates analysis (recommendations 6 and 8, respectively).  FHA said it would explore opportunities to coordinate with CFPB where  appropriate. FHA also said that routing inquiries through the FHA  Resource Center would help identify common issues, track servicer  performance, and inform policy decisions.

However, the factors used in the  model (demographic and socioeconomic characteristics and housing  market conditions) are generally available at the state level or at the ZIP  code level from the Census Bureau and other sources. There are  advantages and disadvantages to using state-level or ZIP-code-level  data. Given the low HECM take-up rates (see fig. 7 earlier in this report),  using ZIP-code data would generally imply very low, if not zero, take-up  rates across a large number of ZIP codes, which would make it harder to  identify effects from our model. Also, not all of the data for the factors  used in the model are available for every ZIP code with a HECM  origination\u2014including the home equity extraction variables\u2014which would  lead to exclusion of some areas, resulting in potential sample-selection  bias. On the other hand, using ZIP code-level data could allow for more  heterogeneity in certain states, and certain variables such as house price  changes when measured at the ZIP code level could be closer to what  the homeowner experiences.

The interaction term for house price growth  and house price volatility is positive and significant at the 1 percent  level. This implies that within states, take-up rates were higher when  house price growth was large and when there was a history of house  price volatility compared to either relatively low house price  appreciation or stable house prices. This result is consistent with  senior homeowners using reverse mortgages to insure against house  price declines, which is supported by the positive and significant  effects of the house price volatility by itself. On the other hand, the  weak significance of house price growth by itself (at the 10 percent  level) provides only modest support for senior homeowners using  reverse mortgages purely to extract home equity.", "Home equity.
