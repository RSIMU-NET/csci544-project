Section 324 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004 required GAO to review AMEC, including its relationship to the Department of Defense's (DOD) Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) program. In accordance with the act, GAO (1) assessed the extent to which AMEC supports and complements the CTR program, (2) identified AMEC member countries' financial contributions to the program, (3) assessed AMEC's future program objectives, and (4) evaluated DOD's proposal to expand its technology development activities to Russia's Pacific region."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In a 1999 program plan to the Congress, DOD stated that AMEC projects would support the goals of the CTR program. However, we found that only one of eight AMEC projects designed to support CTR's objective of dismantling Russia's ballistic missile nuclear submarines has done so. This project involved development of a prototype 40-metric ton container to store and transport spent (used) nuclear fuel from Russia's dismantled submarines. Despite AMEC's limited contribution to CTR, DOD officials, including CTR representatives, said that most of the projects can be used to support dismantlement of other types of Russian nuclear submarines. In addition, U.S. and foreign officials cited other benefits of U.S. participation in AMEC, including promoting U.S. foreign policy objectives, particularly with Norway, and facilitating military-to-military cooperation with Russia. From 1996, when the program was established, to April 2004, AMEC member countries had contributed about $56 million to the program. The United States has been the largest contributor, providing about $31 million, or about 56 percent of the total. However, the overall U.S. contribution has decreased from fiscal year 1999 to fiscal year 2004 as U.S. funded projects have been completed and as other AMEC member countries have increased their assistance. In May 2004, AMEC developed a draft strategic plan to guide its future efforts. The plan, which is currently being reviewed by AMEC partners, proposes improving the security of Russia's nuclear submarine bases and securing spent nuclear fuel from dismantled submarines. However, securing bases could be contrary to U.S. policy, which preclude assistance to most operational Russian military sites that contain nuclear weapons, including certain naval facilities. DOD wants to expand its dismantlement technology development efforts to Russia's Pacific region, but has not adequately analyzed the condition of Russia's decommissioned nuclear submarines in the Pacific and their impact on the environment. Furthermore, DOD has not identified specific projects that would be needed beyond those already done in the Arctic region."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Prior to the collapse of the Soviet Union over a decade ago, little was  known about the extent of contamination of the Arctic environment  because of the secrecy of the former Soviet Union regarding its military  activities in the area. However, in 1993, the Russian government released a  report describing over three decades of Soviet-era dumping of radioactive  waste in the ocean as well as radioactive contamination from nuclear  submarine accidents. As a result, radioactive contamination and  environmental concerns generated by the former Soviet Union\u2019s military  presence in the Arctic region received increased attention from the  international community, including the United States. Among the greatest  concerns are the handling and storage of radioactive waste and spent  (used) nuclear fuel from Russia\u2019s fleet of 249 ballistic missile and general  purpose nuclear submarines. This fleet includes at least 116  decommissioned nuclear submarines in the Arctic region and 76  decommissioned nuclear submarines in the Pacific region. Some of these  decommissioned submarines are in poor condition, and one sank in 2003  off the coast of Norway as it was being towed to a shipyard in Russia for  dismantlement. Figure 1 shows the submarine before it sank.", "About 60 percent of Russia\u2019s decommissioned submarines still have spent  nuclear fuel on board. Vast amounts of spent nuclear fuel\u2014and liquid and  solid radioactive waste from the submarines\u2014are also being stored  temporarily on special service ships and in coastal shipyards in Russia.", "While many of Russia\u2019s aging nuclear submarines present environmental  problems, ballistic missile submarines also present a military and nuclear  proliferation threat. The United States has been working with Russia since  the mid-1990s to dismantle decommissioned Russian ballistic missile  nuclear submarines through the Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD)  Cooperative Threat Reduction program (CTR). Administered by DOD\u2019s  Defense Threat Reduction Agency, CTR funds the dismantlement of  Russia\u2019s ballistic missile nuclear submarines to help Russia meet its  commitments under arms reduction treaties with the United States. The  United States does not consider Russia\u2019s general purpose nuclear  submarines to be a military or nuclear proliferation threat and,  consequently, does not fund their dismantlement.", "As of March 2004, CTR had funded dismantlement of 27 Russian ballistic  nuclear submarines, and CTR plans to partially dismantle up to an  additional 15 submarines by 2013. Specifically, although CTR will continue  to remove the spent fuel from the ballistic missile submarines\u2019 nuclear  reactors, seal the reactors, and remove and eliminate the missile launcher  compartments from all submarines that it dismantles, it will no longer fund  the cutting up of the submarines\u2019 bows and sterns. DOD is turning over this  part of the dismantlement process to Russia because, according to DOD, it  does not directly contribute to threat reduction because the bows and  sterns do not have a military value. CTR-funded dismantlement activities  are taking place at four Russian shipyards\u2014three in the Arctic region and  one in the Pacific region.", "Figure 2 shows the location of CTR dismantlement sites and Russia\u2019s  nuclear submarines.", "To help reduce the environmental impacts of Russia\u2019s military activities in  the Arctic region, the United States, Norway, and Russia established the  Arctic Military Environmental Cooperation program (AMEC) in 1996. The  United Kingdom joined AMEC in 2003. Norway initiated AMEC and  requested that the United States participate in the program to address what  Norway perceived as significant environmental problems located on its  border with Russia. Norway is one of the world\u2019s leading seafood exporters  and was concerned that these problems would adversely affect its fishing  industry.", "AMEC has implemented its program primarily by funding projects to  develop technologies to support the dismantlement of Russia\u2019s nuclear  submarines. AMEC has focused on projects such as storing and  transporting radioactive waste from the submarines. The actual  dismantlement of Russian submarines is being funded by a number of  countries. In 2002, DOD requested congressional approval to expand its  environmental technology development activities to Russia\u2019s Pacific  region, but the Congress has not acted upon that request.", "From AMEC\u2019s inception, U.S. participation has been hindered by the lack of  liability protection. Without liability protection, the United States, its  contractors, and their employees could be held financially responsible for  an accident or incident that might occur while performing work on AMEC- funded projects in Russia. In the absence of liability protection for the  AMEC program, the United States has, for the most part, tied its  participation in AMEC projects to DOD\u2019s CTR program liability protocol:  the CTR program has liability protection for all the work that it performs in  Russia under an agreement signed in the early 1990s. In 1998, the Congress  made $5 million available to AMEC from CTR funds and directed DOD to  include within AMEC \u201ccooperative activities on environmental matters in  the Arctic region with the military departments and agencies of other  countries, including the Russian Federation.\u201d", "Eight AMEC projects were identified by DOD and U.S. AMEC program  officials as designed to be complementary and supportive of CTR program  objectives.

The program plan stated that AMEC  projects supported CTR submarine dismantlement activities. Some of the  projects were expected to provide design and engineering support, while  other projects were designed to fill gaps in the CTR program.", "According to CTR officials, however, only one AMEC project, the  development of a prototype 40-metric ton container used to store and  transport spent nuclear fuel from dismantled Russian ballistic missile  nuclear submarines, was able to meet CTR program objectives. U.S.  expenditures for this project totaled about $2.9 million, and the Navy chose  EPA\u2019s Office of International Programs to manage the project. The  containers helped solve an immediate problem\u2014finding adequate storage  capacity for the spent nuclear fuel removed from the submarines. CTR and  EPA officials told us that the storage containers solved a \u201cbottleneck,\u201d  enabling CTR to remove more spent fuel and facilitate dismantlement  efforts. According to DOD and EPA, when serially produced the AMEC  container costs 80 percent less than the cost of a Russian manufactured  storage container. CTR has purchased 25 containers and plans to purchase  an additional 35 to transport and store the spent fuel from dismantled  ballistic nuclear submarines in Russia. Russia is also using the containers  to store and transport spent nuclear fuel from general purpose nuclear  submarines. Figure 3 shows an AMEC-designed storage container.", "Regarding the other seven AMEC projects that were established to support  or complement the CTR program, we found the following:  A project, also managed by EPA, to develop a storage pad to hold the  storage containers was completed too late to support CTR\u2019s  dismantlement efforts associated with a Russian shipyard that had been  used as a CTR dismantlement site. According to AMEC and EPA  officials, the storage pad\u2019s completion was delayed due to problems  identifying and obtaining all required Russian clearances and licenses to  operate the storage pad; in the intervening time Russia decided it would  no longer dismantle ballistic missile submarines at the shipyard. As a  result, the storage pad is not used to support the CTR program but will  be used for temporary storage of spent nuclear fuel from Russia\u2019s  general purpose nuclear submarines. U.S. expenditures for this project  totaled $2.9 million.", "One project, involving development of technology to prevent corrosion  inside the spent nuclear fuel storage containers, was terminated before  completion because the CTR program withdrew its support and did not  provide liability protection. In April 2002, CTR directed AMEC to  develop and manufacture a spent nuclear fuel storage container  dehydration system. The dehydration system was needed to extract  water from the storage containers to inhibit corrosion and increase the  containers\u2019 service life. However, in December 2003, the CTR program  terminated AMEC\u2019s participation in the project and selected a U.S.  contractor, instead of working through AMEC, to design a larger  dehydration system. U.S. expenditures for this project totaled $396,000.", "Two projects involving solid radioactive waste treatment and solid  radioactive waste storage were implemented at a site where CTR is not  dismantling ballistic missile nuclear submarines. These projects were  designed to assist the Russian navy manage the large volume of waste  generated by dismantlement of nuclear submarines. The waste  treatment project identified, among other things, technologies that  could reduce the volume of solid waste from decommissioned nuclear  submarines and make it easier and more economical to store the  material. The second project supported the development and  production of 400 steel containers for the Russian navy to transport and  store solid radioactive waste. Prior to the project, no Russian-designed  and manufactured container had ever been certified to transport solid  radioactive waste. According to the AMEC project manager, the projects  introduced Russian representatives to western business practices,  including improved contract management techniques. U.S. expenditures  for these projects, which have been completed and consolidated at a  mobile solid waste treatment facility built at a Russian shipyard, totaled  about $12 million, including the cost of the facility.", "AMEC\u2019s project to develop a demonstration radiation detection system  to protect the health and safety of workers who dismantle submarines  does not directly benefit the CTR program. The demonstration system is  installed at the interim storage pad site, which is not being used to  support the CTR program. U.S. AMEC and CTR officials were uncertain  if the radiation detection system would be deployed at any of the CTR  dismantlement sites in Russia. CTR officials said that while they support  projects that protect workers\u2019 heath and safety, they would not have  funded this project and are uncertain how it promotes CTR  dismantlement goals. U.S. expenditures for this project totaled $1.7  million.", "A related project that supplied about 125 DOE surplus dosimeters  (radiation detection devices) to the Russian navy was described as a  failure by the AMEC project manager. He told us that the navy would not  use these dosimeters due to, among other things, technical concerns  and had put the equipment in storage for a couple of years. We brought  this matter to the attention of a U.S. AMEC official who subsequently  contacted the Russian AMEC representative and was informed that the  dosimeters would be distributed. In July 2004, Russia\u2019s representative to  AMEC notified DOD that the dosimeters were now being used.", "Finally, an AMEC project to develop a mobile liquid waste processing  facility that could be used in remote locations in Russia was suspended  because CTR did not support it. A CTR official told us that CTR never  endorsed the project because adequate capacity for liquid radioactive  waste treatment already existed at the facilities where submarines were  being dismantled. As a result, CTR would not extend liability protection  for the project. EPA, which was chosen by the Department of the Navy  to manage the project, still has about $700,000 in unspent project funds  that were transferred from the Navy beginning in 1999. EPA officials told  us that the funds must be reprogrammed by December 31, 2004, unless  the Navy provides an extension, or they will be returned to the U.S.  Treasury.", "U.S. AMEC officials told us that ultimately several of the projects that were  established to meet CTR objectives did not do so because of changing  requirements and plans.

Although  only one AMEC project that was established to support CTR did so, these  officials believed that most of these projects can be used to support  dismantlement of Russia\u2019s general purpose submarines. The storage pad,  for example, can hold spent nuclear fuel from all types of Russian nuclear  submarines and will facilitate the shipment of the fuel to the centralized  storage facility at Mayak. Similarly, the steel containers for solid waste are  already being used to store radioactive waste from dismantled general  purpose submarines, according to U.S. and Russian officials.

Officials noted that AMEC has enabled military personnel from the United  States, Norway, and United Kingdom to visit Russian naval facilities that  they had previously been unable to visit. According to these officials,  access to the facilities enables AMEC to better understand the  environmental conditions and technologies required to assist with  dismantlement efforts. Russia\u2019s AMEC representative told us that AMEC is  a useful way to improve communications among the member countries\u2019  military organizations.

Based on these criteria, DOE has concluded that spent fuel from Russian  submarines does not present a sufficiently high risk to warrant the  commitment of resources. Rather, DOE places a higher priority on the  highest-risk radiological materials, such as sealed radiological sources  found in radioisotope thermo-electric generators, which contain strontium- 90; blood irradiators; sterilization facilities; and large radiological storage  locations.

Regardless of AMEC\u2019s plans, however, the U.S. role will be limited  until the liability issue with Russia is resolved.", "The proposed expansion of AMEC\u2019s goals to include improving security  around naval bases where Russia is decommissioning and dismantling  nuclear submarines is a low priority objective and may be inconsistent with  U.S security policy. DOE, which is responsible for securing nuclear  materials in Russia, does not believe that spent nuclear fuel and other  associated radioactive materials from Russia\u2019s nuclear submarines pose a  high priority threat and therefore have told us they would not fund any  initiatives in this area. Furthermore, improving security around Russian  submarine bases may be inconsistent with U.S. policy, which generally  precludes providing security upgrades around operational Russian naval  facilities.", "In addition, DOD\u2019s interest in expanding its technology development  activities to Russia\u2019s Pacific fleet of nuclear submarines is not based on an  analysis that demonstrates the need to do so, although efforts are  underway to study the environmental risks. Previously developed  technologies for Russia\u2019s Arctic fleet could potentially be applied to  dismantling Russia\u2019s nuclear submarines in the Pacific, and there is no  assessment concluding that additional projects are needed. Furthermore,  Japan, which is most concerned about contamination from aging or  damaged nuclear submarines in the Pacific, has begun dismantling Russian  submarines in the Pacific under the auspices of the G-8 program and has  not requested DOD\u2019s assistance in technology development. If further  analysis in the Pacific shows that environmental conditions warrant  assistance, DOD officials stated that congressional approval for this  initiative will be required.", "Finally, we believe that better oversight is needed to ensure that project  funds are spent on a timely basis.

As we stated in the draft report, AMEC was  established to help reduce the environmental impacts of Russia\u2019s military  activities in the Arctic region. However, we also noted that U.S.  participation in AMEC was hindered by the absence of liability protection.  Given this lack of liability protection, the United States has, for the most  part, tied its participation in AMEC projects to DOD\u2019s CTR liability  protocol. We noted, however, in the draft report that a number of AMEC  projects are not linked to the CTR program.", "It is unclear to us why DOD asserted in its comments that its 1999 program  plan does not state that AMEC was expected to support CTR projects.

DOD claims that the cost savings  from these containers has essentially paid for the AMEC program. As  stated in the draft report, the AMEC containers cost less to produce than  the container Russia developed to store the spent nuclear fuel and we have  revised the report to more accurately indicate the amount of savings per  container as noted in DOD\u2019s comments. However, we believe that DOD has  not understood the larger point of our analysis. While we recognize in the  report that the storage container project has proven beneficial, the other  seven projects that were established to support CTR objectives have had  limited impact on the CTR program.
