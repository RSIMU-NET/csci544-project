TPP authenticates taxpayers by asking questions only a real taxpayer should know; however, fraudsters can pass by obtaining a taxpayer's personally identifiable information (PII). IRS estimates that of the 1.6 million returns selected for TPP, it potentially paid $30 million to IDT fraudsters who filed about 7,200 returns that passed TPP authentication in the 2015 filing season; however, GAO's analysis suggests the amount paid was likely to be higher. Although IRS conducted a risk assessment for TPP in 2012, IRS has not conducted an updated risk assessment that reflects the current threat of IDT refund fraud\u2014specifically, the threat that some fraudsters possess the PII needed to pass authentication questions.

In response to past GAO recommendations, IRS adopted a new methodology in an effort to improve its 2014 IDT refund fraud cost estimates. However, the estimates do not include returns that fail to meet specific refund thresholds. IRS officials said the thresholds allow them to prioritize IRS's enforcement efforts. However, using thresholds could result in incomplete estimates. Improved estimates would help IRS better understand how fraud is evading agency defenses. The GAO Cost Guide states that cost estimates should include all relevant costs. Additionally, IRS's estimates of refunds it protected from fraud are based on the Global Report , which counts each time a fraudulent return is caught by IRS and thus counts some returns multiple times. IRS uses this data source because it is IRS's official record of IDT refund fraud. The GAO Cost Guide states that agencies should use primary data for estimates and the data should contain few mistakes.

The sources of stolen identities are limitless, according to  an official in IRS\u2019s Criminal Investigation Division. Identity thieves can  hack into government or commercial systems, recruit insiders (such as  employees in the healthcare or education industries) to steal PII, or  purchase or put pieces of PII together to create an identity (see figure 1).", "To successfully commit identity theft, thieves can exploit specific digital,  physical, or social vulnerabilities (see sidebar). According to Department  of Justice (DOJ) officials, the PII used in tax refund fraud can also involve  compromised identities, where the real identity holder initially sells his  identity to third parties.", "Identity Theft and Personally Identifiable  Information (PII) Vulnerability: An  Overview  PII is vulnerable to theft and exploitation in  three broad areas.  Digital vulnerability: Criminals can access  large amounts of digital information if it is  inadequately safeguarded. For example,  thieves can steal it through hacking and  computer intrusion, can aggregate publicly  available information, or can sell and buy PII  from other criminals on the black market. In  one case, a foreign national obtained PII from  online databases and sold it to other  criminals, resulting in 13,673 victims and $65  million claimed in refund fraud.  Physical vulnerability: If insufficient attention  is paid to the structures and tools used to  store, maintain, and safeguard PII, such as  hard drives, paper records, or unsecured  mailboxes, thieves will exploit these  vulnerabilities through computer theft and  \u201cdumpster diving.\u201d  Social vulnerability: Thieves can trick  individuals into divulging their own PII or  others\u2019 PII, for example by impersonating IRS  officials. Thieves may also recruit individuals  with legitimate access to sensitive information.  In one case, a ring of thieves used its  employment access to steal identities from  public and private databases, such as the  U.S. Army, several Alabama state agencies, a  Georgia call center and employee records  from a Georgia company.", "IRS recognized the challenge of IDT refund fraud in its fiscal year 2014- 2017 strategic plan and increased resources dedicated to combating IDT  and other types of refund fraud. In fiscal year 2015, IRS reported that it  staffed more than 4,000 full-time equivalents and spent about $470  million on all refund fraud and IDT activities. The administration  requested an additional $90 million and 491 full-time equivalents for fiscal  year 2017 to help prevent IDT refund fraud and reduce improper  payments. IRS estimates that this $90 million would help it protect an  additional $612 million in revenue in fiscal year 2017, as well as protect  revenue in future years. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016,  appropriated IRS an additional $290 million for improvements to customer  service, IDT identification and prevention, and cybersecurity efforts.

As a result of this improvement, officials can more precisely  estimate known IDT refunds paid. Additionally, IRS uses the modeling  data set when calculating estimates of likely IDT refunds paid. IRS  defines likely IDT returns as returns where the information on the tax  return does not match either (1) the current year\u2019s information reporting  (i.e., information on a W-2); or (2) specific prior-year tax return  characteristics.", "While the data source used to estimate IDT refunds paid is an  improvement from the previous Taxonomy, IRS\u2019s methodology for  calculating estimates for refunds paid excludes select categories of  returns that can bias results. A key assumption IRS uses when building  its modeling data set for IDT refunds paid is the amount of the refund. As  part of its methodology, IRS omits some returns with refund amounts that  fail to meet specific refund thresholds from its fraud estimates and does  not include all relevant returns in its analysis. IRS officials said IRS uses  the thresholds because it wants to prioritize IRS enforcement efforts. In  February 2016, IRS officials stated that they did not know how many  returns were excluded from the Taxonomy. In March 2016, IRS officials  said that they are evaluating the extent to which omitted returns met other  criteria associated with IRS\u2019s definitions of known and likely IDT refund  fraud.", "According to its Strategic Plan, IRS should identify trends, detect high-risk  areas of noncompliance, and prioritize enforcement approaches by  applying research and advanced analytics.  Further, the GAO Cost  Guide states that analysis should be regularly updated to reflect  significant changes in the methodology and should include all relevant  costs. While thresholds may help IRS prioritize enforcement efforts on  likely IDT fraud schemes, they limit IRS\u2019s ability to estimate the entire  population of IDT refunds paid. Further, incomplete Taxonomy estimates  could impede IRS and congressional efforts to assess the effectiveness  of its IDT defenses over time. In response to our discussion, IRS officials  said that they are considering removing some thresholds and including  those returns when calculating estimates of IDT refunds paid for the 2015  Taxonomy estimates.", "We also found accuracy issues with IRS\u2019s estimate of IDT refunds  prevented that are likely to result in overestimates. To produce this  estimate, IRS uses the Global Report, which overestimates the amount of  IDT refunds prevented because it overcounts some IDT returns.  Overcounting occurs because the Global Report aggregates return-level  data to create a monthly inventory of confirmed IDT returns. According to  IRS officials, the Global Report counts each time a return is caught by  IRS defenses as a separate instance of refund fraud. For example, if an  IDT return is flagged as IDT in both IRS\u2019s Electronic Fraud Detection  System and its Dependent Database, this return is counted as two IDT  returns, even though it is the same return. E-file rejects are also  overcounted because a single return can be rejected multiple times.", "IRS officials noted that there would be benefits of using return-level data  to estimate refunds prevented in the Taxonomy, such as avoiding  overcounting. However, officials said they use the Global Report to  develop estimates of prevented IDT refund fraud because it represents  IRS\u2019s official record of IDT fraud and because IRS has invested  substantial resources in improving the report. We agree that the Global  Report is an important investment for monitoring the effectiveness of  IRS\u2019s many defenses against fraud, both individually and as a system;  however, overcounting the incidence of fraud inflates IRS\u2019s Taxonomy  estimates of the cost of IDT refund fraud, and could potentially bias  resource allocation and other decisions. For example, if IRS thinks it is  catching 90 percent of estimated IDT refund fraud attempts, agency  officials may decide to allocate resources differently than if IRS is, in fact,  catching 50 percent.", "Our data reliability testing found that the Global Report\u2019s counts for known  IDT returns where IRS prevented the refund were larger than the counts  from the modeling data set. Of the estimated $22.5 billion refunds  prevented or recovered in 2014, the Global Report included 2.0 million  returns worth $11.4 billion in its known IDT return population, whereas the  modeling dataset included 1.6 million returns and $8.9 billion in its  population. Officials acknowledged that they also believe this  discrepancy is due to the overcounting in the Global Report and could  also be caused by the modeling dataset\u2019s exclusion of returns that fail to  meet specific refund thresholds, as described above.", "As noted earlier, IRS\u2019s Strategic Plan notes that IRS should \u201cidentify  trends, detect high-risk areas of noncompliance, and prioritize  enforcement approaches by applying research and advanced analytics.\u201d  It also states that IRS should strengthen refund fraud prevention by  bolstering analytics capability, making full use of existing data sources,  and exploring potential new data sources and techniques. Further, the  GAO Cost Guide states that estimates be based on primary data sources  and contain few mistakes.", "By using aggregated data to develop the Global Report, the agency\u2019s  official record of IDT returns is less accurate than if IRS used return-level  data. Further, by using the Global Report to calculate Taxonomy  estimates for refunds prevented, IRS may have overestimated the $22.5  billion in refunds prevented or recovered in the 2014 filing season.

In addition, IRS  does not always provide rationales or analyses to support the  assumptions it does document. For example, IRS does not provide a  rationale for the average refund value used to estimate the cost of  electronically filed returns that IRS rejects (i.e., e-file rejects) and  categorizes as IDT returns, which affects the total value of IRS\u2019s refunds  prevented estimates.", "Our analyses show that using different refund assumptions can affect the  refunds prevented estimate by billions of dollars. Because IRS does not  have reliable data on the refund values associated with e-file rejects, it  uses the average refund value of returns detected by various IDT  defenses. As noted in table 2, IRS\u2019s estimate assumes the average  refund value for all IDT defenses ($5,959), which results in $7.3 billion  dollars prevented on 1.2 million e-filed returns.

We recommended that  IRS report the inherent imprecision and uncertainty of the estimates and  noted that one way IRS could do this would be to present a range of  values for its Taxonomy estimates. High-quality cost estimates usually  fall within a range of possible costs, with the point estimate between the  best and worst case extremes. Having a range of costs around a point  estimate is more useful to decision makers because it indicates the  uncertainty in the estimates by conveying its level of confidence or by  conveying the level of confidence of the most likely cost. Knowing the  uncertainty related to Taxonomy estimates could affect different decisions  about how to allocate resources to combat IDT refund fraud. For  example, if there is 80 percent confidence in IRS\u2019s estimates, then  decision makers may make different decisions than if there is 50 percent  confidence in the estimates.", "Under its revised methodology, IRS partially addressed our previous  recommendation by presenting refunds-paid estimates as a range rather  than a single point estimate to reflect the uncertainty in IRS\u2019s estimate of  the revenue lost to IDT refund fraud. In addition, IRS took steps to  incorporate better quality data into its refunds paid estimate by utilizing  both the modeling data set\u2019s return-level information and results from a  new sampling effort. However, these ranges may not give decision  makers a truly accurate understanding of what IRS knows and does not  know about IDT refund fraud because they are not derived from a cost  risk and uncertainty analysis. Such an analysis accounts for the  cumulative impact that multiple assumptions might have on IRS\u2019s  estimates. For example, ranges do not account for uncertainty regarding  the extent to which IRS\u2019s estimates account for all IDT fraud schemes.  Additionally, IRS officials manually review some returns to determine  whether or not the returns are IDT or non-IDT returns. IRS\u2019s ranges also  do not account for the uncertainty or the risk that manual reviewers may  not accurately characterize returns as IDT returns and non-IDT returns.", "In addition, IRS does not conduct a sensitivity analysis for Taxonomy  categories that include assumptions. A sensitivity analysis reveals critical  assumptions and cost drivers that most affect estimate results, and can  help managers take steps to ensure the estimates\u2019 quality.

IRS  has invested a considerable effort in monitoring and reporting the extent  of IDT refund fraud through its Taxonomy estimates.

For example, using return-level data, such as the  modeling data set, could improve the accuracy of the Taxonomy\u2019s refunds  paid estimates. More accurate Taxonomy estimates would help IRS  better understand how and to what extent IDT refund fraud is evading IRS  defenses.
