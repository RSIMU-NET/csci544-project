These assessments evaluate  key transactional risks, such as the borrower\u2019s industry, competitive  position, operating performance, liquidity position, leverage, and ability to  service debt obligations. Frequently, credit enhancements are included in  the structure of long-term financing (often in the form of collateral) in order  to decrease the risk of a borrower default but also to increase the  recovery in the event of a default. A risk rating is assigned to the  transaction based on this evaluation which, in turn, determines the  transaction fee that a borrower pays and assists in establishing the level  of loss reserves EXIM must set aside. The credit assessments undergo  multiple levels of internal review.", "All transactions of EXIM carry some risk; however, transactions approved  through delegated authority lenders potentially carry a higher level of  inherent risk because third-party financial institutions make the decisions.  To mitigate the risk, EXIM reviews medium-term transactions approved  by delegated authority lenders before the transactions are executed to  assure compliance with EXIM\u2019s delegated authority lending policies. For  working capital guarantee delegated authority, EXIM conducts periodic  examinations of the lenders, reviewing ongoing transactions and lender  compliance with the delegated authority program.

After an application is determined to be  complete, it is assigned to the applicable EXIM division that oversees the  applicable type of project. For example, an application for the purchase of  an aircraft would be assigned to the Transportation Division. Once  assigned, a loan officer in that division is to assess the eligibility of the  transaction. To ensure compliance with laws and regulations, the loan  officer is to obtain and assess various certifications from transaction  participants. Loan officers are also required to submit the corporate and  individual names and addresses of lenders, borrowers, guarantors, and  other transaction participants to the EXIM Library.

Once the transaction is  considered minimally eligible for EXIM support, the loan officer is required  to perform a series of due diligence activities to determine (1) whether the  transaction provides a reasonable assurance of repayment, (2) any  potential material issues regarding the transaction or the participants that  would preclude EXIM support, and (3) the appropriate risk level and  pricing for the transaction. As part of the financial evaluation of the  transaction, the loan officer is required to obtain and analyze the  borrower\u2019s financial statements, credit reports or rating agency  reports, financial projections, and other relevant information. As  applicable, the loan officer is required to obtain input from other EXIM  staff, such as attorneys or engineers, to conclude on the legal, technical,  economic, or environmental risks of the transaction. Based on this due  diligence, the loan officer is to assess the transaction for risk and assign  an overall risk rating. This rating is used to calculate the exposure fee  EXIM will charge the borrower for guaranteeing the transaction. Greater  perceived risks result in higher fees.", "Credit structure. After the risk assessment and due diligence is  performed, the loan officer determines the financing terms and conditions  to be recommended. The loan officer is generally required to structure the  transaction to include a security interest (collateral) in the financed goods  or other assets of the borrower. If it is determined that collateral is not  necessary, the loan officer is to document the explanation and mitigating  factors (e.g., EXIM support is small relative to a borrower\u2019s size).

EXIM financing could be less than 85 percent depending on the U.S.  content. According to EXIM, guaranteeing 100 percent of the amount it  finances permits it to explore capital markets and is more desirable to  banks for large and long-term projects.
