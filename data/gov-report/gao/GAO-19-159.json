This report examines (1) factors that may present challenges to women, including Medicaid beneficiaries, accessing abortions; and (2) federal and state information on the number of abortions eligible for federal Medicaid funding. GAO reviewed federal laws, regulations, and data sources; surveyed and received responses from Medicaid program officials in all 50 states and the District of Columbia; conducted a literature review; and interviewed CMS officials and eight abortion providers selected based on factors such as variation in Medicaid abortion coverage and geography."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Women could face various challenges accessing abortions depending on where they live, and Medicaid beneficiaries may face additional challenges in some states. GAO identified seven key factors that could pose challenges to women accessing abortions, based on its interviews with providers and review of the literature: gestational limits, mandatory counseling, out-of-pocket costs, parental involvement requirements, provider availability, stigma and harassment, and waiting period requirements. The presence of these factors and their effect on abortion access\u2014such as delays in care or increased costs\u2014varied by state.", "GAO also found that state variation in Medicaid abortion coverage and payment requirements could further complicate access for program beneficiaries. State Medicaid programs are generally required to cover abortions and can seek federal funding for such coverage when the pregnancy is the result of an act of rape or incest, or the life of the pregnant woman would be endangered unless an abortion is performed. States may also cover abortions under other circumstances, but federal funds may not be used. In GAO's survey, one state reported not covering abortions in cases of rape or incest, and 14 states reported not covering the drug used in medical abortions, which they are generally required to cover if the abortion is otherwise eligible for federal funding. Officials from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the federal agency that oversees Medicaid, were unaware that these states were not covering the drug, and thus, have not taken any actions to address states' non-compliance.", "Federal information on the number of abortions eligible for federal Medicaid funding is incomplete, limiting CMS's ability to ensure proper payments and states' coverage of such abortions. For example, the form CMS-64, which states use to report Medicaid expenditures, does not collect information on the number of abortions paid for by managed care\u2014the delivery system serving most Medicaid beneficiaries. It also does not include this information from 8 states that GAO identified as incorrectly reporting abortion costs on the form. While also not complete, state information reported in GAO's survey was more comprehensive, and showed a wide range in the number of abortions eligible for federal funding covered across the 42 states that reported such information."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making three recommendations to CMS to ensure state compliance with federal requirements for Medicaid abortion coverage, including coverage of the drug used for medical abortions.

In fiscal year 2017, Medicaid covered acute health care, long- term care, and other services for an estimated 74 million low income and  medically needy individuals. While federal law prohibits federal funding  for abortions in most circumstances, state Medicaid programs are  required to cover an abortion if the pregnancy is the result of rape or  incest, or the life of the pregnant woman would be endangered unless an  abortion is performed. In these circumstances, abortions are eligible for  federal funding. In addition, states can, at their own expense, choose to  cover this procedure beyond the circumstances outlined in federal law.", "The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the agency within  the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that oversees  Medicaid, has a critical role in monitoring states\u2019 compliance with federal  requirements, including ensuring that federal funding is provided only for  eligible abortions and that state Medicaid programs cover abortions  eligible for such funding. However, members of Congress and others  have raised concerns about women\u2019s access to abortions across states,  including for Medicaid beneficiaries in circumstances eligible for federal  funding. For example, concerns have been raised about the availability of  facilities providing abortions, which could affect women\u2019s access. A recent  study found that the number of abortion clinics varied greatly across the  country with the Northeast having nearly three times more clinics than the  Midwest based on regional population size. Another study found that the  number of abortion clinics has declined over time and that more than a  third of women across the country live in a county without an abortion  clinic.", "You asked us to examine issues related to women\u2019s access to abortions.  This report examines  1.  factors that may present challenges to women, including Medicaid  beneficiaries, accessing abortions; and  2.  federal and state information on the number of abortions eligible for  federal Medicaid funding.", "To examine factors that may present challenges to women, including  Medicaid beneficiaries, accessing abortions, we reviewed federal laws  and regulations, and surveyed Medicaid officials in all 50 states and the  District of Columbia (hereafter, states) regarding their scope of abortion  coverage, including coverage of medical abortions, and their  requirements for Medicaid payment for abortions eligible for federal  funding. All states responded to the survey. In addition, we interviewed  eight abortion providers about access challenges women may face.  These eight providers offered services in 21 states that represented more  than 40 percent of the total national Medicaid population, but varied in  terms of their Medicaid abortion coverage and geography. Our findings  from these interviews are not generalizable. We also conducted a  literature review to identify peer-reviewed studies that examined factors  that could present challenges to women accessing abortions. We  searched multiple reference databases for relevant studies published  between January 2007 and September 2017, and identified 637 studies  that were potentially relevant. To further refine our search, we reviewed  the abstract of each study to ensure the articles met certain criteria. For  the studies remaining, we examined their methodologies to determine  whether they were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our reporting  objectives. As a result of these efforts, we identified 52 studies to include  in our review. For more details on the literature review and a list of  studies we reviewed, see appendix I. We also interviewed officials from  CMS and other relevant organizations representing a range of  perspectives on women\u2019s access to abortions.", "To examine federal information on the number of abortions eligible for  federal Medicaid funding, we reviewed available federal data sources,  such as the form CMS-64, which states use to report Medicaid  expenditures to CMS for the purpose of determining federal funding, and  interviewed CMS officials. To examine state information, we obtained  responses through our survey to questions regarding the number of  abortions eligible for federal funding that state Medicaid programs  covered and denied for fiscal years 2013 through 2017. We asked states  to report information by delivery system type and by the circumstance  eligible for federal funding (rape, incest, or life endangerment). We did not  independently verify state-reported information, but did follow up with  states to clarify inconsistencies or outliers we identified. On that basis,  we determined that the state-reported information was sufficiently reliable  for the purposes of our reporting objectives.", "We conducted this performance audit from May 2017 to January 2019, in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

However, the Court also  recognized that a state may have an interest sufficient to regulate  abortion after the first trimester of the pregnancy or proscribe abortion  after the fetus reaches viability, the point at which the fetus could live  outside the womb. Over time, states have adopted a range of abortion- related laws or policies, including the following examples.", "Gestational limits: Prohibiting abortions after a specified gestational  age.", "Insurance limitations: Limiting insurance coverage of abortions to  certain circumstances in either publicly or privately funded insurance  plans.", "Laws regulating abortion providers: Requiring abortion providers to  meet certain standards, such as standards that specify facility room  size or corridor widths.", "Mandatory counseling: Requiring specific information, including  information on fetal development or gestational age of the fetus, be  provided to a woman prior to an abortion.", "Parental involvement: Requiring the consent or notification of one or  both parents for minors seeking an abortion.", "Waiting periods: Requiring a certain amount of time to elapse  between informed consent\u2014which may include mandatory  counseling\u2014and having an abortion.", "Since Roe v. Wade was decided, many of these state laws have been  challenged, and the Court, in reviewing these laws, has considered  whether they impose an undue burden on a woman\u2019s right to choose an  abortion. Most recently, in 2016, the Court found that two Texas laws  regulating abortion providers offered few, if any, health benefits and  posed a substantial obstacle to women seeking abortions. Therefore,  the Court found that these two Texas laws constituted an undue burden  and were unconstitutional.", "The number of abortions performed in the United States has steadily  declined over the past 30 years, with the abortion rate reaching its lowest  point in 2014\u2014the most recent year data were available\u2014at 14.6  abortions per 1,000 women of reproductive age, according to a 2017  study. This study attributed this decline primarily to a decrease in the  number of unintended pregnancies and to a lesser extent, laws or policies  that may limit women\u2019s access to abortions.", "Abortions are typically performed in a clinic or other nonhospital setting  and involve one of two methods: medical abortion or surgical abortion.  Medical abortions involve using prescription drugs to terminate a  pregnancy. The prescription drug mifepristone, sold under the brand  name Mifeprex, in combination with the prescription drug misoprostol, is  the only Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved medication for  medical abortions in the United States, and is approved for use through  10 weeks gestation. FDA has restricted the administration of Mifeprex to  patients in certain healthcare settings under the supervision of a certified  prescriber; thus, the drug cannot be sold in retail pharmacies. According  to Danco Laboratories, the manufacturer of Mifeprex, there is at least one  certified Mifeprex provider in every state. Surgical abortions, which can  involve different procedures depending on the stage of a women\u2019s  pregnancy, account for the majority of abortions in the United States.  However, according to a recent study, the incidence of medical abortions  increased 7 percent from 2011 to 2014, with medical abortions  accounting for 31 percent of all nonhospital abortions in 2014."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Medicaid Coverage of Abortions", "paragraphs": ["Medicaid expenditures are financed by both the federal government and  the states. In order to receive federal funding for Medicaid expenditures,  states must adhere to a broad set of federal requirements and administer  their programs consistent with individual state plans approved by CMS.  However, Medicaid, by design, allows significant flexibility for states to  design and implement their programs. States have some discretion in,  among other things, setting Medicaid eligibility standards and provider  payment rates; determining the amount, scope, and duration of covered  benefits; and developing their own administrative structures. For example,  states must cover certain mandatory populations and services\u2014including  abortions in cases of rape, incest, or life endangerment\u2014but may impose  certain requirements on that coverage, such as requiring authorization  before a service is provided. States may also opt to cover other optional  populations and services, including abortions for which federal funding is  not available.", "States may also decide how Medicaid-covered services provided to  beneficiaries will be delivered. For example, states may pay health care  providers for each service they provide\u2014referred to as fee-for-service  (FFS)\u2014or contract with managed care organizations (MCO) to provide a  specific set of Medicaid-covered services to beneficiaries and pay them a  set amount per beneficiary, typically per month. While most states use  both delivery systems, the percentage of beneficiaries served through  comprehensive MCOs has grown in recent years, and represented nearly  70 percent of all Medicaid beneficiaries in 2016.", "Oversight of the Medicaid program is also shared by the federal  government and the states, and is aimed, in part, at ensuring that funds  are used appropriately and that beneficiaries have access to covered  services. With respect to abortion coverage, federal law and CMS  guidance outline specific requirements for federal funding to be available.  For example, states that claim federal funding for abortions in the case of  life endangerment must obtain a physician\u2019s certification that the abortion  is necessary for this purpose. While there is not a similar certification  requirement for federal funding of abortions in cases of rape or incest,  CMS guidance specifies that states may impose certain additional  requirements on providers and beneficiaries as a condition of Medicaid  payment for abortions eligible for federal funding, provided such  requirements are reasonable and do not deny or impede coverage for  such abortions.", "In the case of medical abortions, federal law does not specifically require  Medicaid coverage of the prescription drugs used to terminate a  pregnancy. However, state Medicaid programs that opt to cover  prescription drugs\u2014which is the case in all 51 states\u2014are generally  required to cover outpatient drugs of any manufacturer participating in the  Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. Danco Laboratories has a rebate  agreement for Mifeprex, and, as result, states should generally cover it for  abortions in the circumstances eligible for federal funding. In determining  states\u2019 compliance with this requirement, CMS guidance states that the  agency will consider several factors, including a state\u2019s authority to set  limitations on covered outpatient drugs under relevant state laws.", "To inform its oversight of Medicaid, CMS relies on state-reported data  that contain information on multiple aspects of the program. States  claiming federal funding for Medicaid services, including abortions, are  required to report quarterly expenditures to CMS on the form CMS-64.  CMS uses these data to pay states for the federal share of program  spending and the agency is responsible for ensuring that federal  payments are made appropriately. Additionally, states submit Medicaid  expenditure and utilization data that can be linked to individual  beneficiaries to CMS on a monthly basis through the agency\u2019s new  Transformed Medicaid Statistical Information System (T-MSIS)."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Multiple Factors Could Present Challenges to a Woman\u2019s Access to Abortions Depending on Where She Lives", "paragraphs": ["Through provider interviews, we identified multiple factors that could  present challenges to women accessing abortions, but the extent to which  these factors were present in a state varied, as did their effect on access.  In addition, the studies we reviewed examined some of these factors  more than others, but often pointed to the challenges they could pose.  Medicaid beneficiaries may experience further challenges accessing  abortions in some states due to variation in Medicaid abortion coverage  and related payment requirements."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Providers and Literature Pointed to Multiple Factors that Could Present Challenges to Women Accessing Abortions across States", "paragraphs": ["We identified seven key factors as potential challenges to women  accessing abortions based on our interviews with eight selected  providers: (1) gestational limits; (2) mandatory counseling; (3) out-of- pocket costs; (4) parental involvement; (5) provider availability; (6) stigma  and harassment; and (7) waiting periods. (See table 1.)", "The extent to which these factors are present in a state varies. For  example, one provider who did not identify stigma and harassment as a  factor affecting women in the state it operates in noted that women from  all over the country come to its clinics. The provider said this was  because women see its clinics as a safer place to obtain an abortion than  seeking care in their own state, where they would likely be stigmatized or  harassed. Additionally, providers in some states told us that they were  able to cover the entire cost of the abortion and pay for associated costs,  such as transportation, for women who could not afford to pay, while  providers in other states said that they could not cover the entire cost of  the abortion due to funding limitations. See figure 1 for an example of  differences in factors present in two states.", "In addition, a factor could be more challenging in one state versus  another, depending on the details of the factor and other factors present.  For example, one provider noted that the 24-hour waiting period in one  state it serves poses a minimal challenge, because women can complete  part of the process online and only make one visit to the abortion  provider. Conversely, a provider in another state said that the state\u2019s 72- hour waiting period requires two in-person visits and that the same doctor  be present at both, which can create delays in care and increase costs,  particularly if the woman needs to travel a long distance for her  appointments. Differences in access can also exist within a state. Most  notably, some selected providers pointed out that women in a state\u2019s rural  areas typically have more limited access to abortion providers than those  who live in the state\u2019s urban areas.", "The 52 studies we reviewed examined the key abortion access factors  identified through our interviews with selected providers, though some  factors were studied more than others. (See app. I.) Most of the  reviewed studies conducted statistical analyses to evaluate the effects of  a factor on abortion access and often identified access challenges. For  example, nearly two-thirds of the statistical studies for the three most  commonly studied factors\u2014out-of-pocket costs, parental involvement,  and provider availability\u2014found that the factor adversely affected a  measure of abortion access. (See table 2.)", "The other factors identified by providers\u2014gestational limits, stigma and  harassment, mandatory counseling, and waiting periods\u2014were less  frequently examined in the reviewed studies, and the findings from these  studies were more mixed. For example, gestational limits and stigma and  harassment were the least studied of all the factors with only three and  two studies, respectively, and the reviewed studies found both adverse  effects on access, as well as effects that were statistically insignificant.  While there were more studies on waiting periods, the results were  similarly mixed, with at least one study suggesting that the type of waiting  period could change the effect on access. This study found that while a  waiting period requiring two in-person visits could delay care, the effect of  waiting periods that required fewer in-person visits was not significant.  Finally, for mandatory counseling, the studies we reviewed rarely found  that the factor had a statistically significant effect on a measure of  abortion access (2 of 10 studies)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Variation in State Coverage and Payment Requirements Could Further Challenge Medicaid Beneficiaries\u2019 Access to Abortions", "paragraphs": ["In responding to our survey, 29 states reported limiting abortion coverage  for Medicaid beneficiaries to the three circumstances required under  federal law\u2014rape, incest, and life endangerment\u2014while 21 states  reported broader abortion coverage. The remaining state, South Dakota,  reported that it limits abortion coverage for Medicaid beneficiaries to  circumstances when the pregnancy endangers the life of the woman, and  does not cover abortions in cases of rape or incest. CMS confirmed that  South Dakota\u2019s Medicaid state plan does not include coverage of  abortions in cases of rape or incest, and shared a letter it sent to the state  in 1994 outlining that the state\u2019s coverage did not comply with federal law  and expressing CMS\u2019s intent to work with the state on possible solutions.  However, according to CMS officials, the agency has not taken any action  since that time to ensure South Dakota\u2019s compliance, and does not have  plans to do so. As a result, Medicaid beneficiaries in South Dakota do  not have Medicaid coverage for abortions in cases of rape or incest.", "States also varied in the extent to which their Medicaid programs covered  Mifeprex, the prescription drug most commonly used for medical  abortions. (See fig. 2.) As previously noted, state Medicaid programs that  opt to cover prescription drugs\u2014which is the case in all 51 states\u2014are  generally required to cover outpatient drugs of any manufacturer  participating in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, subject to a few  statutory exceptions. CMS officials told us that Mifeprex, which became  a covered outpatient drug in 2001, does not meet any of the exceptions  for categorical exclusion from coverage. However, 14 states reported  that they do not cover Mifeprex. Without such coverage, Medicaid  beneficiaries seeking abortions in these states would have to find another  way to pay for the drug or undergo a surgical abortion instead. CMS  officials were not aware that these states did not cover Mifeprex, and thus  the agency had not taken any action to address states\u2019 non-compliance.", "Beyond differences in the scope of their abortion coverage, states varied  in the types of requirements they imposed as a condition of Medicaid  payment for abortions eligible for federal funding, which could also affect  women\u2019s access to the procedure. Provider certification that the abortion  met the circumstances of rape, incest, or life endangerment was the most  common requirement reported by states. Other commonly reported  requirements included provider certification of counseling, beneficiary  certification of rape or incest, documentation of rape or incest, and prior  authorization by the state Medicaid agency. (See table 3.)", "The details of particular requirements also varied across states. For  example, among the 32 state Medicaid programs that claimed federal  funding for abortions, we reviewed available documents implementing the  federal requirement that physicians certify the abortion is necessary in the  case of life endangerment and found differences among the states. In  particular, some states\u2019 documents incorporated the statutory wording of  the life endangerment exception, others incorporated the wording of the  related federal regulation, and others used different wording.  Additionally, CMS officials told us that the agency does not require that  physicians fill out a specified form to meet the certification requirement,  and the 32 states varied in whether or not they had such a form. In  another example, of the 14 states that required documentation of cases of  rape or incest, some states specifically required a police report, and other  states allowed the beneficiary the option of either filing a police report or  filing a report with another public agency, such as a public health agency.", "Finally, states also varied in terms of the number of requirements they  imposed specific to Medicaid payment of abortions eligible for federal  funding. For example, some states had no requirements specifically for  these abortions, while one state had all five of the requirements most  commonly reported. In general, states that used state-only funds to  cover abortions in circumstances beyond those eligible for federal funding  had fewer requirements. (See fig. 3.)", "Our interviews with the eight selected providers suggest that the scope of  a state\u2019s Medicaid abortion coverage and related payment requirements  could affect abortion access. For example, six selected providers said  that they rarely submit abortion claims to state Medicaid programs that  limit abortion coverage to circumstances eligible for federal funding, in  part, because obtaining payment is challenging; involves multiple, often  unclear requirements; and frequently results in denied claims. One of  these providers noted that not obtaining Medicaid payment puts additional  pressure on already strained resources, affecting its ability to cover  abortions for women in general. Conversely, two providers operating in  states with broader Medicaid abortion coverage stated that they  frequently submit claims for abortions and receive payment.", "State-reported information on denied abortion claims suggests that the  difficulty the selected providers faced in obtaining Medicaid payment for  abortions eligible for federal funding in certain states could exist in other  states. Specifically, among the 15 states reporting information on  denials of payment for abortions in circumstances eligible for federal  funding, denial rates ranged from 4 percent to nearly 90 percent, with  about half of the 15 states reporting denial rates of 60 percent or more.  While we did not ask states to report on their reasons for denying  Medicaid payment for abortions, some states provided this information.  For example, one state said that its high denial rate is due to the initial  denial of all claims for abortions in cases of life endangerment that do not  have the recipient\u2019s address, as required by federal regulation. In  addition, 7 states reported having no payment denials, 4 of which did not  receive any claims for abortions eligible for federal funding over the 5- year period.", "Findings from the studies we reviewed also highlight the potential effect of  states\u2019 Medicaid coverage and payment requirements on a woman\u2019s  access to abortions. Eight studies that examined the effect of limiting  Medicaid abortion coverage to those eligible for federal funding found that  such coverage limits were associated with a reduction in the number of  women having abortions. For example, one of these studies analyzed  national data from 1985 to 2005 and found that limiting Medicaid  coverage to abortions eligible for federal funding reduced a state\u2019s  abortion rate by 8 to 9 percent. In addition, six studies that examined  providers\u2019 experiences obtaining Medicaid payment for abortions  corroborated many of the concerns raised by our selected providers. For  example, one study examining abortion provider experiences in six states  found that many providers choose not to bill Medicaid for abortions,  because obtaining payment for the procedure requires a significant time  commitment, and when states do pay, the amount is typically lower than  the cost of providing the abortion."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Information on Abortions Eligible for Federal Medicaid Funding Is Incomplete, but Showed a Wide Range in the Number of Procedures Covered across States", "paragraphs": ["The usefulness of federal information\u2014namely CMS-64 data\u2014for  identifying the number of abortions eligible for federal Medicaid funding is  limited, which could hamper CMS\u2019s efforts to ensure proper payments  and states\u2019 coverage of abortions in cases of rape, incest, or life  endangerment.

However, in our survey, eight states reported that they include the  costs of such abortions on other lines of the CMS-64, such as on the  lines for outpatient hospital or physician services. According to  agency officials, CMS conducts quarterly reviews of the CMS-64 data  states report. CMS officials also said that reviewers are not required  to confirm whether states that report no abortions on line 14 have  accurately reported the information, which means that reviewers may  not identify states reporting abortions elsewhere. As a result,  information from the CMS-64 does not accurately reflect the number  of FFS abortions for all states that may be claiming federal Medicaid  funding.", "In addition, because state Medicaid programs use the CMS-64 to claim  federal funding for services provided, the form does not include  information from states that covered abortions for Medicaid beneficiaries  in circumstances of rape, incest, or life endangerment, but did not seek  federal funding for those costs. In our survey, 15 states\u2014accounting for  nearly half the Medicaid population nationwide\u2014reported that, from fiscal  years 2013 through 2017, they did not claim federal funding for abortions  covered by their programs.", "In comparison with the CMS-64 data, the information states reported  through our survey was more comprehensive. For example, 16 states  claiming federal Medicaid funding provided us information on the number  of abortions paid for through MCOs, information that was not captured on  the CMS-64 as individual services, but often represented a significant  portion of the abortions covered by these states. Similarly, the 8 states we  identified as incorrectly reporting their FFS abortions on the CMS-64  reported the number of such abortions to us, and these states accounted  for half of all FFS abortions for which states reported claiming federal  funding in our survey. As a result, the number of abortions for which  states claimed federal funding that was reported to us was substantially  higher than the number in CMS\u2019s annual reports to Congress on such  abortions, which are based on CMS-64 data. From fiscal year 2013 to  fiscal year 2016\u2014the latest year of data available from CMS\u2019s annual  reports\u2014our survey identified nearly 5,000 abortions for which states  claimed federal funding versus the approximately 550 identified in the  agency\u2019s reports.", "However, the information on abortions eligible for federal funding that  states reported to us was also incomplete.", "Nine states, accounting for about one-third of total Medicaid  enrollment, were unable to provide any information.

Because over 60 percent of  Medicaid beneficiaries in five of these states are enrolled in MCOs,  information was not available for a significant portion of their  beneficiaries.", "There were also other, smaller gaps in the states\u2019 information. For  example, six states were not able to provide information for at least 1 year  of the survey time frame, and one state was not able to provide  information on abortions in the case of life endangerment, which, based  on information provided by other states, typically accounts for the majority  of abortions eligible for federal Medicaid funding.", "While not always complete, 42 states reported information to us on  abortions eligible for federal Medicaid funding, which showed a wide  range in the number of procedures covered across states. Most of these  states (37 of 42) reported covering 15 or fewer abortions eligible for  federal funding per year, on average, from fiscal years 2013 through  2017, though this number may be understated in some states due to the  data limitations discussed above. However, during this same time  frame, 3 states (Iowa, South Dakota, and Wyoming) reported covering no  abortions eligible for federal funding, and 2 states (Nevada and  Pennsylvania) reported annually covering an average of more than 300  and 700 such abortions, respectively. (See app. II.)", "Additionally, when excluding Nevada and Pennsylvania, states reporting  information showed an aggregate decrease in the number of abortions  eligible for federal Medicaid funding they covered during the fiscal year  2013 through fiscal year 2017 time period (from 383 to 200).

CMS agreed with these recommendations, but as of  October 2018, the agency had not fully implemented them, and we  continue to believe that these recommendations remain valid.
