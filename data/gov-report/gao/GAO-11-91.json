Safe and efficient air travel will therefore partly depend on FAA's having technicians with the right skills now and in the future. As requested, GAO reviewed how (1) FAA incorporates key practices of leading organizations in its workforce planning for technicians, (2) FAA's technician training compares with key practices of leading organizations, and (3) the costs of technician training, including travel costs, have changed in recent years. GAO analyzed FAA workforce and training data, compared FAA planning and training practices with criteria identified in prior GAO work, and conducted focus group interviews with FAA technicians and FAA Training Academy instructors."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["FAA has followed some key practices of leading organizations in its strategic workforce planning for technicians but lacks a comprehensive, written strategy to guide its efforts. GAO assessed whether FAA followed those practices fully, mostly, or partially, or did not follow them. For example, FAA partially follows one practice--determining critical skills and competencies--because it assesses those skills and competencies its technicians now have to maintain legacy systems, but has just begun to identify those they will need to maintain NextGen systems. FAA also partially develops strategies to close the gap between the technician workforce it needs and the one that it has: It determines staffing needs annually, but lacks a longer-term strategy to address the hundreds of technician retirements projected through 2020. Without a comprehensive, written technician workforce planning strategy, FAA does not have a transparent road map to acquire and retain the right number of technicians with the right skills at the right time. FAA mostly follows other leading workforce planning practices, although it only partially involves key stakeholders--managers, but not technicians--in workforce planning and may thus be missing opportunities for improvement. FAA at least partially follows key practices of leading organizations in its strategic training and development for technicians, but it lacks a strategic training plan, and workload issues limit its ability to fully incorporate key leading practices. With the transition to NextGen, technicians will need to be trained both to maintain new systems and to remain proficient in maintaining the legacy systems that FAA plans to continue operating. FAA has partially implemented a strategic approach to planning for training in that it has established annual training goals and incorporated employees' developmental goals in its planning processes. As noted, however, it has just begun to identify the skills and competencies technicians will need to maintain NextGen systems. FAA mostly follows other key practices for design and development, such as developing a mix of in-house and vendor training. FAA is studying the feasibility of having vendors provide certain courses that are currently offered through the FAA Training Academy and are filled to capacity. FAA partially follows leading practices for implementing training and development, but workload demands often limit technicians' opportunities to attend training. FAA also partially follows leading practices for demonstrating how training and development efforts contribute to improved performance and results. For example, FAA identifies annual training goals, but does not link them to specific performance goals. As a result, it is limited in its ability to assess the effectiveness of its investments in training. Recent compensation costs for instructors at the FAA Training Academy have been roughly stable, while those for student travel to and from the academy and for training courses provided by vendors, exclusive of travel costs, have risen. The higher student travel costs reflect increases in air fares, and vendor training costs have grown as FAA has rolled out more courses for new equipment in preparation for the deployment of NextGen systems. Among other things, FAA should develop a written technician workforce planning strategy that identifies needed skills and staffing, and a strategic training plan showing how training efforts contribute to performance goals.

However, during the last few years, power outages and air  traffic control equipment failures\u2014for example, in Southern California in  2006, at the Atlanta Air Route Traffic Control Center in 2008, and at the  Salt Lake City Air Route Traffic Control Center in 2009\u2014have caused flight  delays. FAA\u2019s equipment maintenance staff\u2014referred to in this report as  technicians\u2014are responsible for minimizing the frequency, duration, and  impact of such outages. Trained as systems specialists, electronics  technicians, and computer specialists, they maintain, repair, and certify air  traffic control equipment\u2014including radar, navigation, communication,  automation, and environmental systems deployed throughout the national  airspace system. In 2009, FAA had approximately 6,100 technicians. This  minimum technician staffing level was established under a 2000 contract  between FAA and the Professional Airways Safety Specialists (PASS)\u2014the  technicians\u2019 bargaining unit.

To modernize these systems while improving  the safety, capacity, and efficiency of the national airspace system, FAA  plans to develop and deploy satellite-based air traffic management  technologies, collectively referred to as the Next Generation Air  Transportation System (NextGen). FAA has begun to deploy some  NextGen technologies and has set 2025 as a target date for full  implementation of NextGen capabilities. As it transitions to NextGen  technologies, FAA plans to continue operating existing air traffic control  technologies, referred to as legacy systems, while testing and integrating  NextGen technologies. Safe and efficient air travel will therefore depend  on, among other things, FAA\u2019s having a sufficient number of skilled  technicians to ensure that both the legacy and the new systems are  properly maintained and certified throughout the transition.

To achieve these objectives, we addressed the following research  questions: (1) To what extent does FAA incorporate key practices of  leading organizations in its workforce planning for technicians? (2) How  does FAA\u2019s technician training compare with key practices of leading  organizations? (3) How have the costs of technician training, including  travel costs, changed in recent years?", "To assess FAA\u2019s workforce planning for technicians, we analyzed FAA  data from fiscal year 1999 through fiscal year 2009 to identify trends in  staffing, hiring, and attrition; reviewed FAA\u2019s workforce planning  documents; and compared the agency\u2019s workforce planning practices with  criteria from our past work. We selected key leading practices, listed in  tables throughout the report, and assessed the extent to which FAA  followed each practice by applying the following scale: \u201cFully\u201d indicated  that, in our judgment, all or virtually all aspects of the practice were  followed; \u201cmostly\u201d indicated that more than half but less than all or  virtually all were followed; \u201cpartially\u201d indicated that less than half but  more than a few were followed; and \u201cminimally\u201d indicated that few or no  aspects of the practice were followed.", "To assess training for technicians, we analyzed FAA training data from  fiscal year 2006 through May 2010 to identify trends in course offerings  and determine the number of classes, students, and instructors; reviewed  end-of-course surveys and technician training documents; and compared  FAA\u2019s development and delivery of technician training with key leading  practices identified through our past work, as described above. In  addition, to address both workforce planning and training, we conducted  12 focus group meetings\u201411 with FAA technicians and 1 with FAA  Academy managers\u2014at 11 locations and conducted semistructured  interviews with FAA managers and PASS union officials. To identify the  focus group locations, we considered the number of technicians at the  facilities, geographic location, notable conditions (such as recent  equipment outages), and agency and PASS recommendations. The  information collected from the focus groups is not generalizable to all FAA  technicians.", "To determine how the costs of technician training have changed, including  travel costs, we compiled and compared cost data for training provided at  FAA\u2019s Training Academy in Oklahoma City and by vendors from fiscal year  2005 through May 2010. To address all three questions, we also reviewed  documents from the Department of Transportation\u2019s Office of the  Inspector General, the National Academy of Public Administration, and  PASS. We assessed the reliability of FAA\u2019s workforce and training data  that are pertinent to this effort by reviewing related documentation and  internal controls and interviewing agency officials and determined that the  data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes. We could not assess the  reliability of cost data for vendor training, because FAA\u2019s cost accounting  system does not provide costs for vendor training and travel-related  activities. We conducted this performance audit from May 2009 through  October 2010 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

(See app. II for ATO\u2019s organization.)  Physically, the technicians are located throughout the country at  approximately 600 air traffic control facilities, which they are responsible  for maintaining, repairing, and certifying, together with the systems and  equipment the facilities contain. Currently, FAA operates nearly 60,000  pieces of legacy equipment and has begun to deploy NextGen equipment.  Technicians maintain the equipment, certify that it is working properly by  conducting periodic performance checks, and repair malfunctioning  equipment and return it to service. They conduct maintenance under  various approaches depending on the equipment. Those approaches  include (1) periodic maintenance (which includes periodic equipment  inspections, performance checks, and routine maintenance), (2) condition- based maintenance (which includes proactive maintenance tasks to  predict or prevent equipment failures), and (3) run-to-fault maintenance  (which means maintenance is performed after the equipment stops  functioning\u2014an approach that, according to FAA, is normally applied  when other types of maintenance actions will not reduce the probability of  failure or extend the lifetime of the equipment). Since 2007, FAA has used  reliability-centered maintenance to determine the most appropriate  approach and timing for conducting maintenance activities for each type  of equipment. Reliability-centered maintenance requires that data on the  function and performance of specific equipment be collected and  analyzed, including data on the causes and consequences of failure, in  order to determine the maintenance approach needed to keep the  equipment functioning effectively and prevent future failures. For  example, performance data can be analyzed to determine whether a  particular component wears out with age or fails randomly; this  information is then used to decide the maintenance approach most  appropriate for that item. (Fig. 1 shows a technician upgrading lighting on  an approach lighting system.)", "As mentioned previously, FAA\u2019s technicians are responsible for  minimizing the frequency, duration, and impact of equipment outages.  Over the last 10 years, the frequency and duration of unscheduled outages  has generally increased. (See figs. 2 and 3.) Age and the resulting  deteriorating condition of equipment and facilities are contributing to the  increase in outages and repair time. According to a senior FAA official, the  number of outages decreased around 2008 because of changes in reporting  practices.", "FAA is still determining technician responsibilities and maintenance  requirements under NextGen.

According to FAA officials, this workgroup will look at changes in FAA\u2019s  maintenance philosophy and NextGen equipment acquisitions and needs,  both leading up to and during implementation. The officials said FAA will  consider these factors as it develops NextGen planning documents that  outline, among other things, changes needed in the technician workforce,  including changes in skills, competencies, and training.

The staffing  process, which is discussed in more detail later in this report, begins with  a budgetary dollar amount that is used to determine how many new full- time technician positions can be filled. Top management, with input from  front-line managers in the form of requests based on their facility needs,  then distributes these positions across locations. According to FAA  officials, these recommendations generally take into account FAA\u2019s  equipment inventory and restoration requirements and the varying levels  of trained, certified, and experienced technicians at FAA facilities,  although top management considers these factors in an ad hoc manner.", "Foremost among the succession planning challenges ATO faces is the  impending retirement of portions of the technician workforce. We updated  FAA\u2019s 2008 projections with the most current federal personnel data from  the Office of Personnel Management\u2019s Central Personnel Data File (CPDF)  and found that 23 percent of the technicians on staff at the end of fiscal  year 2009 would be eligible for retirement in 2012. Moreover, if the 2009  staffing level remained constant, 31 percent would be eligible for  retirement in 2015 and over 50 percent in 2020. (See fig. 5.) From 2005  through 2009, FAA averaged 236 actual technician retirements annually, or  27 percent of those eligible. If actual retirements, estimated for existing  staff, continued at that rate, FAA could face over 500 retirements in fiscal  year 2015 and about 900 retirements in fiscal year 2020. As discussed  previously, not all technicians that are eligible to retire will do so, and as  seen in figure 5, the gap between the number of technicians who are  eligible to retire and those projected to actually retire will continue to  expand at least through 2020.", "FAA does not have succession plans for technicians\u2014that is, FAA lacks a  pipeline to develop new technicians to respond to the impact on  operations of retirements, attrition, and the implementation of midterm  NextGen capabilities. Officials noted that new technicians are brought in  only as others retire or leave the agency; however, this strategy does not  factor in how long it takes new technicians to become fully certified and  acquire skills and abilities on a par with those of the retiring technicians. A  pipeline approach to workforce planning, which would create a steady  flow of trained technicians with some on-the-job experience to replace  experienced technicians as they retire, would help to alleviate the  pressures resulting from FAA\u2019s current approach. In all of the focus groups  we conducted, participants raised concerns about this aspect of FAA\u2019s  workforce planning, noting that when an experienced technician trained  to work on multiple systems is replaced by a new technician trainee, the  new technician cannot fully replace the original employee for years,  placing a burden on other technicians at the facility as well as the training  program. FAA officials acknowledged that it can take 2 to 3 years for new  technicians to attain the skills and abilities of more experienced  technicians. According to FAA\u2019s analysis, 686 full-performance-level  technicians with multiple certifications will be eligible to retire by the end  of fiscal year 2011. (These retirements will also have an impact on training,  as discussed later in this report.)", "The expected increase in retirements could also affect FAA\u2019s  implementation of midterm NextGen capabilities, scheduled for  completion by 2018. Currently FAA plans to implement ERAM by 2011 and  the initial segments of several other systems\u2014including SWIM and  DataComm\u2014by fiscal year 2016, as well as continue to operate its legacy  equipment. With both legacy and new systems to maintain, technicians  could have more varied, if not more, responsibilities and therefore need a  wider range of skills, further highlighting the importance of succession  planning. FAA needs to continue to plan for these issues so that it can  minimize the operational impact of projected retirements.", "FAA plans to rely on hiring and training to address gaps between the skills  and competencies that its technicians currently have and those that they  will need in the future. Senior FAA officials recognize that, as NextGen  technologies are introduced, technicians will need very broad, and  perhaps difficult-to-find, skill sets that will allow them to maintain both  old and new air traffic control technologies. According to ATO\u2019s strategic  human capital planning document, technicians will continue to need the  majority of their current skills to maintain legacy systems, and they will  need to enhance many of these skills to maintain new computer networks  and automated software tools. ATO\u2019s planning document identifies timely  new hire selections and technical training as integral to maintaining and  acquiring the correct knowledge and skill base for FAA\u2019s technician  workforce. Moreover, the document states, technicians will need a full set  of technical, business, and leadership skills to be successful in a rapidly  changing environment. As the rate of technological change increases, it  will be an ongoing challenge for ATO to acquire and maintain a technically  current workforce able to integrate new technologies and respond  effectively to changes in technology, as well as maintain legacy  technologies. Additionally, to meet this challenge, FAA will have to  address new and expanded training requirements and deliver that training  in a cost-efficient and timely manner.", "FAA does not have a staffing model for technicians, and senior officials  told us that FAA is currently not sure how many technicians are and will  be needed to maintain the national airspace system. This uncertainty limits  FAA\u2019s ability to plan strategically for the technician workforce. Senior  FAA officials confirmed that there is no staffing standard for technicians.  They noted that previous efforts to develop a staffing model for  technicians were not completed because of too many variables and that  FAA has not yet identified staffing requirements for the technician  workforce. Those officials pointed to the technicians\u2019 union contract as  the primary factor affecting FAA\u2019s annual technician staff planning  process. They explained that the 6,100 staffing minimum established by  the PASS contract was negotiated and is not based on equipment  inventory or maintenance requirements. They further noted that this  contractual staffing minimum has deterred FAA from implementing  staffing requirements for the technician workforce. The 2000 contract has  not been renegotiated since it expired in 2005; however, as of April 2010,  the parties were reportedly discussing a return to the negotiating table.", "Although the negotiated minimum staffing level may preclude changes  below that level, it does not prevent FAA from examining the numbers of  staff and the skills required for its technician workforce now and in the  future. According to the Vice President of Technical Operations Services,  FAA may require more technicians in the future to adequately maintain  both legacy and NextGen systems. Conversely, FAA may require fewer  technicians because of the digital nature of the new equipment and  different maintenance approaches, such as reliability-centered  maintenance. FAA recently hired staff to begin collaboratively developing  an accurate, requirements-based predictive staffing model. A senior FAA  official suggested that FAA will look at various NextGen planning  documents to determine new maintenance requirements. FAA also plans  to look at near-term system deployments and new system requirements to  determine the short-term maintenance requirements for NextGen systems.  Senior FAA officials said that FAA will not be taking as much equipment  out of the national airspace system as previously thought; systems that  were originally planned to be decommissioned are still in service and are  expected to remain in service indefinitely. These officials further noted  that the maintenance process requires administrative and business  management personnel as well as technicians, and the staffing model will  therefore identify and incorporate nontechnical as well as technical  positions. The FAA Reauthorization Bill of 2009 contains a provision that  would require the National Academy of Sciences to study the assumptions  and methods FAA uses to estimate staffing needs for its technicians to  ensure proper maintenance and certification of the national airspace  system.

For example, FAA  uses a Web-based automated rating and ranking system for screening  applicants and making candidate selections for technician vacancies.  According to FAA, it has created efficiencies in the hiring process for  technicians by centralizing this function in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma,  much as it has done to streamline its hiring of air traffic controllers.  Additionally, according to FAA, it has the ability to expand the use of  temporary pre-employment clearance processing centers to include  technicians. These centers provide a centralized interview site and \u201cone- stop\u201d service for potential new hires, and their use can significantly  shorten the hiring process, which can take up to 6 months, thus allowing  FAA to get qualified applicants into academy training sooner.

For  example, FAA has a strategic initiative with activity targets and milestones  in its human resource business plan to improve its external recruiting for  several occupations, including technicians, and it has met these targets  and milestones. FAA, as discussed earlier, also has completed an attrition  analysis of its technical operations workforce, which includes  technicians\u2014an important step in identifying and addressing staffing  goals.

For example, a  workforce plan can include measures that indicate whether the agency  executed its hiring, training, or retention strategies as intended and  achieved the goals for these strategies, and how these initiatives changed  the workforce\u2019s skills and competencies. It can also include additional  measures that address whether the agency achieved its program goals and  the link between human capital and program results.

FAA has a strategic workforce plan for ATO, but it  does not have one specifically for the technician workforce, although ATO  has designated the technician workforce as mission-critical. In contrast,  FAA does have a strategic workforce plan for nearly 16,000 air traffic  controllers, another mission-critical workforce within ATO, and the only  group of FAA employees larger than the technicians. Previous workforce  planning documents for the technicians\u2014including the National Airspace  System Maintenance Workforce Plan, issued in July 2008\u2014either primarily  emphasized training or were never implemented. According to FAA  officials, Technical Operations is in the process of collaboratively  developing an accurate predictive staffing model, a draft of which will be  completed in about another year.

They  raised concerns about how FAA plans for and communicates staffing and  planning decisions. Negative morale, stemming from such concerns over  management support and planning, could adversely affect FAA\u2019s hiring  and retention of technicians in the future. We have reported previously  that FAA\u2019s consistent ranking near the bottom in published lists of best  places to work in the federal government (viewed as an indicator of  employee morale) could pose challenges in recruiting, motivating, and  retaining employees to replace those retiring and to meet current and  future mission requirements.", "The PASS union president also expressed concerns about FAA\u2019s  communication of information on policy changes and new technologies  throughout the agency.

Without a written workforce planning  strategy, a staffing model, and a more strategic approach, including  succession planning issues related to developing new technicians when  experienced technicians leave, FAA lacks a fully considered analysis of the  appropriate number and composition of its technician workforce, and it  may not be able to meet future maintenance demands. Moreover, as FAA  transitions from legacy to NextGen systems, it risks having too many  technicians with legacy skills and not enough with NextGen skills.

In previous work, we have found that accountability  mechanisms, such as an active training oversight committee and effective  performance management systems, can help to ensure that sufficient  attention is paid to planning for training and development needs and that  those planning efforts are consistent with an agency\u2019s mission, goals, and  culture. Line managers and supervisors can ensure that employees\u2019  training goals are consistent with the agency\u2019s overall mission and goals by  keeping this alignment in mind as they work with employees to set  training goals and approve employees\u2019 training requests. For  approximately the last 5 years, FAA has maintained a Technical Training  Advisory Council, which includes training program support staff, a  supervisory committee consisting of technician line managers, and  representatives of three ATO service centers. The council meets in  person four times a year and has a monthly teleconference to provide  training feedback to ATO Technical Training and review the agency\u2019s  training needs and goals. However, the president of PASS told us the union  had not been approached in recent years to provide input into training  planning and is not represented on the council. FAA training officials told  us, and the PASS president confirmed, that the union provided a  technician to work in Technical Operations Training to assist with training  coordination between the two organizations through December 2009.", "As discussed earlier in this report, FAA has begun to determine the critical  skills and competencies that it will need to maintain NextGen systems;  however, FAA officials stated that the agency has never previously had a  robust competency model for technician training. With the transition to  NextGen, technicians\u2019 training requirements\u2014and thus critical skills and  competencies\u2014will increase, since technicians will have to learn how to  maintain the new systems while remaining proficient in maintaining the  legacy systems that FAA plans to continue operating indefinitely. The  recent assignment of a staff member dedicated to compile technician job  descriptions, tasks, and training courses for Technical Operations Training  supports this effort to develop a skills and competency model. Technical  Operations Training does not have a formal process to identify future  needed skills and competencies beyond those that will be required to  maintain new systems that are turned over in the near term from system  program offices, and it lacks a strategic training plan or other document  that presents a business case for proposed investments in training and  development. When assessing investment opportunities for its training  plan, an agency ought to consider the competing demands it faces, the  resources available to it, and how those demands can best be met with  available resources. Because FAA has not developed a longer-term  strategic plan to prepare for impending retirements and determine how  many technicians it will need to replace those who retire, the agency  cannot determine how many technicians it will need to train in the future  and what certifications will need to be replaced. For example, as  mentioned earlier in this report, 686 full-performance-level technicians  with multiple certifications will be eligible to retire by the end of fiscal  year 2011, and those that do retire will be replaced by new technicians  who might not acquire those skills and abilities for 2 to 3 years.", "While FAA has a well-established process to identify current training and  development needs annually and to prioritize training funds annually, its  ability to plan longer-term training and funding is limited by Technical  Operations Training\u2019s dependency on receiving timely and accurate  planning information on FAA systems from the agency\u2019s individual  program offices and NextGen office. Technical Operations Training  officials told us they identify future training needs through coordination  with the system program offices and independently monitor the status of  new systems coming into the FAA inventory by reviewing the agency\u2019s  Capital Investment Plan (CIP) to see when Technical Operations Training  should start planning for training. However, opportunities for  coordination with the program offices have decreased with recent  organizational changes, according to FAA Academy officials. Formerly, the  program offices initially coordinated the contracts for new systems and  equipment, and the academy could work with the program offices to  develop training while the contracts were being negotiated. Now,  however, responsibilities for the contracts have been consolidated within  FAA\u2019s acquisition management offices, and there is less coordination  between the academy and the program offices. Academy officials  recognize that training development and funding for that training must  await equipment development, but they stated that coordination during  the contracting and development process would be extremely beneficial.", "To incorporate employees\u2019 developmental goals into the planning process,  employees develop their course requests annually, in conjunction with  their managers. The agency uses individual development plans to identify  specific developmental needs and areas for further enrichment for each  employee. Technical Operations Training officials stated that they do not  solicit additional input for training planning and development from  technicians themselves because the line managers are the best source of  information on training needs for their facilities.", "Technicians in our focus groups told us they have had some difficulty  obtaining the training they need for several reasons. First, they said, some  courses on legacy systems needed for advancement have not been  available at the academy. Technical Operations Training officials  acknowledged that some academy courses on legacy systems were  prematurely canceled because their subject matter was incorporated in  course offerings for new systems, and then these new courses were  postponed because of delays in rolling out the new systems. For example,  plans for deploying ERAM led Technical Operations Training to cancel the  training on two legacy systems that ERAM incorporates\u2014En Route  Communications Gateway and the Display System Replacement\u2014but then  ERAM\u2019s deployment was delayed, and no courses were available on the  two legacy systems. Second, technicians said, the recent declines in  technician staffing and a reduction in periodic maintenance under the  reliability-centered maintenance approach have limited their ability to  become familiar with new systems and acquire timely on-the-job training,  as well as maintain proficiency in areas where they have already received  training or gained experience. Finally, technicians told us, they often did  not receive approval to attend the courses they have requested as a  priority to meet their developmental needs. FAA officials stated that  training requests are filled according to a facility\u2019s priority, which is  determined through a number of factors, such as the minimum number of  trained people it takes to maintain the facility, the size of the airport where  the equipment is maintained, or the amount of equipment at a facility that  is operationally essential to maintain air traffic control. When a facility  receives approval for a technician to attend a course and the technician  then cannot attend, Technical Operations Training prioritizes the  remaining requests to determine which technician from which facility  should go instead. FAA officials estimate that, on average, 98 percent of  operationally essential training requests in recent years have been met.  For example, in fiscal year 2009, there were 5,100 requests for training, and  5,100 slots were provided. However, academy officials estimated that 50 to  70 percent of the courses are not filled to capacity. As mentioned below,  technicians are not able to attend all training classes they receive approval  to attend because of workforce staffing issues at their facility."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FAA Is Still Developing a Mix of Centralized and Decentralized Approaches for Technician Training", "paragraphs": ["According to our analysis, FAA has mostly developed the capacity to  identify design and development initiatives to improve individual and  agency performance.

Training at the academy focuses on  legacy equipment, while vendor courses are the primary source of training  for next-generation systems coming into the FAA inventory.", "FAA is limited in its choice of training delivery mechanisms because of the  unique and complex nature of air traffic control system components. For  example, the unique configurations of and modifications to FAA  generators make it difficult to replicate their features and teach  technicians how to maintain them at a field office or vendor location  rather than at the academy, according to academy officials. (Fig. 6  illustrates the variety of generators available in the training classroom at  the FAA Academy.) Overall, technicians in our focus groups maintained  that, compared with the training offered at the academy, vendor training  was less informative and more conceptual, offered less hands-on and  problem-solving instruction, and was limited by proprietary considerations  that restricted students\u2019 access to some information. Additionally, they  said, vendors could not teach FAA-specific safety issues or explain how  their systems interacted with other components of air traffic management  systems.", "No vendor courses have been approved to replace academy training for  legacy courses, although Technical Operations Training is studying the  feasibility of having vendors provide certain courses that are currently  offered through the academy and are filled to capacity. For example,  evaluations are under way to determine if the engine generator courses  can be taught by approved colleges and universities. In deciding how to  provide these courses, FAA is considering capacity, quality, and cost  criteria. Specifically, FAA is assessing whether (1) the academy courses  have a sufficient number of seats to fulfill the training requests; (2) the  replacement courses meet FAA\u2019s standards for training in the applicable  subject areas; and (3) how the costs of academy training would compare  with the costs of tuition, a per diem allowance, and travel for training at a  local junior college. Technical Operations Training officials told us they  will need to make a business case to ATO management that there will be  cost savings from college training as well as demonstrate that the  technicians\u2019 training needs can be met with that approach.", "FAA is also comparing the merits of different training delivery  mechanisms, such as computer-based simulation training, but had adopted  no such mechanisms as of April 2010. Some technicians told us that  emerging FAA maintenance policies limit hands-on interaction with  systems and that the combination of these policies and modifications to  equipment over time make the technicians feel they are no longer qualified  to work on certain systems. For example, some technicians stated that  because they have been away from training for so long, they are unable to  apply their now-dated knowledge and skill when doing their work. Others  stated that preventive maintenance checks served as critical refresher  training and familiarization tools, and they raised concerns about the  effects on their proficiency of less frequent preventive maintenance  checks resulting from the change in maintenance philosophy. Technicians  suggested that different methods, such as the use of simulator training or  the addition of detailed visuals or photographs in training and system  manuals, would greatly aid their job knowledge in lieu of the reduced  hands-on training.

Technical Operations  Training officials confirmed that three to four times a week, on average,  technicians who have requested and received approval to attend training  have not been able to do so because of staffing issues at their facilities. In  an effort to enhance training, increase technician proficiency, and avoid  burdening technicians in the field while other technicians are in training,  officials told us that they have been working to shorten the training time  for certain technician courses by adjusting training methods and  enhancing demonstrations of proficiency at the academy.

(3) How have the costs of  technician training, including travel costs, changed in recent years?", "To describe the composition of FAA\u2019s technician workforce, we obtained  information on its nature and scope, including job descriptions and job  series information; the current, historical, and projected population of  technicians; hiring trends; the current and projected numbers of  technicians eligible to retire; the number of technicians who retire when  eligible; and data on the geographic locations of work stations. We  summarized FAA and federal personnel data from the Office of Personnel  Management\u2019s Central Personnel Data File (CPDF) on the technician  workforce and developed trends in staffing and attrition for fiscal years  1999 through 2009, as well as retirement projections through fiscal year  2020. We assessed the reliability of the CPDF data by reviewing related  documentation and determined that those data were of sufficient quality to  be used for the purposes of this report. We focused on the technicians in  the 2101 job series because (1) according to FAA data about the technician  workforce, the majority of technicians are in the 2101 job series and (2)  the FAA reauthorization bill refers to systems specialists, the employees  included in the 2101 job series.", "To determine the extent to which FAA has incorporated key practices of  leading organizations in its workforce planning and training for  technicians, we sought to compare FAA\u2019s efforts with those of leading  organizations. We selected key leading practices in these areas by  reviewing, in conjunction with subject matter experts, our past work to  identify those most applicable. To determine how FAA\u2019s technician- specific workforce planning and training components and practices  compare with those of leading organizations, we reviewed FAA documents  and regulations that detailed FAA policies and practices in the functional  areas of workforce planning and training. We discussed the structure and  processes of FAA\u2019s workforce planning and training for technicians with  FAA officials responsible for implementing those human capital  procedures within the Air Traffic Organization (ATO) line of business,  where the technicians are located. We interviewed FAA officials at FAA  headquarters in Washington, D.C., and at FAA\u2019s Training Academy in  Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Additionally, we obtained the perspectives of  the bargaining unit that represents FAA technicians on FAA\u2019s workforce  planning and training for technicians through semistructured interviews  with representatives of the Professional Airways Safety Specialists  (PASS), the employee union representing technicians. We assessed the  extent to which FAA followed each practice by applying the following  scale: \u201cFully\u201d indicated that, in our judgment, all or virtually all aspects of  the practice were followed; \u201cmostly\u201d indicated that more than half but less  than all or virtually all were followed; \u201cpartially\u201d indicated that less than  half but more than a few were followed; and \u201cminimally\u201d indicated that  few or no aspects of the practice were followed. We conducted our  comparison of FAA\u2019s practices with leading practices at a high level: More  detailed comparisons could disclose specific leading practices that FAA is  not following, beyond those discussed in this report. We did not assess the  effectiveness of FAA\u2019s workforce planning, because factors other than  FAA\u2019s human capital system may also affect FAA\u2019s performance.", "To balance the views of FAA management and obtain perspectives of the  technician workforce on FAA\u2019s workforce planning and training efforts,  we conducted 12 focus group meetings with 101 FAA technicians and 12  academy managers at 11 locations. These meetings involved structured  small-group discussions designed to gain more in-depth information about  specific issues that cannot easily be obtained from single or serial  interviews. Consistent with typical focus group methodologies, our design  included multiple groups with varying characteristics but some similarity  in experience and responsibility. Most groups involved 7 to 10  participants. Discussions were structured, guided by a moderator who  used a standardized list of questions to encourage participants to share  their thoughts and experiences. Our overall objective in using a focus  group approach was to obtain the views, insights, and feelings of FAA  technicians on issues related to their workload, staffing, and training.", "We conducted 12 separate focus group sessions\u201411 with FAA technicians,  including a range of (1) technical specialties (Communications,  Automation, Navigation, Environmental, and Surveillance/Radar), (2)  experience (less senior and more senior staff), and (3) operating  environments (e.g., air route traffic control center , terminal radar  approach control , air traffic control tower, or general national  airspace system ). By including GNAS participants in the focus  groups, we ensured that the perspectives of technicians that perform their  duties at geographically distant, isolated, or smaller facilities were  included. One additional focus group was held with academy managers  from all areas of technician instruction. Table 20 identifies the specialties  included in the focus groups at each location. We traveled to FAA facilities  in Baltimore, Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, Miami, and Oklahoma City to  conduct the focus groups.", "We developed a guide to assist the moderator in leading the discussions.  The guide helped the moderator address several topics related to  workforce planning (staffing levels, workload issues, the Next Generation  Air Transportation System , contract personnel, reliability- centered maintenance) and training (quality and quantity of training, FAA- provided and vendor-provided training). We assured participants of the  anonymity of their responses, promising that their names would not be  directly linked to their responses.", "Methodologically, focus groups are not designed to (1) demonstrate the  extent of a problem or to generalize results to a larger population, (2)  develop a consensus to arrive at an agreed-upon plan or make decisions  about what actions to take, or (3) provide statistically representative  samples or reliable quantitative estimates. Instead, they are intended to  generate in-depth information about the reasons for the focus group  participants\u2019 attitudes on specific topics and to offer insights into their  concerns about and support for an issue.", "The projectability of the information produced by our focus groups is  limited for several reasons. First, the information includes only the  responses of FAA technicians from the 11 selected groups. Second, while  the composition of the groups was designed to ensure a range of  specialties, experience, and operational environments, the groups were  not randomly sampled. Third, participants were asked questions about  their specific experiences with workload, staffing, and training. Other FAA  technicians who did not participate in our focus groups may have different  experiences. Because of these limitations, we did not rely entirely on focus  groups, but rather used several different methodologies to corroborate  and support our conclusions.", "To determine how training funds, including travel funds, have changed in  recent years, we obtained quantitative cost data (including travel costs)  from ATO and FAA Academy officials from fiscal year 2005 through May  2010 and compared these data for FAA-provided and vendor-provided  training. We also conducted semistructured interviews with FAA  management about technician training costs. We analyzed student travel  costs for academy training obtained from FAA\u2019s DELPHI system and  personnel compensation and benefits of academy instructors data from  the Federal Personnel and Payroll System. However, as FAA\u2019s cost  accounting system is not sufficient to provide costs for vendor training  and travel-related activities, the team had to analyze data provided from  FAA\u2019s Electronic Learning Management System (ELMS) to summarize the  cost of vendor technician training. We presented the data provided by FAA  despite the fact that the data are unaudited at the level of detail needed for  findings presented in table 19. As a result, this report identified a  recommendation for FAA to consider modifying its cost accounting  system or cost analysis techniques to develop information about the cost  of in-house and vendor-provided training, and of the travel related to those  training activities. We assessed the reliability of the data we obtained  electronically by reviewing relevant documentation and internal controls,  and interviewing agency officials, and determined that those data were of  sufficient quality to be used for the purposes of this report.", "To develop information on the occurrence and duration of scheduled and  unscheduled outages, we obtained operational performance data from  FAA for fiscal years 2000 through 2009. FAA outage data are collected in  accordance with the reporting guidance contained in FAA Order 6040.15E,  National Airspace Performance Reporting System, and are currently  entered and stored in the Maintenance Management System. These data  are validated and fed into the National Airspace System Performance  Analysis System (NASPAS). NASPAS may be used for facility or service  performance trend analysis. NASPAS is capable of extracting user-defined  outage parameters, performing calculations, and generating graphics for  report writing. To understand how such outages affect the national  airspace system\u2019s efficiency, safety, and costs; industry; and the flying  public, we conducted structured interviews with FAA and PASS officials.  We assessed the reliability of the outage data by reviewing relevant  documentation and interviewing agency officials, and determined that  those data were of sufficient quality to be used for the purposes of this  report.", "We conducted this performance audit from May 2009 to October 2010 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those  standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient,  appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence  obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: ATO Organizational Chart", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Teresa Spisak, Assistant Director;  Jessica A.
