EPA officials told us that funding work  for the three priority issues has led to some accelerated restoration  results."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Selected Task Force Agencies Identified GLRI Work and Funding Using Four General Steps", "paragraphs": ["EPA officials described four steps that Task Force agencies generally  followed to identify GLRI work and funding, and the five agencies we  reviewed followed these steps. The steps are: (1) agency identification of  GLRI work; (2) Task Force agreement on scope and funding for agencies\u2019  work; (3) solicitation of proposals for projects designed to carry out  agencies\u2019 GLRI work, if the work was to be conducted by entities other  than the agencies; and (4) selection of projects.", "EPA officials told us that the first step generally occurred 2 years before  the fiscal year in which the work was to be carried out, in order to coincide  with the federal budget cycle. During that step, the officials told us that the  agencies each did an internal analysis to identify GLRI work that they  wanted to conduct in that fiscal year. For example, FWS officials told us  that the agency\u2019s regional officials coordinated to identify new work that  the agency planned to do in order to achieve its goals and then compared  this work with 2010-2014 Action Plan goals to identify those projects that   The Corps\u2019 approach to this step was different;  also met the goals.according to Corps officials, they selected projects that were already  planned and ready to be conducted, and that were compatible with the  2010-2014 Action Plan. At this point, agency officials also identified the  type of financial agreements they were likely to use to conduct the work  or whether the agency would conduct the work itself.", "For the second step, the five agencies we reviewed held discussions with  the Task Force and agreed on the work that would be done in a given  fiscal year, as well as the amount of GLRI funds that would be needed to  conduct that work. In general, once the agencies made a final  determination of the work they would do in a fiscal year, and the GLRI  funds that would be made available, each agency entered into an  interagency agreement with EPA to transfer GLRI funds from EPA to the  appropriate agency. The interagency agreements we reviewed included  the following two parts: a form that identified the amount to be transferred from EPA to the  agency that was responsible for the work, signed by both agencies;and a scope-of-work organized into discrete topics called templates that  typically included a description of the work, the GLRI Action Plan  goals, objectives, or measures of progress that the work would  achieve, and the amount of GLRI funds to be used.", "EPA officials told us that the Task Force agencies were expected to  spend their funds as detailed in their interagency agreement, but they  could amend it with EPA approval to, for example, increase the amount of  funds to be transferred to an agency or revise the scope of work.", "GLRI Templates  Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI)  templates address Action Plan focus areas,  and can describe work that would be  conducted through multiple projects, or  through a specific, individual project. An  example of a template that describes work  that would be conducted through multiple  projects is a Natural Resources Conservation  Service (NRCS) template that addresses the  nearshore health and nonpoint source  pollution focus area. According to the  template, NRCS would provide agricultural  producers with GLRI funds and technical  assistance to implement conservation  practices to contribute to the 2010-2014  Action Plan goal of significantly reducing soil  erosion and sediment, nutrients, and  pollutants flowing into tributaries. An example  of a project-specific template is a U.S. Army  Corps of Engineers template to complete the  design, and initiate construction, of a facility to  manage dredged sediments in Green Bay  Harbor, Wisconsin. The project is intended to  hold 2.35 million cubic yards of sediments,  and restore a chain of islands and more than  1,200 acres of coastal wetland habitat. applications would use to rank applications and select projects.officials told us that applicants may be asked to provide funds to the  project.", "The fourth step in identifying GLRI work and funding was the selection of  specific projects. Generally, officials from the selected agencies described  similar processes for evaluating project proposals that were submitted in  response to requests for applications. Specifically, they said that agency  officials with the appropriate expertise reviewed and ranked the submitted  proposals against information in the request for applications and selected  the best scoring projects for funding. At the Corps and NOAA, officials  said they evaluated contract bids or proposals, and awarded the contract  to the vendor with a bid or proposal representing the best value to the  government.", "Of the 19 projects we reviewed for which funds were made available for  the GLRI in fiscal years 2010 through 2012 and that addressed each of  the five focus areas in the 2010-2014 Action Plan, 11 were executed  through grants, 2 were executed through cooperative agreements, 3 were  executed by a Task Force agency, 2 were conducted through contracts,  and 1 was executed through a financial assistance contract. One project  addressed the toxic substances and Areas of Concern focus area; 5  addressed the invasive species focus area; 3 addressed the nearshore  health and nonpoint source pollution focus area; 5 addressed the habitat  and wildlife protection and restoration focus area; and 5 addressed the  accountability, education, monitoring, evaluation, communication, and  partnerships focus area. In addition, the recipients conducting the 19  projects included 8 federal entities; 4 state, local, or tribal entities; 4  academic institutions; and 3 nongovernmental organizations. We found  that the solicitations for 11 of the 19 projects reflected the descriptions of  work in the related templates. The 8 remaining projects were not solicited  because 4 were conducted by the agency, 2 were not competitively  awarded, 1 project had been ongoing since before the GLRI, and the  recipient was identified in the interagency agreement, and 1 project was  conducted by a recipient that had been selected prior to the GLRI as one  of a few with the specific skills required for the project.

According to EPA officials,  for fiscal years 2010 and 2011, the Task Force determined the work an  agency would do on an agency-by-agency basis. Beginning with fiscal  year 2012, the process began emphasizing interagency discussion as the  Task Force created three subgroups with federal agency members, one  for each of three priority issues. The three priority issues, which aligned  with three of the five focus areas in the 2010-2014 Action Plan, were (1)  cleaning up and delisting Areas of Concern located entirely or partially in  the United States, (2) preventing and controlling invasive species, and (3)   For  reducing phosphorus runoff that contributes to harmful algal blooms.fiscal year 2015, EPA officials said that the Task Force agencies had  begun creating additional subgroups to discuss and agree on scope and  funding for agencies\u2019 GLRI work.", "For fiscal years 2010 and 2011, the Task Force and the five agencies  agreed on work that each agency would do on an agency-by-agency  basis. Officials from the agencies said that they identified work from their  existing plans and interacted with the Task Force to determine the work  the agencies would do and the funds the agencies\u2019 should receive.  Because the program began in fiscal year 2010, this process did not take  place 2 years in advance, as it would in subsequent years. EPA officials  told us that in 2010 the agencies also began agreeing on work for fiscal  year 2011. After Congress made funds available for the GLRI for fiscal  year 2010, and again after fiscal year 2011, the Task Force revisited the  initial agreements made with each agency to finalize the funding  amounts.", "In agreeing on GLRI work and funding for fiscal years 2012 through 2014,  the Task Force created a subgroup for each of the three priority issues  and set aside a total of about $180 million to pay for work to address  these issues. The Task Force created subgroups staffed by officials from  relevant Task Force agencies to discuss and agree on the scope and  funding for agencies\u2019 work to address the three priority issues.  Specifically, officials from EPA, FWS, NOAA, the Corps, and the U.S.  Geological Survey participated in the cleaning up and delisting of Areas of  Concern and the invasive species prevention subgroups.

These projects  included developing early detection and monitoring, and tools and  technology to discover whether Asian carp were already present in  the Great Lakes Basin. The subgroup agreed to adopt the amount of  funds, $19.5 million, in fiscal year 2012, based on estimates made by  the Asian Carp Regional Coordinating Committee. In fiscal year 2013,  the Coordinating Committee reduced the amount it estimated was  needed for invasive species work in the Great Lakes Basin to $16  million. The subgroup agreed to continue funding this priority issue at  $19.5 million in fiscal years 2013 and 2014, but it divided the funds  into $16 million for Asian carp work and $3.5 million for other invasive  species, such as phragmites and feral hogs.  The subgroup used the  Asian Carp Control Strategy Framework to guide the amount of GLRI  funds that should be provided to each of the Task Force agencies with  responsibility for conducting work to address this priority issue.", "Phragmites australis, or common reed, is a perennial grass now common in North  American wetlands. Invasive phragmites create tall, dense stands that degrade wetlands  and coastal areas by crowding out native plants and animals, blocking shoreline views,  and reducing access for swimming, fishing, and hunting. Feral hogs are domestic hogs  that have either escaped or been released, and they can be found in 39 states including  the Great Lakes region. They cause damage to crops and habitat and can cause erosion  by digging for food. They also carry diseases that threaten humans and animals. In 2014,  the U.S. Department of Agriculture estimated that feral hogs caused $1.5 billion in annual  damage and control costs.", "Phosphorous reduction subgroup: Using available models and  data to identify geographic areas that were contributing more nutrients  to the Great Lakes than others, the subgroup determined that priority  work should be focused on three watersheds where algal blooms had  occurred. The three watersheds were the Lower Fox River in  Wisconsin; the Maumee River watershed in Ohio, Michigan, and  Indiana; and the Saginaw River in Michigan. The subgroup agreed  that $11 million should be set aside for this priority issue for fiscal year  2012, and to increase that amount to $13.1 million for fiscal year  2013, and to $14.4 million for fiscal year 2014. EPA provided the  majority of funds for this priority issue to NRCS because it is the  federal agency that works with agricultural producers to implement  conservation practices to reduce nutrients in runoff, and Task Force  agency officials determined NRCS was best suited to address nutrient  reduction. EPA provided the remaining funds to the U.S. Geological  Survey for monitoring projects because of its experience in monitoring  water supply and water quality.", "To agree on GLRI work to be conducted in fiscal year 2015 and future  fiscal years, EPA officials told us that the Task Force began creating  additional subgroups through which Task Force agency officials would  work together to identify each agency\u2019s GLRI work and share of GLRI  funding in all five of the focus areas in the 2015-2019 Action Plan, not just  the three priority issues. According to EPA officials, the use of subgroups  to meet and agree on work and funding created a process for conducting  GLRI work that all Task Force agencies agreed needed to be done, rather  than each agency identifying its own GLRI work. According to EPA  officials, for fiscal year 2015, the new subgroups developed strategies for  dealing with issues and then identified the work proposed by agencies  that helped to achieve the overall strategies.

EPA announced  in October 2014 that the White Lake and Deer Lake Areas of Concern  had been delisted\u2014both had been identified by the Areas of Concern  subgroup for accelerated cleanup with priority issue funds\u2014and EPA  officials told us that they expect cleanup work to be completed at four  other Areas of Concern in fiscal year 2015 as a result of receiving priority  issues funds. Cleanup work included removing contaminated sediment  and diverting water from an underground mine. In the 25 years before the  three priority issues were identified, only one Area of Concern located  entirely in the United States had been delisted.", "EPA officials said that identifying and funding the three priority issues for  fiscal years 2012 through 2014 has also allowed for continued success in  invasive species prevention and resulted in some progress in reducing  phosphorus runoff that contributes to harmful algal blooms. However,  restoration results in those priority issues are less clear than in the Areas  of Concern priority issue, in large part because the factors contributing to  those priority issues persist and are likely to continue into the future. For  example, dams, canals, and other structures that were created to support  navigation and power production in the Great Lakes Basin also created  channels that connect the Great Lakes and Mississippi River Basins.  These channels are of serious concern as a potential means for Asian  carp or other invasive species to enter the Great Lakes.", "EPA funded work on priority issues from the amounts made available for  the GLRI in fiscal years 2012 through 2014, shifting funds from other  GLRI work to the priority issues. EPA officials described the funds set  aside for the priority issues as a realignment of GLRI funds; that is, the  funds used for the priority issues were taken from the existing funds that  had been made available for the GLRI. Overall, the Task Force set aside  a total of $180 million for the priority issues for this period: $52.2 million of  the available GLRI amounts for all priority issues in fiscal year 2012,  $63.4 million in fiscal year 2013, and $64.7 million in fiscal year 2014.

First, they said there is a limit to the  amount of work that can be conducted for some restoration efforts. For  example, GLRI funds for reducing agricultural runoff can only be given to  recipients in the Great Lakes Basin. These recipients are typically  landowners, and there is a finite number of landowners in the Great  Lakes Basin interested in conducting GLRI work who also have suitable  land and ready projects. In addition, EPA officials told us that NRCS is the  only Task Force agency equipped to oversee phosphorous reduction  work targeted in agricultural areas, and the agency has a fixed number of  personnel that it can use to oversee GLRI work.

We found that each of the five Task Force agencies collected  this and other project information by establishing reporting requirements  in grants, cooperative agreements, and contracts for recipients.

In addition, we found that recipients reported a range of results. For  example, recipients from eight projects reported results that can be  directly linked to restoration, such as increasing lake trout production,  removing acres of invasive plant species, and protecting acres of  marshland. For one of these projects, the Buffalo Audubon Society  reported results needed to restore critical bird habitat, such as planting  3,204 plants and removing invasive species, among other results. For  another project, the Great Lakes Fishery Commission reported results in  the form of improved methods for capturing sea lamprey. According to a  Great Lakes Fishery Commission official, the results from this project will  help to further suppress sea lamprey production in the Great Lakes  thereby reducing the damage they cause to native and desirable species.", "For example, a single lamprey can kill up to about 40 pounds of fish in its  lifetime.", "Recipients for the 11 remaining projects reported results that can be  indirectly linked to restoration; that is, the results may contribute to  restoration over time. These included results such as simulations and  data for helping decision makers make better restoration decisions in light  of climate change, and education and outreach tools to increase  awareness of invasive species. In addition, a University of Wisconsin- Madison representative told us that the University\u2019s project to improve  applied environmental literacy, outreach, and action in Great Lakes  schools and communities, has already contributed to restoration. Some of  the University\u2019s progress reports noted that the project has already  resulted in more than 110 school teams that guided students in  restoration, service-learning, inquiry, and citizen science monitoring  during the 2013-2014 school year, among other things. The  representative told us that this contributed to restoration because  participating students have built rain gardens and implemented other  conservation practices. Similarly, the Corps used GLRI funds to  complete a feasibility study in Highland Park, Illinois, and the study led to  a restoration project that is expected to restore and enhance 4 acres of  coastal habitat along the Lake Michigan shoreline, among other things.

However, our  review found that some of the data collected in GLAS were inaccurate  and therefore may not be sufficiently reliable to monitor and report project  progress. For example, GLAS collected project information in more than  20 data fields, including the project\u2019s title, funding amount, funding year,  funding agency, recipient, focus area, state, end date, status, and related  Area of Concern and watershed. We selected six data fields that could  contribute to our understanding of projects and assessed their reliability.  Specifically, we reviewed the GLAS data fields for funding year, funding  agency, recipient, status, end date, and funding amount. For each of the  six fields, we reviewed field definitions and data entry procedures, and we  manually checked data entries. We found that the funding year and  funding agency data fields were sufficiently reliable, that is, accurate and  complete, for the purposes of monitoring and reporting on the progress of  GLRI projects. However, we found that the other four data fields were  not sufficiently reliable for that purpose. The results of our analysis are as  follows:", "Recipients. GLAS data on project funding recipients, which EPA\u2019s  GLAS User Guide defined as the organizations that actually  conducted the work, were inconsistent. For the 1,558 projects funded  by the five agencies we reviewed, we compared the recipients that  were identified in GLAS with data obtained from the agencies on  recipients that had received GLRI funds for these projects directly  from the agencies. We found that GLAS users did not identify  recipients in GLAS consistently. Specifically, three of the agencies  sometimes or always identified only the agency as the recipient in  GLAS, even if the agency awarded the funds for that project to other  entities that conducted the work. For example, one agency identified  itself as the funding recipient for 118 projects in GLAS, but data we  obtained from the agency identified other entities as the recipients for  most, or 95, of those projects. Similarly, another agency identified  itself as the funding recipient for 311 projects in GLAS, but data we  obtained from the agency identified other entities as the recipients for  almost half, or 151, of those projects. In addition, a third agency  identified itself as the recipient for all 26 of the agency\u2019s GLRI projects  in GLAS. While it is the case that some of the agency\u2019s recipients are  private citizens, whose identities the agency does not want to release,  the agency awarded funds to recipients other than private citizens for  18 of its projects.", "Project status. GLAS users did not define status the same way and  therefore may have entered the status of their projects inconsistently.  To report a project\u2019s status, GLAS users selected from a drop-down  list of options, including started, percentage completed, and  completed. We asked officials at four of the five agencies we  reviewed how they defined \u201ccompleted\u201d and found that the agencies  did not mean the same thing when selecting completed. For example,  one agency official told us that for projects involving construction,  completed means that the bulk of the contractor\u2019s effort was  completed and that the ecological benefits of the project were at least  partially realized, even if additional project activities and final  payments may have not been completed. Officials from another  agency told us that completed means that all of the funds for the  project were obligated and expended, or all contracts were completed,  cancelled, or terminated. EPA officials told us that many recipients did  not report projects as completed until the grant itself was closed out,  which can take as long as a year from the completion of fieldwork.  With agencies using different definitions, it is not clear what the GLAS  data represented for those projects identified as completed. For  example, GLAS users could have selected completed for their  projects when the project work was finished, when all the funds had  been expended, or when the financial agreement was closed out. As  a result, GLAS data cannot be used to reliably determine how many  GLRI projects have been completed.", "Project end date. Although not a required data field in GLAS, most  projects (more than 75 percent) in GLAS had an end date listed.  However, some GLAS data on the project end dates were  inconsistent with project status reported in GLAS. We analyzed the  end dates in GLAS for 1,890 projects as of July 2014 by checking for  errors and by comparing the end dates with the projects\u2019 status.Through this analysis, we found that of the 799 projects identified in  GLAS as completed, 14 percent (112) had end dates that had not yet  been reached. In addition, 698 projects had end dates that had  already passed, but 28 percent of those (194) had not been identified  in GLAS as completed. As a result, GLAS data on the end dates of  projects are unreliable and cannot be used to determine the number  of projects that were completed or are expected to be completed by a  certain date.", "GLRI funding amounts. Some GLAS data on the GLRI funding  amounts for projects were inaccurate. Specifically, after reviewing the  GLAS data we provided on funding amounts for 1,558 projects, four of  the five agencies identified inaccuracies in the GLRI funding amounts  that the agencies or their recipients had reported in GLAS. For  example, the funding amount for one project in GLAS was $8.3 million  less than the actual funding amount, which agency officials attributed  to a data entry error. Similarly, officials from a second agency  identified a project for which the funding amount in GLAS was about  $219,000 more than the actual funding amount and told us that the  reason for the error was unknown. Officials from a third agency also  identified projects for which they said the agency had entered  incorrect funding amounts, including 11 projects for which the GLAS  data overreported the funding by $523,000. And, officials from a fourth  agency identified 19 projects for which the funding amounts the  agency had reported in GLAS were incorrect in part because of data  entry errors, but they did not identify the dollar amount of the errors.  Although we cannot extrapolate these examples of errors in GLAS on  project funding to the 11 other Task Force agencies, the amount of  these errors raises concerns about the accuracy of GLAS data on  GLRI funds.", "Some of the errors we found in GLAS data may have been the result of  agencies\u2019 different interpretations of guidance or unclear guidance.  Specifically, EPA\u2019s GLAS User Guide was the formal guidance document  that defined GLAS data fields, such as recipients, project status, and end  dates, but EPA left it up to the Task Force agencies to decide how to  enter the data. For example, according to an EPA official, the GLAS data  identifying recipients used the lead organizations entered by GLAS users.  The GLAS User Guide defined lead organization as the organization that  actually conducted the project. However, in practice, the Task Force  agencies varied regarding which entity they identified as the recipient, the  funding agency or the organization conducting the project. In addition, the  GLAS User Guide did not provide clear guidance. For example, EPA  required that GLAS users report project status in GLAS, but the GLAS  User Guide did not specify how users should choose a project\u2019s status  from the drop-down menu and did not define available options. Under the  federal standards for internal control, agencies are to clearly document  internal controls, and the documentation is to appear in management  directives, administrative policies, or operating manuals.", "Similarly, although it was not required, the guide did not specify how  users should determine what the end date is when they did enter it.  Without specifying this, GLAS users may have entered information in the  end date field inconsistently. For example, we found that some projects  had a completed status but had not reached their reported end dates, and  others had end dates that had already passed but did not have a  completed status. Specifying in the guide how to determine the end date  would have been consistent with federal standards for internal control that  call for clearly documenting internal controls. According to EPA officials,  the GLAS User Guide did not specify how GLAS users should determine  a project\u2019s end date because the officials thought this data field was  intuitive. Because the GLAS User guide did not require GLAS users to  enter end dates for all projects, however, EPA may not have complete  information on GLRI projects in GLAS. According to our February 2009  guide on assessing the reliability of computer-processed data,reliable when they are accurate and complete.", "In May 2015, when EPA stopped using GLAS and began using the  Environmental Accomplishments in the Great Lakes (EAGL) information  system to collect GLRI project information, the agency issued initial  guidance that included definitions of the data fields in the system. For  example, the guidance defines recipient name as the organization  actually doing the work, and project end date as the date that the project  ended or is planned to end; the data field lead organization is no longer  included. We reviewed the guidance and determined that the definitions  provided were clear and could be used to enter data consistently. In  addition, we found that the guidance clearly identifies those data fields  that are required, including project end date. However, while the guidance  specifies that users should select one project status option from the drop  down list in the system, it does not identify or define the available options.", "Other errors that agencies identified in their GLAS data, such as in the  GLRI funding amounts data, arose from data entry errors or lags in data  updates, according to officials from some of the Task Force agencies we  reviewed. Some of these inaccuracies could have been caught through  data quality controls or other edit checks, but our analysis found that EPA  did not have controls for GLAS to prevent such errors. Under the federal  standards for internal control, agencies are to implement control activities,  such as verifications and reconciliations, which can be computerized or  manual, and document internal controls, such as documenting  procedures on how such verifications are to be implemented (e.g., who is  to conduct periodic reviews of the completeness and accuracy\u2014that is,  reliability\u2014of data). Of the five agencies we reviewed, EPA officials told  us that they reviewed their own agency data and relied on the four other  Task Force agencies to use their own processes to ensure that the data  they or their recipients entered in GLAS are reliable. Of the four other  agencies, three did not identify processes they used to ensure the  reliability of data that they or their recipients entered in GLAS. Officials  from the fourth agency told us that their agency reviewed its GLAS entries  annually by comparing a spreadsheet of GLAS data provided by EPA with  its own programmatic reports and reports from its financial system. Even  with its review process, in January 2015, that agency identified errors in  its GLAS data for nearly 20 percent of its fiscal year 2010 through fiscal  year 2012 GLRI projects. Most were errors in the funding amounts  entered by the agency, which agency officials attributed to data entry  errors and changes that had not been updated in GLAS. Similarly,  officials from one of the other agencies noted that, even when they found  errors, certain data fields, including GLRI funding amounts, could not be  edited by the agencies and that the agencies had to contact EPA to make  corrections.", "Without control activities, such as some form of verification, data errors  are likely to continue, making the data collected into the system used to  collect GLRI project information insufficiently reliable to ensure monitoring  and reporting on GLRI progress as directed in the conference report. In  commenting on a draft of this report, EPA stated that it plans to establish  data control activities, such as verifications and documented procedures,  for ensuring the reliability of the EAGL information system. In discussing  these comments, EPA officials told us that the most important difference  between GLAS and EAGL is that EAGL limits data entry to Task Force  agency officials. The officials did not have a time frame for establishing  data control activities, and told us that they wanted the Task Force  agencies to become comfortable using the new system first. Until EPA  and the Task Force agencies make a decision about the data system and  the agency fully implements the actions needed to address the reliability  of GLRI project data, EPA and the Task Force agencies cannot have  confidence that EAGL can provide consistent, accurate, and complete  information. Thus, we urge EPA to implement these actions as quickly as  possible.", "EPA officials told us that, in 2012, they began to review GLAS and to  consider whether to upgrade GLAS to improve it or develop a new  system. This review included identifying potential improvements and  considering whether GLAS is the right tool for monitoring and reporting on  the GLRI. The Task Force also convened a subgroup of Task Force  agency officials to determine what the next version of GLAS should be.  One concern EPA officials expressed about this decision was the cost to  create a new system to collect detailed data, and they noted that they are  hesitant to make that investment in the face of uncertainty over whether  the GLRI will continue to be funded from year to year. EPA officials told  us that the agency created EAGL in February 2015 and, after consulting  with the Task Force agencies, conducted pilot tests of the system for a  few months, while we were completing our work. After this testing, in May  2015, EPA officials decided to use EAGL to collect information to monitor  and report on GLRI progress, and they made the system available to  Task Force agencies for an initial period of data entry. Specifically, EPA  officials transferred key project information from GLAS into EAGL and  asked the Task Force agencies to enter new project information and  update existing information. According to EPA officials, EAGL will improve  the consistency and completeness of information about GLRI projects.  EPA officials told us that the agency plans to use this initial period of data  entry to get feedback from the Task Force agencies and to make changes  to EAGL and the draft data entry guidance to address any problems and  refine definitions. The EPA officials said their goal is to have EAGL ready  for data entry at the beginning of fiscal year 2016."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The United States has committed enormous resources to help restore the  health of the Great Lakes ecosystem, a region that is vital to the United  States both economically and socially, with some progress. Nonetheless,  Great Lakes restoration remains an ongoing, long-term effort. To gauge  progress toward restoration, EPA and the Task Force agencies have  established measures of progress for the GLRI and collected information  in GLAS to report on progress. EPA and the Task Force agencies have  proceeded carefully over the last 2 years as they have evaluated how  best to collect and report GLRI data. In May 2015, while we were  completing our work, EPA replaced GLAS with a new system to collect  GLRI project information and issued guidance that included definitions of  data fields and identified which data fields are required. This is a good  first step to resolving the data inconsistencies that we identified in GLAS,  which resulted, in part, because of unclear or undocumented definitions,  data requirements, and guidance about entering important data.  However, EPA has not yet established data control activities or other edit  checks, although in commenting on a draft of this report, EPA stated that  it plans to establish data control activities, such as verifications and  documented procedures, for ensuring the reliability of the EAGL  information system.

In particular,  for a recommendation in our draft report that EPA determine whether the  agency should continue using GLAS or acquire a different system to  collect information to monitor and report on GLRI progress, EPA stated in  its written comments that GLAS is no longer in use and has been  replaced by EAGL. We interviewed EPA officials about EAGL and its  status, as well as plans for implementing it, and determined that the  agency has made a final decision and taken appropriate actions to adopt  it. As a result, we removed the recommendation from the report. We also  added information about EAGL in the report.", "In addition to replacing GLAS with EAGL, EPA noted that the agency has  taken action to address three recommendations we made about ensuring  data reliability in our draft report. First, for a recommendation that EPA  should ensure that GLAS or another system requires important data to be  entered, according to EPA, EAGL will require important information,  including project end date, to be entered by the Task Force agencies.  Second, for a recommendation that GLAS or another system documents  definitions and guidance for entering data into the system, the agency in  its written comments stated that it has developed an initial guidance  document for data entry that it is revising based on the initial round of  data entry into EAGL. We reviewed the initial guidance and determined  that it clearly identifies those data fields that are required and that the  definitions provided were clear and could be used to enter data  consistently. As a result, we removed these recommendations from our  report. Third, for a recommendation that EPA should ensure that GLAS or  another system establishes data quality control activities, such as  verifications and documented procedures for ensuring system reliability,  EPA stated that it will establish data quality control activities such as  verifications and documented procedures for ensuring the reliability of the  EAGL information system. Although EPA officials did not have a  timeframe for establishing data quality control activities, the agency has  limited data entry to Task Force agency officials, and we believe the  actions already taken constitute important steps toward enhancing GLRI  oversight. As a result, we removed the recommendation from the report.  We look forward to seeing the agency take this final action. However, until  it is fully implemented, the agency cannot have confidence that the data  produced by EAGL will address the inconsistencies that we identified in  GLAS or that they are complete and accurate.

We reviewed  relevant EPA documents and interviewed EPA officials about the data  input and review for the GLRI financial management update and, based  on this work, determined that it was reliable for our purposes. In addition,  to provide context for how funds for GLRI projects compared with funds  made available for other federal Great Lakes restoration activities, we  analyzed the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s (OMB) Great Lakes  Restoration Crosscut Reports to Congress for 2008 through 2012 and  2014 and the applicable appropriations laws requiring OMB to produce  these reports. We also interviewed OMB staff to obtain information about  the crosscut reports.", "We then selected five Task Force agencies to review in greater detail  because they had received the majority (about 85 percent) of GLRI funds   The five agencies we  made available in fiscal years 2010 through 2014.selected were: EPA, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps), Fish and  Wildlife Service (FWS), Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS),  and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). We  obtained data from EPA\u2019s Great Lakes Accountability System (GLAS) as  of July 2014 to identify the projects funded by the five Task Force  agencies with amounts made available for the GLRI in fiscal years 2010  through 2013. We did not include fiscal year 2014 projects because most  of the amount made available in that year had not been obligated as of  July 2014. We assessed the reliability of the GLAS data on funding  agency and funding year by asking the agencies to verify their projects in  the system, and we believe that the data are sufficiently reliable for  identifying a list and total number of projects funded by the five agencies.", "GLAS data included recipient but, as described below under objective 3,  we do not find that this or certain other GLAS data fields are reliable for  other purposes of reporting. Therefore, to identify the recipients of GLAS  funding, we obtained a list of the recipients from each of the five  agencies, for each of the projects in the GLAS data we obtained. We  used information we obtained from the recipients, their websites, or the  funding agencies to categorize each of the recipients by recipient type,  using the definitions in table 4, and summarized that information.", "In addition, we obtained data from each of the five agencies about the  types of financial agreements they used\u2014grants, cooperative  agreements, and contracts\u2014to determine the percentage of obligations  per financial agreement of amounts made available for the GLRI in fiscal  years 2010 through 2013. We obtained an updated version of GLAS data,  from January 2015, to identify the total number of projects reported by all  Task Force agencies in GLAS.", "To examine the process the Task Force used to identify GLRI work and  funding, we first interviewed officials from the five Task Force agencies.  We used this information, in addition to our previous work on grants  management, to describe the four steps that the Task Force and  agencies generally use to identify GLRI work and funding. We then  analyzed relevant documents to corroborate and obtain information about  each of these steps. Specifically, we analyzed interagency agreements  between EPA and the other Task Force agencies, including the  associated scopes of work; requests for applications; project selection  summaries; and agencies\u2019 policies and guidance on managing grants,  cooperative agreements, and contracts. We also reviewed EPA data on  the amount of GLRI funds in fiscal years 2012 through 2014 that the  agency set aside for issues identified by the Task Force as GLRI priorities  to understand how the Task Force process has evolved. We then  interviewed EPA officials about the process for identifying priority issue  work and funding for fiscal year 2012 through fiscal year 2015. We  reviewed a sample of 19 GLRI projects to understand how the process  was applied to specific cases. For each project, we analyzed documents  from the funding agencies and funding recipients to determine the origin  of each project and why it was selected. The documents we reviewed  included project solicitations, such as announcements of funding  opportunities, requests for applications, or other solicitations; project  proposals and applications; agency documents on why projects were  selected for funding; and project financial agreements such as grant and  cooperative agreement documents.", "We took the following steps to select the sample of 19 GLRI projects.  First, we identified all projects funded by the five Task Force agencies we  reviewed. To do this, we used data from GLAS to create a list of GLRI  projects funded by each of the five agencies we reviewed with amounts  made available for the GLRI in fiscal years 2010 through 2012. We did  not review projects funded with funds made available for the GLRI in  fiscal year 2013 or 2014 because those projects were likely to be in the  early stages of implementation, or not yet started, at the time we began  our review. Second, we categorized these projects by recipient type,  using the process described above. Third, we ranked projects by agency,  recipient type, and funding amount. Finally, we selected the median  project for each agency and recipient type (see table 5 for those projects  selected). We did this to ensure that we include projects that illustrate  typical GLRI funding amounts. We selected at least one project from each  of the following recipient types: federal entities; state, local, or tribal  entities; nongovernmental organizations; and academic institutions.", "Fourth, we also selected the project with the largest amount of GLRI  funds for each agency (see table 6). In the instances where the project  with the largest funding amount was associated with a recipient that we  had already selected, we moved to the project with the next largest  funding amount with a recipient that had not already been selected. This  sample of 19 projects is not representative of all GLRI projects; however,  it captures both projects with typical and large funding amounts from a  range of recipients.", "To examine the information available about GLRI project activities and  results, we first analyzed the three accomplishment reports the Task  Force issued to provide an overview of progress under the GLRI in each  of fiscal years 2010 through 2012. We also reviewed information on  projects available at the GLRI website, http://glri.us, and discussed its  purpose and design with EPA officials. In addition, we obtained  information on the 19 projects we selected for review to identify  information available on project activities and results. We used agency  documents to identify the purpose of the projects and project activities  and results. Specifically, we analyzed project progress reports, and  interviewed, or obtained written responses from, relevant agency officials  and recipient representatives. We also interviewed recipient  representatives about how the projects will contribute to the restoration of  the health of the Great Lakes ecosystem, and we visited the recipients or  locations for 3 of the 19 projects. We visited (1) the \u201cSheboygan River  Area of Concern: pathway to delisting beneficial use impairments\u201d project;  (2) the \u201cGreat Lakes earth partnership\u201d project; and (3) the \u201cRosewood  Park, IL\u201d project and interviewed the relevant funding agency officials and  funding recipient representatives. We selected these three projects in  order to observe work conducted by different recipient types that were  within driving distance of the EPA Region 5 office in Chicago where the  EPA officials that oversee the GLRI are located.", "In addition, we examined project information available for projects  identified in EPA\u2019s database, GLAS, as of July 2014. We selected 6 data  fields that we could use to describe projects and that we wanted to  summarize and include in our report: funding year, funding agency,  status, end date, recipient, and GLRI funding amount. We selected these  6 fields out of the more than 20 data fields in GLAS because they  provided basic information about how GLRI funds have been used for  projects (funding agency, year, GLRI funding amount, and recipient) and  information on the progress of those projects (status and end date). For  example, these data fields can be used to determine first how much  funding an agency provided to a recipient in a fiscal year for a project,  and then the extent to which the project was completed (status) and  when the project would be completed (end date). We assessed the  reliability of these data using three sources of information: EPA\u2019s GLAS  User Guide to identify data field definitions and guidance for entering  data; information we obtained from the five agencies to identify  inaccuracies in the data, such as funding amounts, for their projects in  GLAS; and the agencies\u2019 responses to our questions about GLAS data,  including their procedures for ensuring the reliability of the data and the  known or potential reasons for data errors they identified. In addition, we  conducted electronic testing of the GLAS data to identify missing end  dates and obvious end date errors, such as a date of 1900; compared  projects\u2019 end dates to their status; and compared the recipients identified  in GLAS with the recipient data we obtained from the agencies. On the  basis of this work we determined that the GLAS data on status, end date,  recipient, and GLRI funding amounts were not sufficiently reliable for  reporting on the progress of GLRI projects. In response to EPA\u2019s written  comments on a draft of this report, we interviewed EPA officials about the  Environmental Accomplishments in the Great Lakes (EAGL) information  system and reviewed EAGL guidance.", "As part of our review of GLRI projects, we assessed how the five  agencies we reviewed oversaw projects and ensured accountability for  GLRI funds. First, we identified key internal controls by reviewing the  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government (the federal  standards for internal control), relevant OMB circulars in effect during the first 4 years of the GLRI,  and the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  We then used the following controls to analyze the agencies\u2019  management of GLRI projects: (1) methods to assess the risks of entities  applying for GLRI funds; (2) training required of officials responsible for  managing financial agreements such as grants, cooperative agreements,  and contracts; (3) policies governing site visits; (4) and requirements for  GLRI recipients to submit financial and progress reports.

To assess applicant risk for grants  and cooperative agreements, NOAA officials said that they perform a  credit check for organizations applying for funds, check the System for  Award Management for exclusions from procurement or nonprocurement  activities for those applicants, check the agency\u2019s \u201cdo not pay\u201d list for  delinquent debts, and they also check for Single Audit Act findings. In  addition, NOAA reviews applicants\u2019 past performance. If an organization  is deemed high risk, NOAA will impose a special award condition, such as  requiring the recipient to submit financial or progress reports more  frequently, according to agency officials. The imposed special award  condition remains on the award until the recipient demonstrates  compliance. For awards that are made competitively, NOAA evaluates  applications using criteria set forth in the applicable program regulations  and announcement of federal funding opportunity. According to NOAA  officials, training for officials who managed grants and cooperative  agreements was specific to each of NOAA\u2019s program offices. Within the  National Ocean Service, which has responsibility for the five NOAA GLRI  projects we reviewed, program officers and grant coordinators were  required to complete a certification program, which required completion of  a 3-day course on grants and cooperative agreements and annual  training on grants. The National Ocean Service also required training on  NOAA\u2019s Grants Online system. NOAA did not require site visits for all  projects funded through grants and cooperative agreements. According to  NOAA officials, the decision to conduct a site visit is based on need and  the availability of funds, and high-risk recipients are a priority.

Instead, the agency informally  assesses applicants\u2019 performance capabilities as part of the conservation  planning process and provides technical assistance to producers. NRCS  officials told us that the agency conducts training in contract  management, usually annually, but did not provide us with documentation  of this training. Agency officials said that NRCS conducts site visits  several times a year for financial assistance contracts.", "NRCS also provided GLRI funding through cooperative agreements.  According to agency officials, the majority of the agreements are with  entities that have previously partnered with the agency, such as state  programs or local conservation districts. For new applicants, NRCS  officials said that they conduct assessments using Single Audit Act  findings, among other things. The officials told us that there is no formal  process for reviewing applicants that have worked with the agency  before. An NRCS official told us that the agency required annual program  management training of its program managers, but did not provide us with  documentation of this training. NRCS officials also told us that the agency  did not have specific requirements for conducting site visits to projects  funded through cooperative agreements, which they said NRCS generally  used for capacity building and not for site-specific projects.
