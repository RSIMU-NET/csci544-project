Foundation officials stated that they had not yet performed these actions as they have focused their efforts during fiscal year 2015 on developing formal written internal control policies and procedures in areas that were previously identified by Foundation management as significant risks. However, the Foundation's Corrective Action Plan does not include steps to document hiring and separation policies and does not have a completion date for finalizing its contracting policies. Until this is addressed, there is an increased risk that procedures in these areas may not be consistently carried out, which in turn increases the risk that (1) employees could be hired or separated improperly and applicable laws and implementing regulations may not be consistently followed and (2) the Foundation may pay for erroneous amounts billed.", "The Foundation also effectively designed and implemented internal controls over its receipts and disbursements activity.

Similar to hiring, we found that although the  separation policies and procedures were not fully documented, the  Foundation had sufficiently implemented key internal control  activities related to the separation of employees. We interviewed  Foundation officials and conducted walkthroughs of specific  employee separation transactions and determined that the  Foundation performed certain key internal control activities related  to the separation of employees during the test period of our audit.  Such key internal control activities included management\u2019s review  and approval of the separated employee\u2019s OPM request for  personnel action, management\u2019s review of monthly detailed  spreadsheets attesting to the removal of the employee, and  management\u2019s review of monthly reports attesting to the removal  of the employee\u2019s salary.

The total amount paid on the environmental  conflict resolution contracts was approximately $2.0 million for the 9- month period July 1, 2014, through March 31, 2015. In December 2014,  the Foundation modified its agreement with IBC to include administrative  contracts, which effectively removed the Foundation completely from the  awarding and administration of contracts.

The draft guidance  details certain key internal control activities that the Foundation has  implemented in this area. However, we noted that not all key internal  control activities were included in the Foundation\u2019s draft guidance. For  example, the key control activity to document evidence of management\u2019s  receipt and review of contractors\u2019 invoices, including a comparison of the  scope and nature of services provided and labor hours billed, was not  included in the draft guidance. Federal standards for internal control  require that internal control and all transactions and other significant  events be clearly documented and that the documentation be readily  available for examination. Foundation officials stated that they had not yet  fully documented and finalized internal control policies and procedures  related to contracting because, as noted previously, they focused their  efforts on implementing control activities in areas in which the Foundation  had not yet developed formal written policies and procedures. As  documented in its Corrective Action Plan, Foundation management  planned to update and finalize its formal written internal control policies  and procedures over its contracting practices. However, the Corrective  Action Plan did not establish a date by which the Foundation planned to  complete the action to fully update and finalize its formal written internal  control policies and procedures over its contracting practices. A lack of  fully developed and finalized written internal control policies and  procedures related to the Foundation\u2019s contracting practices increases  the risk that procedures related to its contracting practices may not be  consistently carried out, which in turn increases the risk that the  Foundation may, for example, pay for erroneous amounts billed.", "Based on our review of the Foundation\u2019s draft guidance on its contracting  practices, interviews of Foundation officials, and walkthroughs of specific  contracting transactions during the test period of our audit, we identified  the Foundation\u2019s key internal control activities.
