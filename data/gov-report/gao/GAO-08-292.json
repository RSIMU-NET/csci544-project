In an effort to increase the quality and security of federal ID and credentialing practices, the President issued Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD-12) in August 2004, requiring the establishment of a governmentwide standard for secure and reliable forms of ID. The resulting standard is referred to as the personal identity verification (PIV) card. GAO was asked to determine the progress selected agencies have made in (1) implementing the capabilities of the PIV cards to enhance security and (2) achieving interoperability with other agencies. To address these objectives, GAO selected eight agencies that have a range of experience in implementing smart card-based ID systems and analyzed what actions the agencies have taken to implement PIV cards."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Much work has been accomplished to lay the foundations for implementation of HSPD-12, a major governmentwide undertaking. However, agencies have made limited progress in implementing and using PIV cards. The eight agencies GAO reviewed--including the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, the Interior, and Labor; the Nuclear Regulatory Commission; and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration--have generally completed background checks on most of their employees and contractors and established basic infrastructure, such as purchasing card readers. However, none of them met the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) goal of issuing PIV cards by October 27, 2007, to all employees and contractor personnel who had been with the agency for 15 years or less. In addition, for the limited number of cards that have been issued, most agencies have not been using the electronic authentication capabilities on the cards and have not developed implementation plans for those capabilities. In certain cases, products are not available to support those authentication mechanisms. A key contributing factor for why agencies have made limited progress is that OMB, which is tasked with ensuring that federal agencies successfully implement HSPD-12, has emphasized issuance of cards, rather than full use of the cards' capabilities. Specifically, OMB has set milestones that focus narrowly on having agencies acquire and issue cards in the near term, regardless of when the electronic authentication capabilities of the cards may be used. Furthermore, agencies anticipate having to make substantial financial investments to implement HSPD-12, since PIV cards are considerably more expensive than traditional ID cards. However, OMB has not considered HSPD-12 implementation to be a major new investment and thus has not required agencies to prepare detailed plans regarding how, when, and the extent to which they will implement the electronic authentication mechanisms available through the cards. Without implementing the cards' electronic authentication capabilities, agencies will continue to purchase costly PIV cards to be used in the same way as the much cheaper, traditional ID cards they are replacing. Until OMB revises its approach to focus on the full use of the capabilities of the new PIV cards, HSPD-12's objectives of increasing the quality and security of ID and credentialing practices across the federal government may not be fully achieved. While steps have been taken to enable future interoperability, progress has been limited in making current systems interoperate, partly because key procedures and specifications have not yet been developed to enable electronic cross-agency authentication of cardholders. According to General Services Administration officials, they have taken the initial steps to develop guidance to help enable the exchange of identity information across agencies, and they plan to complete and issue it by September 2008. Such guidance should help enable agencies to establish cross-agency interoperability--a primary goal of HSPD-12."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["As you know, wide variations exist in the quality and security of the  As you know, wide variations exist in the quality and security of the  various forms of identification (ID) that federal agencies issue to their  various forms of identification (ID) that federal agencies issue to their  employees to use to access federal facilities and information systems.

Physical access control focuses on restricting the entry and/or exit of  users from a physical area, such as a building or a room in a building.  Physical access control techniques include devices such as locks that  require a key to open doors or ID cards that establish an individual\u2019s  authorization to enter a building.

Generally, techniques that provide higher levels of  assurance are more expensive, more difficult to implement, and cause  greater inconvenience to users than less sophisticated techniques.

Smart cards are plastic devices that are  about the size of a credit card and contain an embedded integrated circuit  chip capable of storing and processing data. The unique advantage that  smart cards have over traditional cards with simpler technologies, such as  magnetic strips or bar codes, is that they can exchange data with other  systems and process information, rather than simply serving as static data  repositories. By securely exchanging information, a smart card can help  authenticate the identity of the individual possessing the card in a far more  rigorous way than is possible with traditional ID cards. A smart card\u2019s  processing power also allows it to exchange and update many other kinds  of information with a variety of external systems, which can facilitate  applications such as financial transactions or other services that involve  electronic record-keeping. Figure 1 shows an example of a typical smart  card.", "Smart cards can also be used to significantly enhance the security of an  agency\u2019s computer systems by tightening controls over user access. A user  wishing to log on to a computer system or network with controlled access  must \u201cprove\u201d his or her identity to the system\u2014a process called  authentication. Many systems authenticate users by requiring them to  enter secret passwords. This requirement provides only modest security  because passwords can be easily compromised. Substantially better user  authentication can be achieved by supplementing passwords with smart  cards. To gain access under this scenario, a user is prompted to insert a  smart card into a reader attached to the computer as well as type in a  password. This authentication process is significantly harder to  circumvent because an intruder would not only need to guess a user\u2019s  password but would also need to possess that same user\u2019s smart card.", "Even stronger authentication can be achieved by using smart cards in  conjunction with biometrics. Smart cards can be configured to store  biometric information (such as fingerprints or iris scans) in an electronic  record that can be retrieved and compared with an individual\u2019s live  biometric scan as a means of verifying that person\u2019s identity in a way that  is difficult to circumvent. An information system requiring users to present  a smart card, enter a password, and verify a biometric scan uses what is  known as \u201cthree-factor authentication,\u201d which requires users to  authenticate themselves by means of \u201csomething they possess\u201d (the smart  card), \u201csomething they know\u201d (the password), and \u201csomething they are\u201d  (the biometric). Systems employing three-factor authentication provide a  relatively high level of security. The combination of a smart card used with  biometrics can provide equally strong authentication for controlling  access to physical facilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Public Key Infrastructure Technology Can Further Enhance Access Control Based on Smart Cards", "paragraphs": ["Smart cards can also be used in conjunction with public key infrastructure  (PKI) technology to better secure electronic messages and transactions.  PKI is a system of computers, software, and data that relies on certain  cryptographic techniques to protect sensitive communications and  transactions. A properly implemented and maintained PKI can offer  several important security services, including assurances that (1) the  parties to an electronic transaction are really who they claim to be, (2) the  information has not been altered or shared with any unauthorized entity,  and (3) neither party will be able to wrongfully deny taking part in the  transaction. PKI systems are based on cryptography and require each user  to have two different digital \u201ckeys\u201d to gain access: a public key and a  private key. Both public and private keys may be generated on a smart  card or on a user\u2019s computer. Security experts generally agree that PKI  technology is most effective when used in tandem with hardware tokens,  such as smart cards. PKI systems use cryptographic techniques to  generate and manage electronic \u201ccertificates\u201d that link an individual or  entity to a given public key. These digital certificates are then used to  verify digital signatures and facilitate data encryption. The digital  certificates are created by a trusted third party called a certification  authority, which is also responsible for providing status information on  whether the certificate is still valid or has been revoked or suspended. The  PKI software in the user\u2019s computer can verify that a certificate is valid by  first verifying that the certificate has not expired, and then by checking the  online status information to ensure that it has not been revoked or  suspended.", "Implementing a functioning PKI across government agencies involves  much more than just establishing the basic hardware and software  infrastructure at individual agencies. For example, for PKI certificates to  work across the government, a vast network of interoperable online  directories would need to be in place so that each user\u2019s identity could be  looked up and his or her digital certificate verified before any transaction  takes place. Software applications would likely need to consult a number  of disparate directories to validate an incoming user\u2019s digital certificate.  Significant costs are involved in developing, fielding, and maintaining a  production PKI to meet these requirements. Systems must be set up to  positively identify users and manage the exchange and verification of  certificates. In addition, existing software applications, electronic  directories, and other legacy systems must be modified so that they can  interact with the PKI.

In most cases, agencies had not begun issuing  cards to more than a small number of their employees and contractor  personnel. In addition, for the limited number of cards that had been  issued, agencies had generally not been using the electronic authentication  capabilities on the cards. Instead, for physical access, agencies were using  visual inspection of the cards as their primary means to authenticate  cardholders. While it may be sufficient in certain circumstances\u2014such as  in very small offices with few employees\u2014in most cases, visual inspection  will not provide an adequate level of assurance.

The CHUID is a special type of serial number that incorporates an  electronic signature and is used to electronically validate that the  information contained in the CHUID, such as the card expiration date, has  not been altered. However, existing physical access control systems are  unable to receive and process a full CHUID, which is up to 27,016 bits  long. Most legacy control panels for physical access control systems were  built to process only a 26-bit identification number, and even the newest  control panels are only able to process 256 bits, at best. Consequently,  agencies that have implemented CHUID-based authentication have had to  implement systems that truncate the CHUID so that only a subset of  information\u2014without the electronic signature\u2014is transmitted to the  control panel for authentication. Use of the truncated CHUID does not  provide the same level of assurance as processing the full CHUID, because  the electronic signature information is not included. According to industry  representatives, it could take at least 5 to 7 years before a physical access  control system could be commercially available that is capable of reading  the full CHUID. Depending on the risk level of a system or facility, using  the truncated CHUID authentication approach could have important  security implications.", "Another product not yet on the market is a PIV card reader that can access  and validate the PKI certificate on a PIV card.

In contrast, traditional ID cards with  limited or no electronic authentication capabilities can cost less than $1  each, and have no annual maintenance costs. Therefore, agencies that do  not implement electronic authentication techniques are spending a  considerable amount per card for capabilities that they are not able to use.  An agency such as Interior, for example, which plans to issue cards to  approximately 90,000 individuals, could potentially spend approximately  $20 million on PIV cards without realizing the benefits of those cards until  it implements their electronic authentication capabilities. A more  economical approach would be to establish detailed plans for  implementing the technical infrastructure necessary to use the electronic  authentication capabilities on the cards and time the acquisition of PIV  cards to coincide with the implementation of this infrastructure.

We updated the report to include the additional work under way to  enable interoperability.  2.  We updated the report to discuss the capability of using PKI to validate  credentials from other agencies. However, as we discuss in the report,  procedures and specifications to enable cross-agency interoperability  using the cardholder unique identifier (CHUID) have not been  established. The CHUID is expected to be much more commonly used  than PKI. While PIV cards and FIPS 201-compliant readers may  technically be able to read the information encoded on any PIV card\u2014 including cards from multiple agencies\u2014this functionality is not  adequate to allow one agency to accept another agency\u2019s PIV card,  based on reading the card\u2019s CHUID. This is because there is no  common interagency framework in place for agencies to electronically  exchange critical information about the card\u2019s validity, based on  reading the CHUID.  3.  We agree that PIV card readers currently exist that read the full  CHUID. However, existing physical access control panels\u2014which  must receive and process information from the card readers\u2014are  unable to process a full CHUID. While the full CHUID is up to 27,016  bits long, most existing control panels for physical access control  systems were built to process only a 26-bit identification number, and  even the newest control panels are only able to process 256 bits at  best.  4.  We clarified the report to reflect that OMB does not consider the  implementation of HSPD-12 to be a major new investment.  5.  We added references to additional OMB guidance in our report.  6.  Regarding OMB\u2019s comment on the implementation dates, the report  notes both OMB\u2019s original deadlines and the fact that on October 23,  2007, OMB modified its guidance to indicate that agencies not meeting  OMB\u2019s milestones would be directed instead to meet alternate  milestones that had been mutually agreed upon by the agency and  OMB."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the individual named above, John de Ferrari (Assistant  Director), Neil Doherty, Nancy Glover, Emily Longcore, James MacAulay,  Shannin O\u2019Neill, James Rosen, and Glenn Spiegel made key contributions  to this report."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Glossary", "paragraphs": ["Process of determining the permissible activities of users and authorizing  or prohibiting activities by each user."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Application Programming Interface", "paragraphs": ["The interface between the application software and the application  platform (i.e., operating system), across which all services are provided."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Authentication", "paragraphs": ["Process of confirming an asserted identity with a specified or understood  level of confidence."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Authorization", "paragraphs": ["Granting the appropriate access privileges to authenticated users."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Biometric Template", "paragraphs": ["A digital record of an individual\u2019s biometric features.
