For example, at the end of June 2003, with 75 percent of the fiscal year completed, the services' percentage of GWOT operation and maintenance funds that had been obligated ranged from a low of 65 percent for the Army to a high of 78 percent for the Marine Corps. In contrast, the percentage of military personnel funds obligated by the three-fourths of-the-fiscal-year mark by the services ranged from 72 to 75 percent of GWOT appropriations. The military services believe they will obligate all the fiscal year 2003 funds appropriated to them. In addition, the services have received billions of dollars more in transfers from the Iraqi Freedom Fund. But GAO's analysis suggests that they may not need all the funds transferred as well as further transfers in fiscal year 2003 for operation and maintenance, since considerable unobligated fiscal year 2003 funds remain in their direct appropriations. Since DOD terminated Operations Desert Spring and Northern and Southern Watch in Southwest Asia in March 2003, the funds ($1.4 billion) that were included in the President's fiscal year 2004 budget to support those operations next year may no longer be necessary."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the United  States began military operations to combat terrorism both in the United  States and overseas.

In March 2003, the United States  began Operation Iraqi Freedom to change the government in Iraq.  Together, these three operations are known as the Global War on  Terrorism (GWOT). To support GWOT in fiscal year 2003, Congress  appropriated $68.7 billion to the Department of Defense (DOD) in the  Consolidated Appropriations Resolution, 2003, and Emergency Wartime  Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2003.

According to  the conference report that accompanied the legislation, Congress included  $6.1 billion for Operations Noble Eagle and Enduring Freedom in the  Consolidated Appropriations Resolution of February 2003. In March 2003,  the President requested that Congress appropriate $74.8 billion for GWOT,  including the conduct of military operations in Iraq and reconstruction and  relief there. Of this amount, $62.6 billion was identified in the President\u2019s  budget for DOD\u2019s GWOT military operations. In developing the President\u2019s  request, DOD assumed, among other things, that the war with Iraq would  be a short conflict, would involve a two-front war using Turkey as a  staging area, and there would be a rapid redeployment and demobilization  of Reserve and National Guard troops following the cessation of combat  operations. In April 2003, Congress appropriated $79.2 billion, including  $62.6 billion for DOD to cover all GWOT, including the war with Iraq, in  the Emergency Wartime Supplemental Appropriations Act of April 2003.  Although the services received their Consolidated Appropriations  Resolution, 2003, funds for fiscal year 2003 in February 2003, they did not  receive their first allocation of funds from the Emergency Supplemental  until May 2003 and their second allocation until July 2003. Before  receiving these monies, the services used funds from the Consolidated  Appropriations and their base programs, obligating $25.9 billion for  GWOT. DOD\u2019s statement of its requirements for the supplemental  appropriation included reimbursing the services\u2019 accounts for costs  incurred and financing the costs associated with military operations  against Iraq.", "Neither the President\u2019s request for funds nor the appropriations act  allocated the funds to specific operations. Of the funds appropriated  to DOD by the Emergency Wartime Supplemental, $46.699 billion was  appropriated directly to the services\u2019 and other defense agencies\u2019  appropriations accounts and $15.679 billion to a transfer fund called the  Iraqi Freedom Fund. Tables 1 and 2 show the operation and maintenance  and the military personnel appropriations provided to the services  for GWOT.", "To assess the extent to which funds appropriated for GWOT have been  obligated, we compared the latest available obligation reports for  GWOT with the funds appropriated to each of the services\u2019 operation and  maintenance and military personnel accounts. We then compared the  proportion of the funds obligated to the proportion of the fiscal year that  had elapsed to ascertain if funds were obligated at a level commensurate  with that point in the fiscal year. We recognize that funds are not obligated  equally each month throughout the fiscal year but believe that the further  into the fiscal year the closer to 100 percent obligations should be relative  to appropriations if all appropriated funds are likely to be obligated. The  results of this analysis are discussed in the following sections of this  report. We discussed our analysis with DOD representatives at the Office  of the Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) and each of the services\u2019 budget  offices, who disagreed with our methodology. These representatives  believed that the analysis should take into account the fact that the  supplemental appropriation was not available until mid-April 2003 and that  funds were not provided to the services until the beginning of May 2003.", "We recognize that the supplemental funding was not provided to the  services until May 2003. At the same time, DOD had to conduct Operations  Noble Eagle and Enduring Freedom from the first day of fiscal year 2003  and subsequently prepare for war in Iraq, deploy over 100,000 military  personnel to the Persian Gulf, and conduct major combat operations, all  before receiving supplemental funding. As discussed earlier, to fund these  operations in advance of receiving supplemental funding, the services  used funds from the Consolidated Appropriations and their base  programs. In doing so, DOD reported that it had obligated $25.9 billion for  GWOT in fiscal year 2003 through April 2003. Therefore, we believe that  assessing how much of the services\u2019 direct GWOT appropriations have  been obligated relatively late in the fiscal year provides a reasonable  measure of how quickly the services are obligating their GWOT  appropriations and the likelihood that they will obligate all the funds  appropriated to them. Our analysis suggests that the services have no need  for further transfers from the Iraqi Freedom Fund in fiscal year 2003, that  all the funds transferred to their operation and maintenance accounts may  not be obligated, and that any transferred funds unobligated at the end of  the fiscal year should be transferred back to the Iraqi Freedom Fund."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Proportion of Operation and Maintenance Funds Obligated Is Lower Than Proportion of Fiscal Year Elapsed Except for the Marines Corps", "paragraphs": ["Our analysis of the percentage of fiscal year 2003 GWOT operation  and maintenance funds obligated by the services compared with the  proportion of the fiscal year elapsed (i.e., October 1, 2002, through  June 2003, the latest month for which obligation data are available for all  the services) shows that the proportion of available appropriations that  have been obligated as of a particular date is lower than the proportion of  the fiscal year elapsed as of that same date for three of the four military  services, notwithstanding that funds obligated to date include those  required to cover the preparation of military forces for the war with Iraq  and the expense of transporting them and their equipment from the United  States and elsewhere to the Persian Gulf. Therefore, we believe the actual  operation and maintenance obligations made in fiscal year 2003 could be  less than the funds available for obligation in fiscal year 2003. By the end  of June 2003, only one of the services, the Marine Corps, had obligated  more than 75 percent of the funds appropriated for operation and  maintenance, while the other three services had obligated between 65 and  68 percent, although three-fourths of the fiscal year had already elapsed,  raising doubts about whether all the services will be able to obligate their  entire fiscal year 2003 GWOT operation and maintenance funds in the  remaining 3 months of fiscal year 2003. For example, the Army, by the end  of June 2003, had obligated 65 percent of its directly appropriated funds  for GWOT. Figure 2 displays the obligations through June 2003 for each of  the military services.", "As can be seen in figure 2, the percentage of directly appropriated  operation and maintenance funds that were obligated as of June 30, 2003,  ranged from a low of 65 percent for the Army to a high of 78 percent for  the Marine Corps.", "Based on our analysis, we believe that in fiscal year 2003 the services, with  the possible exception of the Marine Corps, may not obligate all operation  and maintenance funds appropriated to them for GWOT. The services,  however, believe that they will obligate all or almost all of these funds.  This may in fact be the case, but except for the Marine Corps, if the  services do obligate all these funds it will require a faster rate of obligation  of funds\u2014greater than the rate at which they have been obligating funds in  recent months. We recognize that estimating the costs of ongoing military  operations is difficult because operational requirements can differ  substantially from what was assumed in developing budget estimates.  This has been the case in Iraq, where actual operations have differed from  some of the assumptions. For example, a second front using Turkey as a  staging area never materialized, there has not been a rapid redeployment  and demobilization of Reserve and National Guard troops, one major Army  division expected to deploy did not, and transportation costs were lower  than predicted. Some of these differences, such as the lack of a rapid  redeployment and demobilization, are resulting in higher than expected  costs, while other differences, for example, the decision to not deploy one  of the Army\u2019s divisions, are resulting in lower than expected costs.  However, in light of the rate of obligations made through June and the  information presented below, we continue to believe that actual  obligations of GWOT operation and maintenance funds for fiscal year 2003  may be less than the total GWOT operation and maintenance  appropriations available for obligation in fiscal year 2003.", "According to the Army\u2019s obligation plan, the Army expects to obligate  $6 billion during the last 3 months of fiscal year 2003. Through June 2003,  the Army had obligated $11.315 billion. Combining the funds obligated  through June and the Army\u2019s estimate for the balance of fiscal year 2003  indicates that the Army will obligate a total of $17.315 billion\u2014$98 million  less than the $17.413 billion it received in direct operation and  maintenance appropriations for GWOT. It should be noted, however, that  the Army\u2019s actual June obligations of $2.38 billion are higher than the  $2.2 billion it planned to obligate in June. Whether the Army will obligate  all its fiscal year 2003 GWOT operation and maintenance funds depends on  whether its obligations for the last 3 months of the fiscal year continue at  or near the June 2003 rate or fall to the levels expected in its obligation  plan. In discussing the results of our analysis with the Army, Army officials  told us that preliminary reports indicate that their July obligations will be  about $3 billion. However, their preliminary June obligation estimate was  higher than their actual June obligations, which underscores the difficulty  in projecting costs and the need to closely monitor the obligation of  GWOT funds.", "The Marine Corps expects to obligate approximately $591 million for force  reconstitution (the repair of damaged equipment and the replacement of  munitions, spare parts or equipment lost in war) during the last 3 months  of the fiscal year. However, in discussing our analysis with the Marine  Corps, Marine Corps officials involved with budgeting for ongoing military  operations told us that constraints in depot and contractor capacity could  lead the Marine Corps to obligate fewer funds in fiscal year 2003 than  planned for depot maintenance, which accounts for $50 million to  $70 million of its $591 million reconstitution estimate.", "Through June 2003, which is the first 9 months of fiscal year 2003, the  Air Force had obligated $6.0 billion, or 68 percent, of its direct GWOT  operation and maintenance appropriation. Most of the Air Force\u2019s aircraft  have redeployed from Operation Iraqi Freedom, and the Air Force\u2019s role in  that operation has been reduced. According to Air Force officials, in  March 2003, the Air Force had 1,000 aircraft deployed in support of the  war in Iraq and by late June the number had been reduced to 276. The  Air Force\u2019s June 2003 obligation of its GWOT operation and maintenance  appropriation was $76 million less than its May 2003 obligation of  that appropriation.", "The Navy had obligated $3.7 billion, or 67 percent, of its direct GWOT  appropriation through June 2003. According to Navy officials, all Navy  ships that deployed to support Operation Iraqi Freedom have been  redeployed, and Navy activity is back to pre-Operation Iraqi Freedom  levels. Furthermore, Navy officials with the Pacific Fleet (the Navy\u2019s major  force provider for Operation Iraqi Freedom) told us that their GWOT  obligations were lower than they had estimated, due in part to lower fuel  and airlift costs. In discussing our analysis with Navy headquarters  officials, they said that while a shorter duration of combat operations  resulted in certain costs not accruing or accruing at the estimated levels,  other operational factors and costs occurred that were substituted and  more than offset estimated fuel and airlift savings.

Service officials told us that they believe they  will use their entire GWOT military personnel appropriation because the  planned demobilization of reserve component personnel has not occurred.
