Such a service might mitigate the concerns taxpayers have about current electronic filing options, which require filing through a third party and may involve fees. Increased electronic filing would reduce IRS's paper processing costs, reduce transcription errors, and speed up refunds. However, the idea is controversial. IRS already has a Free File program which offers free return preparation and filing by private companies for some people via IRS's Web site. Some are opposed to IRS competing with tax preparation software companies. GAO was asked to (1) describe IRS's options for on-line preparation and filing (I-file) based on states' experiences; (2) determine the benefits and costs of I-file based on the experiences of the states; and (3) describe the potential for IRS to realize cost savings from I-file. GAO profiled 7 states and the District of Columbia, 2 foreign countries and 3 federal agencies to describe I-file options and determine their benefits and costs."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The options available to IRS for implementing I-file system vary in technology, features, and eligibility. The states profiled all employed an interactive format on their Web sites for tax return preparation. The systems varied in whether they included features such as the ability to save and return. Systems also varied in eligibility, i.e. limiting income or residency. For the systems profiled, both reported benefits and costs were relatively modest and it is unclear whether benefits were greater than costs. I-file systems may generate benefits by increasing electronic filing and reducing filing fees for taxpayers. California and Pennsylvania estimated savings of $1.00 per return and $3.47 respectively per return converted from paper. However, the benefits were limited by low usage. I-file usage rates were less than 6 percent. Available data on I-file costs, while limited, shows costs are a very small percentage of state tax agencies' budgets. For example, California reported spending $700,000 to develop and operate CalFile from 2003 to 2005--less than 0.1 percent of the tax agency's annual budget. States kept I-file costs relatively modest by restricting eligibility and features. Several states used contractors to develop and operate their I-file system as well as provide the computer hardware. Low usage also contributed to modest costs. For example, some states said low usage meant they could use existing computer equipment. IRS's potential to realize net cost savings from an I-file system depends on the costs of developing the system and the number of taxpayers converted from paper to electronic filing. IRS's costs could be higher than the states'. First, the federal tax system is more complex. Second, unlike states which already had Web sites with Internet transaction capabilities, IRS would have to significantly upgrade its Web site and incur new security costs. Finally, developing an I-file system would further stretch IRS's capability to manage systems development, a GAO high risk area since 1995. Converting paper filers to electronic filing generates savings of $2.36 per return, according to IRS estimates. However, the number of paper filers who would convert is uncertain. The 13 million individual taxpayers who prepared their returns on a computer but then printed and mailed them to IRS are one target for conversion to I-file."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In 2006, about 72 million of the 130 million individual federal tax returns  were filed electronically. The other 58 million were filed on paper. Paper  returns cost more for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to process and  have disadvantages for taxpayers as well. IRS must transcribe paper  returns to its computerized databases, a process that is labor intensive,  slows down refunds, and inevitably introduces errors. By 2006, the growth  of electronic filing had allowed IRS to close two paper processing centers  and eliminate 1,600 staff years, resulting in a savings of tens of millions of  dollars.", "Of the 58 million paper returns, 42 million (about 72 percent) were  prepared electronically on computers but then printed and mailed to IRS  rather than being filed electronically. Taxpayers cite security concerns and  electronic filing fees as some of the reasons for not filing electronically.  IRS does not have the capability to receive electronic returns directly from  taxpayers. Taxpayers filing electronically must do so through third-party  transmitters, such as paid preparers and tax preparation software  companies, who route the tax returns to the IRS and may charge for the  service.", "Some states and other countries allow taxpayers to prepare and file  returns directly on tax agency Internet Web sites (what we will call I-file),  an option not available to federal taxpayers. In 2006, 20 states and the  District of Columbia offered this service to taxpayers; three states had  discontinued an I-file service; 9 had no state income tax; and 18 states do  not offer an I-file service. A return preparation and filing option on IRS\u2019s  Web site could reduce cost for taxpayers and mitigate any concerns about  the security of third-party transmitters. However, the idea is controversial.  Some see it as unnecessary because of IRS\u2019s Free File program, which  allows taxpayers below an income ceiling to access free tax preparation  software provided by private sector companies and then file their returns  electronically at no charge. Others are concerned about the impact IRS  direct Internet filing would have on the tax preparation software industry.", "Because of your interest in information on whether IRS should provide tax  preparation software and electronic filing on its Web site, you asked us to  describe various I-file options and what is known about their use. Our  objectives were to: (1) describe the options available to IRS for developing  an I-file service based on states\u2019 experiences, (2) determine the benefits  and costs associated with a range of I-file options based on the  experiences of selected states, countries, and federal agencies, and  (3) describe the potential for IRS to realize cost savings from providing an  I-file service.", "Our review is based on data analysis, interviews, and examinations of  agencies\u2019 Internet Web sites. We developed in-depth profiles of seven  states and the District of Columbia tax agencies to illustrate the range of  Internet filing systems, types of features, and level of usage. We used the  following criteria to select these agencies: (1) number of I-file users,   (2) year I-file system was implemented, (3) whether the I-file system was  developed by a contractor or in-house, and (4) types of features offered.  We collected information in less depth for two foreign tax agencies and  three federal agencies with I-file systems.", "To collect this information we developed a data collection instrument and  conducted structured interviews with agency officials about usage rates,  system features, eligibility requirements, benefits to agencies and  taxpayers, and system costs. We also interviewed officials from two of the  three states that discontinued an I-file service. We saw consistency in the  types of benefits state tax agencies reported. Based on previous GAO work  and discussions with state agency and IRS officials, we understand that  electronic filing reduces the number of processing staff needed, for  example, and generates dollar savings. We determined that state estimates  of savings per return are sufficiently reliable as a general indicator, but not  necessarily as a precise indicator, of savings.", "We summarized tax agency costs on a total cost basis and per return basis.  No state could give us complete cost information; however, the data  gathered covered large elements of total costs such as development and  operating costs. When available we reviewed state documents such as  feasibility studies, post-implementation evaluations, and contracts with  companies that developed or operated some of the systems. Based on the  consistency of the reporting from the eight states, we determined that the  data were reliable for estimating the rough magnitude of total costs. We  compared the types of system development and operations costs states  incurred with the types of costs IRS would likely face in developing and  operating an I-file system.

At the submission processing centers,  paper returns are opened and sorted, checked for completeness,  numbered with an identifying code, manually transcribed into IRS\u2019s  computerized databases, and checked for accuracy. Transcribing paper  returns inevitably introduces errors that then must be resolved by IRS and  taxpayers. IRS devoted 2,798 staff years to paper processing in 2006. About  58 million taxpayers submitted their returns on paper in 2006.", "For a number of years, some taxpayers or preparers have used tax  preparation software to prepare returns electronically. However, after  returns have been electronically prepared taxpayers cannot transmit them  directly to IRS in order to electronically file them. Instead, only paid tax  preparers and tax preparation software companies that IRS has designated  as electronic return originators (ERO) can transmit tax returns  electronically to IRS. These companies may charge taxpayers for the  services they provide, including electronic filing. Taxpayers who prepare  their returns on their home computer and then use the electronic filing  option are actually sending their returns electronically to an ERO. The  EROs typically bundle returns from many taxpayers and then  electronically forwards them to IRS. IRS conducts suitability checks of  applicants who are applying to become EROs. These checks may include  checking the applicants\u2019 criminal background, credit history, and tax  compliance. In 2006, approximately 72 million returns were submitted  electronically. As shown in figure 1, electronic filing eliminates a number  of steps necessary for processing paper returns.", "In 2002, IRS entered into an agreement with the Free File Alliance, a  consortium of tax preparation companies, to provide on-line electronic  preparation and filing to eligible taxpayers at no charge. Taxpayers can  access Free File on IRS\u2019s Web site, which provides links to the Web sites  of the Free File Alliance companies. Taxpayers prepare their returns  using free software on the companies\u2019 Web sites and then electronically  file their returns from the Web sites. In 2005, eligibility was restricted to  taxpayers with incomes of $50,000 or less. The number of tax returns filed  through Free File for filing season 2006 was about 4 million. As part of the  Free File agreement, IRS agreed not to compete with the Alliance  members by providing free, on-line tax return preparation and filing  services to taxpayers on its Web site.", "Some taxpayers electronically prepare their returns but they choose to  print and mail the tax return to IRS. These taxpayers are known as \u201cv- coders\u201d because IRS codes these returns with a \u201cv\u201d for processing  purposes and to track separately from other paper filers. As shown in table  1, out of the 58.3 million paper returns submitted last year, approximately  42 million were v-coded returns. V-coders are an attractive target for  conversion to e-filing because these taxpayers already have access to  computers and electronically prepare their returns, both prerequisites for  electronic filing.", "Until 2005, federal taxpayers had the option to Telefile. Telefile allowed  taxpayers with simple returns to file electronically via telephone. This  service was discontinued in 2005 because of declining usage and relatively  high costs.", "Very generally, I-file is a Web site application that allows users to prepare  and submit information to an agency electronically. Since the late 1990s,  almost half of the states have offered an I-file service to taxpayers.  Currently, 20 states and the District of Columbia currently offer this  service to taxpayers. Three states have discontinued an I-file service for  taxpayers. In addition, several foreign tax agencies offer I-file services.  Also, some federal agencies offer nontax I-file services that, for example,  allow users to apply for benefits on-line. Individuals applying for federal  student aid, agricultural grants and loans, and veterans\u2019 benefits may  choose to use the agencies\u2019 Web sites to prepare and submit applications  rather than using paper to prepare forms and the mail to submit forms. For  example, since 1997, the Department of Education has offered individuals  an I-file service for preparing and submitting the Free Application for  Federal Student Aid.", "Figure 2 shows the growth of federal electronic filing since 1997.  According to IRS officials, it is getting harder to convert taxpayers to  electronic tax return filing since those who might convert most readily  have already done so.", "Electronic filing has also grown at the state level, as shown in figure 3.  Several states imposed electronic filing mandates on tax preparers who  meet certain criteria, such as filing 100 state tax returns or more, which  contributed to increased electronic filing. Moreover, state taxing  authorities are using technologies such as I-file and 2-D barcode to enable  more efficient processing of returns.", "Within IRS, the Wage and Investment Division (W&I) and Modernization  and Information Technology Services (MITS) have a role in electronic  filing.

However, the benefits were limited by the low usage. As shown in  table 3, I-file users as a percentage of total filers ranged from less than 1  percent to just over 5 percent. Only three states gave us estimates of the  number of taxpayers eligible to I-file. Pennsylvania had 20 percent of  eligible taxpayers I-filing in 2006 while California and South Carolina both  had less than 2 percent. While Pennsylvania had 20 percent of eligible  taxpayers using I-file, GAO is interpreting this as a low usage rate since the  state instituted the system in 2000.", "The benefits to state tax agencies included reducing the costs of  processing paper returns plus related costs due to correcting math and  transcription errors and contacting taxpayers about such errors. The  magnitude of the benefits to tax agencies depends on the savings per  return and the number of taxpayers converted from paper to electronic  filing. Returns prepared and filed through I-file that would have otherwise  been electronically filed do not generate significant benefits in the form of  reduced costs for the tax agencies. Only returns converted from paper to  electronic filing generate benefits in terms of cost savings for the tax  agency.", "Three of the tax agencies we profiled gave us estimates of how much  converting a return from paper to electronic filing saved them in  processing costs. California estimated that each taxpayer converted from  paper to e-filing saved the state about $1.00 in processing costs per return.  Pennsylvania officials reported it costs about $4.72 to process paper  returns, while electronically filed returns costs them only $1.25\u2014a cost  savings of $3.47 per return. One of the largest cost savings on a per return  basis was reported by Kansas where agency officials reported saving $11  per electronic return filed. These savings reflect operations in each state  and may not indicate savings that other states or IRS might achieve.", "State agency officials provided some information about savings beyond  reduced processing costs but could not provide dollar estimates of the  savings. Kansas officials said the state had less than a 1 percent math error  rate for I-filed returns compared to a 17 percent rate for paper returns.  California officials reported a decrease in math and transcription errors.  The state agency reported that fewer contacts with taxpayers can benefit  the agency and yield a savings from fewer notices. Maryland officials said  they have less need to contact taxpayers who I-file.", "The number of taxpayers converted from paper filing to electronic filing  due to state I-file systems is relatively modest. In an evaluation conducted  3 years after CalFile was implemented, California estimated that as many  as 67,000 I-filers were new e-filers in 2004. That number is less than 1  percent of eligible filers in California the same year. The other tax  agencies we profiled could not document how many returns were  converted from paper to electronic filing as a result of I-file, but the  number has to be relatively small because the total number of I-file users  is relatively small.", "Low usage may be due to a number of reasons, including little marketing  and the lack of integration with the federal tax system. Officials in five  states said the amount budgeted for marketing was minimal. Pennsylvania  reported allocating $20,000 to $40,000 for marketing during calendar years  2000 to 2002. The other tax agencies did not provide dollar amounts. Using  different methods to prepare and file state and federal returns can be an  inconvenience to taxpayers. Many tax preparation software packages offer  the convenience of integrating federal and state tax return preparation.  Much of the required data has to be entered only one time and is  automatically transferred from the federal to the state tax return. Users of  state I-file systems would have to prepare their federal tax return using  one preparation method and then learn a second, to prepare their state  return.", "Foreign tax agencies with I-file systems and federal agencies with on-line  application systems reported higher usage rates than the state agencies we  profiled, as shown in table 4. Reasons differed for the higher usage rates  among foreign tax agencies and federal agencies. French officials offered a  financial incentive of 20 euros (approximately $26) in 2005 to French  taxpayers who filed tax returns on-line and paid taxes electronically. An  official with France\u2019s General Tax Directorate said the rebate increased  usage to such a degree the system was overloaded and officials needed to  extend the filing deadline. One federal agency attributed high usage to the  type of user the agency serves. An official with the Department of  Education said usage of the on-line financial aid system was high, due in  part, to the target population of students who are Internet-savvy.", "In addition to the benefits to the tax agencies, state I-file systems also  generated benefits for users. Taxpayers who convert from paper to  electronic filing because of the availability of I-file received the benefits of  electronic filing, such as faster refunds. Compared to paper filing, Utah\u2019s  TaxExpress I-file system reduced return processing time to 4-5 days from  8-10 days and generated faster refunds. South Carolina\u2019s SCnetFile! users  received direct deposit of refunds within 9-10 days, paper checks were  processed within about 3 weeks, according to agency officials. Some  taxpayers who convert from paper may benefit by not having to respond  to notices for math errors, by having lower compliance burdens, and by  preferring electronic confirmation that the tax agency received their  return. A benefit to some taxpayers using I-file is saving on electronic  filing fees. Taxpayers who were charged electronic filing fees and convert  to I-file would save. Taxpayers, who electronically file for free, such as  users of the Free File program, would not save on fees. Another benefit to  some taxpayers using state I-file systems is the security of not having to  file through a third party such as an ERO. However, as was noted earlier  and shown in appendix I, some state I-file systems are operated by  contractors on the contractors\u2019 computer hardware.", "Table 5 compares some of the advantages and disadvantages of the  various methods of preparing and filing federal tax returns from a  taxpayer\u2019s perspective."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Available Information Indicates That I-file Costs Were Relatively Modest Because States Limited Features, Eligibility, and Capacity Needs", "paragraphs": ["The cost data we were able to gather from the state tax and federal  agencies we profiled, while incomplete, implies that costs were relatively  modest.

No state tax agency  had available data on costs such as management planning and  conceptualization or contractor oversight. However, some state tax  agencies did have estimates for large portions of their I-file costs, such as  systems development or operating costs, as shown in table 6.", "As already noted, state tax agencies varied in the extent to which they  used contractors or in-house staff to develop or operate I-file systems.  Three states profiled-Indiana, Kansas, and Utah-used a contractor and  relied almost wholly on the contractor to provide I-file services. The  software and servers (computer hardware) are owned and operated by the  contractors. Some taxpayer support for individuals, including technical  help desk assistance, is provided by the contractor as well. Other states  used a contractor to develop the system, but the state owned and operated  the server. Some states, such as California and Maryland, primarily used  in-house staff to develop and operate their systems. In these states,  taxpayers prepared returns on state-owned servers.", "Available data on total I-file costs show costs are a small percentage of  state tax agencies\u2019 budgets. For example, California spent just over  $700,000 to develop and operate CalFile from 2003 to 2005\u2014less than 0.1  percent of the tax agency\u2019s annual budget. Pennsylvania\u2019s pa.direct.file  annual operating cost of $125,000 is less than 0.1 percent of the Revenue  Department\u2019s 2006 budget of $176 million. For states that primarily used  contractors, data on specific types of costs are not available because many  types of costs are covered by the fee per return charged by contractors.  We did not verify cost information provided by state agencies or  contractors. While the state cost data are incomplete, the data are  consistent with what we learned about development and operating costs  at USDA and the Department of Veterans Affairs.", "The available data also show costs are relatively modest when calculated  per tax return. Three states that relied heavily on a contractor were  charged $0.75 per return or $1.00 per return to develop and operate I-file  systems, as shown in table 6. Based on the data provided, we calculated  Pennsylvania\u2019s I-file average costs per return as $0.94 for 2000 to 2006, and  California\u2019s average costs per return as $2.30 for 2003 to 2005. These costs  per return are relatively modest compared to what the states told us about  their costs for processing paper returns. For example, Pennsylvania  officials said it cost $4.72 per return to process a paper return.", "Several factors contributed to keeping I-file costs relatively modest. Six of  the eight state agencies we profiled limited eligibility. Three states  developed their system incrementally and increased eligibility over time.  As shown in table 2, some states restricted eligibility by income, residency  requirements, or number of itemized deductions. States also varied on the  extent to which they offered system features, such as the ability to save a  partially completed return and the extent to which certain information can  be automatically filled in on the form using previous years\u2019 returns. By  limiting eligibility and features, agencies can limit certain costs, such as  software development and testing, that do not change as the number of  users changes (fixed costs). Restricting the eligibility and features also has  some effect on costs that do depend on the number of system users  (variable costs), such as computer hardware and help desk assistance.  Variable costs for purchases of hardware and telecommunications to  support the system can also increase if system features become more  sophisticated and if the system allows users to file more complex returns.", "Another factor that contributed to modest costs was that contracts  between states and contractors covered the development and operation of  computer systems that provided multiple services, not just tax services.  For example, a contractor\u2019s representative told us the contractor may not  recoup all its costs for I-file with the fees charged per tax return. Instead,  the costs may be recouped from other services provided to the state.", "One other factor keeping costs modest was the limited number of  anticipated users. As discussed previously, the number of users in all eight  states we profiled was less than 6 percent of all taxpayers. Low usage also  affects variable costs for purchases of system hardware and  telecommunication services. Several states told us that they were able to  mitigate additional capacity costs by building upon existing systems  hardware. As reported in their feasibility report, California officials  planned to build the CalFile system using the existing technical  environment and noted that no additional software, hardware, or licenses  would need to be procured. It was expected that all project expenditures  would be for staff costs only. One contractor indicated that additional  capacity was available to support increased usage, if needed, from other  existing servers. Some states we profiled did not make significant changes  to their current levels of taxpayer support because of the low usage rates.  For instance, Maryland\u2019s taxpayer service group provided I-file training to  the current staff but did not have any need to hire additional staff."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Whether States Realize Benefits Greater Than Costs from Their I-file Systems Is Unclear", "paragraphs": ["In all states profiled, whether benefits are greater than costs is unclear for  two reasons. As previously noted (1) data on benefits and costs was  incomplete and (2) based on available data, both benefits and costs were  modest.", "Although incomplete, the available data combined with the decision by  three states to discontinue their systems raise the possibility that in at  least some states the benefits were less than costs. According to officials  in two of the three states that discontinued their I-file systems, the benefits  did not appear greater than costs and the system was not providing a good  return on their investment. One agency official reported experiencing low  usage and high costs. Officials with Iowa\u2019s Department of Revenue said  the state had hoped to see major growth in electronic filing usage by  introducing an I-file system, yet the system use peaked at 22,815 I-filed  returns in 2004. Iowa officials estimated the system was costing about  $7.00 per return. Like Iowa, Arkansas discontinued its I-file services.  According to a state official, Arkansas\u2019s I-file system operated for 5 years  beginning in tax year 2000 and processed a total of 5,149 returns. The  highest usage was in 2005, with only 1,382 returns processed.", "Another example of a state in which the benefits may be less than the  costs, based on reported information, is California. A study of the CalFile  system revealed California overestimated benefits, expecting 400,000 users  in 2004 but getting 110,000. Further, the study highlighted that California  underestimated costs with development costs expected to be $304,538 but  coming in at $511,797. California officials estimated the agency saves  approximately $1.00 per return in processing costs by converting paper  returns to electronic returns. In 2004, California estimated 67,000 filers  converted to electronic filing, which would have saved the agency $67,000.  In the same year, California reported spending $256,362 on CalFile for  development and operating costs. Consequently, based on reported  information, benefits appear less than costs. However, additional benefits  could have been realized from decreased math errors, for example, but the  amount of such benefits is not known. California officials told us that  CalFile may still be beneficial to the state because it provided another  method of filing.", "Pennsylvania estimates show the benefits of its I-file system could exceed  costs. Pennsylvania estimated $3.47 per return in cost savings for  processing and administrative costs associated with converting paper to  electronic filing. Between tax year 1999 and 2005, a total of 1,362,867  taxpayers used the I-file system. Pennsylvania did not provide an estimate  of the number of I-file users that converted from paper. However, if 28  percent of users converted from paper to e-filing, Pennsylvania would  break even. If more than 28 percent converted, Pennsylvania could realize  a net benefit."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Achieving a Net Cost Savings for IRS Depends on the Cost of Developing the System and the Number of Paper Filers Converted", "paragraphs": ["Providing federal taxpayers with an I-file system would be a new service  for which IRS would incur new costs.

To  develop the new service, IRS would have to (1) create or procure return  preparation software for IRS\u2019s Web site and (2) extend direct e-filing to  individuals, in which the return would be routed into the current stream of  electronically filed returns coming in from EROs.", "IRS\u2019s fixed costs for I-file could be higher than the fixed costs of the states  we profiled for several reasons. Currently, IRS\u2019s Web site is mostly  informational, meaning taxpayers can obtain information from IRS but  they cannot submit information to IRS\u2019s tax return databases. The  information that taxpayers can obtain includes instructions, downloadable  forms, and refund status. Developing an I-file system would require IRS to  develop a transactional Web site, where taxpayers could enter information  that would be submitted to IRS\u2019s tax return databases. Transactional Web  sites require more security and other features not necessary for an  informational Web site.", "Some of the states we profiled had transactional Web sites in place before  they developed their I-file systems.  Those states included Kansas,  California, Indiana, and Utah. To provide I-file, IRS would need to incur  the costs of developing a transactional capability.", "Other factors that could cause IRS\u2019s fixed costs to differ from the states\u2019  fixed costs include the relative complexity of the federal tax system, the  types of taxpayers who are eligible, and the features of the I-file system,  such as memory. The federal income tax system is more complex than  states\u2019 tax systems, which generally piggyback on the federal return. For  example, the federal Form1040 for tax year 2006 contains 77 lines and can  require up to 41 other forms, schedules, or worksheets to complete, while  Maryland\u2019s Form 502 contains 52 lines (starting with federal adjusted gross  income) and can require only 7 other forms, schedules, or worksheets to  complete. IRS could limit fixed costs by limiting taxpayer eligibility the  way some states did. Limiting eligibility to more simple forms, such as the  federal Form1040 EZ, would reduce the complexity of I-file software.  Similarly, the features offered on an I-file system would affect the  complexity of the software. Features such as save and return and auto- populating can require additional memory and potentially increase costs.", "IRS\u2019s variable costs for an I-file system could also be higher than the  states\u2019. As previously noted, many of the states we profiled had low  variable costs for computer hardware and taxpayer support because they  were able to make use of existing capacity, either inside the tax agency or  at other state agencies. Several states we profiled said that if their usage  rates were significantly higher than current rates, they would incur  additional costs to increase capacity. According to IRS officials, IRS does  not have excess capacity that could be used to provide I-file services to  taxpayers. As a consequence, IRS\u2019s variable costs per return for I-file  services could be higher than the states\u2019."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Net Cost Savings Depends on the Number of Paper Filers Converted", "paragraphs": ["The number of paper filers who convert to electronic filing can have a  significant impact on the overall cost savings IRS could achieve by  operating I-file. IRS data show, each paper return that is processed cost an  estimated $2.65 per return in 2003, while each electronic return cost an  estimated $0.29, resulting in an estimated cost savings of $2.36 per return  processed electronically. However, we cannot independently verify this  estimate and its basis is unclear because IRS\u2019s cost accounting system is  not yet able to support preparation of such cost estimates.Additionally,  other costs may be reduced by electronic filing including costs associated  with math errors. Math errors on paper returns may be due to taxpayer  error or IRS transcription errors. Both can result in notices being sent to  taxpayers and phone contacts with taxpayers. Both types of errors are  reduced by electronic filing.", "IRS could achieve a net cost savings if the costs saved by reduced paper  processing were greater than the costs incurred from developing and  operating an I-file system. The key to IRS achieving a net cost savings  depends on the number of individuals converted from paper to electronic  filing and the savings per return (estimated to be $2.36 per return by IRS).  I-file users who previously electronically filed do not generate such  savings. In 2006, 58.3 million tax returns (45 percent of all tax returns)  were filed on paper. Any savings from reduced paper processing would  have to be netted against the cost of the I-file system to determine whether  cost savings were realized.", "The extent to which federal paper filers would convert to an I-file system  is uncertain. According to respondents of an IRS Oversight Board survey,  some taxpayers reported not feeling comfortable filing taxes  electronically. These taxpayers reported not having confidence that the  Internet is secure or that their privacy is protected. These taxpayers also  cited other reasons including: the Internet was too complicated, or the  taxpayer liked to use paper method or they didn\u2019t want to pay the  electronic filing fee. An I-file system would address some of these taxpayer  concerns but not all of them. For example, if taxpayers\u2019 security and  privacy concerns are focused on third party transmitters, then an I-file  system might mitigate the concerns.If the concerns are more general and  apply to the Internet as a whole, then an I-file system (only accessible over  the Internet) may not mitigate the concerns. Additionally, IRS\u2019s Free File  service, which may be the existing service most similar to I-file had 4.0  million users (about 3 percent of total taxpayers and 4 percent of eligible  taxpayers) in 2006. This usage rate is an indication of the challenge of  converting some taxpayers to electronic filing.", "The 13.6 million v-coders who self-prepared are an attractive target for an  I-file program. Because v-coders prepare their return on a computer, they  are presumably more comfortable with computers and may be more  willing to try I-file than taxpayers who did not use a computer to prepare  their returns. Because they file on paper, converting them to I-file results  in reduced paper processing costs. V-coded returns prepared by paid  preparers may be less susceptible to convert to I-file because these paid  preparers have concerns about existing e-file options. Several of the states  we profiled emphasized the importance of defining the target population  when designing an I-file system. Whether such a narrowly defined  population, as v-coders who self prepare, could be successfully targeted at  the federal level is unclear.", "In addition to the net savings that could be realized from I-file, another  factor that should be considered is whether IRS has the systems  management capability needed to develop such a program. For well over a  decade, IRS has been involved in a multibillion dollar effort to modernize  its information systems. While IRS has made noteworthy progress  improving its systems management capability, it has had a history of cost  increases and schedule delays that led us to designate systems  modernization as a high-risk area in 1995. Those cost increases and  schedule delays were due, at least in part, to deficiencies in various  management controls and capabilities that have not yet been fully  corrected. In 2003, we noted that IRS had made significant progress in  establishing management controls and foundational systems architecture.However, systems modernization remained at risk because the scope and  complexity of modernization activities was increasing. In 2005, we  reported that balancing the scope and pace of modernization activities  with IRS\u2019s ability to manage them remained a challenge. IRS has made  further progress since 2005 addressing concerns about systems  management. However, critical management controls and capabilities  have still not yet been fully implemented or institutionalized. Before  proceeding with I-file, IRS would need to consider the impact of the  program on its existing portfolio of systems development projects and the  impact of the program on its current modernization vision and strategy.  This would entail IRS determining whether it has the management  capabilities to take on this new project and what, if any, ongoing and  planned programs would need to be deferred."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["In written comments on a draft of this report, the Commissioner of  Internal Revenue said he appreciated our observations on the states\u2019  experiences with I-file systems.
