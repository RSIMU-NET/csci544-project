Four of the five outcomes are the same ones we addressed in our June 2000 review of the agency\u2019s fiscal year 1999 performance report and fiscal year 2001 performance plan to provide a baseline by which to measure the agency\u2019s performance from year to year. These selected key outcomes are:   The federal government has an appropriately constituted workforce with the proper skills to carry out its missions.", "Federal employees are evaluated, rewarded, and otherwise held accountable for their performance.", "Federal agencies adhere to merit system principles.

Additionally, we agreed to analyze how OPM has addressed its major management challenges, including the governmentwide high-risk areas of strategic human capital management and information security that we and OPM\u2019s Inspector General have identified. Appendix I provides detailed information on how OPM has addressed these challenges. (App. II contains OPM\u2019s comments on a draft of our report).", "Attention to strategic human capital management is important because building agency employees\u2019 skills, knowledge, and individual performance must be a cornerstone of any serious effort to maximize the performance and ensure the accountability of the federal government. Because strategic human capital management is a pervasive challenge across the federal government, we recently identified it as a governmentwide high-risk area.Addressing the federal government\u2019s human capital challenges is a responsibility shared by many parties in addition to the individual agencies. For example, we noted that OPM and the Office of Management and Budget have substantial roles to play in fostering a more results- oriented approach to strategic human capital management across the government. OPM\u2019s sustained commitment and attention will be particularly critical to making a real difference in the way federal agencies manage human capital. It is likely that OPM will continue moving from \u201crules to tools,\u201d and that its most valuable contributions in the future will come less from traditional compliance and approval activities than from its initiatives for assisting agencies as a strategic partner.

New and valuable information on the plans, goals, and strategies of federal agencies has been provided since federal agencies began implementing GPRA. Under GPRA, annual performance plans are to clearly inform the Congress and the public of (1) the annual performance goals for agencies\u2019 major programs and activities, (2) the measures that will be used to gauge performance, (3) the strategies and resources required to achieve the performance goals, and (4) the procedures that will be used to verify and validate performance information. These annual plans, issued soon after transmittal of the president\u2019s budget, provide a direct linkage between an agency\u2019s longer-term goals and mission and day-to-day activities. Annual performance reports are to subsequently report on the degree to which performance goals were met. The issuance of the agencies\u2019 performance reports, due by March 31, represents a new and potentially more substantive phase in the implementation of GPRA\u2014the opportunity to assess federal agencies\u2019 actual performance for the prior fiscal year and to consider what steps are needed to improve performance and reduce costs in the future.", "OPM\u2019s mission is to support the federal government\u2019s ability to have the best workforce possible to do the best job possible.

OPM has several goals that relate to this outcome, but none that focus squarely on the degree to which the federal workforce has the right skill mix. Specifically, OPM\u2019s fiscal year 2000 performance report includes goals that \u201cfederal human resources management policies and programs are merit-based, mission- focused, and cost effective\u201d and \u201ca model for workforce planning . . . is in place\u201d for use by agencies. OPM\u2019s performance report states that both of these goals were met. OPM states that the first goal was met because it produced a few studies that contributed to human resource policy or program proposals. The second goal was met, according to the OPM fiscal year 2000 performance report, because OPM has provided the workforce planning model to several agencies. This model, and other important steps OPM has taken to support better workforce planning\u2014including developing research tools and launching a website to facilitate information sharing about workforce planning issues\u2014could prove helpful to agencies in addressing their individual strategic human capital challenges. As a next step, OPM needs to measure, for example, how the studies and workforce planning model actually contributed to improved strategic human capital management at the agencies. Specifically, as an intermediate outcome, OPM could measure the number of agencies that were able to identify skill shortages and solutions as a result of using workforce planning. Previously, we have reported that OPM should take a more proactive role in agency workforce planning efforts, and our April 2001 report on expected trends in federal employee retirements further highlights the need for improved workforce planning.", "Other information indicates that this outcome is not commonly being achieved. Our high-risk series gave many examples of agencies not having the appropriate workforce to carry out its mission. For example, the Department of Energy did not have employees with adequate contract management skills to oversee the clean up of hazardous waste sites, and nursing shortages at Veterans Affairs facilities could put veterans at risk.", "OPM\u2019s fiscal year 2002 plan contains several strategies that, for the most part, appear to be reasonable. For example, OPM plans to obtain input from agencies on how workforce policies need to be changed and to explore policies on dual compensation and phased retirement to bolster retention of federal employees. Determining whether these strategies are successful will require OPM to develop indicators of whether federal agencies and departments have appropriately skilled workforces and how these strategies are being used to build workforce skills."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Employee Performance Accountability", "paragraphs": ["As is the case with the first outcome, OPM\u2019s performance report does not contain sufficient outcome measures to fully assess the extent to which federal employees are held accountable for their performance.

For example, OPM is to develop performance-oriented approaches to employee compensation and to provide assistance in developing performance management systems. OPM measures goal achievement by such indicators as the number of workshops offered, the number of performance studies available on the OPM Website, and whether performance management guidance is issued in a timely manner.", "Other information indicates that much more needs to be done to improve performance management at federal agencies. For example, in our October 2000 report, we noted that surveys we had administered to managers showed that only 26 percent in 1997 and 31 percent in 2000 reported that employees in their agencies had received positive recognition to a great or very great extent for helping agencies accomplish their strategic goals. Also, the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) and we have previously reported that holding employees accountable for their job performance continues to be perceived as a challenge because employees perceive the process as cumbersome.", "OPM\u2019s plan identifies a variety of strategies for achieving goals that relate to the outcome of evaluating, rewarding, and otherwise holding federal employees accountable for their performance. The strategies call for providing guidance and information to agencies, including information on best practices, as well as working with internal and external stakeholders to identify needed changes in compensation and performance policies and programs. Although the strategies appear reasonable, how they will help to achieve the outcome of holding employees accountable for performance is not always clear. For example, a strategy OPM cited to help achieve its goal of identifying options for performance-oriented approaches to compensation was to maintain comprehensive research on best practices in private and public sector compensation systems and tools that the federal government can use. But OPM offers no explanation of how the use of such systems and tools will aid the federal government in holding employees accountable for their performance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Adherence to Merit System Principles", "paragraphs": ["OPM has made mixed progress on the outcome that federal agencies adhere to merit system principles. On the one hand, OPM\u2019s fiscal year 2000 performance report states that OPM\u2019s periodic reviews of agencies have identified no systemic merit principle weaknesses. On the other hand, the results of OPM\u2019s government-wide survey of federal employees conducted in fiscal years 1999 and 2000 indicate that a sizable percentage of employees think that certain merit principles are not being followed. The fiscal year 2000 performance report includes goals related to the overall adherence to merit principles by agencies, including agencies with delegated examining authority. OPM uses a variety of measures to determine if this outcome is being achieved, including (1) the results of merit system reviews of federal agencies, (2) agencies\u2019 satisfaction with the reviews, and (3) the views of federal employees regarding adherence to merit principles. OPM\u2019s report states that the reviews indicated that agencies, including those with delegated examining authority, were adhering to merit principles. According to the performance report, the problems found in OPM\u2019s reviews were not systemic. Once problems were identified in the review, OPM worked with the agency to resolve the problems. In its reviews, OPM also identified best practices and shared them with other agencies.", "The views of federal employees on adherence to the nine merit system principles, as provided in an OPM survey, indicated that there was no significant change from the fiscal year 1999 survey. OPM\u2019s goal was to increase by two percentage points the percentage of federal employees who believed each of the merit principles were being adhered to by their agencies. There are a variety of factors that influence employees\u2019 responses to this question, including governmentwide economic, cultural, and social conditions. For this reason, OPM expects substantive change in the perceptions of these principles to take place over several years. This year\u2019s survey indicates that a relatively large portion of federal employees believed that employees maintain a high standard of integrity and concern for the public and that employees are protected from improper political influence. But on the other hand less than half believe that employees are protected against reprisal for the lawful disclosure of information or are provided equal pay for equal work and rewarded for excellent performance; and only a little more than half think that employees are managed efficiently and effectively. Similar results were reported in the merit system principles survey conducted by MSPB in 2000.", "OPM\u2019s fiscal year 2002 performance plan identifies a variety of strategies that are consistent with its current efforts. The current strategies should help OPM achieve its goals as well as contribute to the outcome of ensuring that agencies adhere to the merit system principles. For example, to help ensure that personnel practices are carried out in accordance with these principles, OPM\u2019s strategies include conducting nationwide agency merit system oversight reviews, auditing agencies with delegated examining authority and reviewing reports filed by these agencies to identify any training needs, and reviewing all agency selections for initial career Senior Executive Service appointments for compliance with merit system principles.", "OPM does not include coordination with MSPB as a strategy for achieving performance goals within its Office of Merit Systems Oversight and Effectiveness\u2014the program office that is responsible for leading the federal government\u2019s efforts in overseeing the merit system. MSPB\u2019s mission, in part, is to ensure that agencies make employment decisions in accordance with the merit system principles. In support of its mission, MSPB hears and decides cases involving abuses of the merit system. It also administers the merit principles survey to gather data on the \u201chealth\u201d of the federal civil service. OPM\u2019s strategy should also consider MSPB\u2019s decisions and merit principles survey in helping to achieve this outcome. However, even though both agencies administer programs and conduct similar activities that share a common purpose, OPM\u2019s strategic plan for fiscal years 2000 through 2005 states that coordination with MSPB is limited to adjudicatory issues."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Fraud and Error in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program", "paragraphs": ["We could not fully assess the progress OPM is making to reduce fraud and error in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. The OPM OIG has identified health care fraud in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program as one of the most serious management challenges facing OPM. The fiscal year 2000 performance report contains an OIG goal to have fraud against OPM programs detected and prevented. This goal has several measures, including the number of convictions for health benefit program fraud (51 in fiscal year 2000) and the number of health benefit providers who are debarred and not allowed to participate in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (2,706 in fiscal year 2000). Although these are measures for the OIG, there were no goals or strategies related to the detection and prevention of fraud at the programmatic level for the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program in the Office of Retirement and Insurance Service (RIS), whose mission, in part, is to provide accurate and cost-efficient benefit services. For example, there were no goals or strategies to decrease the number of errors or fraud cases to a minimum. In addition, there were no baseline indicators of the dollar amount of fraud or errors found in the health benefits program or quantitative targets against which to measure progress. OPM believes that measures identified by the OIG are consistent with RIS\u2019 expectations and says that RIS has worked in unison with the OIG to minimize fraud and abuse in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. While we recognize this, we believe that OPM needs to develop goals and measures within RIS for detecting and preventing fraud and errors in the health benefits program.", "The fiscal year 2002 performance plan contains a strategy to have the employee benefit trust funds be models of excellence and integrity in financial stewardship. The OIG includes strategies related to reducing fraud and errors, such as pursuing debarment of untrustworthy health care providers and conducting aggressive investigations where fraud and abuse are suspected, which seem reasonable. The RIS had no goals or performance indicators related to fraud and errors in the health benefits program, but included strategies such as (1) working with carriers participating in health benefits to ensure that audits are performed and (2) conducting financial statement audits to reduce the incidence of payment errors, which in part will help detect fraud and errors in the health benefits program. Although these strategies generally will help detect and reduce fraud and errors, it is unclear how this will be accomplished and how they plan to measure progress because there were no baseline indicators for the dollar amount of fraud or errors found in the health benefits program, or performance indicators against which to measure progress. In addition, performance indicators for the OIG measured progress in processing cases (debarments, indictments, and convictions) once the fraud is discovered but did not address measures for preventing it."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Retirement and Insurance Services", "paragraphs": ["The fiscal year 2000 performance report describes mixed progress in the provision of timely and accurate retirement and insurance services. OPM\u2019s retirement and insurance program continues to receive high satisfaction ratings from its customers, but timeliness of retirement claims processing has declined. The fiscal year 2000 performance report outlines several outcome-oriented goals that include increasing customer satisfaction with services and reducing processing times. Customer satisfaction with OPM\u2019s retirement and insurance programs remained high during fiscal year 2000. For example, more than 90 percent of new retirees said they were very or generally satisfied with how their claims were handled. Claims processing times, however, did not meet target levels, particularly the time to process Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS) claims. Specifically, Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) claims processing time increased to 44 days from 32 days in fiscal year 1999 and FERS processing time increased to more than 6 months from 3 months in fiscal year 1999. The goal for CSRS processing time is 25 days and for FERS processing time is 60 days.", "OPM recognizes that it needs to address lagging times in retirement claims processing, and the fiscal year 2002 performance plan contains strategies that could improve claims processing timeliness. The plan states that the current processing is based on \u201caging technology, paper-based business processes, and a heavy reliance on human resources.\u201d One of the strategies cited in OPM\u2019s plan for reducing claims processing times is to add more resources to the processing of FERS claims. OPM\u2019s measure of its success in achieving this goal is to gradually reduce processing times for these claims from a fiscal year 2000 level of 6 months to 5 months in fiscal year 2001 and 3 months in fiscal year 2002. The number of FERS claims is expected to increase by nearly 40 percent between fiscal year 2000 and fiscal year 2002. The number of employees seeking retirement services is expected to dramatically increase beyond 2002. To address long-term needs, OPM is implementing a Retirement Systems Modernization project that is expected to significantly reengineer and automate retirement claims processing. OPM is implementing the modernization of the retirement systems in phases and expects to realize significant business benefits each year. OPM says it has already seen improvements. For example, OPM says it implemented a prototype FERS Benefit Calculator that has helped to reduce processing times and the balance of aged cases.

The fiscal year 2000 report clearly identifies the most critical measures of the several measures that are included under most goals. If the critical indicator was met, then OPM considered the goal met. Last year we noted a number of performance report weaknesses, including the use of activity-based indicators instead of outcome-based indicators and the lack of specific target measures for goals. Again for fiscal year 2000, many indicators are activity based or do not contain specific targets. The following are examples of activity-based measures or those without targets:   To determine whether delegated examining is conducted in accordance with merit system laws, OPM measured the number of reviews conducted of agency-delegated examining activities.", "An OPM measure is to ensure that the OPM workforce is well trained for current and future needs; however, there is no target identified to determine when this has been achieved.

OPM considered this goal met because it disseminated information on state-of-the-art compensation practices.", "Even though these measures indicate positive activity, they are not measures of actual goal achievement, and without specific targets it is not possible to determine whether the goal was met.", "The fiscal year 2000 performance report also contains some measures that were not considered reliable by the OPM OIG. The performance report states that the Inspector General reviewed 116 of the 458 performance measures and found that 59 percent were based on reliable information and 17 percent were based on unreliable information; for 24 percent of the measures, the OIG could not determine their reliability. Further, concerns exist about the reliability of key surveys that are used by OPM as measures for goal achievement throughout the performance report. The low participation rates for the current Human Resources Directors\u2019 Survey and the earlier Human Resources Specialists Survey (which was not conducted in fiscal year 2000) pose a material risk that the respondents may not be representative of the overall survey population.

Regarding OPM\u2019s internal strategic human capital management, we found that the fiscal year 2002 performance plan contains several goals and measures related to OPM\u2019s internal strategic human capital management, and OPM\u2019s fiscal year 2000 performance report describes progress in resolving some of these OPM-level strategic human capital management challenges. For example, both the report and the plan contained goals related to recruiting, retaining, and managing a workforce to meet OPM program needs. Of particular note was the requirement that all employee performance plans be linked to agency strategic goals and the establishment of baseline data to measure the rate of retention among employees who complete career development programs. To further improve its strategic human capital management goals and strategies, OPM needs to link these strategies to specific OPM programs. For example, the OPM performance plan states that OPM has significantly changed its ratio of employees to supervisors to now exceed the governmentwide average. OPM\u2019s performance plan also states that it wants to further increase this ratio.

The third column discusses the extent to which OPM\u2019s fiscal year 2002 performance plan includes performance goals and measures to address the challenges that we and/or OPM\u2019s OIG identified.", "We found that OPM\u2019s performance report discussed the agency\u2019s progress in resolving all challenges. Of the agency\u2019s seven major management challenges, its performance plan had goals and measures that were directly related to all seven of the challenges. OPM can build upon its efforts by more clearly identifying the specific strategies that it is using to address its challenges. Such information is important to help OPM, the Congress, and other decisionmakers determine whether the best mix of strategies is in place and to help pinpoint improvement opportunities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments From the Office of Personnel Management", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO\u2019s Comments", "paragraphs": ["The following are GAO\u2019s comments on the specific comments contained in the enclosure to OPM\u2019s letter dated June 26, 2001. 1.  We revised this report to show that the retirement systems modernization project is being implemented in phases and that it will not be fully operational until 2009. 2.  In the draft of this report provided to OPM for comment, we stated that OPM\u2019s goal for fiscal year 2000 was to make the workforce planning model available to agencies for their use and that this goal was met. Although making the model available to agencies is a useful activity, OPM\u2019s performance report and plan do not make clear what the outcome or result was from this activity. For example, neither document provides information on how agencies have used this model to help ensure that they have an appropriately constituted, properly skilled workforce to carry out their missions. OPM comments \u201cthere is already real evidence that the model has been of assistance, as all Federal agencies are meeting a deadline of June 29, 2001, to provide the Office of Management and Budget with individual workforce analyses as a first step in meeting the President\u2019s initiative to use human capital planning to streamline Government.\u201d The basis upon which OPM makes this statement is unclear, because although OPM says the workforce planning model has been of assistance to agencies, it does not say how many agencies actually used it in responding to OMB\u2019s directive. 3.  We recognize that OPM\u2019s goal for fiscal year 2000 was to complete its research on private and public sector best practices in compensation systems and tools. However, OPM does not describe in its fiscal year 2000 performance report or 2002 performance plan what outcome or result was expected for this activity-based goal in terms of ensuring employee performance accountability. Thus, we continue to believe that OPM needs to have goals, measures, and strategies in place that will show how the use of the compensation systems and tools identified as a result of its research will aid the federal government in holding employees accountable for their performance. 4.  We changed the report to recognize OPM\u2019s belief that the measures the OIG identified for detecting fraud and error in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program are consistent with RIS\u2019 expectations. However, as we have stated in this report, the OIG\u2019s measures relate to detecting fraud after it has occurred rather than preventing it. Accordingly, we continue to believe that OPM needs to develop goals and measures within the program office, RIS, for detecting and preventing fraud and errors in the health benefits program. OPM commented that it will look for ways to develop additional program- wide goals and measures relating to fraud and errors in the federal health benefits program. 5.  In addition to the changes described in comment 1, we changed the report to reflect that the retirement systems modernization project has not been delayed. We also cited an example of improvements OPM has seen thus far in implementing the modernized retirement systems."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
