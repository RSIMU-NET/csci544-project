Federal policy, including the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) National Infrastructure Protection Plan, calls for a partnership model that includes public and private councils to coordinate policy and information sharing and analysis centers to gather and disseminate information on threats to physical and cyber-related infrastructure. GAO was asked to determine (1) private sector stakeholders' expectations for cyber-related, public-private partnerships and to what extent these expectations are being met and (2) public sector stakeholders' expectations for cyber-related, public-private partnerships and to what extent these expectations are being met. To do this, GAO conducted surveys and interviews of public and private sector officials and analyzed relevant policies and other documents."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Private sector stakeholders reported that they expect their federal partners to provide usable, timely, and actionable cyber threat information and alerts; access to sensitive or classified information; a secure mechanism for sharing information; security clearances; and a single centralized government cybersecurity organization to coordinate government efforts. However, according to private sector stakeholders, federal partners are not consistently meeting these expectations. For example, less than one-third of private sector respondents reported that they were receiving actionable cyber threat information and alerts to a great or moderate extent. Federal partners are taking steps that may address the key expectations of the private sector, including developing new information-sharing arrangements. However, while the ongoing efforts may address the public sector's ability to meet the private sector's expectations, much work remains to fully implement improved information sharing. Public sector stakeholders reported that they expect the private sector to provide a commitment to execute plans and recommendations, timely and actionable cyber threat information and alerts, and appropriate staff and resources. Four of the five public sector councils that GAO held structured interviews with reported that their respective private sector partners are committed to executing plans and recommendations and providing timely and actionable information. However, public sector council officials stated that improvements could be made to the partnership, including improving private sector sharing of sensitive information. Some private sector stakeholders do not want to share their proprietary information with the federal government for fear of public disclosure and potential loss of market share, among other reasons. Without improvements in meeting private and public sector expectations, the partnerships will remain less than optimal, and there is a risk that owners of critical infrastructure will not have the information necessary to thwart cyber attacks that could have catastrophic effects on our nation's cyber-reliant critical infrastructure."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the national Cybersecurity Coordinator and DHS work with their federal and private sector partners to enhance information-sharing efforts.

The National Infrastructure Protection Plan  (NIPP) describes a partnership model as the primary means of  coordinating government and private sector efforts to protect critical  infrastructure. For each sector, the model requires formation of  government coordinating councils (government councils)\u2014composed of  federal, state, local, or tribal agencies with purview over critical sectors\u2014 and encourages voluntary formation of sector coordinating councils  (sector councils)\u2014composed of owner-operators of these critical assets  (some of which may be state or local agencies) or their respective trade  associations. These councils create the structure through which  representative groups from all levels of government and the private sector  are to collaborate in planning and implementing efforts to protect critical  infrastructure. The sector councils are envisioned to be policy-related and  to represent a primary point of contact for government to plan the entire  range of infrastructure protection activities, including those associated  with mitigating cyber threats. The councils\u2019 functions are distinct from  those of the private sector information-sharing and analysis centers (ISAC)  that were established to serve an operational role such as providing  mechanisms for gathering, analyzing, and disseminating information on  physical and cyber-related infrastructure threats and vulnerabilities to and  from private infrastructure sectors and the government.", "Our objectives were to determine (1) private sector stakeholders\u2019  expectations for cyber-related, public-private partnerships and to what  extent these expectations are being met and (2) public sector  stakeholders\u2019 expectations for cyber-related, public-private partnerships  and to what extent these expectations are being met.", "To determine private sector expectations and to what extent these  expectations are being met, we collected and analyzed documents related  to the formation of public-private partnerships and their actions,  conducted structured interviews, and surveyed 56 private sector  representatives from the following cyber-reliant critical infrastructure  sectors: (1) banking and finance, (2) communications, (3) defense  industrial base (DIB), (4) energy, and (5) information technology (IT).

The NIPP is intended to provide the  framework for a coordinated national approach to address the full range  of physical, cyber, and human threats and vulnerabilities that pose risks to  the nation\u2019s critical infrastructure. The NIPP relies on a sector partnership  model as the primary means of coordinating government and private  sector CIP efforts. Under this model, each sector has both a government  council and a private sector council to address sector-specific planning  and coordination. The government and private sector councils are to work  in tandem to create the context, framework, and support for coordination  and information-sharing activities required to implement and sustain that  sector\u2019s CIP efforts. The council framework allows for the involvement of  representatives from all levels of government and the private sector, so  that collaboration and information-sharing can occur to assess events  accurately, formulate risk assessments, and determine appropriate  protective measures.", "The government councils are to coordinate strategies, activities, policies,  and communications across government entities within each sector. Each  government council is to be composed of representatives from various  levels of government (i.e., federal, state, local, and tribal) as appropriate to  the security needs of each individual sector. In addition, a representative  from the sector-specific agency is to chair the council and is to provide  cross-sector coordination with each of the member governments. For  example, DOE in its role as the sector-specific agency for the energy  sector has established and chairs a government council.", "The establishment of private sector councils (sector councils) is  encouraged under the NIPP model, and these councils are to be the  principal entities for coordinating with the government on a wide range of  CIP activities and issues. Under the model, critical asset owners and  operators are encouraged to be involved in the creation of sector councils  that are self-organized, self-run, and self-governed, with a spokesperson  designated by the sector membership. Specific membership can vary from  sector to sector but should be representative of a broad base of owners,  operators, associations, and other entities\u2014both large and small\u2014within  the sector.

All of the organizations identified trust  as the essential underlying element to successful relationships and said  that trust could be built only over time and, primarily, through personal  relationships. Other critical success factors identified included  (1) establishing effective and appropriately secure communication  mechanisms, such as regular meetings and secure Web sites; (2) obtaining  the support of senior managers at member organizations regarding the  sharing of potentially sensitive member information and the commitment  of resources; and (3) ensuring organizational leadership continuity.

The challenges  included creating warnings that are consistently actionable and timely and  employing predictive analysis. We made 10 recommendations to DHS to  improve the department\u2019s cyber analysis and warning capabilities. These  included, among others, addressing deficiencies in its monitoring efforts,  including establishing a comprehensive baseline understanding of the  nation\u2019s critical information infrastructure and engaging appropriate  private-sector stakeholders to support a national-level cyber monitoring  capability. We also recommended that DHS address the challenges that  impeded it in fully implementing cyber analysis and warning, including  developing close working relationships with federal and private-sector  entities to allow the free flow of information and ensuring consistent  notifications that are actionable and timely. DHS agreed with most of  these recommendations and initiated related actions.", "In 2007 and 2009, we determined the extent to which sector plans for CIP  fully addressed DHS\u2019s cyber security requirements and assessed whether  these plans and related reports provided for effective implementation.  We found, among other things, that although DHS reported many efforts  under way and planned to improve the cyber content of sector-specific  plans, sector-specific agencies had yet to update their respective sector- specific plans to fully address key DHS cybersecurity criteria. The lack of  complete updates and progress reports was further evidence that the  sector planning process had not been effective, thus leaving the nation in  the position of not knowing precisely where it stands in securing cyber- critical infrastructures. Not following up to address these conditions also  showed DHS was not making sector planning a priority. We recommend that DHS assess whether the existing sector-specific planning process  should continue to be the nation\u2019s approach to securing cyber and other  ed  critical infrastructure and, if so, make the process an agency priority and  manage it accordingly. DHS concurred with the recommendations. In  addition, due to concerns about DHS\u2019s efforts to fully implement its CIP  responsibilities, as well as known security risks to critical infrastructu re  systems, we added cyber CIP as part of our federal IT systems security  high-risk area in 2003 and have continued to report on its status s time.", "Most recently, we testified in 2009 on the results of expert panels that  identified the importance of bolstering public-private partnershi discussions with us, the panel identified 12 key areas requiring  improvement.

According to DHS officials, US- CERT\u2019s ability to provide information is impacted by restrictions that do  not allow individualized treatment of one private sector entity over  another private sector entity\u2014making it difficult to formally share specific  information with entities that are being directly impacted by a cyber  threat. In addition, because US-CERT serves as the nation\u2019s cyber analysis  and warning center, it must ensure that its warnings are accurate.  Therefore, US-CERT\u2019s products are subjected to a stringent review and  revision process that can adversely affect the timeliness of its products\u2014 potentially adding days to the release if classified or law enforcement  information must be removed from the product. In addition, federal  officials are restricted to sharing classified information with only cleared  private sector officials.

By contrast, DOE officials stated that they are willing to  share sensitive information with their energy sector member entities due  to the long-standing nature of their relationships with the sector and the  type of information being shared. In addition, according to federal  officials, the limited number of private sector personnel with national  security clearances makes it difficult to share classified information.", "Another issue having an adverse affect on the federal partners\u2019 ability to  meet private sector expectations is that federal officials do not have an  adequate understanding of the specific private sector information  requirements.

For example, more specific threat information would  be focused on the technology being used by a particular entity or specify  that a threat intends to target a particular entity, rather than including just  broad threat information and alerts. In addition, this more specific  information would focus on the specific needs for each sector rather than  all of the sectors getting the same information. A private sector official  also stated that the federal government often approaches the private  sector on issues that are not a priority to the private sector but are issues  the federal government thinks the private sector is interested in.

However, only two of the five government  councils reported that the private sector is providing appropriate staff and  resources. In addition, the extent to which the private sector is fulfilling  the public sector\u2019s expectations varies by sector. Of the five councils, the  communications government council reported most positively on whether  the private sector was providing expected services. Specifically, it  reported that its private sector partners were providing 8 of 10 expected  services to a great or moderate extent. By contrast, the IT sector council  reported that the private sector was providing only 1 of 10 expected  services to a great or moderate extent and 5 of 10 expected services to  only some extent.

For  example, while the government coordinating councils reported receiving  timely and actionable cyber threat and alert information from the private  sector, there are limits to the depth and specificity of the information  provided, according to federal officials. One issue is that private sector  stakeholders do not want to share their sensitive, proprietary information  with the federal government. In addition, information security companies  could lose a competitive advantage by sharing information with the  government which, in turn, could share it with those companies\u2019  competitors. In addition, according to DHS officials, despite special  protections and sanitization processes, private sector stakeholders are  unwilling to agree to all of the terms that the federal government or a  government agency requires to share certain information.

For more than a  decade, this private-public partnership has been evolving. While both  private and public sector stakeholders report finding value in the  partnership, the degree to which expectations are being met varies. Private  sector stakeholders expect their federal partners to consistently provide  usable, timely, actionable cyber threat information and alerts and, to a  lesser extent, other related services. However, private sector stakeholders  are not consistently receiving their expected services from their federal  partners because, in part, federal partners are restricted in the type of  information that can be shared with the private sector and lack an  understanding about each sector\u2019s specific information requirements. In  addition, many private sector stakeholders interact with multiple federal  entities and multiple information sources, which can result in duplication  of efforts and inconsistent information being shared.", "In turn, federal partners primarily expect their private sector partners to  provide commitment to execute plans and recommendations, timely and  actionable cyber threat and alert information, and appropriate staff and  resources, which the private sector is primarily providing; however, while  most federal partners stated that these expectations are mostly being met,  they identified difficulties with the private sector sharing their sensitive  information and the need for private sector partners to improve their  willingness to engage and provide support to partnership efforts. Federal  and private sector partners have initiated efforts to improve the  partnerships; however, much work remains to fully implement improved  information sharing. Without improvements in meeting private and public  sector expectations, the partnerships will remain less than optimal, and  there is a risk that owners of critical infrastructure will not have the  appropriate information and mechanisms to thwart sophisticated cyber  attacks that could have catastrophic effects on our nation\u2019s cyber-reliant  critical infrastructure."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Special Assistant to the President and  Cybersecurity Coordinator and the Secretary of Homeland Security, in  collaboration with the sector lead agencies, coordinating councils, and the  owners and operators of the associated five critical infrastructure sectors,  take two actions: (1) use the results of this report to focus their  information-sharing efforts, including their relevant pilot projects, on the  most desired services, including providing timely and actionable threat  and alert information, access to sensitive or classified information, a  secure mechanism for sharing information, and providing security  clearance and (2) bolster the efforts to build out the National  Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center as the central focal  point for leveraging and integrating the capabilities of the private sector,  civilian government, law enforcement, the military, and the intelligence  community.", "We are not making new recommendations regarding cyber-related analysis  and warning at this time because our previous recommendations directed  to DHS, the central focal point for such activity, in these areas have not yet  been fully implemented."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["The national Cybersecurity Coordinator provided no comments on a draft  of our report.

In addition, regarding our second recommendation, DHS stated that  it is integrating government components and private sector partners into  its National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center.", "DHS also provided general comments. First, DHS noted that it is important  to distinguish between actionable information and classified, contextual  threat information. Specifically, DHS stated that sharing classified  information with the private sector can pose a risk to national security  and, consequently, such information is generally non-actionable. While we  found that the private-sector stakeholders we surveyed and interviewed  expect such information, we do not state that the federal government  should share classified information with uncleared individuals. We  distinguish in this report between sharing timely and actionable threat and  alert information and providing access to classified information.
