Major goals of the reform legislation have included the  following:", "Strengthening internal control. Accountability is part of the  organizational culture that goes well beyond receiving an unmodified  or \u201cclean\u201d audit opinion on agency financial statements; the underlying  premise is that agencies must become more results oriented and  focused on internal control. Thousands of internal control problems  have been identified and corrected in executive branch agencies over  the past two decades. A disciplined and structured approach to  assessing and dealing with internal controls over the critical flow of  funds through the entire agency provides a mechanism that over time  mitigates potential damaging breakdowns in financial integrity and  mismanagement of funds. Such breakdowns can affect the ability of  the agency or entity to carry out its mission and can severely damage  public confidence.", "Accurate accounting and financial reporting. The CFO Act and  FFMIA provide for financial management systems that support reliable  financial reporting on the results of operations on a day-to-day basis.  This functionality, in turn, supports management decision making on  budgets, programs, and overall mission performance and goals.  Accurate accounting and financial reporting are also a major element  of any effort to achieve auditable financial statements.", "Improving performance information. A key goal of much of the  federal management reform legislation enacted over the past 25  years, such as the CFO Act and GPRA, is the ability to have reliable  information to measure performance against mission goals. Federal  agencies have made progress in the preparation of annual  performance and accountability reports (PAR). By linking financial  and performance information, the PARs provide important information  about the return on the taxpayers\u2019 investment in agency programs and  operations.", "Enhancing transparency. Achieving clean audit opinions evidencing  sound financial management practices is an overall outcome of  effective implementation of these reforms. For example, the  achievement of a clean audit opinion on the first-ever annual financial  statements for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) was a  significant accomplishment. This provided important accountability  and transparency to the public regarding TARP activities.", "Many of the problems that preceded passage of the CFO Act also led us  to issue our first high-risk list in 1990, designating certain DOD and other  federal programs as high risk because of their vulnerability to fraud,  waste, abuse, and mismanagement. DOD areas designated as high risk in 1990 included Supply Chain Management and Weapon System  Acquisition, followed by Contract Management in 1992, Financial  Management and Business Systems Modernization in 1995, Support  Infrastructure Management in 1997, and Business Transformation in  2005.", "As we reported in our latest high-risk update, DOD is one of the few  federal entities that cannot accurately account for its spending or assets  and it is the only federal agency that has yet to receive an opinion on at  least one of its department-wide financial statements. Without accurate,  timely, and useful financial information, DOD is severely hampered in  making sound decisions affecting its operations. Further, to the extent  that current budget constraints and fiscal pressures continue, the  reliability of DOD\u2019s financial information and ability to maintain effective  accountability for its resources will be increasingly important to the federal  government\u2019s ability to make sound resource allocation decisions.

DOD has made moderate progress in addressing its  supply chain management weaknesses, but several long-standing  problems have not yet been resolved.

We reported in 2012 and  2013 that DOD had made progress in reducing its excess inventory and  implementing its Comprehensive Inventory Management Improvement  Plan. DOD established overarching goals in the plan to reduce the  enterprise-wide percentages of on-order excess inventory, those items  already purchased that may be excess due to subsequent changes in  requirements, and on-hand excess inventory, those items categorized for  potential reuse or disposal. Since DOD was exceeding its initial goals for  reducing excess inventory, we recommended that DOD\u2019s efforts would  benefit from establishing more challenging, but achievable, goals for  reducing excess inventory and that the department periodically reexamine  and update its goals. DOD agreed with our recommendations and revised  its on-hand excess inventory goal from 10 percent of the total value of  inventory to 8 percent in fiscal year 2016. However, DOD did not make  any changes to its on-order excess inventory goals and maintained that  its current goals of 6 percent of the total value of on-order inventory in  2014 and 4 percent in 2016 were sufficient. Our work determined that  DOD has made progress in reducing on-hand and on order excess  inventory. For example:", "Data from the end of fiscal year 2009 showed that of the about $94.5  billion in on-hand inventory, 9.4 percent, or about $8.8 billion, was  excess.

DOD primarily relies on various logistical systems to carry out both its  stewardship and financial reporting responsibilities for an estimated $1.5  trillion in physical assets, ranging from enormous inventories of  ammunition, stockpile materials, and other military items to multimillion- dollar weapon systems. These systems are the primary source of  information for maintaining visibility over assets to meet military objectives  and readiness goals and for financial reporting. However, our prior reports  and DOD Inspector General (IG) reports have shown that these systems  have serious weaknesses that in addition to hampering financial  reporting, impair DOD\u2019s ability to (1) maintain central visibility over its  assets; (2) safeguard assets from physical deterioration, theft, or loss;  and (3) prevent the purchase of assets already on hand.

However, the  current system\u2014LMP Increment 1\u2014does not support certain critical  requirements, such as automatically tracking repair and manufacturing  operations on the shop floor of depots and arsenals.

Deficiencies  in internal control supporting the process for estimating environmental  and disposal liabilities could result in improperly stated liabilities as  well as adversely affect the ability to determine priorities for cleanup  and disposal activities and to appropriately consider future budgetary  resources needed to carry out these activities. In addition, DOD could  not support a significant amount of its estimated military  postretirement health benefits liabilities for federal employee and  veteran benefits. These unsupported amounts related to the cost of  direct health care provided by DOD-managed military treatment  facilities. Problems in accounting for liabilities affect the determination  of the full cost of the federal governments operations and the extent of  its liabilities.

To the  extent that Industrial Operations does not complete work at year-end,  the work and related funding are carried over into the next fiscal year.  Carryover is the reported dollar value of work that has been ordered  and funded by customers but not completed by Industrial Operations  at the end of the fiscal year. We found that the Army did not  adequately evaluate program needs and performance management  constraints or the budgetary impact of the implementation of its LMP  when budgeting for its Industrial Operations. As a result, unreliable  information on the scope of work and the lack of available parts  affected mission readiness. Further, the overstated Industrial  Operations carryover amounts resulted in unreliable estimates of  Operations and Maintenance funding levels. For example, the  Industrial Fund carryover amounts more than doubled from fiscal  years 2006 through 2012, exceeding budget estimates by more than  $1.1 billion each year. We made three recommendations aimed at  implementing the Army\u2019s planned corrective actions to (1) establish a  timetable for implementing new policy guidance, (2) improve the  budgeting for new orders, and (3) establish procedures for evaluating  work orders received to ensure that resources are available to  perform the work.

Improper payments degrade the integrity of government  programs, compromise citizens\u2019 trust in government, and drain  resources away from the missions and goals of the government. As  we reported in May 2013, although DOD has reported billions of  dollars in improper payments, it does not know the extent of its  improper payments because of flaws in its estimating methodology.  We found that DOD\u2019s improper payment estimates reported in its  fiscal year 2011 AFR were neither reliable nor statistically valid  because of long-standing and pervasive financial management  weaknesses and significant deficiencies in the department\u2019s  procedures to estimate improper payments. The flawed methodology  for estimating improper payments also limits the effectiveness of  DOD\u2019s corrective actions. We recommended that DOD take steps to  (1) improve improper payment estimating procedures, such as  developing valid sampling methodologies and error projections; (2)  identify programs susceptible to improper payments and perform a  risk assessments; (3) develop and implement corrective action plans  in accordance with best practices; (4) implement recovery audits; and  (5) ensure the accuracy and completeness of improper payment and  recovery audit reporting.

Further, deficiencies in internal control  over such assets could affect the federal government\u2019s ability to fully  know the assets it owns, including their location and condition, and its  ability to (1) safeguard assets from physical deterioration, theft, or  loss; (2) account for acquisitions and disposals of such assets and  reliably report asset balances; (3) ensure that the assets are available  for use when needed; (4) prevent unnecessary storage and  maintenance costs or purchase of assets already on hand; and (5)  determine the full costs of programs that use these assets. DOD is  addressing these issues through implementation of its FIAR Plan.", "With the nation facing fiscal challenges and the potential for tighter  defense budgets, the Congress and DOD have placed more attention  on controlling the billions of dollars spent annually on weapon system  operating and support costs, including costs for repair parts,  maintenance, and personnel, which account for 70 percent of the total  costs of a weapon system over its life cycle. The Selected Acquisition  Report (SAR) is DOD\u2019s key recurring status report on the cost,  schedule, and performance of major defense acquisition programs  and is intended to provide authoritative information for congressional  oversight of these programs. Oversight of operating and support costs  is important because many of the key decisions affecting these life  cycle costs are made during the acquisition process. In February  2012, we reported that DOD\u2019s reports to the Congress on estimated  weapon system operating and support costs are often inconsistent  and sometimes unreliable, limiting visibility needed for effective  oversight of these costs. To enhance the visibility of weapon system  costs during acquisition, we recommended that DOD improve its  guidance to program offices on cost reporting and also to improve its  process for reviewing these costs prior to final submission of the SAR  to the Congress. DOD concurred with our recommendations and  noted actions it was taking to address them. We are continuing to  monitor DOD\u2019s progress in addressing our recommendations.", "In December 2012, DOD canceled the Air Force\u2019s Expeditionary  Combat Support System after having spent more than a billion dollars  and missing multiple milestones, including failure to achieve  deployment within 5 years of obligating funds. The system was to  provide the Air Force with a single, integrated logistics system that  was to control and account for about $36 billion of inventory. We  issued several reports on this system and found that among other  things, the program was not fully following best practices for  developing reliable schedules and cost estimates. We also reported  that independent Air Force technical evaluations identified operational  deficiencies that impaired the system\u2019s efficiency and effectiveness in  accounting for business transactions and reporting reliable financial  information.", "Accurate and complete cost information also is key to making  effective and economical investment decisions. We reported that one- time implementation costs for Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC)  2005 grew from $21 billion originally estimated by the BRAC  Commission in 2005 to about $35.1 billion, or by 67 percent, through  fiscal year 2011, primarily because of higher-than-anticipated military  construction costs. Military construction costs for the BRAC 2005  round increased from $13.2 billion based on original estimates by the  BRAC Commission to $24.5 billion, an 86 percent increase, through  fiscal year 2011, while over the same period, general inflation  increased by 13.7 percent. In certain cases, DOD did not include  some significant military construction requirements that were needed  to implement the recommendations as envisioned, resulting in the  identification of additional requirements and related cost increases  after the recommendations were approved by the BRAC Commission.  Consequently, the increase of $11.3 billion in military construction   costs drove about 80 percent of the total cost increases of $14.1  billion for BRAC 2005. Further, because some additional requirements  were driven by events after the BRAC Commission\u2019s approval, the  Congress had limited visibility into the potential costs of the original  recommendations. Another reason we identified for the growth in  implementation costs over DOD\u2019s initial BRAC estimates was that  DOD had difficulties accurately anticipating information technology  requirements for many recommendations, leading to significantly  understated information technology costs for some BRAC  recommendations\u2014particularly those that involved missions with  considerable reliance on such capabilities.

According to copies of ADA violation reports we reviewed, DOD  reported 75 ADA violations from fiscal year 2007 through fiscal year  2012, totaling nearly $1.1 billion. We received reports of 2 additional  ADA violations in 2013 totaling $148.6 million. However, we  determined that the number of violations and dollar amounts reported  may not be complete because of weaknesses in DOD\u2019s funds control  and monitoring processes that may not have allowed all violations to  be identified or reported. For example, DOD IG reports issued in fiscal  years 2007 through 2012 identified $5.5 billion in potential ADA  violations that required further investigation to determine whether an  ADA violation had, in fact, occurred, or if adjustments could be made  to avoid a violation. Further, while DOD\u2019s Financial Management  Regulation (FMR) limits the time from identification to reporting of  ADA violations to 15 months, our analysis identified several  examples of time spans for investigations of potential ADA violations  taking several additional months to several years before  determinations of actual violations were reported. For example, as of  September 30, 2013, three of the DOD IG-reported potential violations  totaling $713.1 million could not be fully corrected and, consequently,  resulted in $108.8 million in actual, reported ADA violations. To the  extent that ADA violations are not identified, corrected, and reported,  DOD management decisions are being made based on incomplete  and unreliable data.", "DOD has stated that its major financial decisions are based on  budgetary data (e.g., the status of funds received, obligated, and  expended). We have found that the department\u2019s ability to improve its  budgetary accounting has historically been hindered by its reliance on  fundamentally flawed financial management systems and processes  and transaction control weaknesses. In its November 2013 AFR,  DOD self-reported 16 material weaknesses in financial reporting,  noting that it has no assurance of the effectiveness of the related  controls. These weaknesses affect reporting on budgetary  transactions and balances, including budget authority, fund balance,  outlays, and categories of transactions, such as civilian pay, military  pay, and contract payments. As a result, we have concluded that  DOD\u2019s reports on budget execution and reports on the results of  operations that could have a material effect on budget, spending, and  other management decisions are unreliable.", "For example, we found that DOD continues to make billions of dollars  of unsupported, forced adjustments, or \u201cplugs,\u201d to reconcile its Fund  Balance with Treasury (FBWT). In the federal government, an  agency\u2019s FBWT accounts are similar in concept to corporate bank  accounts. The difference is that instead of a cash balance, FBWT  represents unexpended budget authority in appropriation accounts.  Similar to bank accounts, the funds in DOD\u2019s appropriation accounts  must be reduced or increased as the department spends money or  receives collections that it is authorized to retain for its own use. For  fiscal year 2012, DOD agencies reported making $9.2 billion in  unsupported reconciling adjustments to agree their fund balances with  the Department of the Treasury\u2019s (Treasury) records. DOD\u2019s  unsupported reconciling adjustments to agree its fund balances to  Treasury records grew to $9.6 billion in fiscal year 2013. We  recommended that the Navy develop and implement standard  operating procedures for performing FBWT reconciliations with  Treasury records and that it provide training on the new procedures to  personnel performing FBWT reconciliations. The Navy has actions  under way to address our recommendations.", "Further, we have reported that over the years, DOD has recorded  billions of dollars of disbursement and collection transactions in  suspense accounts because the proper appropriation accounts could  not be identified and charged, generally because of coding errors.  Accordingly, Treasury does not accept DOD reporting of suspense  transactions, and suspense transactions are not included in DOD  component FBWT reconciliations. We have concluded that it is  important that DOD accurately and promptly charge transactions to  appropriation accounts since these accounts provide the department  with legal authority to incur and pay obligations for goods and  services. We recommended that the Navy perform periodic testing of  systems for reporting transactions to Treasury and prioritize and  address identified deficiencies. The Navy agreed with our  recommendations and has actions under way to address them. We  are monitoring the Navy\u2019s progress.", "While DOD has actions under way to address its department-wide funds  control weaknesses, several are not expected to be completed until 2017.  Until fully resolved, these weaknesses will continue to adversely affect  DOD\u2019s ability to achieve its goals for financial accountability, including the  ability to produce consistent, reliable, and sustainable financial  information for day-to-day decision making. Sustained leadership  commitment will be critical to achieving success. In commenting on our  most recent report released this week, DOD stated that while our report  recommended no new actions based on the numerous actions that DOD  already has under way, the department\u2019s commitment to building a  stronger business environment via its people, processes, and systems  remains paramount."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOD\u2019s Actions to Improve Financial Management and Achieve Audit Readiness, and Remaining Challenges", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "FIAR Plan Implementation", "paragraphs": ["In 2005, the Under Secretary of Defense Comptroller/CFO (DOD  Comptroller) established the FIAR Directorate, consisting of the FIAR  Director and his staff, to develop, manage, and implement a strategic  approach for addressing financial management deficiencies, achieving  audit readiness, and integrating those efforts with other initiatives. In  accordance with the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2010, DOD provides reports to  relevant congressional committees on the status of DOD\u2019s  implementation of the FIAR Plan twice a year\u2014no later than May 15 and  November 15. In August 2009, the DOD Comptroller sought to focus  FIAR efforts by giving priority to improving processes and controls that  support the financial information most often used to manage the  department. Accordingly, the DOD Comptroller revised the FIAR Plan  strategy to focus on two priorities\u2014budgetary information and asset  accountability. The first priority was to strengthen processes, controls,  and systems that produce DOD\u2019s budgetary information. The second  priority was to improve the accuracy and reliability of management  information pertaining to the department\u2019s mission-critical assets,  including military equipment, real property, and general equipment. In  May 2010, the DOD Comptroller first issued the FIAR Guidance, which  provided the standard methodology for the components to implement the  FIAR Plan. According to DOD, the components\u2019 successful  implementation of this methodology is essential to the department\u2019s ability  to achieve full financial statement auditability.", "In October 2011, the Secretary of Defense directed the department to  achieve audit readiness for its SBR for general fund accounts by the end  of fiscal year 2014, and the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2012 required that the  next FIAR Plan update include a plan to support this goal. Further, the  NDAA for Fiscal Year 2013 made the 2014 target for SBR auditability an  ongoing component of the FIAR Plan by amending the NDAA for Fiscal  Year 2010 such that it now explicitly refers to describing the actions and  costs associated with validating as audit ready both DOD\u2019s SBR by the  end of fiscal year 2014 and DOD\u2019s complete set of financial statements  by the end of fiscal year 2017.", "In response to component difficulties in preparing for a full SBR audit, the  November 2012 FIAR Plan Status Report and the March 2013 FIAR  Guidance included a revision to narrow the scope of initial audits to only  current-year budget activity and expenditures on a Schedule of Budgetary  Activity. Under this approach, beginning in fiscal year 2015, reporting  entities are to undergo an examination of their Schedules of Budgetary  Activity reflecting the amount of SBR balances and associated activity  related only to funding approved on or after October 1, 2014. As a result,  the Schedules of Budgetary Activity will exclude unobligated and  unexpended amounts carried over from prior years\u2019 funding as well as  information on the status and use of such funding in subsequent years  (e.g., obligations incurred and outlays). These amounts will remain  unaudited. Over the ensuing years, as the unaudited portion of SBR  balances and activity related to this funding decline, the audited portion is  expected to increase. However, the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2010, as  amended by the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2013, requires that the FIAR Plan  describe specific actions to be taken and the costs associated with  ensuring that DOD\u2019s SBR is validated as ready for audit by not later than  September 30, 2014. We have reported that because the audit of the  Schedule of Budgetary Activity is an incremental step building toward an  audit-ready SBR, the FIAR Plan does not presently comply with this  requirement. Furthermore, all material amounts reported on the SBR will  need to be auditable in order to achieve the mandated goal of full  financial statement audit readiness by September 30, 2017. It is not clear  how this can be accomplished if activity related to funding provided prior  to October 1, 2014, remains unaudited.", "DOD defines an assessable unit as any part of the financial statements, such as a line  item or a class of assets, a class of transactions, or a process or a system, that helps  produce the financial statements. generally accepted accounting principles. We found that while DOD has  made progress toward financial audit readiness, according to DOD\u2019s  November 2013 FIAR Plan Status Report, milestone dates for the Navy  have slipped and SBR milestone dates for the Army and defense  agencies have been compressed, making it questionable whether  corrective actions for these DOD components will be completed by  September 2014 for all assessable units. Further, the Air Force has  revised its milestone dates for achieving SBR audit readiness to the third  quarter of fiscal year 2015. With a reported $187.8 billion in fiscal year  2013 General Fund budgetary resources, the Air Force is material to  DOD\u2019s SBR, and if the Air Force cannot meet DOD\u2019s September 2014  SBR audit readiness goal, DOD will not be able to meet its goal. This in  turn raises substantial concerns about DOD\u2019s ability to undergo an audit  on a full set of financial statements for fiscal year 2018.", "In addition, our recent reports have identified several major challenges to  DOD\u2019s ability to successfully implement the FIAR Plan and meet its audit  readiness goals. The following discussion summarizes these challenges.", "Process for identifying and mitigating risks to the FIAR effort. In  August 2013, we reported that DOD\u2019s FIAR effort would benefit from a  risk management strategy to help program managers and stakeholders  make decisions about assessing risk, allocating resources, and taking  actions under conditions of uncertainty.six department-wide risks to the FIAR Plan\u2019s implementation: (1) lack of  DOD-wide commitment, (2) insufficient accountability, (3) poorly defined  scope and requirements, (4) unqualified or inexperienced personnel, (5)  insufficient funding, and (6) information systems control weaknesses.  DOD officials stated that risks are discussed on an ongoing basis during  various FIAR oversight committee meetings; however, the risks DOD  initially identified were not comprehensive, and DOD provided no  evidence of efforts to identify additional risks. Further, we found little  evidence that DOD analyzed risks it identified to assess their magnitude  or that DOD developed adequate plans for mitigating the risks. DOD\u2019s risk  mitigation plans, published in its FIAR Plan Status Reports, consisted of  brief, high-level summaries that did not include critical management  information, such as specific and detailed plans for implementation,   In January 2012, DOD identified  assignment of responsibility, milestones, or resource needs. In addition,  information about DOD\u2019s mitigation efforts was not sufficient for DOD to  monitor the extent of progress in mitigating identified risks. We concluded  that without effective risk management at the department-wide level to  help ensure the success of the FIAR Plan implementation, DOD is at  increased risk of not achieving its audit readiness goals. We  recommended that the department design and implement department- level policies and detailed procedures for FIAR Plan risk management  that incorporate the five guiding principles for effective risk management.  DOD acknowledged that it does not have a risk management program  that is specifically related to its FIAR effort and cited planned actions that  if effectively and efficiently implemented, would address some aspects of  the five guiding principles of risk management that are the basis for our  recommendations. We are continuing to monitor DOD\u2019s actions on our  recommendation.", "Component implementation of the FIAR Guidance. The FIAR  Guidance provides a methodology for DOD components to use in  developing and implementing their Financial Improvement Plans (FIP).  The guidance details the roles and responsibilities of the DOD  components, and prescribes a standard, systematic process for  assessing processes, controls, and systems. DOD\u2019s ability to achieve  department-wide audit readiness greatly depends on its military  components\u2019 ability to effectively develop and implement FIPs in  compliance with the FIAR Guidance. However, we have reported on  concerns with the department\u2019s efforts to implement this methodology.  For example, our review of the Navy\u2019s civilian pay and Air Force\u2019s military  equipment audit readiness efforts identified significant deficiencies in the  components\u2019 execution of the FIAR Guidance, resulting in insufficient  testing and unsupported conclusions. We recommended that DOD take  various actions to improve the development, implementation,  documentation, and oversight of DOD\u2019s financial management  improvement efforts. DOD generally concurred with recommendations  and noted actions being taken to implement them. We are continuing to  monitor Navy and Air Force audit readiness actions.", "In reviews of other DOD components, we also found internal control  weaknesses in DOD\u2019s procedures for maintaining accountability for  billions of dollars in funds and other resources. For example, the Army  and DFAS could not readily identify the full population of payroll accounts  associated with the Army\u2019s $46 billion active duty military payroll because  of deficiencies in existing procedures and nonintegrated personnel and  payroll systems. We recommended that the Army identify documents  needed to support military payroll transactions affecting the pay of  millions of active duty Army military personnel and that it develop and  implement procedures for maintaining those documents. As a first step,  the Army has developed a matrix of supporting documents for its military  pay. However, the Army has not yet completed action to populate a  central repository with these records.", "Preliminary results from our ongoing work to assess the Army\u2019s progress  in implementing its FIP for budget execution to help guide its SBR  readiness efforts indicate that the Army did not fully complete certain  tasks in accordance with the FIAR Guidance to ensure that its FIP  adequately considered the scope of efforts required for audit readiness.  For example, the Army did not consider the risks associated with  excluding prior year balances and current year activity associated with  legacy systems and did not adequately identify significant SBR activity  attributable to service-provider business processes and systems or obtain  sufficient information to assess their audit readiness. These activities may  continue to represent material portions of future SBRs, which if not  auditable, will likely affect the Army\u2019s ability to achieve audit readiness  goals as planned. Our review of the Army\u2019s monthly tests to assess the  effectiveness of selected budget execution controls show that the Army  identified extensive deficiencies, such as a lack of appropriate reviews or  approvals, and had an average failure rate of 56 percent for control tests  from June 2012 through May 2013, the period covered by our review.  Further, the Army\u2019s corrective actions were not linked to specific  corrective action plans to address the causes of identified deficiencies.  The deficiencies and gaps we have identified in our preliminary findings  throughout various phases of the Army\u2019s SBR audit readiness efforts  demonstrate a focus on meeting scheduled milestone dates and asserting  audit readiness instead of completing actions to resolve extensive control  deficiencies.", "Further, the military services rely heavily on DOD\u2019s internal service  providers to perform a variety of accounting, personnel, logistics, and  system operations. For example, DFAS performs accounting and  disbursement functions for the military services and defense agencies.  The FIAR Guidance requires the service providers to have their control  activities and supporting documentation examined by the DOD IG or an  independent auditor in accordance with Statement on Standards for  Attestation Engagements (SSAE) No.16 so that components have a basis  for relying on the service provider\u2019s data for their financial statement  audits. In August 2013, we reported that DOD did not have an effective  process for identifying audit-readiness risks, including risks associated  with its reliance on service providers for much of its components\u2019 financial  data, and it needed better department-wide documentation retention  policies. We identified two DOD component agencies\u2014the Navy and  the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA)\u2014that had established practices  consistent with risk management guiding principles. Because effective  service-provider controls are critical to ensuring improvements in DOD  funds control, we recommended that DOD consider and incorporate, as  appropriate, Navy and DLA practices in department-level policies and  procedures. DOD agreed with our recommendation and is taking actions  to address it.", "DOD has identified contract pay as a key element of its SBR. DFAS, the  service provider responsible for disbursing nearly $200 billion annually in  the department\u2019s contract pay, has asserted that its processes, systems,  and controls over contract pay are suitably designed and operating  effectively to undergo an audit. Preliminary results from our ongoing  assessment of DFAS\u2019s implementation of its FIP for contract pay audit  readiness indicate that DFAS has numerous deficiencies that have not  yet been remediated. For example, DFAS did not adequately perform  certain planning activities, such as assessing dollar activity and risk  factors of its processes, systems, and controls, which resulted in the  exclusion of three key processes from the FIP, such as the reconciliation  of its contract pay data to components\u2019 general ledgers. As a result,  DFAS did not obtain sufficient assurance that the contract disbursements  it processed were accurately recorded and maintained in the components\u2019  general ledgers and that the status of DOD\u2019s contract obligations was up- to-date. Although DFAS has asserted audit readiness for contract pay,  until it corrects the weaknesses we identified, its ability to process, record,  and maintain accurate and reliable contract pay transaction data is  questionable. Therefore, our preliminary results indicate that DFAS does  not have assurance that its FIP will satisfy the needs of DOD components  or provide the expected benefits to department-wide efforts to assert audit  readiness for contract pay as a key element of the SBR."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Modern Business Information Systems", "paragraphs": ["In May 2014, we reported that DOD continued efforts to improve its  business enterprise architecture (BEA)\u2014a modernization blueprint\u2014and  transition plan and modernize its business systems and processes,  consistent with key statutory provisions. However, we found that even  though DOD has spent more than 10 years and at least $379 million on  the architecture, DOD has not yet demonstrated that the BEA has  produced business value for the department. For example, while DOD  has established a tool that can assist in identifying potential duplication  and overlap among business systems, the department has not  demonstrated that it has used this information to reduce duplication and  overlap. Accordingly, we recommended that the department develop  guidance requiring military departments and other defense organizations  to use existing BEA content to more proactively identify potential  duplication and overlap. DOD agreed with our recommendation.  Collectively, the limitations described in our May 2014 report put the  billions of dollars spent annually on approximately 2,100 business system  investments that support DOD functions at risk.", "Further, DOD has identified several, multifunctional ERP systems as  critical to its financial management improvement efforts. In a 2012 report  on four of these ERPs, we found deficiencies in areas such as data  quality, data conversion, system interfaces, and training that affect their  capability to perform essential business functions. DFAS personnel also  reported difficulty in using the systems to perform day-to-day activities.  We recommended that DOD ensure that (1) any future system  deficiencies identified through independent assessments are resolved or  mitigated prior to further deployment of the systems, (2) timelines are  established and monitored for those issues identified by DFAS that are  affecting their efficient and effective use, and (3) training on actual job  processes are provided in a manner that allows users to understand how  the new processes support their job responsibilities and the work they are  expected to perform.recommendation, stating that based on the nature of an identified system  deficiency, it will determine whether to defer system implementation until  it is corrected. DOD agreed with our recommendations to establish and  monitor timelines and provide training on user roles and responsibilities.  We are continuing to monitor DOD\u2019s actions.", "DOD partially concurred with our first  If these business systems do not provide the intended capabilities on  schedule, DOD\u2019s goal of establishing effective financial management  operations and becoming audit ready could be jeopardized. We recently  reported that the Air Force did not meet best practices in developing a  schedule for the Defense Enterprise Accounting and Management  System (DEAMS) program. We believe that this raises questions about the credibility of the deadline for acquiring and implementing DEAMS to  provide needed functionality for financial improvement and audit  readiness. We recommended that the Air Force update the cost estimate  as necessary after implementing our prior recommendation to adopt  scheduling best practices. DOD concurred with our recommendation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Competent Financial Management Workforce", "paragraphs": ["A key principle for effective workforce planning is that an agency needs to  define the critical skills and competencies that it will require in the future  to meet its strategic program goals. Once an agency has identified critical  skills and competencies, it can develop strategies to address gaps in the  number of personnel, needed skills and competencies, and deployment of  the workforce.", "In April 2014, we reported that DOD is addressing financial  management workforce competencies and training through  complementary efforts by (1) the Office of the Under Secretary of  Defense for Personnel and Readiness (Personnel and Readiness) to  develop a strategic civilian workforce plan that includes financial  management, pursuant to requirements in the NDAA for Fiscal Year  2010, as amended, and (2) the DOD Comptroller to develop and  implement a Financial Management Certification Program, pursuant to  requirements in the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2012. Financial management  personnel are expected to possess the competencies that are relevant to  and needed for their assigned positions. These competencies include  fundamentals of accounting, accounting analysis, budget execution,  financial reporting, and audit planning and management, among others.  Personnel and Readiness is currently working on a competency  assessment tool that will be used by the department, including the  financial management functional community. The tool is to capture  information related to competencies, such as proficiency level,  importance, and criticality, and to identify any gaps in support of the  Comptroller\u2019s Financial Management Certification Program. Phased  implementation of the program began in June 2013, and the current  target date for full implementation is the end of fiscal year 2014. The  certification program is to be mandatory for DOD\u2019s approximately 54,000  civilian and military financial management personnel and may take up to  2 years to complete, depending on the extent to which an individual\u2019s  prior course work and level of experience to meet the new certification  requirements. In April 14, 2014, the Deputy CFO stated that the newly  implemented Financial Management Certification Program has already  enrolled 22,300 financial managers and certified over 30.", "Without a competent workforce and effective implementation of financial  management processes, systems, and controls, DOD and its components  are at risk that DOD\u2019s other financial management reform activities will  not be successful, resulting in incomplete and unreliable data for decision  making. To the extent that these challenges are not addressed, DOD  financial management will continue to be at high risk for waste, fraud,  abuse, and mismanagement.", "In conclusion, while DOD has several financial management improvement  efforts under way and is monitoring progress against milestones, as the  dates for validating audit readiness approach, DOD has emphasized  asserting audit readiness by a certain date over making sure that effective  processes, systems, and controls are in place to ensure that its  components have improved financial management information for day-to- day decision making. However, several significant factors\u2014including  DOD component milestone slippages in meeting audit readiness dates;  continuing, uncorrected DOD-wide financial management weaknesses;  and inadequate risk management efforts\u2014make it increasingly unlikely  that DOD\u2019s SBR will be audit ready by September 2014. While  establishing and working toward milestones are important to measure  progress, DOD should not lose sight of the ultimate goal of implementing  lasting financial management reform to ensure that it has the systems,  processes, and personnel to routinely generate reliable financial  management and other information critical to decision making and  effective operations for achieving its missions.
