For example, while 73 percent of agencies did not meet timeliness objectives for initial clearances for three of four quarters in fiscal year 2012, 98 percent of agencies did not meet these objectives in fiscal year 2016. The DNI has not developed a government-wide plan, including goals and milestones, to help agencies improve timeliness. Agencies' challenges in meeting timeliness objectives have contributed to a significant backlog of background investigations at the agency that is responsible for conducting the majority of investigations, the National Background Investigations Bureau (NBIB). NBIB documentation shows that the backlog of pending investigations increased from about 190,000 in August 2014 to more than 710,000 as of February 2018, as shown below.

The government-wide personnel security  clearance process was designated as a high-risk area in January 2018  because it represents one of the highest management risks in  government. A high-quality personnel security process is necessary to  minimize the risks of unauthorized disclosures of classified information  and to help ensure that information about individuals with criminal  histories or other questionable behavior is identified and assessed. In  2014, emphasis on security clearance reform was renewed following  high-profile events such as the September 2013 shooting at the  Washington Navy Yard by an individual who had both access to the  facility and a security clearance. In November and December 2017, we  reported, among other things, that the executive branch faces challenges  completing key reform efforts, processing security clearances, and  reducing a significant backlog in background investigations.", "In January 2018, in light of the serious challenges facing the interagency  Security, Suitability, and Credentialing Performance Accountability  Council (PAC), the entity responsible for driving the implementation of  and overseeing the reform efforts, we placed the government-wide  personnel security clearance process on GAO\u2019s High-Risk List. We made  this designation out-of-cycle because it was important to call attention to  these challenges now. My testimony today focuses on three of the key  challenges that led to the high-risk designation, including: (1) the extent to  which executive branch agencies made progress reforming the security  clearance process; (2) the extent to which executive branch agencies are  meeting timeliness objectives and reducing the National Background  Investigations Bureau\u2019s (NBIB) investigative backlog; and (3) the potential  effects of continuous evaluation\u2014a process to review the background of  clearance holders and individuals in sensitive positions at any time during  the eligibility period\u2014on executive branch agencies.", "My testimony is primarily based on our November and December reports  on these topics. For those reports, we reviewed relevant statutes,  Executive Orders, and PAC strategic documents; obtained data from the  Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) on the timeliness of  initial personnel security clearances and periodic reinvestigations for  fiscal years 2012 through 2016 for specific executive branch agencies;  and interviewed PAC, Office of Personnel Management (OPM), NBIB,  ODNI, and Department of Defense (DOD) officials. Our November and  December 2017 reports include a detailed explanation of our scope and  methodology. In these reports, we made 12 recommendations to the  Director of National Intelligence and the Director of NBIB, some of which I  will discuss today. NBIB concurred with the recommendations. The  Director of National Intelligence concurred with some, but not all, of our  recommendations. We continue to believe these recommendations are  valid.

Actions in response to these  recommendations included ODNI and OPM jointly issuing Quality  Assessment Standards in January 2015, which establish federal  guidelines for assessing the quality of investigations. Additionally, ODNI  developed the Quality Assessment Reporting Tool, through which  agencies will report on the completeness of investigations.", "Similarly, the PAC reported quarterly on the status and progress of key  initiatives, as part of the Insider Threat and Security Clearance Reform  cross-agency priority goal. This reporting included the milestone due  date and status for each initiative. According to PAC Program  Management Office officials, although the data are no longer publicly  reported, they have continued to track the status of these milestones  internally, and identified almost half of the initiatives\u201416 of 33\u2014as  complete as of the third quarter of fiscal year 2017.", "Additionally, the PAC has issued three documents that serve as its  updated strategic framework for the next 5 years.

In October 2016, it issued an updated PAC  Enterprise IT Strategy, which provides the technical direction to provide  mission-capable and secure security, suitability, and credentialing IT  systems. According to PAC program management officials, the third  document\u2014PAC Strategic Intent and Enterprise IT Strategy  Implementation Plan\u2014was distributed to executive branch agencies in  February 2017.

Continuous evaluation  is a process to review the background of an individual who has been  determined to be eligible for access to classified information or to hold a  sensitive position at any time during the period of eligibility. Continuous  evaluation involves automated record checks conducted on a more  frequent basis, whereas periodic reinvestigations are conducted less  frequently and may include, among other things, subject and reference  interviews. The types of records checked as part of continuous evaluation  are the same as those checked for other personnel security purposes.  Security-relevant information discovered in the course of continuous  evaluation is to be investigated and adjudicated under the existing  standards.", "Efforts to implement an executive branch continuous evaluation program  go back to at least 2008, with a milestone for full implementation by the  fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010. In November 2017, we reported that  while ODNI has taken an initial step to implement continuous evaluation  in a phased approach across the executive branch, it had not determined  when the future phases of implementation will occur. We recommended,  among other things, that the Director of National Intelligence develop an  implementation plan. ODNI generally concurred with that  recommendation.", "Regarding government-wide measures for the quality of background  investigations, as noted earlier, ODNI and OPM issued the Quality  Assessment Standards and ODNI issued the Quality Assessment  Reporting Tool. The Quality Assessment Standards established federal  guidelines for assessing the quality of investigations. The Quality  Assessment Reporting Tool is a tool through which agencies will report  on the completeness of investigations. However, measures for quality  have not been developed, and it is unclear when this key effort will be  completed. The original milestone for completing government-wide  measures was fiscal year 2010, and no new milestone has been  established. In our December 2017 report, we recommended that the  Director of National Intelligence, in his capacity as the Security Executive  Agent, and in coordination with the other PAC Principals, establish a  milestone for the completion of government-wide performance measures  for the quality of investigations. ODNI disagreed with the  recommendation, stating that it is premature to establish such a milestone  and that it will do so once the Quality Assessment Reporting Tool metrics  have been fully analyzed. We continue to believe that setting a milestone,  which takes into consideration the amount of time needed to analyze  Quality Assessment Reporting Tool data, will help to ensure that the  analysis of the data is completed, initial performance measures are  developed, and agencies have a greater understanding of what they are  being measured against."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agencies Meeting Timeliness Objectives for Clearances Decreased, and a Government-Wide Approach Has Not Been Developed to Improve Timeliness or Address the Backlog", "paragraphs": ["Our analysis of government-wide and agency-specific data shows a  decline in the number of executive branch agencies meeting the  timeliness objectives for processing clearances.

The objective includes  no longer than 40 days to complete the investigative phase and 20 days  to complete the adjudicative phase.
