To receive benefits, UI claimants  generally must be able to work, be available to work, and seek work  actively. Claimants may access reemployment services from the public  workforce system\u2014a network of federal, state, and local partners that  administer and carry out an array of federal employment and training  programs\u2014to help them return to work. These reemployment services,  such as job search assistance and career counseling, are available at  one-stop centers, also known as American Job Centers.

Many claimants now apply for UI benefits remotely,  and may not visit one-stop centers to obtain reemployment services.", "Policymakers have encouraged states to strengthen the connection  between the UI program and the public workforce system in a number of  ways. For instance, the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act  (WIOA) requires local workforce development boards to include in their  plans strategies for strengthening linkages between the UI program and  one-stop centers. In 2018, Congress also authorized up to approximately  $3.9 billion in funding over the next 10 years for the Reemployment  Services and Eligibility Assessment (RESEA) grant program.  Participating states use a profiling system to identify UI claimants who are  most likely to exhaust their benefits, meaning that they receive benefits  for the maximum time period for which the state pays benefits. The state  then selects these claimants, as well as certain military veterans, to  receive services offered through the program. These services include a  one-stop center orientation and meeting with a caseworker, who  assesses each claimant\u2019s eligibility for UI benefits and helps the claimant  develop an individualized reemployment plan, among other things.", "You asked us to review how states leverage resources from the public  workforce system to meet UI claimants\u2019 reemployment needs.

Using information from these sources, we selected  six states cited in research or by stakeholders as having at least one  noteworthy reemployment practice, such as an effective or well-designed  reemployment program or commitment to using technology to improve  service delivery, as well as other features of interest, such as use of state  funds to help provide reemployment services. We visited four states  (Massachusetts, Nebraska, Nevada, and Utah), where we interviewed  state and local workforce officials, and had phone interviews with state  workforce agency officials in two states (Texas and Wisconsin). Our  selected states provided illustrative examples of the approaches they take  to meet the reemployment needs of UI claimants; these examples are not  representative of state practices nationwide.", "Second, to describe how often UI claimants receive services through key  federally funded workforce programs, we interviewed DOL officials to  identify which programs states typically use to serve UI claimants, and  analyzed national data on UI claimant participation in those programs\u2014 the DOL-administered Wagner-Peyser Employment Service, RESEA, the  WIOA Adult program, and the WIOA Dislocated Worker program\u2014for  program year 2015 (July 2015 through June 2016), the most recent year  available at the time of our review.

We  found the data sufficiently reliable to describe how many UI claimants  states report serving through key federally funded workforce programs,  and have included caveats regarding differences in state reporting  practices and other limitations, as appropriate. To describe how states  fund reemployment services for UI claimants, we analyzed summary  reemployment program expenditure data provided by five of the six  selected states for state fiscal year 2017, the most recent year available  at the time of our review.

During fiscal year 2017, 49 states and the District of Columbia  participated in RESEA, and DOL made $115 million in grant funds  available through the program. In February 2018, legislation was  enacted that established RESEA as a formula grant program with  incentive payments for states meeting or exceeding outcome goals, and  authorized up to approximately $3.9 billion in funding for the program  through fiscal year 2027. In July 2018, DOL announced that it was  developing an implementation plan for the new RESEA program  provisions, and would provide details on this plan in the coming months.", "RESEA aims to link UI claimants to the public workforce system, address  their individual reemployment needs, and help states prevent and detect  improper payments by conducting UI eligibility reviews. Once a UI  claimant is selected for RESEA, the claimant is required to attend a one- stop orientation and meet one-on-one with a caseworker, who conducts a UI eligibility assessment, helps the claimant develop an individualized  reemployment plan, and provides or refers the claimant to other  reemployment services, as appropriate (see fig. 1).

Officials from Wisconsin, for example, said claimants who are not  selected for the state\u2019s RESEA program are considered job ready and  typically do not need in-person services. In addition to prioritizing  claimants who are most likely to exhaust their benefits, our sixth selected  state, Nevada, randomly selects additional claimants to participate in a  state-funded reemployment program that is similar to the state\u2019s RESEA  program.

Officials in two  states said their state strongly encourages the use of online services. For  example, officials in Utah said all UI claimants are required to fill out an  online needs assessment when filing a claim, and based on their  responses, are required to complete up to five additional online  workshops. These officials said leveraging online self-service options  helps UI claimants adapt to using technology in the workplace and helps  the state preserve limited financial resources (see text box). Similarly,  officials in Wisconsin said claimants are required to complete an online  needs assessment and orientation, and claimants can access various  online workshops to address identified service needs. These officials  believe this emphasis on online services will help claimants become more  self-sufficient and in control of their job search.", "State Spotlight: Online Services  Officials in Utah described the one-stop center\u2019s motto as \u201cself-directed.\u201d One-stop  center staff encourage customers to access services independently through the  state\u2019s online portal in the computer lab so that they feel empowered to use online  services at home.", "In contrast, officials in three other selected states emphasized the  benefits of in-person service provision. In Nebraska, officials said in- person meetings help one-stop center staff observe a claimant\u2019s potential  employment barriers that might otherwise be hard to identify. Officials  provided an example of a claimant who seemed well-positioned on paper  to obtain employment, but in person clearly lacked good interviewing  skills, prompting the caseworker to refer the claimant to additional  interviewing support. In Texas, officials said in-person service provision,  where possible, also helps promote program integrity as it enables  caseworkers to more easily set the expectation that claimants must  search for work to qualify for UI benefits. Additionally, officials in Nevada  said establishing a personal connection with claimants can help one-stop  staff encourage those struggling with the experience of applying for  dozens of jobs online without receiving any feedback from prospective  employers (see text box).", "Officials in the six selected states also described varying approaches in  the extent to which they provide reemployment services in group settings  or on an individual basis. In RESEA guidance, DOL has encouraged the  use of group services as a way to enhance efficiency, and officials in four  selected states said they conduct group orientations through their primary  reemployment programs. For example, in Massachusetts, officials said  that all UI claimants attend a group Career Center Seminar, where one- stop center staff provide an overview of available reemployment services  and local labor market conditions, and UI claimants complete a needs  assessment and career action plan. In Nebraska, a caseworker said the  use of group orientations is a strength of the state\u2019s program because it  provides an opportunity for claimants to discuss shared challenges and  network with each other. In contrast, Nevada provides all services  through its primary reemployment program individually, which officials  said they believe is more effective than group service provision. Officials  said that during these individual meetings, caseworkers identify each  claimant\u2019s barriers to employment and assess whether the claimant  needs ongoing individual case management or if additional service  referrals would be appropriate."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Selected States Leverage Technology and Integrate Program Resources to Help Improve Services", "paragraphs": ["Officials from all six selected states said they use technology and  integrate resources from across federally funded workforce programs as  strategies that help enhance efficiency and improve UI claimant customer  experiences."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Leveraging Technology", "paragraphs": ["To help provide services more cost-effectively and enhance service  delivery capacity, officials in two selected states, Utah and Wisconsin,  said they invested resources into expanding the array of online self- service options available to UI claimants.

Similarly, officials in Wisconsin said the  state\u2019s enhanced self-service options are central to its strategy for  meeting current UI claimant needs and prepare the state for potential  increases in UI claimant demand in an economic downturn.", "Officials in five selected states said they have also used technology to  help make services more customer-friendly, including the four selected  states in which officials described improvements to their online job banks.", "One of these states, Nebraska, added a mobile job bank application that,  according to officials, has made it easier for UI claimants to use job bank  features on their mobile devices and allows them to search for postings  within a certain radius of their physical location. Nevada and Wisconsin  officials also described other investments in mobile technology. Nevada,  for instance, plans to implement a tool that will allow UI claimants to  communicate with caseworkers via text message, such as by sending a  picture of their first paystub to document that they found a job.  Additionally, Wisconsin implemented a self-scheduling feature for initial  RESEA meetings as part of broader upgrades to the state\u2019s UI and  workforce data systems.", "Officials in all six selected states said they use technology to help  caseworkers maximize their time. For example, officials in four states said  integrating their state UI and workforce data systems has enabled them to  automate some caseworker responsibilities. In Massachusetts and  Wisconsin, officials said data system integration allows caseworkers to  instantly transfer relevant information from the workforce data system to  the UI data system, enabling them, for instance, to automatically trigger  UI adjudication proceedings after a UI claimant fails to meet RESEA  requirements. Officials from Wisconsin, Massachusetts, and Utah said  their online self-scheduling features help save time that caseworkers  would otherwise spend scheduling and rescheduling missed  appointments. (See text box.) Officials in four selected states said they  also use technological tools to help caseworkers focus their time on  providing individualized services. For example, Nebraska developed a  series of orientation videos designed to deliver clear, standardized  information on job search requirements and available resources for  claimants.

State officials said they had not yet established  a performance assessment and updating process for the new system,  and that they would need to gather additional data and determine how to  address certain analytical challenges before doing so.", "Officials from a third state agency said they were using a statistical  profiling system that had not been updated in over 25 years, and had  asked DOL to help them develop a new statistical profiling system  because they lacked the expertise to do so themselves. In March 2017,  DOL provided the new system to the contractor that maintains the state\u2019s  UI data system and will be responsible for running the new system.  However, in June 2018, state officials told us they had delayed  implementing the new system until the state completed a UI  modernization project. Further, while state officials said they plan to keep  the system up-to-date once implemented, they acknowledged that they  do not have staff with the skills to do so, and will likely need continued  DOL support.", "For the three selected states that use non-statistical profiling systems,  state officials said that these systems generally require little effort to  maintain. Officials in two of these states reported using characteristic  screens, which sort claimants into two groups to identify and exempt from  service requirements those claimants who meet certain conditions, such  as being only temporarily unemployed or in an approved training  program. An official from each state said they aim to serve all non-exempt  claimants through their reemployment programs.", "The third state recently implemented a non-statistical claimant needs  assessment that replaced the state\u2019s outdated statistical profiling system,  which officials said had never been updated and was only used to comply  with the federal profiling requirement. With the new needs assessment,  claimant responses to questions such as, \u201cDo you have a resume?\u201d and  \u201cHow many job interviews have you had in the last month?\u201d are scored to  determine whether the claimant is job-ready or needs reemployment  services. (See text box.) Caseworkers can also use these responses to  make more effective service referrals during their appointments with  claimants. For instance, if a claimant reported not having a current  resume, a caseworker might refer the claimant to a resume workshop. In  addition, officials said that program administrators can easily adjust the  scoring and weights used in the assessment, and that they review it each  year for potential updates.", "Sample Alternative Non-Statistical Profiling System (Needs Assessment)  One selected state\u2019s claimant needs assessment scores claimant responses to a  questionnaire about job readiness to determine if claimants need reemployment  services.

DOL officials said that  they communicate with states about their profiling practices and gather  some profiling system information in the course of their periodic UI and  RESEA reviews. However, DOL technical staff do not review or  maintain this profiling system information for oversight purposes, and  DOL does not have a systematic method of tracking state profiling  practices across states. DOL officials said that they view their primary  role, related to profiling systems, as providing technical assistance;  however, by law, DOL is also responsible for ensuring that states\u2019  profiling systems meet federal requirements. Further, GAO  recommended in a 2007 report that DOL take a more active role in  ensuring profiling system accuracy, and federal internal control  standards state that agencies should obtain timely and relevant data to  conduct effective monitoring. Without such data, DOL\u2019s ability to  effectively oversee state profiling practices is limited.", "In addition, DOL provides technical assistance\u2014which can range from  answering specific questions to developing a new statistical profiling  system on a state\u2019s behalf\u2014to individual states only upon request, rather  than identifying and providing assistance to states at higher risk of poor  profiling system performance. This approach necessitates that states  recognize when they need technical assistance and request it. However,  states may not know that their profiling systems are performing poorly  and may not request needed technical assistance as a result. For  example, officials from four of our six selected states with statistical  systems told us that they do not currently have a process to assess their  systems\u2019 performance. As a result, these states may not be aware of  potential issues they may need to address to improve their system  performance. Additionally, officials responsible for maintaining another  selected state\u2019s profiling system had incorrectly identified the system  type. As a result, officials may have difficulty identifying problems and  seeking support.", "DOL has an opportunity to use its new UI state self-assessment to  systematically collect information that could inform its oversight of state  profiling practices and technical assistance efforts. This questionnaire,  which DOL designed to help states self-identify and correct UI system  weaknesses, covers 15 functional areas. Self-assessment questions in  one of these areas will collect some information on state profiling  systems, such as system type and date of last update. However, as  currently designed, the self-assessment will not solicit other information  that could help DOL identify states at risk of poor system performance.  For example, it does not ask whether states have experienced challenges  maintaining their systems (for instance, due to staff turnover), or how  states have assessed system performance. DOL officials told us regional  staff will review state responses to the self-assessment, the first of which  are due in March 2019, and which will be one piece of information used to  identify states that DOL might prioritize for general UI program oversight.", "While DOL officials said it would make sense to use the information  gathered to inform oversight of profiling systems as well, they did not  have specific plans about how they would do so. Federal internal control  standards state that agencies should identify, analyze, and respond to  risks. Without collecting more detailed and consistent profiling system  information and having a clearer plan for how to use it, DOL\u2019s ability to  conduct effective monitoring and respond to risks will continue to be  limited.

While the law does not specify a particular type of profiling system states  must use, DOL\u2019s only formal profiling guidance, issued in 1994, describes  only two state options: statistical systems and characteristic screens, a  type of non-statistical system. Further the guidance encourages states to  use statistical systems, which it asserts are more efficient and precise,  and easier to manage and adapt, than non-statistical systems. DOL  officials who provide technical assistance to states told us they also  encourage all states to use statistical profiling systems for the same  reasons. However, DOL officials acknowledged that, in practice, not all  statistical profiling systems predict benefits exhaustion well, particularly  outdated systems. The 2007 DOL-sponsored study similarly found that  some state profiling systems did not predict benefit exhaustion much  more accurately than random chance.", "Additionally, statistical profiling systems may be more difficult for some  states to develop and maintain than non-statistical systems. DOL officials  acknowledged that states with technical capacity issues, such as staffing  and data system limitations, may experience particular challenges.  Officials we spoke to in four of our six selected states with statistical  profiling systems told us that they have faced these challenges. In contrast, officials from all of our selected states with non-statistical  profiling systems said their systems are easy to maintain. Officials from  one state that uses a claimant needs assessment said this system also  provides useful information that caseworkers can review prior to one-on- one meetings with claimants.", "DOL officials told us they are supportive of state experimentation with  alternative profiling approaches. However, officials in our selected states  had differing perspectives on DOL\u2019s views on state flexibility and options  for pursuing experimentation. For example, an official in one state was  interested in making a change to the outcome variable that the state\u2019s  statistical system predicted, believing it could reduce UI program  expenditures. As a result, the state consulted with regional DOL staff  about the possible revision and made the change with DOL\u2019s support. In  contrast, an official in another state who wanted to make a similar change  to its statistical profiling system has not pursued the change or discussed  it with DOL officials because he believes such a change would not be  allowed.", "Further, some of our selected states differed in their understanding of  state flexibility to use the type of profiling system that works best for them.  For example, officials in one of our selected states said they are switching  to a statistical system after longstanding encouragement by DOL to do  so, even though a key official expressed concern that a statistical system  may not be useful, given the state\u2019s goal of providing services to all UI  claimants. In contrast, officials in another state said they had recently  replaced their outdated statistical profiling system with a claimant needs  assessment that differs from the options described in DOL\u2019s 1994  guidance, after requesting DOL review of their revised approach.", "The differences in states\u2019 perspectives on allowable options for profiling  systems may in part be due to the fact that DOL\u2019s current profiling  guidance is limited and outdated. The guidance was issued in 1994, and  it does not clearly reflect all of the options available to states, such as  using a different outcome variable in a statistical system, or implementing  an alternative type of non-statistical system to meet worker profiling  requirements. Further, while a key DOL official said they are open to  reviewing alternative state profiling approaches, they do not have a formal  process for doing so, nor does guidance address the option for DOL to  review alternative approaches. DOL officials said they believe the existing  guidance provides states relatively wide latitude in designing their  profiling systems and, as a result, they have not found the need to  change those guidelines. However, federal internal control standards  emphasize the importance of periodically reviewing policy for continued  relevance and effectiveness in achieving objectives. Without clearer,  more current policy information from DOL on profiling requirements and  available options, state officials may continue to have differing  understandings of what they can do, and states may not pursue  innovations that could improve their profiling systems, better suit their  technical capacity, and, ultimately, better target claimants for  reemployment services."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["With 5.7 million UI claimants receiving nearly $30 billion in unemployment  benefits in 2017, reemployment services have the potential to  substantially improve employment outcomes and conserve resources by  shortening UI claimants\u2019 periods of unemployment.

However,  DOL has not taken key steps to help states effectively identify and select  such claimants for the program. DOL has the opportunity to collect more  systematic information on state practices for profiling UI claimants  through its new UI state self-assessment, but the information it is planning  to collect is limited and may not enable DOL to identify states that are  having trouble identifying claimants in need of services. Further, DOL  does not have a process for how it can use information on state risks of  poor profiling system performance to guide its oversight and technical  assistance efforts, choosing largely to assist individual states only when  asked. Some states may not be equipped to identify weaknesses in their  profiling systems, and as a result may not request the assistance they  need. In addition, DOL encourages all states to use statistical profiling  systems despite acknowledging that some states\u2019 statistical systems,  particularly outdated ones, may not perform well in practice. Moreover, its  profiling guidance to states has not been updated since 1994, and may  not reflect the flexibility afforded states to pursue alternative profiling  options.
