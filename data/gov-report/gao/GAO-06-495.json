In attempting to purchase SSNs from 21 of the 53 resellers advertising the sale of such information, we received 1 full SSN, 4 truncated SSNs displaying only the first five digits, and no SSNs from the remaining 16. In one case, we also received additional unrequested personal information including truncated SSNs of the search subject's neighbors. We also found that some other entities truncate SSNs by displaying the last four digits. According to experts we spoke to, there are few federal laws and no specific industry standards on whether to display the first five or last four digits of the SSN, and SSA officials told us the agency does not have the authority to regulate how other public or private entities use SSNs, including how they are truncated. We could not determine if federal privacy laws were applicable to the Internet resellers because such laws depend on the type of entity and the source of information, and most of the resellers' Web sites did not include this information.

Four of the remaining resellers attempted to contact us to request legal  documentation to support a permissible purpose for obtaining the  information. However, since we attempted to purchase SSNs as a member  of the general public, we could not provide the requested information. One  of these resellers sent us an e-mail asking us to fax a signed letter stating  our reason for obtaining a person\u2019s SSN and a copy of our driver\u2019s license  to verify our identity, which we could not provide. We contacted the other  three to find out why prospective buyers were required to have a  permissible purpose. One reseller told us that the company is audited  every year by the government and that a legal document request was part  of its security screening of its customers. The other two stated that some  form of legal documentation, such as a certified copy of a court order, was  required in order for their companies to release the information.", "In addition to receiving one full and four truncated SSNs, we also received  other information related to our purchases. Given that we only received  SSNs as a part of packaged information, we were not surprised that we  received additional information about the person whose SSN we were  trying to obtain. For example, the two Internet resellers that provided  some form of SSN in a background check report also provided the  following information:  the person\u2019s current and previous addresses,    date of birth,    a list of other names associated with the person,    a list of their neighbors,   tax liens and judgments against the person, and    properties owned by the person.", "However, in one case we received unexpected and unrequested  information. In this case, we did not receive the SSN of the person whose  number we requested, but instead received the truncated SSNs of the  person\u2019s past and present neighbors, information we did not request.", "Five of the 21 resellers from whom we attempted to purchase SSNs did  provide us with some form of an SSN. We received one full nine-digit SSN  and four truncated SSNs. All five resellers that supplied an SSN provided  the SSN as a part of a package of information. As shown in table 6, the full  SSN was obtained as a part of a background check, and the four truncated  SSNs were provided as a part of a \u201cpeople locator\u201d package, a background  package, and an employment trace. We attempted to order SSNs from five  resellers that offered to sell the SSN alone, and we were unable to obtain  an SSN from those resellers.", "We also found a wide range of the costs for information services when we  tried to purchase SSNs. The packages of information we attempted to  purchase ranged from about $4 to $200 compared to the costs to purchase  individual SSNs that ranged from about $15 to $150. The range of costs  from the five resellers that provided some form of the SSN was about   $20 to $200. The Internet reseller that provided the full SSN did so for $95.", "Of the four resellers that gave us truncated SSNs, three of these disclosed  on their Web sites that they would provide full SSNs, but only under  certain circumstances. For example, one reseller said that, by law, it  cannot provide a person\u2019s SSN to any third party. Another required the  customer to have a legitimate reason for requesting the information under  laws such as GLBA. This reseller said it may not provide the full SSN if the  customer did not meet those requirements. None explained why they only  provided the first five digits.", "All resellers that provided truncated SSNs showed the first five digits and  masked the last four digits. We interviewed industry representatives and  privacy experts to determine if this way of truncating the SSN was the  standard practice among private sector entities. Industry representatives  and privacy experts told us that entities in other industries may truncate  the SSN differently from the truncated SSNs we bought from Internet  resellers. For example, consumer data industry representatives said that  members of their association decide for themselves how and when to  truncate SSNs. One consumer reporting agency we spoke to told us that it  truncates the SSN by masking the first five digits on reports it provides  directly to consumers, by displaying only the last four digits. Some privacy  experts said that certain entities that use SSNs as identifiers on lists, such  as universities, also truncate the number by masking the first five digits. In  addition, SSA also masks the first five digits of the SSN on the Social  Security Statements mailed to individuals over the age of 25 who have an  SSN and have wages or earnings from self\u2013employment.", "On the basis of our discussions with government officials and industry  representatives, we could not identify any industry standards or guidelines  for truncating SSNs. None of the officials we spoke to knew for certain  why either method\u2014masking the first five digits or the last four digits\u2014 was used or how such methods came into use. In addition, when we asked  officials which way of truncating the SSN better protects it from misuse,  there was no consensus among them, and no one knew of any research  regarding this issue. Some officials said that although truncation could  provide some protection for SSNs, it is unlikely to be foolproof. There are  also few, if any, federal laws that require or regulate truncating the SSN.  Currently, FCRA has a specific provision relating to truncating SSNs.  Under this law consumers can request that their SSN be truncated to  display only the last four digits on any consumer report they request about  themselves. The Judicial Conference of the United States issued rules,  effective in December 2003, requiring that SSNs be truncated to mask the  first five digits in newly filed electronically available bankruptcy court  documents.", "Federal agency officials whom we spoke to said that Congress or SSA  should decide how SSNs should be truncated. The Social Security Act of  1935 authorized SSA to establish a record-keeping system to help manage  the Social Security program and resulted in the creation of the SSN.  Through a process known as enumeration, unique numbers are created for  every person as a work and retirement benefit record for the Social  Security program. According to SSA officials, the law does not address the  use of the number by private and public sector entities.

For example, FCRA applies primarily to a consumer reporting  agency, which is defined as any person which, for monetary fees, dues, or  on a cooperative nonprofit basis, regularly engages in whole or in part in  the practice of assembling or evaluating consumer credit information or  other information on consumers for the purpose of furnishing consumer  reports to third parties, and which uses any means or facility of interstate  commerce for the purpose of preparing or furnishing \u201cconsumer reports.\u201d  In addition, these laws allow for disclosure of personal information for  certain permissible purposes, and those who request or receive  information from an entity meeting those statutory definitions may also  have obligations under these laws. For example, FCRA generally prohibits  \u201cconsumer reporting agencies\u201d from furnishing \u201cconsumer reports\u201d to  third party users unless it is for a permissible purpose; before providing  \u201cconsumer report\u201d information to prospective users, however, the  prospective user must certify the purposes for which the information is  sought and that it will be used for no other purpose. GLBA and DPPA  also contain prohibitions against re-disclosure of personal information  covered by those laws.", "FCRA, GLBA, and DPPA could apply to Internet resellers that identify  themselves as one of the statutorily defined entities covered under the  laws\u2014which are consumer reporting agencies for FCRA, financial  institutions for GLBA, and state motor vehicle departments for DPPA\u2014or  that received information from such entities. We found four resellers that  identified themselves as one of the statutorily defined entities. Three  stated on their Web sites that they were consumer reporting agencies and  the other stated it was a credit bureau. However, we did not find similar  information on the remaining 150 resellers\u2019 Web sites to determine what  type of entity they were. In addition, we found that some resellers  identified the source of their information generally, but did not link  information sources to particular pieces of information. For example,  about 7 percent of the resellers identified \u201cDepartment of Motor Vehicle  records\u201d as the source of some of their information and offered to search  for personal information based on a driver\u2019s license number, license plate  number, or vehicle identification number. However, most did not specify  which personal information came from the \u201cDepartment of Motor Vehicle  records\u201d or any state motor vehicle departments.

As shown in figure 3, the  most frequently mentioned laws were FCRA, GLBA, and DPPA.", "We also found 5 out of the 154 Internet resellers referenced state laws on  their Web sites. Two stated adherence to the California Investigative  Consumer Reporting Act, which allows a consumer to review any files  concerning that consumer maintained by an \u201cinvestigative reporting  agency.\u201d One cited two California consumer laws. One law allows  California consumers to remove their names from credit bureau mailing  lists used for unsolicited pre-approved credit offers for a minimum of   2 years. It also provides identity theft victims and other consumers with  increased rights regarding consumer credit reports, including requiring the  deletion of inquiries resulting from identity theft. The other California law  prohibits consumer credit reporting agencies that furnish reports for  employment purposes from reporting information on the age, marital  status, race, color, or creed of any consumer and requires the user of the  report to provide written notice to the consumer. The law also requires  that the consumer be provided a free copy of the report upon request.

Our experiences indicate that it is more likely that a  buyer would not be able to purchase an SSN or would receive a truncated  version of an SSN from Internet resellers.", "However, our work does suggest that someone seeking an SSN may be  able to obtain a truncated SSN, and depending on the entity, the SSN may  be truncated in various ways. Standardizing the truncation of the SSN  could provide some protection from SSNs being misused. Under a  standardized approach, the same digits of the SSN would be the only  information transmitted, no matter the source from which the SSN is  obtained.

Our searches  resulted in 1,036 Web sites that we then reviewed to determine whether  they were live sites, redirected sites, or duplicate sites that were operated  by the same reseller. Nineteen percent of the 1,036 Web sites took us to  another Internet reseller Web site that was included in our list. Most of  these redirected sites took us to two Internet resellers that offered online  membership\u2014allowing access to their databases and affiliate programs,  which allowed others to link their Web sites to the resellers\u2019 Web sites.  More than one-half of the 1,036 Web sites were inactive at the time a GAO  analyst attempted to access the site. In addition, we found a few Web sites  were operated by the same reseller and were similar in appearance. As a  result, we ended up with a list of 226 sites that we included in our review.  We recognize that had we used different search engines, different  keywords, and a different point in time we may have identified a different  list of sites.", "To describe the types of readily identifiable Internet resellers that have  SSN-related services and characteristics of their businesses, we developed  a Web-based data collection instrument (DCI) for GAO analysts to  document selected information contained on the Internet resellers\u2019 Web  sites. We used the DCI to record information from the Web pages that  contained items that addressed the types of SSN-related services and  information that the resellers sold, the sources of the information, and the  types of clients to whom the site marketed. To ensure that the entry of the  DCI data conformed to GAO\u2019s data quality standards, each DCI was  reviewed by one of the other GAO analysts. Tabulations of the DCI items  were automatically generated from the Web-based DCI software.  Supplemental analyses were conducted using a statistical software  package. For these analyses, the computer programs were checked by a  second, independent analyst. Our analyses found   154 Internet resellers with SSN-related services.", "To determine the extent to which Internet resellers sell Social Security  numbers, we analyzed data collected from the review of Internet resellers  just described, attempted to purchase SSNs from a nonprobability sample  of Internet resellers, and collected data about the transactions. We used  information collected from the DCI to derive a nonprobability sample of  Internet resellers to purchase SSNs. The criteria we used to select the  resellers for our attempted purchases included the following (1) the Web  site advertised the sale of an SSN without the customer\u2019s having to provide  the SSN of the subject of our inquiry, (2) the Web site advertised the sale  of an SSN to the general public, and (3) the transaction could be made  online through the Internet reseller\u2019s Web site using a credit card. We  collected information about the purchases including cost, the information  that was required about the search subject and the purchaser (including  the permissible purpose), whether the site contacted us to verify our  information or our permissible purpose, and whether the SSN was  provided and, if it was, whether the full or a truncated SSN was provided.  In addition, we interviewed staff from the Federal Trade Commission,  officials from the Social Security Administration, one of the three national  consumer reporting agencies, the Consumer Data Industry Association   (an international trade association that represents consumer information  companies), and five privacy experts to obtain their views about the use of  SSN truncation as a means for safeguarding the number. We also reviewed  prior GAO work and performed literature and Internet searches about SSN  truncation.", "To determine the applicability of federal privacy laws to Internet resellers,  we reviewed federal laws and the resellers\u2019 Web sites for information  about the resellers\u2019 type of entity and sources of information. However, in  most instances these resellers did not have sufficient information on their  Web sites to determine if they were in compliance with these laws.  Specifically, we were unable to determine whether most of these resellers  met the definitions specified by these laws such as \u201cfinancial institution,\u201d  \u201cconsumer reporting agency,\u201d or an \u201cofficer, employee, or contractor\u201d of a  \u201cState Motor Vehicle Department.\u201d We also were unable to determine the  resellers\u2019 specific sources for particular pieces of information. Although  Internet resellers generally did not provide information about the entity  and sources of information, they generally cited, and we recorded,  whether they stated adherence to any federal privacy laws."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Social Security Administration", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact above, Tamara Cross, Assistant Director,  Margaret Armen, Patrick Bernard, Richard Burkard, Ellen Chu, John  Cooney, Benjamin Federlein, Evan Gilman, Richard Harada, Joel Marus,  Andrew O\u2019Connell, Stanley Stenersen, Jacquelyn Stewart, and Lacy Vong  made important contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
