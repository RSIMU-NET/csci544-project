However, GAO found that the agency overpaid the campaign committees at least an estimated $3.9 million when reimbursing them for special agents' seats on charter flights. Since at least 1977, the Secret Service's policy has been to pay the lower of two fares when reimbursing campaign committees for special agents' travel on chartered aircraft flights. Specifically, the Secret Service is to pay the lower of the following two fares: the lowest commercially available first-class airfare, or the pro rata fare\u2014the cost of the agent's seat on the charter flight calculated by taking the total cost of the charter divided by the number of passengers on board. However, during the 2016 presidential campaign, Secret Service officials misinterpreted a Federal Election Commission regulation, and as a result, did not conduct the comparison. Instead, the Secret Service solely paid the pro rata fare to the campaign committees. Eight months before the end of the 2016 presidential campaign, Secret Service officials determined the interpretation was erroneous, but did not ensure the agency reverted to its long standing policy.

We  analyzed the travel expenses incurred by the Secret Service for each of  the protected individuals (a total of 12) to determine the total expenses for  each campaign committee and for the 2016 presidential campaign as a  whole. Additionally,  we determined the amount of the total travel-related  expenses that were reimbursed to the campaign committees for special  agents\u2019 seats on aircraft chartered by the committees. We determined  that the expense data were sufficiently reliable after, among other things,  discussing with Secret Service officials how the data are entered and  maintained in the agency\u2019s financial systems, reviewing the data for  obvious errors and anomalies, and comparing the reimbursement data to  data campaign committees reported to the Federal Election Commission  (FEC).", "To determine the extent to which the Secret Service\u2019s payments and  reimbursements for travel-related protection expenses were made in  accordance with applicable laws, regulations, and policies, we analyzed  the Secret Service\u2019s lodging payments and charter aircraft  reimbursements to the campaign committees.

They also agreed that the Secret Service  should require the charter companies\u2019 invoices to verify that the campaign  committees are correctly charging the Secret Service for its share of the  total flight cost.", "Without updating its charter aircraft reimbursement policy, the Secret  Service does not have reasonable assurance that correct payments will  be made. These changes include: (1) assigning responsibility for verifying  that all calculations done by the campaign committees on behalf of the  protected individual  are accurate, (2) requiring a secondary review  process to confirm the accuracy of charter flight costs prior to making  payment, and (3) requiring that copies of charter companies\u2019 invoices be  provided to ensure that the reported pro rata costs are accurate prior to  reimbursement. In response to our finding, in February 2018 the Secret  Service began drafting an initial version of proposed policy changes,  consistent with its directive on revising policy. Specifically, Secret  Service officials started initial policy research and began reviewing and  drafting the policy, consistent with step two of their policy revision process  (see figure 4). However, several additional steps remain to be completed  before the planned changes are implemented.

As discussed earlier, Secret Service is to pay  the lower of two applicable fares (lowest available first-class fare, and the  pro rata fare) when reimbursing the campaign committees for special  agents\u2019 travel on chartered aircraft flights. The Secret Service obtains the  lowest available first-class airfare from its travel agency. LRC officials  initially told us that the Secret Service\u2019s travel agency had been including  taxes in the lowest available first-class airfare. However, after inquiring  with the travel agency, an LRC official learned that taxes had not been  included. After further discussion with us, Secret Service officials told us  that taxes should be included.", "Including taxes can make the difference between a first-class airfare  being less or more expensive than the pro rata fare for a charter flight,  therefore dictating which fare the Secret Service should reimburse the  protected individual  and campaign committee. For example, if a pro rata  fare costs $1,000, and the lowest available first-class airfare (without  taxes) is $950, then the lower fare is the first-class airfare. However, if the  lowest available first-class airfare (with taxes) is $1,050, then the lower  fare is the pro rata fare.", "The Secret Service\u2019s policy on reimbursement of special agents\u2019 seats on  chartered aircraft also lacks important details to ensure that its travel  agency can accurately identify the lowest available first-class airfares and  make accurate reimbursements. The policy requires the protected  individual to provide the Secret Service the 3-letter airport code for the  departure and arrival airports for each flight segment for which it is  seeking reimbursement. However, it does not specify that the 3-letter  airport code needs to be the International  Air Transport Association  (IATA) code and not the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) code.  Airports in different countries can have the same IATA  and FAA codes.  Providing the FAA code can result in the Secret Service\u2019s travel agency  identifying the wrong airport when determining the lowest first-class  airfare for a travel segment since the travel agency searches IATA codes.  For example, when we asked the Secret Service\u2019s travel agency to  research the lowest available first-class airfare for campaign travel  segments based on the reported destination codes in campaign  committee invoices the travel agency identified \u201cSGJ\u201d as Sagarai, Papua  New Guinea based on the IATA code. However, SGJ is the FAA code for  the Northeast Florida Regional Airport. Similarly, another reported  destination code in a campaign committee\u2019s invoice, LOM, is the FAA  code for Wings Field Airport, Pennsylvania and is also the IATA  code for Lagos de Moreno, Colombia. Since the travel agency searches on the  basis of IATA codes, using FAA codes that are designated as foreign  destinations in the IATA  system can result in confusion for the travel  agency when identifying the lowest available first-class airfare for a flight  segment.", "Secret Service officials told us that they had not considered specifying  whether the lowest first-class airfares should include taxes since the  Secret Service had been using the same representative at its travel  agency since 1986 to identify the lowest available first class fare. They  said they assumed that their representative knew the policy through  practice. Also, Secret Service officials told us that they were not aware of  the difference between IATA and FAA codes. Secret Service officials  agreed that the reimbursement policy should be revised to make it clear  that taxes are to be included when the Service\u2019s travel agency identifies  the lowest available first-class airfare when determining the correct  reimbursement amount, and that protected individuals are to provide the  IATA  code for airports.", "Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that  management should internally and externally communicate the necessary  information to achieve the entity\u2019s objectives and that effective information  and communication are vital for an entity to achieve its objectives. The  Secret Service could better ensure that its travel agency is able to identify  the lowest commercially available first-class airfare for comparison to the  pro rata fare by updating its charter aircraft reimbursement policy to  specify that (1) taxes are to be included in the lowest commercially  available first-class airfare, and (2) protected individuals\u2019 invoices include  the IATA  airport codes for arrival and departure airports. In response to  our finding, in February 2018 the Secret Service started to draft an initial  version of proposed changes to its charter aircraft reimbursement policy,  consistent with its directive on revising policy.

During the 2016 presidential campaign, for the trips we  reviewed, the Secret Service generally followed its internal policies and  federal regulations  governing payment for lodging costs incurred while  protecting candidates. However, due to an erroneous legal decision in  August 2015, the Secret Service did not follow its reimbursement policy  for chartered aircraft during the campaign. By not adhering to its policy,  the Secret Service overpaid campaign committees at least an estimated  $3.9 million dollars  for charter flights. Until the Secret Service determines  the amounts owed and how it will proceed with seeking repayment from  the various  campaign committees, these funds will not be recovered by  the federal government.", "Further, in making the erroneous legal decision in August 2015, the  Secret Service did not adhere to its directive on policy revisions. The  decision to effectively  change a policy was not fully vetted,  reviewed, or  communicated in accordance with the directive. This was largely  due to  the lack of a requirement to notify the directive control point when legal  decisions are made that can result in policy changes. This could result in  similar policy changes not being reviewed in the future.", "Finally,  presidential campaigns create a fast-paced operational  tempo at  the Secret Service, and according to agency officials, this tempo  contributed to their failure to comply with travel policies during the 2016  presidential campaign. Until Secret Service evaluates  the pressure  caused by this tempo and implements appropriate  mechanisms, it cannot  ensure that agency officials responsible for travel reimbursements are  complying with policy during presidential campaigns. In addition,  Secret  Service\u2019s charter aircraft reimbursement policy does not assign primary  and secondary reviews of invoices  provided by campaign committees.  The policy also does not require that campaign committees and the  agency\u2019s travel agency provide  all the information necessary to verify the  accuracy of the invoices.

Specifically, our objectives were to examine the following questions:  (1) How much did the Secret Service incur in transportation, lodging, and  other travel-related expenses when providing protection during the  2016 presidential campaign?  (2) To what extent did the Secret Service reasonably assure that  payments and reimbursements for travel-related protection expenses  were made in accordance with applicable laws, regulations, and  policies during the 2016 presidential campaign?", "To determine how much the Secret Service incurred in travel-related  expenses, we obtained expense data from the Secret Service for each of  the individuals protected for the 2016 presidential campaign. In total, the  Secret Service protected 12 individuals associated with 4 campaign  committees (see table 1 below).", "We analyzed the travel expenses for each of these protected individuals  to determine the total travel expenses incurred by the Secret Service for  each campaign committee and for the 2016 presidential campaign as a  whole. Travel expenses include those captured by the Secret Service  under object class 21\u2014travel and transportation of persons. Object class  21 expenses include airfare, vehicle rentals, hotel rooms, meals and  incidental expenses, and baggage charges for special agents  accompanying protected individuals. Additionally,  we determined the  amount of the total travel-related expenses that were reimbursements to  the campaign committees\u2014all of which were for special agents\u2019 seats on  campaign chartered aircraft.", "To assess the reliability  of the Secret Service\u2019s expense data, we  discussed with the Secret Service officials how the data are entered and  maintained in the Secret Service\u2019s official financial system of record\u2014 Travel Manager, Oracle, PRISM, Sunflower system\u2014which is used to  track operating and travel expenses, among other things. We also  reviewed the data for any obvious errors and anomalies. We compared  the data to the invoices the Secret Service received from the campaign  committees seeking reimbursements in order to verify the amounts the  campaigns were reimbursed. Further, we compared the Secret Service\u2019s  reimbursement data to data the campaign committees reported to the  Federal Election Commission (FEC) on payments they received from the  Secret Service. As a result, we determined that the expense data were  sufficiently reliable for reporting the Secret Service\u2019s total travel  expenses, expenses broken out by campaign committee and protected  individual, and the portion of expenses that were reimbursements to the  committees.", "To determine the number of travel stops made by the campaign  committees for which the Secret Service provided protection, we used  data from the Secret Service\u2019s Agent Manpower Protection System. To  assess the reliability of these data, we reviewed responses provided by  the Secret Service on how the data are entered and maintained in the  system. We further matched a sample of the travel stops data to hotel  bills for those stops. As a result, we determined that the data on travel  stops were sufficiently reliable for reporting the total number of travel  stops made during the campaign and number of stops per campaign  committee.", "To determine whether the campaign committees charged the Secret  Service appropriate rates for the use of candidate-owned assets, we tried  to identify whether any portion of the Secret Service\u2019s reimbursements to  the campaign committees were for the use of candidate-owned assets.  Candidates flew on various types of charter aircraft, including jets and  helicopters. Pursuant to law and FEC regulations, campaign committees  must report and maintain certain information regarding the use of these  aircraft. However, this information was not sufficient for us to determine  whether aircraft for which the Secret Service provided reimbursement  were owned by candidates. Further, the Secret Service does not collect  information about a campaign\u2019s use of candidate-owned assets, including  aircraft. We contacted all four campaign committees using various  methods, including email, phone, and in-person visits to identify  reimbursements received for candidate-owned assets, but none of the  committees responded to our questions. As a result, we were unable to  determine whether any portion of the Secret Service\u2019s reimbursements  were for the use of candidate-owned assets.", "To determine the extent to which the Secret Service\u2019s payments and  reimbursements for travel-related protection expenses were made in  accordance with applicable laws, regulations, and policies, we analyzed  the Secret Service\u2019s lodging payments and charter aircraft  reimbursements. Of the 962 overnight trips taken during the 2016  presidential campaign, we randomly selected 40\u201410 for each of the  presidential candidates\u2014to assess the Secret Service\u2019s compliance with  (1) its internal policy requiring a waiver when a hotel room exceeds the  General Services Administration (GSA) per diem rate by any amount,  and (2) provisions of Federal Travel Regulation (FTR) that limit hotel  spending to 300 percent of the GSA rate. To determine the GSA per  diem lodging rate, we reviewed the GSA rates applicable on the date of  the hotel stay and for that location. If the amount of the room exceeded  the GSA rate we identified whether the Secret Service had a waiver for  the trip and also checked whether the amount paid exceeded the  maximum amount available for lodging under Department of Homeland  Security (DHS) and Secret Service policy and under the FTR. The time  and effort associated with collecting trip bills from many field offices were  primary considerations in determining the number of candidates\u2019 trips to  review. The Secret Service\u2019s retention of hotel bills is decentralized; that  is, the field office responsible for the geographic area where the  protective operation occurs retains hard copies of the bills. Although the  results of our analysis are not generalizable to all overnight trips taken  during the 2016 presidential campaign, it provided us insight to the Secret  Service\u2019s compliance with its lodging policy and the FTR.", "With regard to whether the Secret Service reimbursed the four campaign  committees the correct amounts for special agent travel on campaign  chartered aircraft, we compared the Secret Service\u2019s payments to the  committees to our estimate of what the Secret Service would have paid  had its own charter aircraft reimbursement policy been followed. We  determined the Secret Service did not use the correct reimbursement  method throughout the 2016 presidential campaign. To determine  whether the Secret Service followed its directive on the review and  approval of policy changes, we compared the steps required to effect a  change in policy to the steps taken by the Secret Service when its  reimbursement method was altered.", "To estimate whether and, if so, by how much the Secret Service overpaid  the campaign committees for special agents\u2019 seats on chartered aircraft  flights based on the reimbursement policy change mentioned above, we  selected a generalizable stratified random sample of 650 flight segments  from the 2,318 flight segments taken from November 1, 2015 through the  end of the 2016 presidential campaign that had an identifiable  airport.  Appendix II provides further technical details on the statistical methods  we used.

Specifically, we selected 650 flight segments from the  2,318 flight segments taken from November 1, 2015 through the end of  the 2016 presidential campaign that had an identifiable airport. We  stratified the population of 2,318 flight segments into 11 mutually  exclusive strata by campaign (Trump, Clinton, Sanders, and Carson) and  three size categories based on the number of special agents that  indicated being on board a flight. We chose to stratify based on the  number of special agents on board to minimize the variance of the total  cost within each stratum in an attempt to gain statistical efficiency in the  sample design.", "The sample size of 650 flight segments was based primarily on available  resources to have the Secret Service\u2019s travel agency extract cost data  from the airfare database. We allocated the sample of 650 flight  segments to the 11 strata using proportional allocation within each  campaign. We then adjusted the allocation in each stratum in an attempt  to match a Neyman allocation method that would minimize the variance of  an estimate of total cost. We randomly selected the allocated sample size  of flight segments within each of the 11 strata.", "For each of the 650 flight segments selected in the sample, we obtained  two measures of the lowest first-class airfare from the Secret Service\u2019s  travel agency, one with fees and taxes and one without (base fare). This  was due to some confusion at the Secret Service about whether taxes  and fees should be included when determining the lowest first-class  airfare. We then compared these first-class airfares to the individual fare  (i.e., the pro rata fare) paid by the Secret Service to the campaign  committees. We classified a flight segment as overpaid if the lowest first-class airfare was less than the pro rata fare paid by the Secret Service.  To determine the total amount of overpayment per flight segment, we  multiplied the difference between the pro rata fare paid by the agency and  the lowest first-class airfare by the number of Secret Service special  agents on board the flight. We assigned flight segments that were  classified as not overpaid a total overpaid value of zero.", "From our sample of 650 flight segments, we identified 295 flights for  which the Secret Service overpaid a total of about $1.5 million. To  estimate the proportion of overpaid flight segments and the total amount  overpaid by the Secret Service for all 2,318 flight segments in the  population from which we sampled, we weighted the sample results by  the inverse of the probability of selection based on the stratified sample  design. We used estimation methods appropriate for a stratified random  sample design and generated 95 percent confidence intervals for each  estimate. Because we followed a probability procedure based on random  selections, our sample is only one of a large number of samples that we  might have drawn. Since each sample could have provided different  estimates, we express our confidence in the precision of our particular  sample\u2019s results as a 95 percent confidence interval (e.g., plus or minus 7  percentage points). This is the interval that would contain the actual  population value for 95 percent of the samples we could have drawn. As  a result, we are 95 percent confident that each of the confidence intervals  in this report will include the true values in the study population. The  weighted percentage estimates of the full population from our sample  have margins of error at the 95 percent confidence level of plus or minus  4 percentage points or fewer and the estimate of the total amount  overpaid by the Secret Service has a relative error of plus or minus 12  percent of the estimate or less.", "Based on these results, we estimate that total overpayments in the  population of 2,318 flight segments from November 1, 2015 through the  end of the campaign would be at least $3.9 million. We estimate that the  Secret Service overpaid invoices for about 49 percent (+/- 4 percentage  points) of the flight segments. The estimated $3.9 million represents the  lower bound of the 95 percent confidence interval of the estimated total  dollar amount overpaid based on our sample.
