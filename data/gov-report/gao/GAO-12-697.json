SBA administers the government-wide program, while VA maintains databases of veterans and SDVOSBs and oversees its own contracts. GAO has reported several times since 2009 that both programs were vulnerable to fraud and abuse and recommended improvements. In October 2010, Congress passed the Veterans Small Business Verification Act (2010 Act), part of the Veterans\u0092 Benefits Act of 2010, to provide tools to VA to more-thoroughly validate firms\u0092 eligibility before listing them in VetBiz, the database used by VA contracting officials to award SDVOSB contracts.", "GAO was asked to assess (1) VA\u0092s progress in addressing remaining vulnerabilities to fraud and abuse in its SDVOSB program and (2) actions taken by SBA or other federal agencies to improve government-wide SDVOSB fraud-prevention controls. GAO reviewed agency documentation and interviewed agency officials. GAO also investigated cases of alleged fraud and abuse. GAO did not project the extent of fraud and abuse in the program."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) program remains vulnerable to fraud and abuse. VA has made inconsistent statements about its progress verifying firms listed in VetBiz using the more-thorough process the agency implemented in response to the Veterans Small Business Verification Act (2010 Act). In one communication, VA stated that as of February 2011, all new verifications would use the 2010 Act process going forward. However, as of April 1, 2012, 3,717 of the 6,178 SDVOSB firms (60 percent) listed as eligible in VetBiz had not been verified under the 2010 Act process. Of these 3,717 firms, 134 received $90 million in new VA SDVOSB set-aside or sole-source contract obligations from November 30, 2011, to April 1, 2012. While the 2010 Act did not include a deadline for verification using the more-thorough process, the presence of firms that have only been subjected to the less-stringent process that VA previously used represents a continuing vulnerability. VA\u0092s Office of Inspector General (OIG) reported that the less-stringent process was in many cases insufficient to establish control and ownership and in effect allowed businesses to self-certify as SDVOSBs with little supporting documentation. VA has taken some positive action to enhance its fraud prevention efforts by establishing processes in response to 6 of 13 recommendations GAO issued in October 2011, including conducting unannounced site visits to high-risk firms and developing procedures for referring suspicious SDVOSB applications to the OIG. VA has also begun action on some remaining recommendations, such as providing fraud awareness training and removing contracts from ineligible firms, though these procedures need to be finalized.", "Regarding the government-wide SDVOSB program, no action has been taken by agencies to improve fraud-prevention controls. Relying almost solely on firms\u0092 self-certification, the program continues to lack controls to prevent fraud and abuse. The Small Business Administration (SBA) does not verify firms\u0092 eligibility status, nor does it require that they submit supporting documentation. While SBA is under no statutory obligation to create a verification process, five new cases of potentially ineligible firms highlight the danger of taking no action. These firms received approximately $190 million in SDVOSB contract obligations. In one case, a firm found ineligible by VA continued to self-certify as an SDVOSB and received about $860,000 from the General Services Administration and the Department of Interior. Further, the Department of Defense (DOD) OIG reported in 2012 that DOD provided $340 million to firms that potentially misstated their SDVOSB status. To address these vulnerabilities, GAO previously suggested that Congress consider providing VA with the authority necessary to expand its SDVOSB eligibility verification process government-wide. Such an action is supported by the fact that VA maintains the database identifying which individuals are service-disabled veterans and is consistent with VA\u0092s mission of service to veterans. However, the problems GAO identified with VA\u0092s verification process indicate that an expansion of VA\u0092s authority to address government-wide program problems should not be undertaken until VA demonstrates that its process is successful in reducing its own SDVOSB program\u0092s vulnerability to fraud and abuse."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that VA take steps to ensure that all firms within VetBiz have undergone the 2010 Act verification process.

The 2006 Act also requires that VA verify the ownership, control,  and veteran or service-disabled status of firms listed in VetBiz to confirm  that they are eligible to receive VA SDVOSB set-aside and sole-source  contracts. In response to the 2006 Act, VA chose to implement a  verification process consisting of checking whether a firm\u2019s owner was  listed in VA\u2019s database of service-disabled veterans and conducting  searches on publicly available websites such as the Excluded Parties List  System (EPLS), which lists firms that have been debarred from doing  business with the federal government. Nonetheless, we reported in 2009  and 2010 that this verification process allowed ineligible firms to be  wrongly certified. In 2011, VA\u2019s Office of Inspector General (OIG) also  reported on the basis of a random selection of 42 firms that 32 of 42  SDVOSBs and VOSBs listed in the VetBiz database were ineligible for  the VA SDVOSB program.", "As part of our past work, we made recommendations to strengthen both  government-wide and VA fraud-prevention controls.

In addition,  our case examples cannot be projected to the overall population of  SDVOSB firms. To identify potential cases, we reviewed SDVOSB  contract awards and protests filed with SBA since 2008 and VA since  2010. We also analyzed the CCR database and VA\u2019s VetBiz database of  applicants for fraudulent activity and reviewed over 100 allegations of  fraud and abuse we received from informants between 2009 through  2011. From these sources, we selected 10 potential cases for further  investigation on the basis of a variety of factors, including the credibility  and specificity of facts and evidence provided in protests and allegations  and whether a firm received multiple SDVOSB contracts since fiscal year  2010. We attempted to select case studies from two categories:  SDVOSBs verified in VetBiz and firms listed in CCR as SDVOSBs that  were not verified by VA. In addition, these 10 cases were not under  investigation by the SBA or VA OIGs at the time of selection.", "To validate the facts in these cases, we interviewed some firm owners  and managers and reviewed relevant documentation, such as business  filings and tax returns, to determine if SDVOSB eligibility requirements  had been met. We reviewed certifications made by firms, such as  certifications about a firm\u2019s size, SDVOSB status, and line of business, in  the federal government\u2019s Online Representations and Certifications  Application (ORCA) and CCR. We also analyzed data from Federal  Procurement Data System-Next Generation (FPDS-NG) from October  2009 through December 2011 to identify SDVOSB contract obligations  received by the firms, and confirmed the contract information with  awarding agencies. We also reviewed Accurint reports to identify  whether owners and firms had any criminal records and federal tax liens  and validated this information if necessary. Ultimately, through a  combination of data matching, a review of public records, and interviews,  we were able to substantiate the informants\u2019 allegations in 4 of the 10  cases and have gathered enough evidence to indicate firms in a fifth case  may be ineligible.

Federal statutes and the Federal Acquisition  Regulations (FAR) require all prospective contractors to update the  ORCA to state whether their firm qualifies as an SDVOSB. Additionally,  the SDVOSB, as a contractor, is required to register in CCR. Contracting  officials are required to check CCR, which includes information such as a  firm\u2019s status as an SDVOSB, prior to awarding most federal contracts,  including an SDVOSB set-aside or sole-source contract.

At a minimum, preventive controls for the SDVOSB program  should be designed to verify that a firm seeking SDVOSB status is eligible  for the program. Even with effective prevention controls, there is residual  risk that firms that appeared to meet SDVOSB program requirements  initially will violate program rules once they obtain contracts. This fact  makes effective monitoring and detection controls essential in a robust  fraud-prevention framework. Detection and monitoring efforts include  activities such as periodic reviews of suspicious firms and evaluating  firms to provide reasonable assurance that they continue to meet  program requirements.

These statements  indicate that VA has taken an inconsistent approach to prioritizing the  verification of firms and has been unable to accurately track the status of  its efforts. Specifically, at the close of our audit work, documentation  provided by VA indicated that thousands of SDVOSBs listed as eligible in  VetBiz received millions of dollars in SDVOSB sole-source and set-aside  contract obligations even though they had not been verified under the  more-thorough process implemented in response to the 2010 Act. At that  time, VA told us it planned to remove all firms that had their 1-year  verification period expired and had not provided documentation for  reverification under the 2010 Act process.

As we  previously stated, the process VA implemented to review firms under the  2006 Act consisted of checking whether a firm\u2019s owner was listed in VA\u2019s  database of service-disabled veterans and conducting searches on  publicly available websites such as the EPLS, which lists firms that have  been debarred from doing business with the federal government. In  contrast, VA stated that it implemented a more-thorough verification  process under the 2010 Act that included unannounced and announced  site visits and a review and analysis of company documentation.", "Although the 2010 Act did not include a date by which VA must complete  the verification of firms, within 60 days of the law\u2019s enactment VA was  required to notify all unverified firms listed in its VetBiz database about  the need to apply for verification by submitting documents to establish  veteran ownership and control. Firms were required to do so within 90  days of receipt of the notification in order to avoid removal of the firm from  VetBiz. VA officials told us that the agency prioritized its verification under  the process implemented in response to the 2010 Act by reviewing (1)  new applications for firms that had previously only self-certified in VetBiz  (i.e., firms that had not been reviewed under the processes VA created  for the 2006 Act or 2010 Act); (2) new firms that had initially applied for  verification after the 2010 Act, to include reprocessing any firms that were  denied through the new requirements and subsequently requested  reconsideration; and (3) applications for firms initially verified in VetBiz  under the process VA chose to implement for the 2006 Act.", "However, our review of information provided by VA raises concerns about  the status of this process and whether VA knows how many of its firms  have actually been verified under the processes implemented in response  to the 2010 Act. In one communication, VA stated that as of February  2011, VA\u2019s 2006 Act verification process had been discontinued, and all  new verifications would use the process implemented in response to the  2010 Act going forward. Because firms would need to reverify 1 year  later, this meant that only firms verified under the 2010 Act process  should have been in VetBiz as of February 2012. In November 2011, VA  reported that it had removed all unverified firms from its database on  September 4, 2011. Subsequently, while reviewing new cases involving  firms that had received VA SDVOSB contracts, we found instances where  firms were not verified under VA\u2019s 2010 Act process, but rather were  verified under its 2006 Act process.", "When we met with VA in February 2012 to discuss our new cases,  officials confirmed that there were still firms in VetBiz that had not been  through the processes implemented in response to the 2010 Act, but did  not explain how many firms still had not gone through the new process.  Then, on April 23, 2012, officials told us that they had recently removed  thousands of firms from VetBiz because these firms had not supplied the  supporting documentation that VA decided was required for verification  under the process implemented in response to the 2010 Act; VA indicated  that it planned to remove hundreds of additional firms for the same  reason. VA has provided conflicting statements about whether these firms  received the December 2010 request to supply documentation. Further,  over the next month, VA officials provided us with at least seven differing  accounts of the number of SDVOSBs verified under the processes  implemented for the 2006 Act and 2010 Act, the number of SDVOSBs  they planned to remove, and the timing of the removals. VA\u2019s conflicting  statements create uncertainty about the status of the agency\u2019s efforts to  verify firms under the process implemented for the 2010 Act. Without a  clear inventory and methods designed to track the verification process  firms have undergone, VA cannot provide reasonable assurance that all  firms appearing in VetBiz have been verified as owned and controlled by  a veteran or service-disabled veteran.", "In its agency comments, VA explained these inventory issues by noting  (1) the lack of a comprehensive case-management system has created  the need for aggregate workarounds and resulted in inconsistent  aggregate reporting; (2) the limitations of its current case-management  system make it difficult to track the inventory of firms; and (3) as the  limitations of the case-management system increase over time, the  potential of CVE to lose track of how many firms have been verified also  increases. VA also noted that its verification priorities have evolved over  time.", "As of the close of our audit work, the information provided by VA  indicated that thousands of potentially ineligible firms remain listed in  VetBiz because they have not been verified under the more thorough  process implemented for the 2010 Act. Our analysis shows that as of  April 1, 2012, 3,717 of the 6,178 SDVOSBs (60 percent) listed as eligible  in VetBiz had yet to be verified using the more-thorough verification  process. Of these 3,717 firms listed as eligible on April 1, 2012, 134  received a total of $90 million in new VA SDVOSB sole-source or set- aside contract obligations during the 4-month period from November 30,  2011, to April 1, 2012. On May 14, 2012, VA told us that it removed  1,857 of these 3,717 SDVOSBs from April 2 to April 10, 2012, so that  they are no longer eligible for VA SDVOSB sole-source and set-aside  contracts. According to VA, the remaining 1,860 firms that had not  received a review under the 2010 Act process were projected to be  removed in July 2012 unless the firms provided adequate documentation  supporting their eligibility. VA also stated that these firms were identified  as being in \u201creverification\u201d and no such expired firm was eligible for an  actual contract award until the reverification decision had been  completed.", "Since then, on June 27, VA implemented an interim final rule that extends  the eligibility of verified firms to 2 years. VA told us it interprets \u201cverified\u201d  to include any firm that has been verified under either its 2006 or 2010  Act processes. Therefore, according to the interim rule, as long as a firm  is verified under either process and is in its 2-year eligibility period, VA is  only authorized to initiate a verification examination if it receives credible  evidence calling into question a participant\u2019s eligibility. Furthermore, VA  considered firms whose prior 1-year eligibility period had recently expired,  but who had not yet been through reverification, to be within the scope of  the new rule, thus extending their eligibility another year. Extending the  eligibility period may allow VA to focus its efforts on more thoroughly  verifying firms that were previously verified under its less-stringent 2006  Act process. However, the extension also allows thousands of firms to  continue to be eligible for contracts even though they have not undergone  the more-thorough process. For example, according to information  provided by VA in its comments, as of July 13, 2012, there are 6,079  SDVOSBs and VOSBs listed in VetBiz. Of these, 3,724 were verified  under the more-through process implemented under the 2010 Act and  2,355\u2014over 38 percent--were verified under VA\u2019s less-rigorous 2006 Act  process.

For example, in 2011, VA\u2019s  own OIG issued a report that reviewed both SDVOSBs and VOSBs listed  in VetBiz and found that 10 of 14 SDVOSBs and VOSBs verified under  VA\u2019s 2006 Act process and listed as eligible were in fact ineligible for  these respective programs. The report identified several reasons for why  these firms were ineligible, including improper subcontracting practices,  lack of control and ownership, and improper use of SDVOSB status,  among others.

VA\u2019s OIG  also used statistical sampling methods to project that (1) $500 million of  VA SDVOSB and VOSB contracts were awarded annually to ineligible  firms and (2) VA will award about $2.5 billion in SDVOSB and VOSB  contracts to ineligible firms over the next 5 years if it does not strengthen  its oversight and verification procedures."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VA Has Made Some Progress in Addressing Our Prior Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["In October 2011, we issued 13 recommendations to VA related to  vulnerabilities in the verification process implemented by VA after the  2010 Act; VA generally concurred with our recommendations.

If the OIG declines  the investigation, VA can refer the matter to VA\u2019s Debarment  Committee, which VA instituted in September 2010 specifically to  debar firms that had violated SDVOSB regulations.

The government-wide program  remains particularly vulnerable since it relies on an honor-system-like  process whereby firms self-certify their eligibility. VA has the only program  within the government dedicated to verifying SDVOSB firms\u2019 eligibility; VA  also has responsibility for maintaining a database of service-disabled  veterans and a listing of firms that are eligible for the SDVOSB program.

Specifically, this should include consideration of the  following three actions: (1) inventory firms listed in VetBiz to establish a  reliable beginning point for the verification status of each firm; (2)  establish procedures to maintain the accuracy of the status of all firms  listed in VetBiz, including which verification process they have undergone;  and (3) expeditiously verify all current VetBiz firms and new applicants  under the 2010 Act verification procedures."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of our report to VA and SBA for comment. In its  written comments, reproduced in appendix I, VA stated that it concurred  with our first two recommendations. It concurred \u201cin principle\u201d with the  third, to verify all current VetBiz firms and new applicants under the  processes implemented under the 2010 Act. With respect to this  recommendation, VA noted that it implemented an interim rule on June  27, 2012, that extends the eligibility of verified firms to 2 years. VA told us  it interprets \u201cverified\u201d to include any firm that has been verified under  either its 2006 or 2010 Act processes. Therefore, according to the interim  final rule, as long as a firm is verified under either process and is in its 2- year eligibility period, VA is only authorized to initiate a verification  examination if it receives credible evidence calling into question a  participant\u2019s eligibility. Extending the eligibility period may allow VA to  focus its efforts on more thoroughly verifying firms that were previously  verified under its less-stringent 2006 Act process. However, the extension  also allows thousands of firms to continue to be eligible for contracts even  though they have not undergone the more thorough process. We  acknowledge that VA has latitude under the law to modify its own  regulations as necessary. However, the interim final rule in effect  removes a backlog of firms and appears to be a self-created impediment  delaying verification under the 2010 Act process. We remain convinced  that the verification process utilized by VA prior to the 2010 Act process  does not provide reasonable assurance that only eligible SDVOSBs  participate in the program. Given this ongoing vulnerability to fraud and  abuse, we continue to believe that VA should expeditiously verify current  VetBiz firms and new applicants under the 2010 Act verification process.", "Despite these concurrences, VA commented that our report was  misleading and inaccurate with respect to (1) our characterizations of a  2011 VA OIG report, (2) conflicting statements made by VA, and (3) VA\u2019s  implementation of our previously issued recommendations. We disagree.  First, VA stated that our use of the VA OIG\u2019s 2011 report was misleading  because the report examined a period when the VetBiz database  included self-certified firms in addition to firms verified under the  processes implemented under the 2006 Act. VA also claims the VA OIG  report contains excessive extrapolations because it examined eligibility  requirements beyond ownership and control. Specifically, VA notes that  14 of the 42 firms reviewed for the OIG report had been through the  verification process VA used in response to the 2006 Act and claims that  only 3 were determined to be ineligible based on ownership and control.  VA\u2019s statement is incomplete and misleading. According to the OIG, an  additional 7 were determined to be ineligible for reasons that could be  identified during a robust verification process. As a result, the OIG found  10 of 14 firms verified under VA\u2019s 2006 Act process to be ineligible\u2014an  eligibility failure rate comparable to the overall eligibility failure rate cited  in the report.", "With regard to the aforementioned 7 firms, the OIG determined they were  ineligible because they were engaged in improper subcontracting  practices, such as \u201cpass-through\u201d contracts. Pass-through contracts occur  when businesses or joint venture/partnerships list veterans or service  disabled veterans as majority owners of the business but, contrary to  programs requirements, the non-veteran owned business either  performed or managed the majority of the work and received a majority of  the contracts\u2019 funds. Given that the firms being reviewed by the OIG  already had existing contracts in place, the OIG was able to identify the  pass-through contracts by conducting site visits and reviewing business  documentation, the same steps that VA claims are taken during the  verification process it implemented in response to the 2010 Act. While we  acknowledge that it is difficult to identify pass-through contracts for  applicants to the program who don\u2019t have any preexisting contracts, VA  should be conducting such a review for those firms that have contracts in  place. As we have noted in past reports, VA\u2019s fraud prevention controls  should include detection and monitoring measures to assure that firms  are completing the work required of an SDVOSB contract.", "Second, VA disagrees that it provided numerous conflicting statements to  us regarding its verification efforts, stating that the verification process  has evolved and that VA faces technical limitations related to its case- management system. While we acknowledge these concerns, it is  important to note that VA did not provide us with any explanation as to its  evolving priorities during the course of our audit and instead repeatedly  sent us contradictory information without any clarification. Moreover, not  all of the conflicting statements VA made can be attributed to  inadequacies in its case-management system or to evolving priorities.  Specifically, the information we received during the course of our audit  work changed so significantly over such a short period of time that the  evidence GAO collected does not support VA\u2019s assertion that it \u201cknows  how many firms have been verified\u201d and can \u201ctrack individual firms,\u201d as  VA claims in its agency comment letter.

Then, on April 23, 2012, VA told us that it stopped verifying firms  under its 2006 Act process in February 2011 and began  verification under its 2010 Act process at the same time. Next, on  May 12, 2012, VA told us that it stopped verifying firms under the  2006 Act process in January 2011 and began verifying under the  2010 Act at the end of December 2010. In the same  communication, VA told us that no firm was approved under its  2006 Act process after February 2011. But on May 21, 2012, VA  sent us a list of firms and verification dates showing that multiple  firms were last verified under its 2006 Act process past February  2011, with at least two firms verified under iits 2006 Act process  as late as May 2011.", "Finally, VA stated it believed all previous GAO recommendations issued  in October 2011 should be closed. For GAO to close a recommendation,  it must be implemented or actions must have been taken that essentially  meet the recommendation\u2019s intent. Further, the responsible agency must  provide evidence, with sufficient supporting documentation, that the  actions are being implemented adequately. By the end of our audit work,  we were able to close 6 of the 13 recommendations that we issued to VA  in October 2011 based on documentation VA provided demonstrating that  the agency had taken specific actions in response to our  recommendations. Although VA indicated that it would like to close out  the remaining recommendations, it either did not demonstrate that it had  taken an action to implement a recommendation or did not provide the  supporting documentation needed to show that the recommendation was  in fact implemented. We had several discussions with VA staff about our  requirements for closing recommendations, the last occurring on June 22,  2012.  Moreover, we noted in our report any progress VA has made with  respect to each recommendation; the information VA provided in this  letter had previously been acknowledged in our report. For the 7  recommendations that remain open after the issuance of this report, we  will continue to seek from VA additional documentation necessary to  demonstrate that implementation has occurred.

However, as noted in our report, SBA\u2019s bid-protest process  alone\u2014that is, without upfront eligibility verification and other related  measures\u2014cannot provide reasonable assurance that only legitimate  firms are awarded SDVOSB contracts.

SBA  disagreed with the draft report\u2019s portrayal of actions taken against the  firms that were the subject of the 10 case studies developed as part of  our October 2009 report. We revised our report where appropriate. SBA  also stated that it had taken actions against firms in addition to those cited  in our case studies, but did not provide specific examples. Finally, SBA  stated that it was implementing training to help its staff identify fraud and  abuse and working to improve its referral process and collaboration with  other agencies. Such efforts could help reduce the SDVOSB program\u2019s  vulnerability. However, these efforts would affect only SBA\u2019s investigation  and prosecution efforts, and not prevention, detection, and monitoring.

While VA\u2019s recommended change points out that VA removed firms  that self-represented or had expired eligibility periods, these  categories of firms are included by the \u201call unverified businesses\u201d  language in the existing report language.  4.  We deleted the sentence stating that SDVOSBs are required to  receive a portion of government-wide contractual dollars annually.  5.  We have revised our draft report to note that according to VA, (1) the  lack of a comprehensive case-management system has created the  need for aggregate workarounds and resulted in inconsistent  aggregate reporting, (2) the limitations of the case-management  system make it difficult to track the inventory of firms, and (3) as the  limitations of the case-management system increase over time, the  potential of CVE to lose track of how many firms have been verified  also increases. We also acknowledge VA\u2019s assertion that its  verification priorities have evolved over time. However, not all of the  conflicting statements VA made can be attributed to inadequacies in  its case-management system or to evolving priorities. One of the  many examples relates to the December 2010 request for  documentation mentioned in the 2010 Act. Specifically, on April 23,  2012, VA told us that between late March 2012 and early April 2012 it  had removed over 3,000 SDVOSBs and VOSBs because these firms  had failed to provide requested business documentation. We asked  whether the firms removed in April 2012 had been sent this request.   In response, VA told us that the firms removed in April 2012 did not  receive the December 2010 document. Then on May 12, 2012, VA  told us the firms had in fact been sent the December 2010 letter.  Later, on June 20, 2012, VA told us that it did not send the December  2010 letter to all firms listed in VetBiz at the time to avoid a flood of  applications. In its agency comments, VA states that the 2010 Act did  not require it to send all firms listed in VetBiz in December 2010 a  request for documentation if the firms had been verified under the  2006 Act and this verification had not yet expired.  6.  We revised the text in our draft report to more-clearly reflect that  thousands of SDVOSBs listed as eligible in VetBiz received millions of  dollars in contract obligations even though they had not been verified  under the more-thorough process that VA implemented in response to  the 2010 Act.  VA\u2019s recommended changes also suggest that firms  that were verified under the 2006 Act process could not be  immediately reverified under the more-thorough 2010 Act process  because, in addition to resource-allocation priorities, VA was limited  by the requirements of 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 74.15(c). However, we note that  VA has latitude under the law to modify its own regulations as  necessary to ensure that only valid SDVOSBs are included in VetBiz.  Furthermore, VA\u2019s recent decision to amend 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 74.15 and  extend the VetBiz eligibility term from 1 year to 2 years appears to be  a self-created impediment to ensuring all firms expeditiously undergo  the more-thorough 2010 Act process. 7.  We revised the text in our report to reflect that the 2010 Act required  VA to notify all unverified firms about the need to apply for verification.  8.  The language VA objects to concerning VA\u2019s prioritization of  verifications under the 2010 Act process is taken directly from  documentation provided by VA during the course of our audit.  Accordingly, we made no changes to the report. 9.  The language VA objects to concerning removal of firms is taken  directly from oral and written statements made by VA during the  course of our audit. Accordingly, we made no changes to the report. 10. The firms mentioned in this footnote are related to one of the new  cases we reviewed as a result of allegations we received from  confidential informants. These firms were not verified under the  process implemented under the 2010 Act and we determined that  they were in fact ineligible for the SDVOSB program because the  firms\u2019 operating agreements allowed the two minority owners to  control the firms, rather than the service-disabled veteran. These firms  received approximately $16 million in VA SDVOSB set-aside and  sole-source contract obligations from October 2010 to December  2011. Accordingly, we made no changes to the report. 11. We revised our report to make clear that we were referring to  verification using the processes implemented under the 2010 Act.  12. We received conflicting statements from VA as to which firms  received the December 2010 notification later and have revised the  text to clearly reflect this fact.  13. We revised the text in our report to more-clearly reflect that thousands  of potentially ineligible firms remain listed in VetBiz because they have  not been verified under the more-thorough process implemented for  the 2010 Act. While these firms have been verified under the 2006 Act  process, past audits show the potential risk of providing SDVOSB  contracts to firms reviewed under this process. VA\u2019s recommended  change does not acknowledge this risk and is therefore incomplete.  Moreover, our statements that were related to the number of firms not  verified under the requirements of the 2010 Act, the dollar amounts  those firms received, and the number of firms VA planned to remove  were all supported by evidence and were accurate at the close of our  audit work. We have clarified the report to indicate that fact and  included information on the requirements of the interim final rule VA  implemented on June 27, 2012. Specifically, in our final report we  have noted that the rule extends a firm\u2019s eligibility period for 2 years.  We also note that VA interprets \u201cverified\u201d to include any firm that has  been verified under either the 2006 Act or 2010 Act processes,  meaning that this rule will allow thousands of firms to remain eligible  for contracts even though they have not undergone the more- thorough process implemented under the 2010 Act process. See the  Agency Comments and Our Evaluation section of this report for a  more-thorough discussion of this issue. 14. To this point, VA has not provided sufficient documentation to close  the 7 recommendations that remain open. GAO will continue to work  with VA to confirm the status of its efforts to address our  recommendations and will close recommendations, as long as  necessary supporting evidence is provided.  15. Our report states that VA has made progress in the area of fraud- awareness training. However, VA has not provided any  documentation to show that fraud-awareness training is being  provided on a regular basis, as we recommended. Our  recommendation will remain open until necessary evidence to close it  is provided. Accordingly, we have not changed the language in our  report. 16. The FAR and the VA Acquisition Regulations do not provide specific  processes and criteria for the Debarment Committee on compliance  with the requirement in the 2006 Act to debar, for a reasonable period  of time, firms and related parties that misrepresented their SDVOSB  status. VA should provide additional guidance to the Debarment  Committee on the specific process and criteria to use to debar firms  as required by the 2006 Act. Accordingly we have not changed the  language in our report.  17. The recommendation requested that VA develop specific guidelines  outlining the Debarment Committee's decision process to debar firms  that misrepresent their SDVOSB status. VA needs to provide  supporting documentation demonstrating that VA provided the  Debarment Committee with the guidance outlining the decision  process to debar firms that misrepresent their SDVOSB status.   Accordingly, we have not changed the language in our report. 18. VA cites provisions of the FAR and the VA Acquisition Regulations  containing guidance for continuing current contracts to firms that were  found ineligible through the debarment process. However, our  recommendation asked VA to develop procedures to remove  SDVOSB contracts from ineligible firms. Accordingly, we have not  changed the language in our report. 19. Our report acknowledges that VA advertises the debarments and  prosecutions on the Debarment Committee, VA OIG, and CVE  websites. However, our recommendation specifically asked for VA to  formalize procedures to advertise debarments and prosecutions, and  we have not received any documentation related to such procedures.   Accordingly, we have not changed the language in our report."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Related GAO Products", "paragraphs": ["Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Program:  Governmentwide Fraud Prevention Control Weaknesses Leave Program  Vulnerable to Fraud and Abuse, but VA Has Made Progress in Improving  Its Verification Process.
