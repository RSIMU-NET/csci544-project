From 2004 through 2009, S&T spent approximately $60 million and made varying levels of progress in the research and development of its four container security technology projects. These projects include the Advanced Container Security Device (ACSD), to detect intrusion on all six sides of a container; the Container Security Device (CSD), to detect the opening or removal of container doors; the Hybrid Composite Container, a lightweight container with an embedded sensor grid to detect intrusion on all six sides of the container; and the Marine Asset Tag Tracking System (MATTS), to track containers. The ACSD and Hybrid Composite Container technologies have not yet completed laboratory testing, but the CSD and MATTS are proceeding to testing in an operational environment, which will determine if the technologies can operate in the global supply chain--the flow of goods from manufacturers to retailers. S&T's master plans for conducting operational environment testing, however, do not reflect all of the operational scenarios the Office of Policy Development and CBP are considering for implementation. According to DHS guidance, before S&T can provide performance standards to the Office of Policy Development and CBP, the technologies are to have been proven to work in their final form and under expected operational conditions. Until the container security technologies are tested and evaluated consistent with all of the operational scenarios DHS identified for potential implementation, S&T cannot provide reasonable assurance that the technologies will effectively function as the Office of Policy Development and CBP intend to implement them. If S&T determines that the container security technologies are mature enough to provide performance standards for these technologies to the Office of Policy Development and CBP, key steps and challenges remain before implementation can occur. These key steps involve (1) obtaining support from the trade industry and international partners, (2) developing a concept of operations (CONOPS) detailing how the technologies are to be deployed, and (3) certifying the technologies for use. The Office of Policy Development and CBP plan to take these steps if and when S&T provides performance standards."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DHS test and evaluate the container security technologies consistent with all the operational scenarios DHS identified for potential implementation.

As it performs this mission, CBP  maintains two overarching and sometimes conflicting goals\u2014increasing  security while efficiently facilitating legitimate trade. To address these  goals, CBP has developed a layered security strategy. Core components of  this strategy include analyzing information to identify cargo containers  that may pose a security risk, working with host governments to examine  high-risk containers at foreign ports before they are loaded onto vessels  bound for the United States, and providing benefits, such as reduced  examination of cargo, to private-sector companies that comply with  predetermined security measures.", "Recognizing that security can be further enhanced, CBP has partnered  with DHS\u2019s Science and Technology (S&T) Directorate to develop  performance standards\u2014requirements that must be met by products to  ensure they will function as intended\u2014for container security technologies  that can (1) detect and report container intrusion, (2) alert officials to  possible security threats, and (3) track the movement of cargo containers  through the supply chain.

In particular, this report addresses the  following questions:    To what extent has DHS made progress in conducting research and  development and defining performance standards for container  security technologies?", "What remaining steps and challenges, if any, does DHS face in  implementing container security technologies?", "To address the first objective, we reviewed all four ongoing container  security projects initiated by S&T to develop technologies that can detect  cargo container intrusions and track the movement of cargo containers  through the supply chain. For each of the four projects, we reviewed  project requirements documents, test plans, technology transition  agreements, and task orders to determine the projects\u2019 scope and  requirements. We then evaluated DHS\u2019s plans against criteria for planning  in DHS\u2019s Developing Operational Requirements guide. To assess DHS\u2019s  progress in developing technologies, we reviewed the test reports  outlining the performance of the technologies under evaluation to identify  the capabilities of the technologies and performance deficiencies. We also  reviewed each of the project schedules and compared them to the current  status of each of the container security technology projects as of June  2010. We interviewed senior officials in S&T\u2019s Borders and Maritime  Security Division in Washington, D.C., who are responsible for the four  container security projects to discuss the status of the projects.

Further, we reviewed the contracts and interagency  agreements that provided funds to the CSTE team and vendors to  determine the amount of money DHS has spent on testing, evaluating, and  developing the technologies since funding for the container security  technologies began, in April 2004, through 2009.", "To address the second objective, we discussed container security  technology implementation plans with officials from DHS\u2019s Office of  Policy Development Transportation, Cargo & Infrastructure Unit, and with  CBP officials from its Office of Field Operations and its Customs-Trade  Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT) Office.We also spoke with  Department of Defense (DOD) entities, including the U.S. Army and the  U.S. Transportation Command, to identify any lessons learned from DOD\u2019s  implementation of container security devices in transporting supplies and  equipment to support war efforts in Afghanistan. With representatives of  the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and World  Customs Organization (WCO),we discussed the process for obtaining  international adoption of container security technology standards, and the  imposition of duties and taxes on container security technologies,  respectively. Further, we spoke with trade industry representatives to  understand the trade industry\u2019s perspective on how container security  technologies could be implemented in the global supply chain, and to  identify any potential challenges to implementation. Specifically, we spoke  with officials from the World Shipping Council, which represents vessel  carriers that transport cargo containers, as well as with two individual  vessel carriers and one non-vessel operating common carrier.We also  spoke with representatives from two trade industry associations\u2014the  American Association of Exporters and Importers and the National  Association of Manufacturers\u2014as well as 22 individual U.S. importers the  trade association members identified for us among their membership. We  conducted interviews with these importers in group settings. This  interview format allowed us to determine consensus and also identify and  examine instances where viewpoints differed among importers. As a result  of the group settings, we do not explicitly identify the number of importers  who expressed particular views. Rather, we express these views as those  of some of the importers we interviewed. Further, we met with an official  from the Institute of International Container Lessors, which represents  companies that lease containers to members of the trade industry,  including vessel carriers and importers. Our interviews with these trade  industry representatives were based on a nonprobability sample, so they  are not generalizable to the entire maritime trade industry, but they did  provide us with insights into the willingness of members of the maritime  trade industry to partner with DHS and CBP to implement container  security technologies, and identify potential challenges to implementation.", "We conducted this performance audit from October 2009 through  September 2010 in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards.

The SAFE Port Act established a statutory  framework for some of the programs comprising CBP\u2019s layered security  strategy, including CSI and C-TPAT, which previously had been agency  programs not required by law. The SAFE Port Act also required that DHS  initiate a rulemaking process and subsequently issue an interim final rule  to establish minimum standards and procedures for securing containers in  transit to the United States. In August 2007, the Implementing  Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 (9/11 Act) was  enacted, amending this SAFE Port Act requirement. Specifically, the 9/11  Act required that if the interim final rule was not issued by April 1, 2008,  then effective no later than October 15, 2008, all containers in transit to the  United States would be required to use an ISO 17712 compliant seal. DHS  did not establish standards by the set deadline, so all maritime containers  in transit to the United States are now required to be sealed with an ISO  17712 compliant seal. According to DHS, it did not establish minimum  standards for securing cargo containers in transit because there were no  available technology solutions at the time that would adequately improve  container security without significantly disrupting the flow of commerce.

For example, entry  into a container through the roof or sides will not be indicated by a  container seal affixed to the doors. Further, various methods to  circumvent seals installed on container door hasps (see fig. 3) have been  demonstrated by the Department of Defense and the Vulnerability  Assessment Team at Los Alamos National Laboratory. Seals installed  through the door hasp can be bypassed and left intact by simply removing  an entire container door.

According to an Office of Policy Development  director, there are two approaches DHS could likely pursue to implement  container security technologies\u2014mandatory or voluntary participation by  the trade industry. The director added that if DHS determines that the  universal use of container technologies would provide a worthwhile  security benefit, DHS would likely pursue a rulemaking approach to  mandate the use of the technologies on all U.S.-bound containers. If DHS  determines that the technologies would be primarily beneficial in a more  limited portion of the supply chain, though, it would work with the trade  industry to encourage voluntary use of the technologies. Some members of  the trade industry we spoke with were resistant to purchasing and using  the technologies given the number of container security programs they  already have to comply with. Representatives of the World Shipping  Council and both vessel carriers we spoke with questioned the role of  vessel carriers in implementation because of the uncertainties that  presently exist concerning how the technologies could be implemented  and which parties are to be involved. The representatives of the two vessel  carriers we spoke with expressed interest in purchasing the Hybrid  Composite Container because of the commercial benefit that could be  provided by its reduced weight, but they added that they are not interested  in spending additional money on the embedded sensor grid that is to  provide the security benefit. Further, the importers we spoke with  questioned their role and whether they have the authority to affix  technologies on containers they do not own, as the containers they use are  typically leased.", "If CBP adopts a voluntary approach, it may also have challenges getting  support from C-TPAT members\u2014its trusted private sector partners.  Container security technologies could provide security benefits in the  supply chain, but using technology that detects intrusion into a cargo  container when there is no assurance illicit materials or contraband were  not earlier introduced could give the false impression that the container is  secure or could have the effect of potentially locking dangerous or illicit  cargo in a container. Since C-TPAT members are committed to a  comprehensive security process, including procedures for securing  containers at the point of packing, they provide such assurance. According  to DHS\u2019s 2007 Strategy to Enhance International Supply Chain  Security, the department intended to use C-TPAT Tier III members to  implement commercially available container security devices that CBP  previously tested. However, C-TPAT Tier III members we spoke with were  resistant to the idea of having to purchase and use technologies, such as  the CSD and ACSD, on their containers to maintain their Tier III status. In  particular, some of the members stated that from a financial standpoint,  the additional benefit of reduced number of container inspections that  CBP provided to Tier III members over Tier II members, would not  outweigh the costs of using the technologies. As a result, they stated that  they would likely downgrade to Tier II status rather than have to purchase  the technologies. The C-TPAT Tier III members, as well as other trade  industry representatives we spoke with, said DHS should demonstrate,  through a risk-benefit analysis, that using the technologies would provide  a clear security benefit before making the use of such technologies a  requirement. CBP officials told us that they are aware that the trade  industry is generally not willing to spend money on container security  technologies and that C-TPAT members question whether the cost is  worth the benefit.", "In addition to obtaining trade industry support, DHS will also need to  obtain support from international organizations and WCO to implement  the new container security technologies. In order for the container  security technologies to be admitted into foreign countries without being  subject to import duties and taxes, as well as import prohibitions and  restrictions, the technologies first have to be recognized as accessories  and equipment of the containers under the Customs Convention on  Containers. The convention essentially provides for the temporary  admission and reexportation of containers and their accessories and  equipment that meet certain requirements without the imposition of duties  or taxes by any customs authority. According to a WCO director, while an  individual device attached to a container most likely would be viewed as  an accessory to the container, if multiple devices are shipped in bulk for  reuse on other containers, the question of how to treat them for import  duty purposes would be more difficult. He also noted that, if requested by  a member country, WCO could provide an advisory opinion as to whether  the technologies should be treated as container accessories and equipment  pursuant to the Customs Convention on Containers, but the ultimate  decision as to whether to classify the technologies as exempt from import  duties and taxes resides with each individual foreign government.", "Other options under consideration for how the container security  technologies are to be implemented would also require support from  foreign governments. CPB officials told us that they are considering  implementing the use of container security technologies in high-risk trade  lanes\u2014trade routes that have been determined to pose the highest risk of  transporting threats to the United States. S&T officials stated that another  option would be to use the technologies on cargo containers departing  from ports participating in the Container Security Initiative.

These procedures are typically  documented in a concept of operations (CONOPS)-\u2014a user-oriented  document that describes how an asset is to be employed and supported  from the users\u2019 viewpoint. A CONOPS also describes the operations that  must be performed, who must perform them, and where and how the  operations will be carried out. DHS and CBP could face challenges  developing a feasible CONOPS that addresses the necessary technology  infrastructure needs and protocols. Container security technologies  require a supporting technology infrastructure, including readers to  communicate to customs officials whether a technology has identified an  unauthorized intrusion, and a means to capture and store the data. CBP  will be faced with determining who will have access to the container  security technologies through readers, where to place these readers, and  obtaining permission to install fixed readers at both domestic and foreign  ports. Prior work we conducted on container scanning technologies  identified challenges in obtaining permission and space from terminal  operators at both domestic and foreign ports to install equipment.  Further, several pilots previously conducted to test the feasibility of using  container security technologies have also noted challenges with  establishing the reader infrastructure at ports. For example, during  Operation Safe Commerce, difficulties were encountered with the  installation and maintenance of fixed readers at both foreign and domestic  ports. Furthermore, several foreign ports did not allow installation of the  fixed readers, and problems were also encountered in installing and  maintaining power to fixed readers at domestic port facilities. In addition,  databases are needed to collect the data obtained by the readers from the  container security technologies. Pilots have also demonstrated the  challenges with establishing information systems to collect the data  provided by the technologies.", "Establishing protocols regarding which supply chain participants will be  involved in arming and disarming the technologies, reading the status  messages generated by the technologies, responding to alarms, and  accessing data will also be important. For example, if the CONOPS calls  for technologies to first be affixed to a container at the point of packing, it  will require the packers to have the ability to first install and arm the  technologies. The packing of goods into cargo containers can be handled  by a number of different parties, including the shipper (i.e., seller), a third- party consolidator, or the buyer. Regardless of which party is packing the  container, these participants have the last visual check of the goods before  they are sealed for transport. At any point during the transfer of the  container from its packing point to the port of embarkation, foreign  customs may need to stop and open a container for inspection. In these  instances, it will be important to ensure foreign customs officials have the  ability to arm and disarm the technologies so they can open a container  without triggering the alarm. Response protocols will need to be  developed that include information on which parties are to respond to an  alarm and the associated processes for responding. While CBP would  likely respond to a container alarm by first scanning the container with NII  equipment to mitigate any potential danger to a CBP officer entering the  container to conduct a physical examination, CBP officers may not be  nearby when an alarm occurs, particularly if it occurs during a container\u2019s  transport to a foreign port, at a non-Container Security Initiative port, or  while on a vessel in-transit. Furthermore, CBP will also need to consider  whether foreign governments\u2019 customs agencies will be allowed access to  the data generated by the technologies on containers departing their  respective ports."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CBP Plans to Certify Technologies before They Can Be Used in the Supply Chain", "paragraphs": ["Once a CONOPS is developed, certification testing can take place to  determine the suitability of technologies consistent with the CONOPS.

Interested container  security technology vendors would submit their products to CBP for  certification testing, which consists of a mix of laboratory and trade lane  testing to demonstrate whether the products meet the performance  standards.
