Of about 183,000 aliens removed under the program from October 2008 through March 2012, about 74 percent had a criminal conviction. ICE did not have state or local arrest charges for about 56 percent of alien Secure Communities removals from October 2010 (when ICE began collecting arrest charges) through March 2012, so we were unable to determine the most frequent arrest charges under the program. For the 44 percent of aliens removed on whom ICE collected arrest charge data, traffic offenses, including driving under the influence of alcohol, were the most frequent arrest charges. ICE is taking steps to improve the collection of arrest charge data, but it is too early to assess the effectiveness of its efforts.", "ICE has not consistently followed best practices in acquiring technology to help determine the immigration status of aliens identified by Secure Communities. ICE awarded contracts to modernize its technology without fully defining requirements or developing an integrated master schedule\u0097two best practices for managing capital programs. As a result, ICE encountered delays, cost increases, and products that did not meet ICE\u0092s needs. For example, ICE spent $14.3 million for one contract to develop services that ICE found to be unusable. Establishing well-defined requirements and developing an integrated schedule for completing technology modernization could better position ICE to prevent delays and cost increases.

DHS\u2019s U.S.  Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is responsible for  apprehending and removing aliens who have violated immigration law. All  aliens not lawfully present in the United States are potentially removable.  Removal is a civil enforcement process that does not lead to a criminal  conviction. A criminal alien is a noncitizen in the United States, who may  be present on a lawful basis or not, who has been convicted of a crime. A  criminal alien lawfully in the United States may be removable, depending on the nature of the particular offense of which the alien was convicted.Secure Communities, initiated in 2008 and expected by DHS to be  deployed nationwide by 2013, is one of ICE\u2019s programs for identifying  potentially removable aliens arrested by state or local law enforcement  agencies, particularly those with criminal convictions. Under Secure  Communities, the fingerprints that these agencies submit to the  Department of Justice\u2019s Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for criminal  background checks are automatically forwarded to DHS for comparison  with fingerprint records DHS maintains. If the fingerprints match DHS\u2019s  records, ICE is to use its information systems to access law enforcement  and immigration databases to conduct additional analysis of the  individuals\u2019 immigration status and criminal history, and determine  whether to request that the law enforcement agency hold the subject so  ICE can take custody for further enforcement action.", "Secure Communities is one of four programs under ICE to identify  criminal aliens who are subject to removal, a key agency enforcement  priority. In addition to Secure Communities, ICE\u2019s Criminal Alien Program  (CAP) is designed to identify, process, and remove criminal aliens from  prisons across the United States; the National Fugitive Operations  Program is to pursue known at-large criminal aliens and fugitive aliens;  and the 287(g) program, authorized by section 287(g) of the Immigration  and Nationality Act, is to provide state and local law enforcement agency  officers with delegation of authority, training, and resources to perform  certain functions of an immigration officer. While identifying criminal  aliens is a priority for ICE, individuals identified by Secure Communities  who are not convicted for the offense for which they are arrested and  have no previous criminal conviction may be removed because they fall  under other ICE priorities (such as previous violations of immigration  laws).", "Different stakeholders have provided differing perspectives on the effects  of Secure Communities. According to ICE, Secure Communities  strengthens public safety by improving ICE\u2019s ability to identify, detain, and  ultimately remove criminal aliens nationwide. ICE has also reported that  Secure Communities reduces the potential for racial or ethnic profiling by  state and local law enforcement agencies because anyone who is  arrested and fingerprinted is subject to the Secure Communities matching  process. In contrast, some immigrant advocacy groups have expressed  concern that the program encourages racial profiling because officers  could find pretexts to arrest individuals based on their physical  appearance, knowing that they will be screened for immigration status as  a result of the arrest. Further, these groups believe that Secure  Communities discourages witnesses of crimes and domestic violence  victims from contacting law enforcement for fear of possible deportation.  A DHS Advisory Task Force identified similar community concerns, based  in part on forums held in communities across the country, and concluded  that such fears could erode the police\u2019s ability to build strong relationships  with immigrant communities and engage in community policing.", "In March and April 2012, DHS\u2019s Office of Inspector General issued two  reports on Secure Communities, one of which reviewed how ICE  communicated the intent and requirements for participation in Secure  Communities to states and local jurisdictions, and the other reviewed  ICE\u2019s operation of Secure Communities. recommendations made in both reports.", "You asked us to review ICE\u2019s implementation of the Secure Communities  program.

We also examined ICE\u2019s policies and procedures for identifying and  removing criminal aliens, and documents related to enforcement actions  and detainers. We interviewed officials from ICE\u2019s Secure Communities  and Law Enforcement Systems and Analysis offices. We assessed the  reliability of Secure Communities\u2013related data by examining  documentation about the various systems that ICE uses to analyze  Secure Communities fingerprint submissions and maintain information on  aliens it encounters, and confirming with ICE officials that the  documentation is accurate and up to date. In doing so, we confirmed that  ICE has controls in place to ensure that the data it maintains on aliens  encountered by the program are entered accurately.

ERO manages the Secure Communities  program and has 24 field offices nationwide.", "Under Secure Communities, when an individual is arrested by a state or  local law enforcement agency, the individual\u2019s fingerprints are taken and  automatically checked against the Integrated Automated Fingerprint  Identification System (IAFIS), a national fingerprint and criminal history  system maintained by the FBI, and DHS\u2019s Automated Biometric  Identification System (IDENT) to identify a fingerprint match. IDENT  contains fingerprint and other biometric information on immigration  violators, known or suspected terrorists, criminal aliens, and foreign  nationals who are enrolled in DHS\u2019s United States Visitor and Immigrant  Status Indicator Technology program, among others. When a law  enforcement agency (LEA) arrests and books an individual on suspicion  of committing a crime, the person\u2019s fingerprints are routinely sent to the  FBI for a criminal background check. FBI electronically forwards the  fingerprints to DHS for a check against IDENT records. If there is a  fingerprint match, ICE is to then determine whether the individual is  subject to removal. On the basis of the match, the FBI is to send an  Immigration Alien Query to ICE\u2019s LESC. Using the Alien Criminal  Response Information Management (ACRIMe) system, LESC specialists  are to search multiple databases, such as the FBI\u2019s National Crime  Information Center (NCIC) and the Student and Exchange Visitor  Information System for information on the individual\u2019s criminal history and  immigration status. LESC is to then send an Immigration Alien  Response to the LEA and relevant ICE ERO field office or Interoperability  Response Center (IRC)\u2014offices established in the Los Angeles, Chicago,  Miami, and Buffalo, New York, field offices to expand ICE\u2019s ability to  respond to Secure Communities matches.", "The ICE field office or response center is to then determine whether to  send an immigration detainer (Form I-247) to the LEA that has custody of  the individual. A detainer is an ICE request that the law enforcement  agency maintain custody of the individual for up to 48 hours after that  person would otherwise be released, excluding weekends and holidays,  to allow ICE time to administratively arrest (i.e., assume custody of) the  person. The decision whether to issue a detainer for a particular alien is  based on whether the alien falls within ICE\u2019s priorities for removal and  other factors, such as whether ICE detention resources are available, and  whether the individual is still in the custody of the arresting local or state  law enforcement agency (under some circumstances a person may be  held for only a few hours). If the individual is convicted and serves a  criminal sentence, ICE is to wait until the sentence is completed to take  the person into custody. Figure 1 describes the Secure Communities  process.", "According to ICE, Secure Communities helps carry out ICE\u2019s civil  immigration enforcement priorities. In a March 2011 memorandum, ICE\u2019s  Director provided guidance to all ICE employees on ICE\u2019s civil  immigration enforcement priorities as they relate to the apprehension,  detention, and removal of aliens across all ICE programs. The types of  crimes included under the different priority classifications are described in  table 1.", "In a June 2011 memorandum, ICE\u2019s Director provided guidance to ICE  officers, agents, and attorneys on the exercise of \u201cprosecutorial  discretion\u201d to ensure that the agency\u2019s immigration enforcement  resources are focused on its enforcement priorities. As noted in the  memorandum, because the agency is confronted with more  administrative violations than its resources can address, the agency must  regularly exercise prosecutorial discretion to prioritize its efforts. The  memorandum provides a list of criteria for ICE personnel to use when  assessing whether an individual case is appropriate for an exercise of  prosecutorial discretion. In a second memorandum, also issued in June  2011, ICE provided additional guidance on the use of prosecutorial  discretion for victims, witnesses, and plaintiffs. Specifically, the  additional guidance stated that ICE is to exercise discretion on a case-by- case basis when making detention and enforcement decisions in the  cases of (1) victims of domestic violence, human trafficking, or other  serious crimes; (2) witnesses involved in pending criminal investigations,  plaintiffs in nonfrivolous lawsuits regarding civil rights or civil liberties  violations; and (3) individuals engaging in a protected activity related to  civil or other rights, such as union organizing. In August 2011, DHS  began to review all incoming cases in immigration court to identify the  cases most clearly eligible and ineligible for exercising discretion to not  pursue removal of the individual. DHS and DOJ launched pilot programs  in which an intra-agency team of attorneys from ICE, U.S. Citizenship and  Immigration Services, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection applied  the June 2011 memorandums to its review of existing cases in the  Denver and Baltimore immigration courts.announced that in the next phase of its pilot, beginning in April 2012, it  would extend its case reviews to immigration courts in Seattle, Detroit,  New Orleans, Orlando, New York City, San Francisco, and Los Angeles.", "On March 30, 2012, DHS  ICE has followed an incremental approach to activating Secure  Communities interoperability in jurisdictions nationwide. 2011, ICE has been simultaneously activating all jurisdictions within a  given state into Secure Communities.

About 74 percent had been convicted of a  criminal offense; that is, they were either convicted of the offense that led  to their identification under Secure Communities or had a record of  conviction for a previous offense. For these individuals, the current or  prior criminal conviction served as the basis for ICE\u2019s prioritization for  removal. Twenty-one percent of aliens removed did not have a criminal  conviction known to ICE prior to their removal, but were identified as one  of ICE\u2019s other removal priorities, including aliens who were fugitives or  who reentered the country illegally after removal. The remaining 5  percent of aliens removed also did not have a known criminal conviction  prior to their removal but were nonetheless removable because, for  example, they entered the United States without inspection or violated the  terms of their admission.

According to ICE, the percentage of removals  who are Level 3 offenders has been decreasing, in part because ICE has  continued to prioritize its resources on the identification and removal of  aliens convicted of felonies. Additionally, ICE redefined its criminal  offense levels between fiscal years 2010 and 2011, causing some Level 3  offenders to be reclassified as Level 2 offenders based upon repeat  misdemeanor offenses, which ICE officials said resulted in an increase in  the percentage of removals who were Level 2 offenders to 19 percent in  fiscal year 2011 as compared with 13 percent in fiscal year 2010, and a  decrease in the percentage classified as level 3.", "ICE\u2019s removal data do not reflect those aliens identified as removable  through the Secure Communities program who are currently serving  criminal sentences in state and local prisons, as ICE has not yet detained  and removed them.

Further, the  contractor that ICE selected for the ACRIMe-1 contract did not develop a  system that met ICE\u2019s performance requirements. As a result, ICE  canceled the ACRIMe-1 contract, selected a new contractor in September  2011 to complete and deploy the modernized system, and expects to  award another contract by September 2012 to develop call center  functionalities within the modernized ACRIMe system that were originally  supposed to be delivered through the ACRIMe-1 contract. In August  2011, ICE also canceled the original SDS contract because of the delays  encountered with the ACRIMe-1 contract. Further, because of its  dissatisfaction with the quality of the work completed on the SDS  contract, ICE now plans to award additional contracts to different  contractors to start over with developing the services it requires. ICE has  also reduced the scope of the SDS services\u2019 capabilities (as discussed  below). As a result, ICE expects that the SDS services will be completed  for about $22 million less than the baseline cost estimate, even though it  spent $14.3 million on a contract that did not produce useable services. In  contrast, ICE has expanded the scope of the ATP requirements and  expects to exceed its baseline cost estimate by about $7.8 million. ICE  projects that for the ATP and SDS services, it will be able to meet and  potentially finish ahead of its estimated deployment dates. See appendix I  for additional information on all of ICE\u2019s ACRIMe-related contracts. Table  5 compares the baseline estimates for deployment and cost of the  projects, and status as of April 2012.", "The schedule delays and cost increases can be attributed in part to  weaknesses in ICE\u2019s planning, including ICE (1) not fully defining  requirements before awarding contracts and (2) not developing an  integrated master schedule.", "According to ICE officials, the agency did not fully define its requirements  before awarding the ACRIMe-1, ATP, or SDS contracts. We have  previously reported that firm requirements should be established at the  beginning of an acquisition program and that requirements should be well  defined to ensure communication about what the government needs from  the contractor providing services.", "Regarding the ACRIMe-1 contract, ICE officials stated that ICE\u2019s  requirements did not accurately reflect the needs of LESC system users  or fully define technical expectations. Although ICE involved LESC users  in the development of the system requirements, ICE officials told us that  ICE did not ensure the users\u2019 needs were clearly defined in the  requirements documentation and the contractor did not routinely meet  with the users to ensure its understanding of the requirements. As a  result, the contractor misinterpreted some of the requirements, according  to ICE officials. ICE revised the requirements after the contractor had  already conducted a significant amount of work, contributing to delays.  Further, ICE officials told us that ICE did not fully define its technical  expectations of the contractor, such as specific requirements for the  software code. According to the officials, ICE did not include more  specific technical requirements because it wanted to encourage the  contractor to develop innovative solutions and did not want to be too  prescriptive. However, the officials also noted that not having more  specific technical requirements contributed to the unsatisfactory  performance by the contractor in producing software that did not meet  ICE\u2019s needs. Consequently, ICE deemed the modernized ACRIMe  system the contractor delivered in April 2011 to be unusable, and ICE  awarded a new contract in September 2011 to a different contractor to  complete and deploy the system. ICE also plans to award another  contract for $1.7 million by September 2012, to develop call center  functionalities within the ACRIMe system that were originally supposed to  be developed under the ACRIMe-1 contract.", "Shortcomings in defining requirements and changes in the scope of the  requirements also contributed to cost increases on the ATP contract.  Specifically, cost increases occurred when, in August 2011, nearly 2  years after the ATP contract was awarded, ICE added a new requirement  that the contractor develop a \u201crisk classification assessment score.\u201d This  score is meant to help standardize the method for determining if an alien  should be detained by ICE or released on bond or other condition.  According to ICE, the requirement for a risk classification assessment  score was added to the ATP contract to support ICE detention reform  initiatives based on revisions that were made in 2011 to ICE\u2019s detention  standards. Among other things, the 2011 detention standards call for  detention facilities to take into account risk factors when making custody  decisions. Officials told us it would be more efficient to add the risk  classification assessment score requirement to the ATP contract than to  develop this capability through a separate system. However, the officials  also stated that ICE could do a better job of defining its requirements. As  of April 2011, ICE had spent about $21.5 million on acquiring the ATP  service, which is about 17 percent over ICE\u2019s baseline cost estimate of  $18.3 million. To complete the ATP service, ICE estimates that it may  need to spend an additional $4.6 million, for a total cost of $26.1 million.  This would be a 42 percent increase over ICE\u2019s baseline cost estimate.", "With respect to the SDS contract, in September 2010, about a year after  the SDS contract was awarded (and over 2 years after ACRIMe-1 was  awarded), ICE determined that the SDS contract requirements  overlapped significantly with those of the ACRIMe-1 contract. In  response, ICE expanded the scope of the SDS contract to include all of  the requirements for aggregating data from multiple law enforcement and  immigration databases that had previously been spread between the  ACRIMe-1 and SDS contracts, and eliminated the requirements from the  ACRIMe-1 contract. ICE officials stated that not clearly defining how the  SDS services would be integrated with the ACRIMe system was an  oversight. As with the ACRIMe-1 contract, ICE officials stated that the  technical requirements for the contract were not well defined, and this  contributed to the contractor producing poor-quality software.  Consequently, ICE spent $14.3 million for the SDS contract to develop  services that ICE found to be unusable. ICE terminated the SDS contract  in August 2011. As of April 2012, ICE officials planned to award four new  contracts at an estimated total cost of $5.4 million that would involve the  contractors starting over with developing services to enhance the  functionality of the modernized ACRIMe system. In commenting on a draft  of this report, in June 2012 ICE officials told us that to complete the SDS  services, they now plan to award two (instead of four) new contracts and  that they are incorporating the work that would have been done through  the two other previously planned contracts into other ACRIMe   modernization efforts.", "According to ICE officials, some of the documents the SDS contractor  developed, such as the Concept of Operations, will be used to help inform  future contractors\u2019 work. ICE officials noted that despite spending $14.3  million on the SDS contract, which did not produce useable  functionalities, ICE expects to spend about $22 million less than the  original cost estimate of $41.7 million because the scope of capabilities to  be provided by the contractor have been reduced. Specifically, ICE found  after awarding the SDS contract that it would be more technically  complicated and costly to develop the criminal alien tracking service than  it had anticipated, so ICE does not plan to pursue the development of this  functionality further. ICE officials acknowledged the importance of  establishing well-defined requirements going forward, but as of April  2012, ICE had not developed the requirements for the contracts it  planned to award starting in July 2012 through December 2012.of the challenges it has experienced as a result of unclear and changing  requirements, ICE could be better positioned to help prevent delays and  cost increases by establishing well-defined requirements that accurately  reflect both user and technical needs prior to awarding additional  contracts.", "Although ICE anticipates meeting its baseline deployment dates for the  SDS services that it plans to develop through new contracts, it has not  developed an integrated master schedule for completing ACRIMe  modernization. Rather, ICE has used the separate schedules developed  for each contract to manage the modernization effort. We have previously  reported that one critical management tool for complex systems that  involve the incorporation of a number of different projects\u2014in this case,  ACRIMe modernization\u2014is an integrated master schedule that allows  managers to monitor all work activities, how long the activities will take,  and how the activities are related to one another. Because ICE lacked  an integrated master schedule when it issued the first three ACRIMe  modernization contracts in 2008 and 2009, it was not well positioned to  understand how schedule changes in each individual contract would  affect the overall modernization effort. For example, ICE assumed that  the modernized ACRIMe system would be completed before work began  on the ATP and SDS contracts. However, the deployment of the  modernized ACRIMe system was delayed, and because ICE did not have  an integrated master schedule, ICE was not in a position to effectively  identify and resolve the effects of delays in the deployment of the  modernized ACRIMe system on the development of the SDS and ATP  services. Subsequently, the delays with the deployment of the  modernized ACRIMe system contributed to the cancellation of the SDS  contract and delayed the integration of the ATP service with the  modernized ACRIMe system, according to ICE officials.", "ICE is using an incremental development approach called \u201cAgile software development.\u201d  Agile software development is a philosophy based on selected values, such as the highest  priority is to satisfy customers through early and continuous delivery of valuable software;  delivering working software frequently; and that working software is the primary measure  of progress. was based on their knowledge of the remaining work to be done and past  experience developing schedules. However, they acknowledged that by  not developing an integrated master schedule, ICE did not meet best  practices for managing capital programs and recognized the importance  of having an integrated master schedule moving forward. Accordingly,  ICE officials said they began developing an integrated master schedule in  April 2012, during the course of our review. While we recognize this as a  positive step, it is too early to tell if ICE\u2019s efforts will result in an integrated  master schedule that reflects all of the tasks to be completed by the  agency and contractors. For example, as of May 2012, ICE had not  incorporated detailed project schedules for the four SDS services into its  integrated master schedule. GAO\u2019s Cost Estimating and Assessment  Guide states that an integrated master schedule should include all tasks  necessary to complete the project, including work to be performed by  both the government and contractors. Given the number of new  contracts ICE plans to award and its previous difficulties with accounting  for all contract activities and their interrelationships, ICE could help  ensure that its deployment schedule is reliable and mitigate schedule  risks by developing an integrated master schedule that includes all  activities and identifies dependencies among the complementary  contracts it plans to award."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Workforce Planning Could Improve Use of Resources under ACRIMe Modernization", "paragraphs": ["Various developments could change ICE\u2019s workforce requirements for  responding to state and local law enforcement\u2019s queries about aliens\u2019  immigration and criminal status, providing ICE with an opportunity to  examine the most efficient number and location of staff to accomplish the  task. One development is the anticipated deployment of modernized  ACRIMe to ICE field offices in December 2012, which could help reduce  the existing duplication of effort in analyzing immigration and criminal  status information. This duplication of effort involves ICE field office staff  repeating database searches that LESC has already conducted because  ACRIMe, which LESC uses to determine individuals\u2019 immigration status,  cannot generate reports or electronically transmit the results of LESC\u2019s  database searches to field offices; and field offices do not have access to  ACRIMe, necessitating that they conduct their own database searches.  According to ICE officials, such duplication of effort is necessary not only  because of the current ACRIMe system\u2019s limitations, but also because it  serves as a quality control to minimize the likelihood of ICE making an  incorrect arrest or detention decision. Modernized ACRIMe is expected to  reduce the total number of immigration status database searches  because the system is intended to be able to generate a report on the  databases searched and electronically transmit the results of those  searches. Another development is the anticipated increase in Secure  Communities matches as the program is activated nationwide. ICE  estimates indicate that when Secure Communities interoperability is  activated in all jurisdictions in fiscal year 2013, it expects an additional  approximately 90,000 Secure Communities queries will be generated  each year. In calendar year 2011, LESC conducted database searches  based on about 423,550 Secure Communities matches.", "As of April 2012, ICE had not determined or planned for how many staff it  will need to conduct these searches. The new system will be accessible  not only to LESC, as is currently the case, but also to field offices and  interoperability response centers ( which were set up primarily to analyze  an increased number of immigration status queries resulting from Secure  Communities), making it possible for multiple organizational entities in  ICE to conduct the database searches. LESC officials said that if they had  60 additional staff, LESC would be able to process all Secure  Communities requests for database searches for the entire country when  modernized ACRIMe is deployed; however, an expansion under way at  the Los Angeles response center could also accommodate additional staff  for processing Secure Communities database searches. ICE officials  have not yet addressed the role that LESC, the field-based response  centers, or other ICE components involved with immigration status  determination will have after modernized ACRIMe becomes operational.", "In its April 2012 report, DHS\u2019s Inspector General recommended that ICE  develop procedures to eliminate duplication in the process of identifying  potentially removable criminal aliens. Further, congressional staff  requested that ICE brief members in March 2012 regarding the efficient  allocation of resources between LESC and the response centers;  however, the briefing had not been scheduled as of June 8, 2012.  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government identifies  effective management of an organization\u2019s workforce as essential to  achieving results and maintaining internal control, and program  management guidance states that successful execution of any program  includes developing plans that include efficient use of workforce  resources.", "ICE officials acknowledged the need for comprehensive workforce  planning, but officials indicated to us and to DHS\u2019s Office of Inspector  General that the agency plans to wait until after Secure Communities is  activated nationwide and modernized ACRIMe becomes operational in  fiscal year 2013 to make decisions about how to effectively realign  resources. In August 2011 ICE completed an Operational Workforce  Analysis, which projected the additional ERO workforce needed for  detention and removal when Secure Communities is fully activated. A  separate ICE analysis provided estimates of the workforce needs at  LESC for analyzing an additional 90,000 queries. ICE\u2019s analyses,  however, did not consider the impact of modernized ACRIMe on  workforce requirements or how staff resources at response centers will be  utilized for making status determinations. Agency officials also said that  uncertainty about funding was a factor they would need to consider as  part of their planning. While planning efforts can be subject to uncertainty  about future funding, developing a workforce plan prior to full program  and system deployment could help position ICE so it is ready to  effectively align staff among components responding to law enforcement  agency queries when the modernized ACRIMe system is deployed."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "ICE and CRCL Identified Safeguards to Help Address Potential Civil Rights Abuses under Secure Communities; Some Efforts Have Not Yet Been Fully Implemented", "paragraphs": ["ICE and CRCL jointly identified four safeguards used to help protect  aliens\u2019 civil rights under Secure Communities.

The monitoring process is designed to take place in  three phases. In the first phase, CRCL\u2019s plan calls for analyzing crime,  arrest, and demographic data from activated jurisdictions to determine the  extent to which foreign-born individuals are arrested at a rate that is  proportional to their representation in the jurisdiction\u2019s population, and the  extent to which the types of charges for which foreign-born individuals are  arrested are proportional to the types of arrest charges for all individuals  in that jurisdiction.", "In the second phase, CRCL is conducting additional in-depth analyses of  arrest, crime, and demographic data on the 10 large jurisdictions (those  with populations over 100,000 that had over 30 Secure Communities  submissions for the quarter), and 5 smaller jurisdictions (those with  populations under 100,000) that produced the most anomalous results in  the first phase of the analysis. CRCL stated that anomalies may indicate  that police engaged in racial profiling, but they may also reflect local crime  patterns and legitimate police practices. For example, they said, in a  jurisdiction where highway patrol is a primary function, officers would be  making more traffic stops, and higher rates of traffic offenses might be  expected. According to CRCL, because its second-phase analysis relies  in part on data collected by local and state law enforcement agencies, the  data are frequently less consistent across jurisdictions.

In such cases, CRCL plans to identify and use other data,  such as the National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS),  another FBI UCR Program method for collecting crime data, and  arrest data, if available, that are publicly reported outside the  summary UCR system, by some states, such as Florida, through its  state UCR program.", "There is a lag between the time that the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s  American Community Survey collects and releases demographic  information on the foreign-born population in the United States.
