GAO was asked to discuss DOD's (1) force health protection and surveillance policies, (2) medical treatment policies that cover federal civilians while they are deployed to support contingency operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, and (3) differences in special pays and benefits provided to DOD's deployed federal civilian and military personnel. For this statement, GAO primarily drew on its September 2006 report that addressed these objectives. For its report, GAO analyzed over 3,400 deployment-related records at eight component locations for deployed federal civilians and policies related to defense health care, reviewed claims filed under the Federal Employees' Compensation Act (FECA); and examined major provisions of special pays and disability and death benefits provided to DOD's deployed federal civilians and military personnel."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In 2006, GAO reported that DOD had established force health protection and surveillance policies to assess and reduce or prevent health risks for its deployed federal civilians, but it lacked procedures to ensure implementation. GAO's review of over 3,400 deployment records found that components lacked documentation that some federal civilians who deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq had received, among other things, required pre- and post-deployment health assessments and immunizations. Also, DOD lacked centralized data to readily identify its deployed civilians and their movement in theater, thus hindering its efforts to assess the overall effectiveness of its force health protection and surveillance capabilities. GAO noted that until DOD establishes a mechanism to strengthen its oversight of this area, it would not be effectively positioned to ensure compliance with its policies, or the health care of deployed federal civilians. GAO also reported that DOD had established medical treatment policies for its deployed federal civilians, which provide those who require treatment for injuries or diseases sustained during overseas hostilities with care under the DOD military health system. GAO reviewed a sample of seven workers' compensation claims (out of a universe of 83) filed under FECA by DOD federal civilians who deployed to Iraq. GAO found in three cases where care was initiated in theater that the affected civilians had received treatment in accordance with DOD's policies. In all seven cases, DOD civilians who requested care after returning to the United States had, in accordance with DOD's policies, received medical examinations and/or treatment for their deployment-related injuries or diseases. GAO reported that DOD provides certain special pays and benefits to its deployed federal civilians, which generally differ in type and/or amount from those provided to deployed military personnel. For example, in cases where injuries are sustained while deployed, both DOD federal civilian and military personnel are eligible to receive government-provided disability benefits; however, the type and amount of the benefits vary, and some are unique to each group. Importantly, continuing challenges with modernizing federal disability programs have been the basis for GAO's designation of this as a high-risk area since 2003. In addition, while the survivors of deceased DOD federal civilian and military personnel generally receive similar types of cash survivor benefits for Social Security, burial expenses, and death gratuity, the comparative amounts of these benefits differ. However, survivors of DOD federal civilians almost always receive lower noncash benefits than military personnel. GAO does not take a position on the adequacy or appropriateness of the special pays and benefits provided to DOD federal civilian and military personnel. Any deliberations on this topic should include an examination of how such changes would affect ensuring adequate and appropriate benefits for those who serve their country, as well as the long-term fiscal well-being of the nation."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for the opportunity to be here today to discuss the Department  of Defense\u2019s (DOD) policies for its federal civilians who deploy in support  of contingency operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. First, let me emphasize  that as DOD has expanded its involvement in overseas military operations,  it has grown increasingly reliant on its federal civilian workforce to  provide support in times of war or national emergency. Further, in recent  years, DOD has undertaken efforts to expand the use of its civilian  workforce to perform combat support functions traditionally performed  by military personnel. Therefore, the need for attention to the policies and  benefits that affect the health and welfare of these individuals becomes  increasingly significant. Today\u2019s hearing is particularly timely considering  the continuing role of the United States in Afghanistan and Iraq as  discussed during last week\u2019s hearings.", "The structure of the armed forces is based on the Total Force concept,  which recognizes that all elements of the structure\u2014active duty military  personnel, reservists, defense contractors, host nation military and civilian  personnel, and DOD federal civilian employees\u2014contribute to national  defense. In recent years, federal civilian personnel have deployed along  with military personnel to participate in Operations Joint Endeavor,  conducted in the countries of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, and Hungary;  Joint Guardian, in Kosovo; and Desert Storm, in Southwest Asia. Further,  since the beginning of the Global War on Terrorism, the role of DOD\u2019s  federal civilian personnel has expanded to include participation in combat  support functions in Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom.", "DOD relies on the federal civilian personnel it deploys to support a range  of essential missions, including intelligence collection, criminal  investigations, and weapon systems acquisition and maintenance. To  ensure that its federal civilian employees will deploy to combat zones and  perform critical combat support functions in theater, DOD established the  emergency-essential program in 1985. Under this program, DOD  designates as \u201cemergency-essential\u201d those civilian employees whose  positions are required to ensure the success of combat operations or the  availability of combat-essential systems. DOD can deploy federal civilian  employees either on a voluntary or involuntary basis to accomplish the  DOD mission.", "DOD\u2019s use of its civilian personnel to support military operations has long  raised questions about its policies relating to the deployment of civilians in  support of contingency operations. In 1994, we reported on the adequacy  of DOD\u2019s planning for the future use of civilian personnel to support  military operations in combat areas and noted a number of problems in  deploying civilians to the Gulf War and caring for them in theater. For  example, we noted that many civilians had not been screened to ensure  that they were medically fit to serve in desert conditions. Thus, some had  arrived in the desert with medical and physical limitations, such as severe  heart problems and kidney disorders, that precluded them from effectively  performing their duties. Other problems, while not as grave, indicated a  lack of preparation for civilians in theater. For example, clear procedures  did not exist to ensure that civilians received medical care comparable to  that received by military personnel. In addition, procedures were not in  place to provide for overtime or danger pay that the deployed civilians  were eligible to receive.", "My testimony today will focus on (1) the extent to which DOD has  established and implemented force health protection and surveillance  policies, (2) medical treatment policies and procedures for its deployed  DOD federal civilians who require treatment for injuries and diseases, and  (3) the differences in special pays and benefits provided to DOD\u2019s  deployed federal civilians and military personnel. My remarks today are  primarily based on our September 2006 report on DOD\u2019s policies  concerning its federal civilians who have deployed in support of  operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. For the 2006 report, we reviewed DOD  deployment health requirements for contingency operations in  Afghanistan and Iraq. To assess the implementation of these requirements,  we analyzed over 3,400 deployment-related records for deployed federal  civilians. We also analyzed DOD policies and guidance related to defense  health care and discussed these with senior DOD and service surgeon  general officials. To assess the implementation of these policies, we  requested all workers\u2019 compensation claims that had been filed under the  Federal Employees\u2019 Compensation Act (FECA) by DOD federal civilians  who had deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq. We selected and reviewed a  non-probability sample of workers\u2019 compensation claims to reflect a range  of casualties, including injuries, physical and mental illnesses, and  diseases. The scope of our review did not extend to the Department of  Labor\u2019s claims review process, which covers the workers\u2019 compensation  claims process. We also examined the major provisions for special pays  and disability and death benefits for civilian and military personnel, relying  primarily on statutes, Department of State regulations, and DOD guidance.  We performed our review in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards.", "In summary, we found DOD had established force health protection and  surveillance policies aimed at assessing and reducing or preventing health  risks for its deployed federal civilian personnel, but lacked a quality  assurance mechanism to ensure the components\u2019 full compliance with its  policies, or the health care and protection of its deployed federal civilians.  DOD has taken steps in the right direction by issuing a new policy in  February 2007 toward that end. DOD has also established medical  treatment policies that cover its federal civilians while they are deployed  in support of contingency operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, and selected  workers\u2019 compensation claims that we reviewed confirmed that those  deployed federal civilians received care that was consistent with the  policies. Further, DOD provides certain special pays and benefits to its  deployed federal civilians, which generally differ in type and/or amount  from those provided to deployed military personnel. We are not taking a  position on the adequacy or appropriateness of the special pays and  benefits provided to DOD federal civilian and military personnel.

The Defense Manpower Data Center is  responsible for maintaining the department\u2019s centralized system that  currently collects location-specific deployment information for military  servicemembers, such as grid coordinates, latitude/longitude coordinates,  or geographic location codes. However, at the time of our review, DOD  had not taken steps to similarly maintain centralized data on its deployed  federal civilians. In addition, DOD had not provided guidance that would  require its components to track and report data on the locations and  movements of DOD federal civilian personnel in theaters of operations. In  the absence of such a requirement, each DOD component collected and  reported aggregated data that identified the total number of DOD federal  civilian personnel in a theater of operations, but each lacked the ability to  gather, analyze, and report information that could be used to specifically  identify individuals at risk for occupational and environmental exposures  during deployments.", "In previously reporting on the military services\u2019 implementation of DOD\u2019s  force health protection and surveillance policies in 2003, we highlighted  the importance of knowing the identity of servicemembers who deployed  during a given operation and of tracking their movements within the  theater of operations as major elements of a military medical surveillance  system. We further noted the Institute of Medicine\u2019s finding that  documentation on the location of units and individuals during a given  deployment is important for epidemiological studies and appropriate  medical care during and after deployments. For example, this information  allows epidemiologists to study the incidences of disease patterns across  populations of deployed servicemembers who may have been exposed to  diseases and hazards within the theater, and health care professionals to  treat their medical problems appropriately. Without location-specific  information for all of its deployed federal civilians and centralized data in  its department-level system, DOD limits its ability to ensure that sufficient  and appropriate consideration will also be given to addressing the health  care concerns of these individuals.", "At the time of our review, DOD also had not provided guidance to the  components that would require them to forward completed deployment  health assessments for all federal civilians to the Army Medical  Surveillance Activity, where these assessments are supposed to be  archived in the Defense Medical Surveillance System, integrated with  other historical and current data on personnel and deployments, and used  to monitor the health of personnel who participate in deployments. The  overall success of deployment force protection and surveillance efforts, in  large measure, depends on the completeness of health assessment data. In  our report, we noted that the lack of such data may hamper DOD\u2019s ability  to intervene in a timely manner to address health care problems that may  arise from DOD federal civilian deployments to overseas locations in  support of contingency operations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Has Taken Steps to Address Policy Shortcomings", "paragraphs": ["With increases in the department\u2019s use of federal civilian personnel to  support military operations, we noted in our report that DOD officials  have recognized the need for more complete and centralized location- specific deployment information and deployment-related health  information on its deployed federal civilians. In this regard, we further  noted that in August 2006, the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for  Personnel and Readiness issued revised policy and program guidance that  generally addressed the shortcomings in DOD\u2019s force health protection  and surveillance capabilities. The revised policy and guidance, that  became effective in December 2006, require the components within 3  years, to electronically report (at least weekly) to the Defense Manpower  Data Center, location-specific data for all deployed personnel, including  federal civilians. In addition, the policy and guidance require the  components to submit all completed health assessment forms to the Army  Medical Surveillance Activity for inclusion in the Defense Medical  Surveillance System.", "Nonetheless, in our 2006 report we noted that DOD\u2019s new policy is not  comprehensive enough to ensure that the department will be sufficiently  informed of the extent to which its components are complying with  existing health protection requirements for its deployed federal civilians.  Although the policy requires DOD components to report certain location- specific and health data for all of their deployed personnel, including  federal civilians, we noted that it does not establish an oversight and  quality assurance mechanism for assessing and ensuring the full  implementation of the force health protection and surveillance  requirements by all DOD components that our prior work has identified as  essential in providing care to military personnel.", "To strengthen DOD\u2019s force health protection and surveillance for its  deployed federal civilians, in our 2006 report, we recommended that DOD  establish an oversight and quality assurance mechanism to ensure that all  components fully comply with its requirements. In February 2007, the  Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Force Health  Protection and Readiness published a new instruction on force health  protection quality assurance. This policy applies to military  servicemembers as well as applicable DOD and contractor personnel. The  new policy requires the military services to implement procedures to  monitor key force health protection elements such as pre- and post- deployment health assessments. In addition, the policy requires each  military service to report its force health protection and quality assurance  findings to the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) through the  Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Force Health Protection and  Readiness. In our June 2007 report on DOD\u2019s compliance with the  legislative requirement to perform pre- and post-deployment medical  examinations on military servicemembers, we noted that DOD lacked a  comprehensive oversight framework to help ensure effective  implementation of its deployment health quality assurance program, which  included specific reporting requirements and results-oriented performance  measures to evaluate the services\u2019 adherence to deployment health  requirements. Also, we noted in our 2007 report that the department\u2019s new  instruction and planned actions indicate that DOD is taking steps in the  right direction.

These policies state  that DOD federal civilians who require treatment for injuries or diseases  sustained during overseas hostilities may be provided care under the DOD  military health system. DOD\u2019s military health system provides four levels  of medical care to personnel who are injured or become ill while deployed,  as shown in figure 1.", "Medical treatment during a military contingency begins with level one  care, which consists of basic first aid and emergency care at a unit in the  theater of operation. The treatment then moves to a second level of care,  where, at an aid station, injured or ill personnel are examined and  evaluated to determine their priority for continued movement outside of  the theater of operation and to the next (third) level of care. At the third  level, injured or ill personnel are treated in a medical installation staffed  and equipped for resuscitation, surgery, and postoperative care. Finally, at  the fourth level of care, which occurs far from the theater of operation,  injured or ill personnel are treated in a hospital staffed and equipped for  definitive care. Injured or ill DOD federal civilians deployed in support of  contingency operations in Afghanistan and Iraq who require level four  medical care are transported to DOD\u2019s Regional Medical Center in  Landstuhl, Germany.", "In our 2006 report, we found that injured or ill DOD federal civilians who  cannot be returned to duty in theater are evacuated to the United States  for continuation of medical care.

The policy stipulates that  federal civilians who are injured or become ill as a result of their  deployment must file a FECA claim with DOD, which then files a claim  with the Department of Labor\u2019s Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation  Programs (OWCP).", "The Department of Labor\u2019s OWCP is responsible for making a decision to  award or deny medical benefits.

Specifically, in  reviewing a sample of seven workers\u2019 compensation claims (out of a  universe of 83) filed under the Federal Employees\u2019 Compensation Act by  DOD federal civilians who deployed to Iraq, we found that in three cases  where care was initiated in theater the affected federal civilians had  received treatment in accordance with DOD\u2019s policies. For example, in  one case, a deployed federal civilian was treated for traumatic injuries at a  hospital outside of the theater of operation and could not return to duty in  theater because of the severity of the injuries sustained.

For civilian personnel, the  monthly payment amounts for total disability are generally similar to those  for permanent partial disability described earlier, but unlike with  permanent partial disabilities, the payments do not take into account any  wage earning capacity. Both groups are eligible to receive additional  compensation payments beyond the recurring payments similar to those  for permanent partial disability. DOD federal civilians with permanent  disabilities receive a schedule award based on the specific type of  impairment. In addition, DOD federal civilian personnel may be eligible for  an additional attendant allowance\u2014up to $1,500 per month during 2006\u2014 if such care is needed.
