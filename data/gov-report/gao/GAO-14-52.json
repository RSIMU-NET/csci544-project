The number of HRSA employees grew from 1,418 in fiscal year 2008 to 1,857 in fiscal year 2012. According to agency officials, the most common job function within HRSA is a project officer--an employee responsible for the oversight of grantees funded by the agency's programs; and HRSA has over 400 project officers. From fiscal years 2008 through 2012, HRSA lost an average of 9 percent of its staff annually to attrition. Of those who left HRSA in fiscal year 2012, approximately 59 percent resigned and 35 percent retired. Agency-wide, over 30 percent of HRSA's permanent employees will be eligible to retire by the end of fiscal year 2017. An even larger portion of HRSA's leadership, nearly 50 percent, will be eligible to retire by 2017. If a large portion of the agency's leadership were to actually retire during this time period, HRSA runs the risk of having gaps in leadership and potential loss of important institutional knowledge. HRSA periodically tracks attrition and retirement eligibility. To respond to retirements and other attrition, HRSA has instituted succession planning efforts which generally focus on leadership development for agency staff. For example, HRSA has instituted two leadership development programs, has two other programs under development, and has established mentoring and coaching programs.", "In fiscal year 2012, HRSA obligated over $240 million, or about 3 percent of its appropriations, to contracts to acquire goods and services necessary to support its operations, an amount that has generally remained steady over the past few years. Over half of the fiscal year 2012 contract obligations were for two categories of services--information technology and telecommunications services, and professional support services, which includes providing technical assistance to grantees. According to HRSA officials, the agency uses contracts to support its operations for a variety of reasons; these include supplementing HRSA staff or fulfilling short-term needs and performing functions that require specialized skills for which HRSA staff do not have the appropriate expertise, such as clinical or financial expertise.", "We provided a draft of this report to HHS for its review.

Based on this, we determined  that the data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes. To supplement  the data from FPDS-NG, we obtained information manually compiled by  HRSA on the organizational component supported by each contract with  obligations in fiscal year 2012. We also interviewed HRSA officials  knowledgeable about the agency\u2019s contracts, contracting data, and  approach to determining when and how to use contractors, and leaders of  HRSA\u2019s programmatic bureaus about how the bureaus use contracts to  support their programs.

In addition to these funding mechanisms, HRSA  uses contracts\u2014award mechanisms used to acquire services or property  from a non-federal party for the benefit or use of HRSA\u2014to support its  operations and programs.", "Grants constitute one form of federal assistance consisting of payments in cash or in  kind to a state or local government or a nongovernmental recipient for a specified  purpose. Cooperative agreements are another form of financial assistance similar to  grants, but where the federal agency is more involved with the recipient during the  performance of the project. HRSA also has programs that offer scholarships to students  and educational loan repayment to health care providers in exchange for a commitment to  provide care in underserved areas or for underserved populations.", "Through these mechanisms, HRSA provides funding and support for a  wide variety of programs. HRSA\u2019s programs include a block grant to fund  services for maternal and child health across the country, compensation  for people injured by vaccines, grants to a national network of health  centers to provide primary health care, loan repayment and scholarships  for recruiting and training health care providers who practice in  underserved communities, and grants to organizations providing services  for people living with HIV/AIDS. As a result of ARRA and PPACA,  HRSA has expanded some of its programs, and started new programs in  recent years.

The office includes HRSA\u2019s Administrator, Deputy  Administrator, and Senior Advisors. HRSA\u2019s seven programmatic bureaus  each manage a portfolio of activities dealing with a specific area of health  care services, systems, or workforce. Each of HRSA\u2019s bureaus is led by  an Associate Administrator and Deputy Associate Administrator, who are  generally members of the SES. The bureaus are organized into smaller  components called divisions or offices that are led by a director, generally  a GS-15, who reports to the bureau\u2019s Associate Administrator. Some of  these divisions and offices are further broken down into subcomponents  called branches which are led by chiefs who report to the division or office  directors.

These included creating new  organizational components, expanding or otherwise changing the  functions of some components, and consolidating functions in order to  eliminate a component. In addition, HRSA has made minor organizational  changes within bureaus, such as realigning branches or shifting oversight  responsibility of certain programs, and the staff responsible for them,  between or within bureaus. HRSA officials reported that organizational  changes were generally made to improve agency efficiency. For example,  in 2010, HRSA established the Office of Operations to consolidate three  previously separate offices: (1) the Office of Information Technology;      (2) the Office of Management; and (3) the Office of Financial  Management, which consisted of procurement, budget, policy, and control  functions. These offices had formerly each reported directly to the Office  of the Administrator. With this restructuring, the Chief Operating Officer\u2014 a position created in 2010\u2014gained responsibility for oversight of these  functions. In at least one instance, HRSA made a change as a result of a  legislative requirement, namely, in October 2011 HRSA made its Office of  Women\u2019s Health, which was previously located within its Maternal and  Child Health Bureau, a separate office in response to a requirement in  PPACA that the office be established within the Office of the  Administrator. Most recently, as a result of fiscal circumstances,  including the sequester which went into effect in March 2013, and an  ongoing hiring freeze in effect since January 2013, HRSA eliminated its  Office of Special Health Affairs and distributed most of its functions to  other existing bureaus and offices.

According to HRSA officials,  each bureau and office develops a proposal to request contracts, budget,  and other resources for the coming fiscal year. Next, these proposals are  shared and discussed among all bureau and office leaders to allow for  coordination and to reduce the risk of duplication or overlap of resources.  Finally, HRSA\u2019s Administrator makes a determination about resource  allocation\u2014such as budgets and contracts for the coming fiscal year\u2014 which is documented in a decision memo for each bureau and office.", "Agency officials told us that this process improves efficiency and reduces  the chance for duplication of effort among the bureaus and offices.", "In addition, HRSA has established 20 active workgroups to coordinate  across the agency\u2019s bureaus and offices on cross-cutting topics. For  example, according to agency officials, HRSA established a workgroup in  April 2010\u2014 following the passage of PPACA\u2014to coordinate  communications and activities related to the implementation of provisions  in the act pertaining to HRSA. The workgroup includes senior leaders  from across the agency or their designees. In November 2012, HRSA  established a Standard Operating Procedures Workgroup to monitor the  implementation of standard operating procedures related to grantee  oversight across bureaus, discuss the status of implementation, and to  share successful practices regarding their use. Members include  individuals who are tasked with leading the implementation of standard  operating procedures within each bureau. Another workgroup\u2014the HRSA  Program Integrity Initiative Workgroup, launched in June 2010\u2014is tasked  with identifying risks to the agency\u2019s management of programs and  working to reduce those risks by initiating new or improved oversight  efforts. The workgroup is comprised of representatives from all bureaus  and offices. Other established workgroups focus on issues such as  providing technical assistance to potential grantees who may be new to  the application process, analyzing requests for information technology  capital projects, and monitoring performance of the agency\u2019s ongoing  technology investments.

The Office of the  Administrator uses a variety of standing meetings and reporting tools to  communicate and exchange information with bureau and office leadership  on a broad range of policy, program, and management matters. For  example, HRSA\u2019s Administrator holds a weekly senior staff meeting with  the leaders of all of HRSA\u2019s bureaus and offices. Topics for discussion  include HRSA\u2019s budget, operations, and implementation of PPACA.  During these meetings, bureau and office leaders have the opportunity to  share their concerns and discuss issues that they think may be of interest  to the other organizational components of the agency.

Officials indicated that HRSA\u2019s  Administrator meets monthly with the directors from all nine operational  support offices; officials from the Office of the Administrator also meet  weekly for one-on-one discussions with the directors from most of these  offices. In addition, the leaders of each of the bureaus told us they hold  regular meetings with their staff such as one-on-one meetings with  division directors, weekly senior staff meetings within the bureau where  participants can raise issues of concern or topics for discussion, and \u201call- hands\u201d meetings used to inform all bureau staff.", "In addition to participating in these standing meetings, bureau leaders  make use of routine reports and other written communication to convey  key programmatic information from the bureau to the Office of the  Administrator. For example, bureau leaders provide monthly written  updates on their programs and activities for inclusion in an agency-level  report for the Secretary of HHS. These reports include information about  HRSA collaboration with other agencies, programmatic updates, status of  efforts related to PPACA, areas of concern, and completed congressional  testimonies. HRSA officials also prepare decision papers to outline policy  options for the Administrator\u2019s consideration.

In fiscal  year 2012, attrition ranged from a high of 16.1 percent among GS-1s  through GS-8s to a low of 3.9 percent for SES employees. While three  organizational components, including the Office of the Administrator, had  no attrition in fiscal year 2012, the Office of Planning, Analysis, and  Evaluation had an attrition rate over 21 percent. Across HRSA\u2019s  programmatic bureaus, attrition rates ranged from 6.1 percent in the  Office of Rural Health Policy to 13.4 percent in the Bureau of Health  Professions. (See fig. 7.)", "Agency-wide, 31.3 percent of HRSA\u2019s permanent employees will be  eligible to retire by the end of fiscal year 2017; a rate similar to that for the  entire federal government. However, a larger portion of HRSA\u2019s  leadership, nearly 50 percent, is eligible to retire in the next few years.  Specifically, over 55 percent of HRSA\u2019s SES employees, who serve as  the leaders of HRSA\u2019s bureaus and offices, and almost 50 percent of   GS-15s, which include Division Directors, will be eligible to retire by the  end of fiscal year 2017. Although eligibility to retire does not necessarily  mean that employees will do so at the time they become eligible, if there  were a large number of retirements among the agency\u2019s leadership  during this time period, HRSA runs the risk of having gaps in leadership  and potential loss of important institutional knowledge.", "Within HRSA, retirement eligibility rates also vary by organizational  component. By fiscal year 2017, over 40 percent of the employees in  HRSA\u2019s Office of the Administrator, the Healthcare Systems Bureau, the  Maternal and Child Health Bureau, and several of HRSA\u2019s operational  support offices, will be eligible to retire. (See fig. 8.)", "HRSA periodically tracks attrition and retirement eligibility data. Collecting  and analyzing data on attrition rates and retirement eligibility are  considered a fundamental element for measuring the effectiveness of  human capital approaches in support of an agency\u2019s mission and goals.  HRSA receives a quarterly report from HHS that provides agency-wide  attrition data by reason for departure. Additionally, HRSA officials stated  that staff in the Office of Operations track employee attrition data as  needed for making agency-wide hiring and budget decisions. According  to these officials, staff attrition data is shared with leaders of the  programmatic bureaus and operational support offices as requested, or  when high rates of attrition occur.", "In addition to reviewing attrition data, officials from several bureaus  reported that they use information from exit interviews to help them  understand the reasons for attrition. According to officials, a common  reason why staff leave the agency is limited promotion potential,  particularly from the GS-12 or GS-13 levels into more senior positions.  Another reason officials reported for attrition is that some employees have  expertise or skill sets that are easily transferrable and in demand  elsewhere, including within other HHS and federal agencies. In particular,  officials noted that the skill sets of project officers and those with  information technology backgrounds are highly sought elsewhere in the  government. While exit interviews provide insight into why staff are  leaving the agency, officials also reported that they use information from  the Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey to get a sense of the number of  staff considering leaving the agency in the next year.", "HRSA also tracks retirement eligibility at the agency, bureau, and office  levels. Quarterly, HRSA receives agency-wide data from HHS on the  proportion of staff, including supervisory staff, eligible to retire in the next  5 years. Additionally, in early 2013, HRSA officials began providing  leaders in each bureau and office with the names and retirement eligibility  dates of their staff who are eligible to retire within the next 5 years. HRSA  officials indicated they plan to provide these data on an annual basis  going forward; however, officials indicated that the retirement eligibility  reports are of limited use to them because eligibility to retire does not  mean that an employee actually plans to retire.", "To respond to retirements and other types of attrition, HRSA has  instituted succession planning efforts which generally focus on providing  leadership development to agency staff. In 2011, HRSA launched two  agency-wide leadership development programs to help prepare staff to  take on leadership roles when such opportunities arise. One of these  programs, the Mid-Level Leadership Development Program, is for staff at  the GS-12 and GS-13 levels and focuses on leadership skills  development, interdepartmental project experience, exposure to HRSA  leaders, and an understanding of HRSA\u2019s mission, challenges, and  opportunities. The other program, the Administrative Management  Development Program, focuses on individuals who are interested in  careers handling the administrative management functions of the agency.  HRSA officials indicated that, as of September 2013, 59 staff had  completed one of these two programs. According to HRSA officials, as of  July 2013, the agency was in the process of developing two additional  leadership development programs\u2014one targeted to staff at the GS-11  level and below and another for staff at the GS-14 and GS-15 levels.  Officials estimated these additional programs would become operational  in fiscal year 2014.", "In addition to leadership development programs, HRSA officials said that  there are several other opportunities for staff to gain leadership  experience and professional development. For example, HRSA has  established a mentoring program, which focuses on leadership  development for both the participating mentor and mentee, and a  coaching program, which provides participating supervisors and  managers with opportunities to focus on specific areas for further  development. Officials across the agency also promote opportunities for  employees to be assigned to acting roles in more senior positions when  there is a vacant position or when a supervisor is on leave. For example,  if a branch chief were to retire or be out of the office for an extended  period, a senior level employee in the branch may be asked to act as the  branch chief until the position can officially be filled or the branch chief  returns. HRSA officials indicated that they work to train individuals to  enhance their capabilities, which may better position staff to be  successful candidates when leadership positions open up in the agency.  In addition, opportunities to serve in an acting capacity in a role more  senior to their own allows employees to smoothly transition into a position  should they be selected for it on a permanent basis. For example, HRSA  officials we spoke with told us that when the Associate Administrator of  one of the bureaus was recently promoted\u2014leaving a key vacancy\u2014the  Deputy Associate Administrator served as Acting Associate Administrator  until promoted into the position permanently. Leaders from some bureaus  also noted additional bureau-specific succession planning efforts. For  example, the HIV/AIDS Bureau created its Organizational Development  Unit in fiscal year 2012 to help deal with staff attrition issues within the  bureau by providing training, helping staff create individual development  plans, and providing mentoring opportunities to encourage staff to stay  and continue to grow professionally.", "HRSA officials told us they also promote cross-training opportunities  among staff, where employees work on multiple programs to assure a  broader range of knowledge so that they are able to take over for each  other should someone leave the bureau or agency. For example, Office of  Rural Health Policy leaders said that they have their staff work on multiple  programs to ensure they obtain a broader range of skills than they would  acquire by working on just one program. Similarly, they assign their policy  staff to a lead and backup role on key regulations so that if one person  leaves the organization or is out of the office for an extended period of  time, another is also familiar with the topic and able to complete the  review. HRSA officials noted that some of these succession planning  efforts, such as leadership training, also help with staff retention. In  addition, officials noted that they have other efforts in place to promote  staff retention, such as employee recognition and morale boosting  opportunities."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "HRSA Obligated Over $240 Million for Contracts in Fiscal Year 2012, the Majority of Which Were for Information Technology and Program Support", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal year 2012, HRSA obligated over $240 million, or about 3 percent  of its appropriations, to contracts to acquire goods or services necessary  to support its operations. With the exception of fiscal year 2008, when  HRSA had approximately $167 million in contract obligations, the amount  of HRSA\u2019s contract obligations generally remained steady over the past   5 years. (See fig. 9.)", "The vast majority of HRSA\u2019s fiscal year 2012 contract obligations  (approximately 97 percent) were used to obtain services, while the  remaining 3 percent of obligations went toward goods, such as computer  software. Nearly 60 percent of HRSA\u2019s fiscal year 2012 contract   (1) information  obligations were for two categories of services:technology and telecommunications services, which includes HRSA\u2019s  contract to support the operation and management of the agency\u2019s online  system for documenting its grantee oversight activities, called the  Electronic Handbook; and (2) professional support services, which  includes HRSA\u2019s contracts for the provision of technical assistance, such  as site visits, to grantees. (See table 2.)", "In fiscal year 2012, nearly 40 percent, or $95,697,751, of HRSA\u2019s contract  obligations provided cross-cutting support, meaning that they were  utilized by more than one HRSA organizational component. The  remaining 60 percent of HRSA\u2019s obligations were for programs and  activities specific to a single programmatic bureau, though the amount of  obligations varied by bureau. (See table 3 for a summary of the amount of  contract obligations by organizational component and app. II for  information on the contract with the highest obligation for each  component.)", "HRSA\u2019s bureaus utilized contracts for different purposes. For example,  nearly 78 percent of the Bureau of Health Profession\u2019s fiscal year 2012  obligations were for information technology and telecommunications  services, primarily for the National Practitioner Data Bank, while the  Maternal and Child Health Bureau did not have any obligations for that  purpose.Bureau\u2019s obligations in fiscal year 2012 were for professional services  such as for a newborn hearing, screening, and intervention programs  study, while about 12 percent of the Bureau of Health Professions\u2019  obligations were for professional services. See appendix III for  information on the top categories of contracted services or goods by  organizational component.", "Conversely, 69 percent of the Maternal and Child Health  According to HRSA officials, the agency uses contracts to support its  operations for a variety of reasons, including to supplement HRSA staff  because of time constraints, or to fulfill short-term needs. In addition,  HRSA uses contracts to perform functions that require specialized skills  for which HRSA staff do not have the appropriate expertise, such as  clinical or financial expertise. For example, the Office of Rural Health  Policy uses contract staff with special expertise in areas such as oral and  primary health care to provide technical assistance to its broad range of  grantees, while the Bureau of Primary Health Care uses contract staff  with financial expertise to conduct site-visits to health center grantees,  assist HRSA staff with understanding grantees\u2019 financial audits, and help  grantees develop plans to improve their financial stability. Furthermore,  according to HRSA officials, the agency uses contracts to support its  operations when contract staff can perform the functions more efficiently  and at a lower cost than HRSA staff. For instance, the Maternal and Child  Health Bureau obtains logistical support services, such as supporting  large advisory committee meetings, from a contractor because it is more  efficient and cost effective than having bureau staff manage these  functions. Finally, HRSA uses contracts for other reasons including when  the agency is legislatively required to do so. For example, HRSA is  required by law to contract with one or more entities to carry out certain  aspects of its C.W.
