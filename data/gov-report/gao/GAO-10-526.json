Previously, the Department of Defense's (DOD) increased reliance on the private sector for depot maintenance support, coupled with downsizing, led to a general deterioration in the capabilities, reliability, and cost-effectiveness of the military services' depots. In March 2007, the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (OUSD (AT&L)) directed each service to submit a depot maintenance strategic plan and provided direction for the content of those plans. The Air Force issued two documents in response to this direction--a Strategy and a Master Plan. GAO used qualitative content analyses to determine the extent to which the Air Force's collective plan addresses (1) key elements of a results-oriented management framework and (2) OUSD's (AT&L) direction for the plan's content."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["While the Air Force plan focuses efforts on weapon system and equipment operational availability, it does not fully address the elements of a results-oriented management framework, nor does it clearly link information between the plan's two component documents. GAO's prior work has shown that seven elements of a results-oriented management framework are critical for comprehensive strategic planning. The plan fully addresses one of these elements by including a mission statement that summarizes the Air Force depots' major functions and operations, but it partially addresses or does not address the remaining six elements. For example, while the plan describes goals for the depots' mission-related functions, it does not provide time frames to achieve them. Additionally, the plan does not discuss any factors beyond the Air Force's control that could affect its ability to achieve the plan's goals nor does it identify how the Air Force will evaluate its programs and use the results of such evaluations to adjust the plan's long-term goals and strategies to achieve desired levels of performance. Moreover, the content of the plan's two component documents are not clearly linked to one another. For example, the goals listed in the Strategy are not clearly repeated in the Master Plan, and the Master Plan includes goals that are unrelated to depot maintenance. Nor does the Master Plan clearly align its content to the five long-term goals described in the Strategy. The plan does not fully address the elements of a results-oriented management framework and the plan's two documents are not clearly linked to one another in part because of weaknesses in oversight. Specifically, although OUSD (AT&L) established an oversight body, which included senior representatives from OUSD (AT&L) and the services, to review the services' plans, this body did not review the plan. Also, the Air Force did not establish an oversight mechanism to review its plan. The plan's weaknesses may limit the Air Force's ability to use its plan as a tool to meet future challenges. In addition, the Air Force plan is not fully responsive to OUSD's (AT&L) direction to the services that was designed to provide the services with a framework to meet future challenges. OUSD (AT&L) directed the services to address 10 specific issues in four general areas: logistics transformation, core logistics capability assurance, workforce revitalization, and capital investment. The plan partially addresses 8 of these issues and does not address the remaining two. For example, while the plan notes that the Air Force is partnering with local universities and technical schools to provide training to reengineer existing employees' skills, the plan does not address Air Force actions to identify new and emerging skill requirements, as directed. Furthermore, the plan does not discuss any benchmarks to evaluate the adequacy of investment funding, as directed. As discussed for the elements of a results-oriented management framework, the plan does not fully respond to OUSD (AT&L)'s direction for the plan's content in part because of weaknesses in oversight in both OUSD (AT&L) and the Air Force. The plan's shortcomings may limit the Air Force's assurance that its depots are postured and resourced to meet future maintenance challenges."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Air Force\u2019s three maintenance depots provide equipment repair and  sustainment services that are critical to supporting ongoing operations  around the world.

In 2001, DOD identified performance- based logistics as its preferred support strategy, further increasing  reliance on contractors to support many of its weapon systems.", "In 2003 and again in 2006, the House Armed Services Committee  encouraged DOD to develop a comprehensive depot maintenance  strategy. In March 2007, the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for  Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (OUSD (AT&L)) issued DOD\u2019s  depot maintenance strategic plan, which articulated the department\u2019s  strategy for posturing and resourcing the depots to meet the national  security and materiel readiness challenges of the 21st century. In March  2007, the Office of the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Logistics  and Materiel Readiness, within OUSD (AT&L), directed each of the  services to conduct strategic planning for depot maintenance and submit  plans that focus on achieving DOD\u2019s strategy. In response, the Air Force  published its Air Force Depot Maintenance Strategic Plan, known as the  Strategy, in April 2008. In addition, it published the Air Force Depot  Maintenance Master Plan, known as the Master Plan, in March 2009.  According to Air Force officials, these two documents collectively respond  to OUSD (AT&L)\u2019s direction. DOD\u2019s 2007 Depot Maintenance Strategy and  Implementation Plans also noted that the services would update their  depot maintenance strategic plans no later than 6 months after the  publication of an updated DOD depot maintenance strategic plan, which  will be published within 6 months of the publication of the February 2010  Quadrennial Defense Review Report.", "Our prior work has shown that organizations conducting strategic  planning need to develop a comprehensive, results-oriented management  framework to provide an approach whereby program effectiveness is  measured in terms of outcomes or impact, rather than outputs, such as  activities and processes. Such a framework includes seven critical  elements: a comprehensive mission statement; long-term goals; strategies  to achieve the goals; use of metrics to gauge progress; identification of key  external factors that could affect the achievement of the goals; a  description of how program evaluations will be used; and stakeholder  involvement in developing the plan. In its March 2007 call for strategic  plans, OUSD (AT&L) directed the services to address many of these same  elements in their strategic plans. In addition, OUSD (AT&L) directed the  services to address 10 specific issues in four general areas: logistics  transformation, core logistics capability assurance, workforce  revitalization, and capital investment. OUSD (AT&L) officials told us that  the direction in these four areas was designed to provide the services\u2019  plans with a framework to meet future challenges.", "In September 2009, we issued a report on the Army\u2019s and Marine Corps\u2019  depot maintenance strategic plans.

As agreed with your office, this  report addresses two questions on the Air Force\u2019s strategic plan for depot  maintenance: (1) To what extent does the Air Force\u2019s strategic plan for  depot maintenance address key elements of a results-oriented  management framework? and (2) To what extent does the Air Force\u2019s  depot maintenance strategic plan address OUSD (AT&L)\u2019s direction that  was designed to provide a framework for the services to meet future  challenges? We are issuing a separate report on the Navy depot  maintenance strategic plan. The Related GAO Products section at the end  of the report lists additional publications on related topics.", "We used the same set of methodological procedures to answer both  questions, and each type of procedure was performed simultaneously for  the two questions. Specifically, we reviewed the Air Force\u2019s depot  maintenance strategic plan, which is composed of the Strategy and Master  Plan. We evaluated the Air Force\u2019s plan using qualitative content analyses  to compare information in it against criteria from the seven elements of a  results-oriented management framework and the 10 issues listed in the  OUSD (AT&L) direction for depot maintenance strategic plans. To  conduct these analyses, we first developed a data collection instrument  that incorporated these two types of criteria. One team member then  analyzed the plan using this instrument. To verify preliminary observations  from this initial analysis, a second team member concurrently conducted  an independent analysis of the plan. We compared the two sets of  observations and discussed any differences. We reconciled the differences  with the assistance of analysts from the team that was evaluating the Navy  depot maintenance strategic plan. We met with Air Force officials to  confirm our understanding of the plan and sought additional information  where our preliminary analyses revealed that the plan partially addresses  or does not address criteria. We also interviewed and obtained  documentary evidence from relevant OUSD (AT&L) officials on its  oversight of the services\u2019 plans. Additionally, we interviewed depot leaders  and strategic planning personnel during site visits at two of the three Air  Force depots to obtain first-hand information on issues the depots face.  We also obtained data on workload and personnel from the Air Force and  determined that these data were sufficiently reliable for our report. More  detailed information on our scope and methodology is provided in  appendix I.", "We conducted this performance audit from July 2009 through May 2010 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

Mission statement: A statement that concisely summarizes what the  organization does, presenting the main purposes for all its major  functions and operations.  2.  Long-term goals: A specific set of policy, programmatic, and  management goals for the programs and operations covered in the  strategic plan. The long-term goals should correspond to the purposes  set forth in the mission statement and develop with greater specificity  how an organization will carry out its mission.  3.  Strategies to achieve the goals: A description of how the goals  contained in the strategic plan are to be achieved, including the  operational processes; skills and technology; and the human, capital,  information, and other resources required to meet these goals.  4.

Key external factors that could affect goals: Key factors external to  the organization and beyond its control that could significantly affect  the achievement of the long-term goals contained in the strategic plan.  These external factors can include economic, demographic, social,  technological, or environmental factors, as well as conditions or events  that would affect the organization\u2019s ability to achieve its goals.  6.  Program evaluations: Assessments, through objective measurement  and systematic analysis, of the manner and extent to which programs  associated with the strategic plan achieve their intended goals.  7.

However, the Air Force plan  does not discuss the OUSD (AT&L) direction to address the projected  effects of weapon system retirements or bed-down (i.e., the act or process  of locating aircraft at a particular base). However, the Air Force plans to  substantially reduce some portions of its fleet. In May 2009, the Air Force  announced that it would accelerate the retirement of 249 older aircraft,  including 112 F-15s and 134 F-16s. While these retirements will affect the  workload at the Air Force depots at Warner-Robins, Georgia, and Ogden,  Utah, the Master Plan issued 2 months earlier does not include any  information on the planned changes. Moreover, the plan does not discuss  new aircraft that will replace those being retired, the future workload  estimates associated with any potential replacement aircraft, or the  processes that will be used to determine which facilities will obtain any  new work."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Plan Partially Addresses Two of the Workforce Revitalization Issues but It Does Not Address the Third Issue in This Area", "paragraphs": ["The Air Force plan partially addresses both reengineering and  replenishment strategies but does not contain information on the OUSD  (AT&L)-directed workforce replenishment requirements. Regarding the  reengineering strategies issue, the plan discusses actions the Air Force is  taking to reengineer its existing employees\u2019 skills to satisfy new capability  requirements, but it does not discuss actions the service is taking to  identify new skill requirements. To address reengineering existing  employees\u2019 skills, the plan indicates that the depots are partnering with  local universities and technical schools to provide training. However, it  does not directly address the Air Force actions to identify new skill  requirements. Instead of providing details on new skill requirements, the  plan makes a general statement that the Air Force\u2019s workforce skill  capabilities are continuously assessed to determine future training and  skill requirements. Likewise, it is silent on specific actions the Air Force is  taking to carry out this assessment.", "The plan does not discuss the method the Air Force will use to forecast  workforce replenishment requirements, nor the quantitative data needed  to project annual hires as well as losses due to retirements and other  reasons. Although the plan discusses a manpower and capability program  that determines the required personnel for future work, the plan does not  follow the OUSD (AT&L) direction to discuss the methods or sources of  quantitative data the Air Force uses to determine turnover and the timing  of the turnover.", "To address the replenishment strategies issues, the plan describes actions  the Air Force is taking to train employees, but it does not discuss how the  Air Force is recruiting new employees, nor does it discuss a  comprehensive management approach for establishing and implementing  an employee replenishment strategy. The plan discusses, for example, a  university and vocational school partnership program to train depot  employees. However, it is silent on the Air Force\u2019s recruiting methods  (e.g., for hard to fill types of positions) and any servicewide employee  replenishment strategy.", "The Air Force plan\u2019s limited and missing information for the three issues in  the workforce revitalization area is noteworthy in the context of our  previous findings on the DOD depot maintenance workforce and in the  context of information in the OUSD (AT&L)\u2019s document directing the  services to provide the plans. In 2003, we reported that DOD faced  significant management challenges in succession planning to maintain a  skilled workforce at its depot maintenance facilities. Among other  challenges, we reported that relatively high numbers of civilian workers at  maintenance depots were nearing retirement age. DOD\u2019s Depot  Maintenance Strategy and Implementation Plans makes a similar point. It  states that DOD\u2019s depot maintenance community, like the rest of the  federal government, faces increasing numbers of retirements as the \u201cbaby  boom\u201d generation reaches retirement eligibility. It goes on to state that the  retirement-eligible population within the depot maintenance workforce  and forecasted annual retirements are expected to increase annually for  the remainder of the decade. This dynamic\u2014coupled with the highly  skilled nature of some depot maintenance work and the length of time  required to train new employees\u2014creates hiring, training, and retention  challenges. Without a discussion that acknowledges these and other such  workforce challenges, it is unclear how well the Air Force is positioned to  optimally address the challenges that its depots face."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Plan Partially Addresses One Capital Investment Issue but Does Not Address the Other", "paragraphs": ["The Air Force plan partially addresses the capital investment issue of  quantifying current capabilities but does not address the other issue\u2014 capital investment benchmarks.

Even though the plan does not address benchmarks,  it notes that the Air Force intends to continue making an annual capital  investment of at least 6 percent of revenue, as required by law, to sustain  depot infrastructure requirements. Moreover, an OUSD (AT&L) official  mentioned that the Air Force\u2019s citing of the 6 percent capital investment  should be seen as addressing the benchmark issue.", "The plan partially addresses the issues pertaining to the methods for  quantitatively articulating these concerns: current capabilities, current and  projected deficiencies, and the capabilities that planned investment will  provide. The plan notes that the Air Force targets its investments to the  highest priority needs to support the warfighter. While the plan also  discusses an infrastructure investment prioritization process, it does not  describe the method for prioritizing needed investments. Similarly, the  plan notes that the Air Force invests in facility restorations and  modernizations and discusses the Capital Purchase Program for  equipment, restoration, and modernization programs for facilities,  transformation initiatives, and military construction. However, the plan  does not present quantitative data on the projected funding (or shortfalls)  for facilities and equipment.", "Capital investment in DOD depots has been an issue of concern in our  prior work. For example, in 2001, we reported that capital investments in  depot plant equipment had declined sharply in the mid-1990s as a result of  defense downsizing and depot closures and consolidations. As a result of  DOD\u2019s lack of capital investment, its depots did not keep up with the latest  technologies. In subsequent years, funding levels increased as the services  recognized the need to modernize their depots."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["OUSD (AT&L) officials told us that the primary intent of the OUSD  (AT&L)\u2019s direction was to provide a framework for the services to meet  challenges in the future and that the issues identified in the four areas  specified in the direction were designed to address those challenges.  Further, DOD\u2019s Depot Maintenance Strategy and Implementation Plans  states that each service will conduct depot maintenance strategic planning  that focuses on achieving the DOD depot maintenance strategy and that  the DOD strategy will ensure that DOD is postured to meet the national  security and materiel readiness challenges of the 21st century. However,  the Air Force\u2019s plan does not provide a comprehensive, results-oriented  management framework to efficiently and effectively inform the Air  Force\u2019s future decisions, nor does it fully respond to OUSD (AT&L)\u2019s  direction that was designed to provide a framework for the services to  overcome four general areas of future challenges. Furthermore, the limited  linkage of information in the Air Force\u2019s two planning documents may  reduce the utility of the plan as a decision-making tool to meet future  challenges. A primary reason for not fully addressing these framework  elements and linkages in the plan was that OUSD (AT&L) and the Air  Force did not have effective oversight mechanisms in place to promptly  identify the incomplete information, communicate such findings to the  plan developers, and monitor the revision of the plan to ensure that the  limitations had been addressed. These concerns about the content,  linkage, and oversight resulted in a plan that missed an opportunity to  identify a more complete Air Force vision for the effective and efficient  operation of its depots in the future. For example, had the Air Force  identified and implemented systematic program evaluation and a thorough  set of metrics to directly assess goal achievement, it would have additional  tools for reacting in a timely manner to findings from the ongoing  congressionally mandated study on depot capabilities.

For our analysis, we first reviewed relevant laws;  Department of Defense (DOD) and Air Force regulations governing depot  maintenance; and depot maintenance-related reports issued by agencies  and organizations including GAO, DOD, the Logistics Management  Institute, and RAND. We then used qualitative content analyses to  compare the Air Force plan against criteria from the seven elements of a  results-oriented management framework and the 10 issues listed in the  OUSD (AT&L) direction for depot maintenance strategic plans. To  conduct these analyses, we first developed a data collection instrument  that incorporated these two types of criteria. One team member then  analyzed the plan using this instrument. To verify preliminary observations  from this initial analysis, a second team member concurrently conducted  an independent analysis of the plan. We compared observations of the two  analysts and discussed any differences. We reconciled the differences with  the assistance of analysts from the team that was evaluating the Navy  depot maintenance strategic plan. We subsequently met with Air Force  officials to confirm our understanding of the plan and sought additional  information where our preliminary analyses revealed that the plan  partially addresses or does not address the criteria. We also interviewed  and obtained documentary evidence from relevant OUSD (AT&L) officials  regarding its oversight of the services\u2019 plans.
