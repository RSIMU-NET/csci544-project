Since 1993, the Departments of Energy (DOE) and Defense (DOD) have worked to improve security at sites housing weapons-usable nuclear material and warheads in Russia and other countries. In 1995, DOE established the Materials Protection, Control, and Accounting (MPC&A) program to implement these efforts.

To address these objectives, among other things, GAO analyzed agency documents, conducted interviews with key program officials, and visited four Russian nuclear sites."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Through fiscal year 2006, DOE and DOD spent over $2.2 billion to provide security upgrades and other assistance at sites in Russia and other countries that house weapons-usable nuclear materials and warheads. With regard to securing nuclear material, DOE reports to have \"secured\" 175 buildings and plans to improve security at 35 additional buildings by the end of 2008. However, DOE's reported total of buildings \"secured\" does not recognize that additional upgrades remain to be completed at some buildings because DOE considers a building \"secured\" after it has received only limited MPC&A upgrades, even when additional comprehensive upgrades are planned. Further, DOE and Russia have developed a Joint Action Plan that includes 20 sites and details the remaining work to be accomplished by 2008. However, the plan does not include two sites containing many buildings with vast amounts of nuclear material where Russia has denied DOE access. DOE and DOD report to have improved security at 62 Russian warhead sites and plan to help secure 35 additional sites by the end of 2008. The departments have improved their coordination mechanisms since our 2003 report, in which GAO reported that the agencies had inconsistent policies for installing site security upgrades at Russian warhead sites. Additionally, DOE and DOD are using similar approaches to manage large security upgrade contracts at warhead sites. DOD has used earned value management (EVM), which at early stages can identify cost and schedule shortfalls. DOE has not used EVM on its fixed-price contracts, but, during the course of GAO's review, augmented its contract oversight to increase reporting frequency, which DOE officials consider a comparable alternative to EVM. DOE has developed broad guidelines to direct its efforts to help ensure that Russia will be able to sustain (operate and maintain) U.S.-funded security systems at its nuclear material and warhead sites after U.S. assistance ends and is working with Russia to develop a joint sustainability plan. However, DOE lacks a management information system to track the progress made toward its goal of providing Russia with a sustainable MPC&A system by 2013. DOE and DOD's abilities to ensure the sustainability of U.S.-funded security upgrades may be hampered by access difficulties, funding concerns, and other issues. Finally, DOE and DOD plan to provide Russia with assistance to sustain security upgrades at nuclear warhead sites but have not reached agreement with Russia on access procedures for sustainability visits to 44 sites. As a result, the agencies may be unable to determine if U.S.-funded security upgrades are being properly sustained."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Safeguarding nuclear warheads and nuclear materials that can be used to  make nuclear weapons is a primary national security concern of the United  States and Russia. The collapse of the Soviet Union left Russia with the  largest arsenal of nuclear weapons in the world with unclassified U.S.  estimates of the number of Russia\u2019s nuclear warheads at the end of the cold  war ranging from 18,000 to 25,000. Russia also inherited an estimated 600  metric tons of highly enriched uranium and plutonium\u2014materials that  could be used to build nuclear weapons. Terrorists or countries seeking  nuclear weapons could use as little as 25 kilograms of highly enriched  uranium or 8 kilograms of plutonium to construct a nuclear weapon.  During the Soviet era, security systems at Soviet nuclear sites emphasized  heavy surveillance of site workers with severe penalties imposed on those  who violated security procedures. However, the fall of the Soviet Union and  subsequent social, political, and economic changes in Russia and other  former Soviet republics exposed gaps in the physical security and material  accounting at sites containing nuclear material and revealed weaknesses in  these countries\u2019 abilities to secure nuclear sites against internal and  external threats of theft.", "Since the early 1990s, there has been concern that unsecured nuclear or  radioactive material could fall into the hands of terrorists and be smuggled  into the United States for use in a nuclear weapon or a device that uses  conventional explosives with radioactive material (known as a \u201cdirty  bomb\u201d). For example, in January 2007, international media reported that  authorities in Georgia had seized about 100 grams of highly enriched  uranium from a Russian citizen who was attempting to sell the material on  the black market. Key to the United States\u2019 efforts to combat this threat is  securing nuclear materials and warheads at vulnerable civilian and military  sites in the former Soviet Union and other countries. In 1991, the Congress  authorized the Department of Defense (DOD) to establish the Cooperative  Threat Reduction program to help Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and  Kazakhstan secure and protect former Soviet nuclear weapons. Members  of the Congress were concerned that nuclear weapons or materials might  be lost, stolen, or sold and that nuclear scientists and technicians might be  persuaded to sell their knowledge to nations or terrorists seeking to  develop nuclear weapons. Between fiscal years 1992 and 2006, the  Congress authorized about $9 billion for a variety of nuclear  nonproliferation programs implemented by DOD and the Department of  Energy (DOE), including efforts to help Russia and other countries secure  sites where nuclear material and warheads are located. In 1993, DOE and  the Russian government began working together to secure sites housing  weapons-usable nuclear material and, in 1995, DOE established the  Materials Protection, Control, and Accounting (MPC&A) program, which is  now administered by the National Nuclear Security Administration  (NNSA). Through its MPC&A program, DOE has provided nuclear  facilities in Russia and other countries with modern nuclear security  systems that include the following, among other things:  physical protection systems, such as fences around buildings containing  nuclear materials; metal doors protecting rooms where nuclear  materials are stored; and video surveillance systems to monitor storage  rooms;  material control systems, such as seals attached to nuclear material  containers to indicate whether material has been stolen from the  containers, and badge systems that allow only authorized personnel into  areas containing nuclear material; and  material accounting systems, such as nuclear measurement equipment  and computerized databases to inventory the amount and type of  nuclear material contained in specific buildings and to track their  location.", "In 1998, DOE issued guidelines that provide a systematic approach for DOE  program managers to develop and implement MPC&A systems that meet  DOE\u2019s objective of helping Russia and other countries secure buildings  with weapons-usable nuclear material and nuclear warhead storage sites.  DOE seeks to improve security at nuclear sites in Russia and other  countries by providing security upgrades that protect against threats of  theft from both internal adversaries, such as disgruntled nuclear workers  (called the \u201cinsider\u201d threat), and external adversaries, such as terrorist  groups. DOE conducts these site security upgrades in two phases known as  \u201crapid\u201d upgrades and \u201ccomprehensive\u201d upgrades.", "Rapid upgrades include such improvements as bricking up windows in  buildings where nuclear material is stored; installing strengthened  doors, locks, and nuclear container seals; establishing controlled access  areas around nuclear material; and implementing procedures that  require the presence of two people when nuclear material is handled  (called the \u201ctwo-person rule\u201d). Rapid upgrades are primarily designed to  be simple, easy to implement and maintain, and result in immediate,  though limited, improvements to nuclear material security. Rapid  upgrades include upgrades designed to detect and delay external  adversaries and sometimes include basic material control and  accounting equipment and procedures that can be implemented during a  6-to-12 month period.", "Comprehensive upgrades include electronic sensors, motion detectors,  and closed circuit television systems to detect intruders; central alarm  stations, where guards can monitor cameras and alarms; and  computerized nuclear material accounting systems. Comprehensive  upgrades are designed to secure against both internal and external  threats and are usually put in place over the 18-to-24 months after the  rapid upgrades have been installed but can be installed concurrently in  some cases.", "Buildings that contain nuclear material, which DOE considers to be of a  high proliferation threat receive both rapid and comprehensive upgrades,  and buildings with nuclear material of less concern may receive only rapid  upgrades. In addition to providing security upgrades, DOE provides a  variety of training to foreign officials and nuclear site personnel on how to  operate MPC&A systems.", "In February 2006, DOE changed the metrics it uses to track progress in its  MPC&A program from measuring the percentage of nuclear material  secured (out of the estimated 600 metric tons of loose nuclear material in  the former Soviet Union) to measuring the number of buildings in Russia  and other countries with weapons-usable nuclear material that have been  secured. DOE currently plans to secure 210 buildings containing weapons- usable nuclear material in Russia and other countries by the end of 2008.", "The United States has also assisted Russia in improving security at nuclear  warhead storage sites, both temporary sites, such as rail transfer points,  and permanent sites containing storage bunkers. In 1995, DOD began  assisting the Russian Ministry of Defense (MOD) with enhancing  transportation security for nuclear warheads and security at nuclear  warhead sites. Also, in 1998, at Russia\u2019s request, DOE expanded the scope  of its efforts with the Russian Navy from protecting naval reactor fuel to  helping secure nuclear warheads. In February 2005, President Bush and  Russian President Putin issued a joint statement on nuclear security  cooperation, including enhanced cooperation on nuclear terrorism  prevention efforts. In 2006, Presidents Bush and Putin reaffirmed their  commitment to completing security upgrades at nuclear material and  warhead sites in Russia by the end of 2008. DOE and DOD plan to help  Russia secure a total of 97 nuclear warhead sites by the end of 2008.", "After completing the installation of site security upgrades, DOE and DOD  provide ongoing technical and financial support to help ensure that U.S.- funded security upgrades continue to reduce the risk of theft at foreign  nuclear sites. These efforts are known as sustainability activities.  Sustainability support is necessary to ensure that U.S.-funded security  upgrades are properly maintained and continue to support risk reduction  goals as intended. However, security of nuclear material and warheads in  Russia and other countries ultimately depends on these countries\u2019 ability to  sustain the continued operation of U.S.-funded security upgrades after U.S.  funding ends. In 2002, the Congress directed DOE to work with Russia to  develop a sustainable MPC&A system to be solely supported by Russia no  later than January 1, 2013.", "As agreed with your offices, this report addresses U.S. efforts to secure  nuclear material and warheads in Russia and other countries by assessing:  (1) the progress DOE has made in helping Russia and other countries  secure weapons-usable nuclear material, (2) the progress DOE and DOD  have made in helping Russia secure its nuclear warhead sites, and (3) the  efforts undertaken by DOE and DOD to ensure the sustainability and  continued use of U.S.-funded security upgrades at sites that house nuclear  materials and warheads in Russia and other countries.", "To address these objectives, we analyzed documentation from DOE and its  contractors at Los Alamos, Oak Ridge, and Sandia National Laboratories;  DOD; and DOD contractors. We conducted interviews with key program  officials at each of these agencies and at the Department of State. We also  discussed the implementation of DOE and DOD\u2019s programs with Russian  officials. However, the Federal Agency for Atomic Energy of the Russian  Federation (Rosatom), which is responsible for the production of all  nuclear materials in Russia and the development, testing, and production of  Russian nuclear weapons, denied our request for access to facilities under  its control. We were able to complete our audit objectives by visiting four  Russian nuclear facilities\u2014civilian, educational, and research institutes not  under Rosatom\u2019s control\u2014where DOE installed MPC&A upgrades. We  discussed security issues and the sustainability of MPC&A upgrades with  officials at these sites. In addition, we analyzed cost and budgetary  information from DOE and DOD on U.S. efforts to help Russia and other  countries secure nuclear materials and warheads. We interviewed  knowledgeable DOE and DOD officials on the reliability of these data,  including issues such as data entry, access, quality control procedures, and  the accuracy and completeness of the data. We determined these data were  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report. More details on our  scope and methodology can be found in appendix I.

Four of these offices implement DOE\u2019s MPC&A  program, which, among other things, provides security upgrades at nuclear  sites in Russia and other countries, and the fifth office, the Office of the  Second Line of Defense, works to improve detection of illegal nuclear  trafficking activities at border crossings and seaports.", "The Office of Nuclear Warhead Protection works with the Russian Ministry  of Defense, including the 12th Main Directorate\u2014the Russian Defense  Ministry\u2019s organization for nuclear munitions, the Strategic Rocket Forces,  and the Navy to install security upgrades at nuclear warhead storage sites.  The Office of Nuclear Warhead Protection also oversees DOE\u2019s security  upgrades work at naval nuclear fuel sites. The Office of Weapons Material  Protection upgrades MPC&A systems at sites within the Rosatom nuclear  weapons complex and also oversees DOE efforts to sustain U.S.-funded  security upgrades at nuclear sites within the former Soviet Union that are  not in Russia, such as facilities in Ukraine and Uzbekistan. The Office of  Material Consolidation and Civilian Sites works to install MPC&A upgrades  at nonmilitary nuclear facilities throughout Russia and oversees efforts to  consolidate nuclear material into fewer buildings and to convert excess  weapons-usable nuclear material into less attractive forms. The Office of  Material Consolidation and Civilian Sites also manages DOE\u2019s efforts to  provide nuclear security assistance to countries outside of the former  Soviet Union. The Office of National Infrastructure and Sustainability  manages a variety of crosscutting programs, including transportation and  protective forces assistance, and oversaw the development of guidelines  for DOE\u2019s efforts to help ensure that Russia can sustain the operation of  U.S.-funded security systems at its nuclear sites after U.S. assistance ends.", "DOD has also assisted Russia in securing nuclear warhead storage sites,  both temporary sites, such as rail transfer points, and permanent sites  containing storage bunkers.

The majority of these buildings are located in Russia  and fall into three categories: Rosatom weapons complex sites, civilian  sites, and naval fuel sites. DOE has also helped to secure buildings with  weapons-usable nuclear material in nine other countries.

DOE also  spent about $493.9 million on additional and related MPC&A efforts in  Russia, such as assistance for transportation security, providing equipment  for protective forces at nuclear facilities, and efforts to consolidate nuclear  material into fewer buildings and sites. According to DOE officials, these  efforts are important to increasing the overall security of nuclear materials  in Russia and other countries, and they support DOE\u2019s goal of enhancing  the security of vulnerable stockpiles of weapons-usable nuclear material.  For example, because DOE believes that nuclear materials are most  vulnerable while they are in transit, the department has provided Russia  with specialized secure trucks, armored escort vehicles, and secure  containers\u2014called overpacks\u2014to improve the security of nuclear material  transported within and between nuclear sites in Russia. Further, DOE\u2019s  assistance to protective forces at Russian nuclear sites, which includes  such items as bulletproof vests, helmets, and response vehicles, helps  ensure that guards at those sites are properly equipped and trained so that  they can quickly respond to alarms.

As table 1 shows, all  planned upgrades have been completed at naval fuel sites and sites outside  of Russia. The vast majority of remaining buildings that have not yet  received security upgrades are in the Rosatom weapons complex, where  DOE has historically had access difficulties, including being denied access  to key sites and buildings housing weapons-usable nuclear material.", "While DOE officials told us that rapid upgrades offer a limited measure of  risk reduction against some threats, they also noted that rapid upgrades fall  short of meeting all of DOE\u2019s risk reduction goals for buildings with  weapons-usable nuclear material. For example, rapid upgrades generally  include only limited measures designed to address the insider threat of  theft, such as establishing a two-person rule and providing certain types of  tamper indication devices that would set off alarms at guard stations in the  case of an unauthorized attempt to access nuclear materials. According to  NNSA, which implements the MPC&A program at DOE, the greatest threat  DOE faces in its effort to help Russia secure nuclear materials is the threat  of insider theft.

The design basis threat is defined as the attributes and  characteristics of potential adversaries (a group or groups of armed  attackers) against which a facility\u2019s physical protection systems are  designed and evaluated. According to DOE, the design basis threat is  critical to determining an MPC&A system\u2019s effectiveness. In 2005, DOE  began examining the impact of increasing the number of adversaries  against which Russian sites with U.S.-funded security upgrades should be  able to defend themselves. DOE is currently reassessing the effectiveness  of the security upgrades it has provided through the MPC&A program and  has increased its emphasis on providing assistance to the protective forces  at Russian nuclear material sites. Specifically, DOE is currently working  with a number of sites to relocate guard forces closer to the target nuclear  material to improve their response times to an incident. For example, at all  four of the nuclear material sites we visited in Russia, Russian officials told  us that they were working with DOE to relocate guard forces closer to  buildings that contain weapons-usable nuclear material at their sites.  However, DOE is limited in the scope of assistance it can provide to  protective forces at nuclear facilities in Russia and other countries. For  example, DOE is neither allowed to provide weapons or ammunition to  these forces, nor is it allowed to pay the salaries of protective forces at  these sites.

For example,  we reported in 2003 that DOE\u2019s lack of access to many buildings that store  weapons-usable nuclear material in the Rosatom weapons complex was  the greatest challenge to improving nuclear material security in Russia.  DOE requires access to these buildings to validate Russian security system  designs and to confirm the installation of equipment as intended. DOE  signed an access agreement with the Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy  (now called Rosatom) in September 2001 that described administrative  procedures to facilitate access, such as specifying which DOE personnel  are allowed to make site visits and the number and duration of those visits.  We reported in 2003 that this access agreement had done little to increase  DOE\u2019s ability to complete its work at many key sites in the Rosatom  weapons complex. Since that time, DOE has worked with Rosatom through  a Joint Acceleration Working Group and other mechanisms to develop  alternative access procedures, such as the use of remote video monitoring,  that have allowed work to progress at some sensitive buildings and sites  that had previously been inaccessible to DOE project teams. In June 2005,  DOE and Rosatom signed a Joint Action Plan detailing the remaining scope  of work to be completed by the 2008 deadline. Rosatom and DOE are using  this plan to guide cooperative activities and to develop a multiyear budget  for DOE\u2019s MPC&A program. DOE officials told us that they have been  granted access to almost all of the sites and buildings covered in the plan  and that all security upgrades should be completed, as scheduled, by the  end of 2008.

According to DOE officials, the department has  offered numerous alternative access proposals to try to obtain access to  install security upgrades at these two sites. For example, in November  2004, DOE provided senior Russian officials with access to some of the  most sensitive sites in the U.S. nuclear weapons complex, including the  Pantex nuclear weapons plant in Texas, which is the only U.S. nuclear  weapons assembly and disassembly facility. However, Rosatom has refused  to grant DOE officials reciprocal access to analogous Russian sites.  Because of the sensitive nature of the work conducted at these sites,  Rosatom has denied DOE\u2019s requests for access, rejected DOE offers to  provide assistance without access, and informed DOE that it is not  interested in pursuing MPC&A cooperation at these sites.

Generally, OMB requires federal agencies to use EVM or an  alternative performance management system on major acquisition  contracts to identify cost and schedule variances at early stages so they can  be addressed in a timely manner. DOD has used EVM to evaluate its  contracts to install security upgrades at Russian warhead sites. DOE does  not require its contractors to implement EVM to evaluate its contracts to  install security upgrades at Russian warhead sites, but, during the course of  our review, augmented its contract performance management system to  include additional reporting mechanisms for identifying and addressing  schedule variances, which DOE officials believe represent a comparable  alternative to an EVM system.", "DOD officials stated that EVM is one of many tools that provide empirical  data to validate testimonial information about the status of security  upgrades provided in its contractors\u2019 monthly and quarterly reports.  Additionally, EVM enhances program management capabilities by  providing an early warning system for deviations from plans and quantifies  technical and schedule problems in terms of cost. This provides DOD with  an objective basis for considering corrective action. DOD officials told us  that their use of EVM allowed them to identify schedule variances due to  poor contractor performance at one Russian nuclear warhead site where  the department is installing security upgrades. DOD officials stated that  this early detection allowed them to reassign the work to a different  Russian subcontractor and formulate a plan to make up for the lost time  and work in order to meet their scheduled completion date and critical  path milestones.", "Similarly, DOE recently proposed requirements that its large contracts for  security upgrades at nuclear warhead sites be managed with a system  similar to EVM. In September 2006, DOE initiated security upgrades at four  large nuclear warhead storage sites in Russia. Until January 2007, DOE  managed these fixed-price contracts according to the NNSA Programmatic  Guidelines, which do not require the use of EVM or an alternative system to  assess contract performance for cost and schedule variances. In part, as a  result of our inquiry into its contracting practices, DOE altered its oversight  mechanisms for these contracts in January 2007 and will now require  monthly reports and other measures to more accurately ascertain the  progress of contracted items, including the identification of schedule  variances due to inclement weather and other unforeseen events and,  subsequently, the development of recovery plans.

In December 2006, DOE issued a final version of  its Sustainability Guidelines for the MPC&A program. These guidelines  require DOE program managers to develop assessments of each site\u2019s  existing capabilities to sustain MPC&A systems and to identify  requirements that should be met before a site transitions from DOE  support to full Russian responsibility. According to DOE, these  assessments will be used to develop site-specific sustainability plans that  detail the remaining cooperative activities required to address each of the  seven elements of sustainability. The guidelines also require DOE project  teams to develop site-specific transition plans, which would detail how  sustainability activities will be funded as the sites move toward transition  to full Russian responsibility by 2013.", "DOE\u2019s Sustainability Guidelines set forth seven key elements of a  sustainable MPC&A program at sites receiving MPC&A upgrades, such as  the development of site operating procedures, which form the foundation  for all of DOE\u2019s sustainability activities at nuclear material and warhead  sites in Russia and other countries where DOE has provided security  upgrades. DOE uses a variety of sustainability indicators for each of the  seven elements to determine the degree to which the individual elements  are being addressed at Russian sites. Table 2 shows the seven elements of  sustainability outlined in DOE\u2019s Sustainability Guidelines and some of the  indicators DOE uses to assess the degree to which each element of  sustainability is being met at a given Russian site.", "According to DOE, the Sustainability Guidelines provide general criteria  for DOE project teams to follow when working with their Russian  counterparts in developing sustainability programs for sites where DOE  has installed MPC&A systems. DOE officials noted that some sites may not  require assistance to address issues in each of the seven categories. For  example, many sites that store naval nuclear fuel are administered by the  Russian Navy, which has its own human resource management system and  would not require DOE assistance to address the human resource  management and site training sustainability element.", "In addition, DOE and Rosatom are currently developing a joint  sustainability plan that is intended to govern sustainability activities at the  sites under Rosatom\u2019s control where DOE has installed MPC&A systems.  DOE officials told us that this joint sustainability plan may be completed in  March 2007. DOE officials believe that this plan will be an important step in  gaining Rosatom\u2019s buy-in to the concepts of sustainability and will lead to a  specific path forward and detailed plan for funding sustainability activities  for DOE, while transitioning to full Russian responsibility in 2013.  According to DOE officials, the plan will be based largely on DOE\u2019s  Sustainability Guidelines and will include the seven key elements of  sustainability outlined in those guidelines.

Currently, DOE\u2019s Metrics Information  Management System (MIMS) contains data detailing the department\u2019s  progress in implementing the MPC&A program by tracking the number of  buildings and sites where DOE has installed security upgrades, among  other things. DOE also uses MIMS to track some measures of progress in  their sustainability efforts, such as the development of site-specific plans  that document how MPC&A site management will plan, budget, direct,  monitor, and evaluate all MPC&A systems. DOE managers use MIMS as a  tool in their oversight of the MPC&A program. However, DOE officials  acknowledged that the current MIMS data do not provide an accurate  picture of the department\u2019s progress toward its goal of preparing Russia to  take full responsibility for funding the maintenance and sustainability of  U.S.-funded upgrades by 2013. Expanding MIMS to include tracking for all  sustainability elements could give DOE managers an improved tool for  monitoring the MPC&A program\u2019s progress toward the goal of preparing  Russia to take full responsibility for funding the maintenance and  sustainability of U.S.-funded upgrades by 2013.

For example, at one facility  where DOE completed upgrades in 1998, DOE officials were denied  access from 1999 through 2002. DOE officials told us that after  commissioning the MPC&A system at this facility, the department had  not developed specific plans for sustaining the U.S.-funded security  equipment. Upon returning to the facility in September 2002, DOE  officials found that the U.S.-funded security upgrades were in a severe  state of disrepair. As a result, DOE has had to spend about $800,000 to  correct problems resulting from the site\u2019s inability to properly maintain  the U.S.-funded security upgrades. According to DOE officials, these  security upgrade replacement efforts are scheduled to be completed in  fiscal year 2007.", "Despite improvements in the Russian economy, some sites may not be  financially able to maintain DOE-funded security upgrades. The Russian  economy has improved since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991  and the financial troubles of the late 1990s. In September 2006, the  Deputy Head of Rosatom stated that Russia is no longer in need of U.S.  assistance and that it is easier and more convenient for Russia to pay for  its own domestic nuclear security projects. However, during our visit to  Russia, officials at three of the four civilian nuclear research institutes  we visited told us that they are concerned about their sites\u2019 financial  ability to maintain U.S.-funded security upgrades after U.S. assistance  ends. Some of these sites do not receive regular funds from the Russian  government to support the operation and maintenance of their MPC&A  systems. As a result, Russian site officials told us that, after DOE  financial support ends in 2013, they will likely face difficult choices  about how to pay for maintenance of the security upgrades DOE has  provided.", "Some U.S.-funded MPC&A equipment is not certified for use at Russian  facilities, which means that the Russian government may not pay for its  maintenance. Certification is a mandatory Russian regulatory  requirement designed to ensure the functionality, safety, and security of  specific equipment, products, and technology used in Russian nuclear  sites. Certification of U.S.-funded MPC&A equipment must be obtained  before it can be legally used at Russian nuclear sites. DOE has  historically maintained that certification is a Russian responsibility, and  current DOE policy generally precludes funding for certification of  equipment. Despite repeated attempts to persuade Russia to fund  equipment certification, DOE is paying for some equipment to be  certified on a case-by-case basis. According to DOE officials, some sites  have equipment or MPC&A systems that are not fully certified for use.  For example, at eight sites that house weapons-usable nuclear material,  DOE-funded equipment used to make accurate measurements of the  type and quantity of nuclear material stored at these sites has not been  certified for use. Unless this equipment receives certification in the near  future, DOE may be forced to pay for maintenance longer than it  intends. Rosatom and DOE also have established a Joint Certification  Working Group that is developing a joint plan to certify key equipment  items. DOE developed the Equipment Certification and Vendor Support  project in 1998 to provide DOE project managers with accurate  information on the Russian certification process. DOE spent $23.6  million on this project through the end of fiscal year 2006.", "There have been delays installing the MOM system at some Rosatom  facilities. In February 2001, we recommended that DOE develop a  system, in cooperation with Russia, to monitor, on a long-term basis, the  security systems installed at the Russian sites to ensure that they  continue to detect, delay, and respond to attempts to steal nuclear material. In response to this recommendation, DOE developed the  MOM system, consisting of off-the-shelf video cameras and other  equipment designed to allow Russian officials to ensure that MPC&A  systems are properly staffed, personnel are vigilant, and key security  procedures are enforced. DOE officials told us in 2002 they anticipated  that the MOM system would be an integral part of DOE\u2019s sustainability  assistance to Russian sites. However, through the end of fiscal year  2006, only five sites with weapons-usable nuclear material where DOE  installed security upgrades had the MOM system. While DOE also  plans to install equipment at two additional sites in fiscal year 2007,  none of the seven sites where DOE has installed or plans to install  MOM systems is controlled by Rosatom. Rosatom has been unwilling to  allow DOE to install MOM systems at sites under its control.  Unfortunately, DOE was unable to anticipate Rosatom\u2019s resistance to  the MOM system and, in 2002, the department pre-purchased MOM  equipment for use at Rosatom facilities. As a result, DOE has had to pay  for storage and upkeep of 367 MOM cameras and other equipment since  2002. DOE officials told us that if Rosatom decides not to allow MOM  equipment at its sites, the excess equipment may be used by other DOE  programs, such as the Second Line of Defense program, which works  with Russia to combat nuclear smuggling by installing radiation  detection equipment at key border crossings. Through fiscal year 2006,  DOE had spent a total of $20.5 million on the MOM project, including  about $270,000 to pay for storage and upkeep of unused MOM  equipment that has been in storage since 2002."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Access Difficulties at Some Russian Nuclear Warhead Sites May Prohibit DOE and DOD from Ensuring That Security Upgrades Are Being Sustained", "paragraphs": ["DOE and DOD plan to provide Russia with assistance to sustain security  upgrades at nuclear warhead sites, but access difficulties may prevent the  agencies from carrying out their plans.

Site access is needed to ensure  that U.S. funds are being used to help Russia maintain security upgrades at  these sites. If DOE and DOD cannot reach an agreement with the Russian  MOD on access procedures for sustainability activities at these 44 sites, or  develop acceptable alternatives to physical access, the agencies will be  unable to determine if U.S.-funded security upgrades are being properly  sustained and may not be able to spend funds allotted for these efforts.", "DOE and DOD have formed an informal working group to more effectively  coordinate their efforts on sustainability of security upgrades at Russian  nuclear warhead sites. DOE and DOD have agreed in principle that the  seven elements of sustainability outlined in DOE\u2019s Sustainability Guidelines  will be applied to the agencies\u2019 efforts to help the Russian MOD sustain  security upgrades at nuclear warhead sites.

Similarly, DOD has supported the development of a personnel  reliability program for the 12th Main Directorate of the MOD and DOE is  planning to support a similar program for the Russian Navy and  Strategic Rocket Forces.", "Second, DOE and DOD have funded the construction of regional  training and maintenance centers. For example, DOE recently  completed construction of the Kola Technical Center, near Murmansk,  Russia, which serves as the centralized training and maintenance facility  for all Russian MOD sites in the Murmansk region, both naval nuclear  fuel sites and nuclear warhead storage sites. The Kola Technical Center  was commissioned in fall 2005, and Russian MOD officials told us that  the facility will help them prepare to assume full financial responsibility  for maintenance and sustainability when U.S. assistance ends.", "Finally, at the site level, once DOE and DOD come to agreement with the  Russian MOD on verification of sustainability assistance, they will assist  in sustaining the upgraded security systems with a focus on training and  developing the Russian MOD\u2019s capability to maintain the modernized  systems. Initially, DOE and DOD will rely on contractor support for  repair of failed security systems while the Russian MOD\u2019s capability is  being developed, gradually transitioning to full Russian system support.", "Although DOE and DOD are working closely to provide sustainability  assistance at Russian nuclear warhead storage sites, differences exist in  the length of time DOE and DOD intend to fund sustainability activities at  these sites. Specifically, DOE intends to fund sustainability until 2013, while  DOD plans to halt funding in 2011. This has the potential to cause  difficulties for the Russian MOD when it comes to funding sustainability  earlier at sites where DOD installed security upgrades. In addition, DOD  plans no further support with respect to sustainability for warhead  transportation upgrades it has provided to the Russian MOD, because,  according to DOD officials, the Russian MOD has not requested assistance  for this activity."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["DOE and DOD have made significant progress in helping Russia and other  countries improve security at vulnerable sites housing weapons-usable  nuclear material and nuclear warheads.

Currently, DOE considers  buildings to be \u201csecured\u201d after only limited MPC&A upgrades (rapid  upgrades) are installed, even when additional comprehensive upgrades are  planned. Rapid upgrades do not include the majority of measures DOE uses  to address the threat of insider theft at Russian nuclear sites, which DOE  considers to be one of its most pressing concerns. DOE provides most  upgrades designed to address the insider threat during the comprehensive  upgrades phase. Further, DOE officials told us that comprehensive  upgrades are necessary to achieve all risk reduction goals at buildings with  nuclear material, calling into question DOE\u2019s decision to report buildings  without such upgrades completed as \u201csecure.\u201d", "As DOE nears the completion of its security upgrade work in its MPC&A  program, the sustainability of U.S.-funded nuclear security upgrades in  Russia and other countries has become increasingly important for ensuring  that the substantial investment of U.S. funds over the past 15 years is not  wasted. DOE and Rosatom have been cooperating to develop a joint  sustainability plan for the majority of sites where DOE has installed  MPC&A upgrades. We believe this is a critical step in gaining agreement on  what remains to be done before DOE transfers full responsibility for  sustainability of MPC&A upgrades to Russia in 2013. While DOE uses its  Metrics Information Management System to track some measures of  progress in its sustainability efforts, DOE officials acknowledged that the  current MIMS data do not provide an accurate picture of the department\u2019s  progress toward its goal of preparing Russia to take full responsibility for  funding the maintenance and sustainability of U.S.-funded upgrades by  2013.
