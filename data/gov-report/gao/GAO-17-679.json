These standards are designed to minimize risk to federal facilities and help nonmilitary federal entities meet recommended levels of protection. Interior's, the Smithsonian's, and the National Gallery's adherence to these policies and standards, and the related steps that the entities follow, shows the considerable extent to which these entities use risk assessments as an analytical tool in their physical security programs. Nonetheless, the threat to federal facilities is significant, and ISC standards require the documentation of risk management decisions\u2014such as decisions to defer actions to mitigate risk due to cost or other factors. Documenting risk management decisions is also a necessary part of an effective internal-control system and important in order to retain institutional knowledge and inform decision-making. GAO found that the National Gallery, which follows ISC standards voluntarily, lacked such documentation.", "Interior, the Smithsonian, and the National Gallery collect information on various aspects of the performance of their physical security programs and are making efforts to use goals, measures, and testing to assess the performance of their physical security programs; however, each could benefit from taking additional steps. ISC and GAO have reported that it is necessary to establish goals and link performance measures to those goals to assess progress. While Interior, the Smithsonian, and the National Gallery intend to link performance measures to goals, they have not done so yet or established firm time frames for completing these efforts. Ensuring that plans include both goals and performance measures linked to those goals, as well as developing timelines for completion, could help these entities develop a more strategic view of their physical security programs and better position them to prioritize their needs. These entities also test aspects of their physical security programs, such as to ensure that security systems are operational and that guards are attending to their duties. While the entities have reached out to others to improve their overall programs, they did not focus on testing as part of that outreach. Seeking input from others with expertise is consistent with key practices GAO has identified for physical security and could help these entities target where their testing efforts need improvement."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["In the sensitive report, GAO recommended that (1) the National Gallery document its risk management decisions and that (2) Interior, the Smithsonian, and the National Gallery link performance measures with security goals and seek input to enhance their testing programs.

With this information, federal entities can  then decide how to allocate their resources to address risks. Risk  management principles acknowledge that while risk cannot always be  eliminated, steps can be taken to reduce it.", "ISC, an interagency organization chaired by DHS, has developed  physical security standards for nonmilitary federal facilities in the United  States. One of the primary ISC standards is known as the RMP, and it  defines the criteria and process federal entities should follow to assess  risks to their facilities and determine which countermeasures\u2014such as  blast resistant windows and intrusion detection systems\u2014should be in  place to reduce risk to an acceptable level.

That categorization serves as the basis for identifying security  enhancements or countermeasures that should be implemented at  federal facilities to reduce the level of risk to an acceptable level.", "Because risk assessments play a key role in the risk management  process, ISC has developed standards for these assessments. For  example, ISC requires that risk assessments consider the likelihood of  certain undesirable events (which range from theft to active shooter), and  the RMP provides entities with an integrated, single source of information  on physical security enhancements that entities should implement to  effectively minimize risk and meet baseline levels of protection. To  determine whether a facility meets recommended baseline levels of  protection, the RMP includes criteria, which vary by FSL, in the following  categories:", "Site: facility perimeter, exterior areas and assets, and parking.", "Structure: structural hardening, fa\u00e7ade, windows, and building  systems.", "Facility entrance: employee and visitor entrances and exits, loading  docks, and other openings in the building envelope.", "Interior: space planning and security of specific interior spaces.", "Security systems: intrusion-detection, access control, and closed- circuit television (CCTV) camera systems.", "Security operations and administration: management and decision- making and the handling and receiving of mail.", "The RMP also notes that performance measurement data are essential to  appropriate decision-making and provides guidance on implementing a  comprehensive performance measurement and testing program.  According to ISC, performance measures should be based on an entity\u2019s  goals and objectives. Examples of performance measures for physical  security programs include the number and types of security incidents, the  time it takes to respond to security incidents, and the percentage of  countermeasures deployed within a given time frame. In addition, the  RMP notes that testing can be useful in assessing how well  countermeasures are performing. Testing can include operational efforts,  such as determining whether equipment is calibrated properly,  determining if security guards are knowledgeable about procedures, and  determining if intrusion detection systems are activating properly.

Despite these  challenges, Interior, the Smithsonian, and the National Gallery have each  taken steps to incorporate testing into their physical security programs,  more specifically:", "The Park Police currently conducts operational checks to ensure that  security guards are following procedures, conducts daily security  inspections of the icons to verify that guards are at their assigned  locations and attending to their duties, and uses security managers  from outside sources to perform covert operational checks on a  random basis.", "The Smithsonian currently conducts periodic operational tests of its  security systems and its access controls, with more frequent tests for  higher risk areas such as perimeter doors and exhibition space,  according to Smithsonian officials. In addition, an official told us that  they began to review security screening at the entrances to their  facilities in February 2017, in response to our questions about this  topic. As part of these tests, Smithsonian assesses how well security  guards follow prescribed guidelines.", "The National Gallery currently tests aspects of its physical security  program and plans to expand its testing practices. Specifically, the  National Gallery conducts periodic covert testing of access controls  and uses the results of these tests to address failures and measure  improvement. The National Gallery also tests whether its command  center appropriately directs responses to alarm situations and plans to  test its baggage-screening procedures.", "As Interior, the Smithsonian, and the National Gallery proceed with these  efforts, there may be opportunities to draw on the expertise of others with  knowledge in testing physical security initiatives. In our prior work we  have identified information sharing and coordinating with other federal  entities as a key practice for physical security. We have also found that  federal agencies can enhance their collaborative efforts by identifying  opportunities to leverage resources. ISC officials told us that ISC  provides an interagency forum with multiple mechanisms for information  sharing and that ISC members could share best practices for conducting  testing. We have also reported that DHS\u2019s Federal Protective Service  (FPS) and the Department of Justice\u2019s U.S. Marshals Service (Marshals  Service), which has primary responsibility for the security of federal  courthouses, have years of experience in testing security-screening  efforts in federal buildings\u2014places where balancing public access and  security is an important factor. For example, in order to assess  screening effectiveness, we have reported that FPS conducts covert tests  of security screening at federal buildings and that the Marshals Service  conducts intrusion tests that consist of attempts to circumvent the public-  screening process and access federal courthouses with a prohibited item  such as a weapon. A senior FPS official also told us that FPS could meet  with entities to understand their existing program and share applicable  lessons learned, and Marshals Service officials told us they would be  willing to share their expertise in planning and conducting testing with  entities on the National Mall.", "Interior, the Smithsonian, and the National Gallery have reached out to  other federal entities to improve their physical security programs, but we  found they have not made testing a focus of their outreach efforts,  specifically:", "Park Police officials told us they have sought to enhance their  physical security program by coordinating with internal and external  partners. This coordination includes, for example, sharing information  about best practices, emerging threats, and new technology through a  variety of venues, such as by visiting other sites, such as the Statute  of Liberty National Monument; and by participating in a variety of  working groups, such as the Mall Security Working Group. While  these efforts are valuable, testing has not been the primary focus.  According to Park Police officials, they have considered implementing  additional covert testing but found they lacked the capability to  implement and sustain such efforts.", "Smithsonian officials said that additional testing would help them to  assess the effectiveness of their physical security program but that  they lacked the resources to conduct additional testing activities.  According to these officials, they participate in the Mall Security  Working Group and have collaborated with other entities to share  practices for implementing testing. Apart from these efforts, officials  said they have not reached out to other entities regarding testing  because they have devoted time and resources to other efforts, such  as conducting operational tests and managing day-to-day security  concerns.", "National Gallery officials told us they have a collaborative relationship  with other entities through the Mall Security Working Group and that  they reach out to this group to discuss a variety of security initiatives  and emerging issues. A senior official told us the National Gallery has  reached out to this group to discuss testing of its screening  procedures, which is a useful first step. However, a senior National  Gallery official also noted that other aspects of the physical security  program could benefit from the same kind of knowledge sharing.", "Moving forward, drawing on the knowledge and practices of others could  help Interior, the Smithsonian, and the National Gallery enhance their  respective testing programs, a process that could provide them with more  information about what security procedures and investments are working  and where improvements are needed. By not making testing a focus of  outreach efforts, National Mall entities may be missing opportunities to  leverage the knowledge of other entities that have experience in this area."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Ensuring the physical security of the icons, museums, and galleries on  the National Mall\u2014as well as the federal employees who work there and  the visiting public\u2014is a complex and difficult task. Federal entities  contend with a variety of challenges on the National Mall that can limit  what they can do to enhance security. Interior, the Smithsonian, and the  National Gallery recognize these limitations and are taking steps to  assess physical-security risks. However, more could be done to better  manage physical security risks on the National Mall. Because the  National Gallery lacks complete documentation of its risk management  decisions, there is an opportunity to enhance its risk management  decision-making as it relates to physical security. Furthermore, Interior,  the Smithsonian, and the National Gallery have opportunities to take a  more strategic approach to performance measurement by developing  goals for their programs and linking performance measures to those  goals. Without taking a more strategic approach, these entities may have  difficulty effectively assessing their progress. Lastly, although federal  entities on the National Mall have reached out to others to improve their  physical security programs, they have not made testing a focus of their  outreach efforts.
