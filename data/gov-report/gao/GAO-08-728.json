Because IRS has a very large debt workload and limited resources spread across multiple units, it must make numerous decisions about how best to handle debt cases. The complexity also arises because debt cases can take various routes based on about 70 IRS decision rules used for handling cases. The rules respond to a wide variety of debt characteristics, information known about the taxpayer, and the results of attempts to contact the taxpayer or take enforcement action. From fiscal years 2002 through 2007, increases occurred in the unpaid tax debt inventory, the percentages of debt classified as potentially collectible and in active collection status, and the dollars IRS collected. It is unclear whether dollars collected will continue to grow at rates similar to the growth in debt classified as collectible or active because, for example, those categories do not mean that the debt has a high potential for collection and will be actively pursued or that debt resolution will necessarily result in dollars collected. IRS-wide collection performance measures cover three outcomes of the three-phase process with an emphasis on closing more debt cases in less staff time. IRS did not indicate why more measures for the whole collection process were lacking. For each of the phases, IRS had more performance measures such as on debt resolutions, time spent, satisfaction, and quality, which phase managers said were sufficient for them. GAO has identified material weaknesses in IRS's controls over unpaid tax assessments and collections partly due to the lack of agencywide cost-benefit data and related performance measures. Although IRS has made some progress on these weaknesses, progress has not been sufficient to resolve them. For example, over the past 3 years, IRS has employed various approaches, including sophisticated computer modeling and risk assessment techniques, to assist it in more effectively identifying the tax debt cases with the greatest collection potential, and to facilitate prioritizing of these cases for collection. IRS has also employed these techniques to identify the most effective collection approach to take for the various types of outstanding tax debt. Although IRS has ongoing projects to expand the use of these models and techniques, it does not yet have an agencywide, systematic approach to managing the collection of tax debts across IRS. In response, IRS has created a council of IRS collection officials to coordinate various collection activities across IRS and potential changes across the parts of the collection process. Further, IRS has a number of ongoing projects to improve aspects of the collection process. However, some of these projects will take a few years to be implemented."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) must pursue collection of unpaid tax  debt to help ensure compliance and confidence in the tax system and  address the tax gap, which is the estimated difference between tax  amounts that taxpayers voluntarily and timely pay and those they owe.

Since IRS\u2019s filing and reporting compliance programs  identify new tax debt when pursuing apparent noncompliance, IRS is  contributing continually to the unpaid assessments inventory.", "After identifying potential tax assessments, IRS sends a series of notices to  taxpayers about these potential assessments as well as about any taxes  due. For example, IRS is required to send taxpayers certain statutory  notices. IRS first is to send a \u201c30-day letter\u201d that includes a proposed  assessment of tax, penalty, and interest. The letter is to instruct the  taxpayer on possible ways to respond, such as by accepting the proposed  assessment; filing an original return; providing evidence that there is no  filing requirement; or appealing the proposed assessment to IRS\u2019s Office of  Appeals. If no response is received to the 30-day letter within the allotted  time, IRS is to send a 90-day statutory notice. The statutory notice is to  contain information similar to the 30-day letter and information on the  taxpayer\u2019s right to petition the Tax Court. If IRS does not receive a  response within the allotted time, the tax, penalty, and interest on the  return are to be assessed. IRS\u2019s practice is to send up to four balance-due  notices at 5-week intervals for the amount owed. Six weeks after the  fourth balance-due notice, IRS is to forward any unpaid accounts to IRS  staff who are to try to collect the unpaid amounts through other phases of  the collection process\u2014-the telephone or in-person contact phases.", "Congress enacted the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998 to  balance IRS\u2019s responsibility to collect taxes with its responsibility to  protect taxpayers\u2019 rights. One of the concerns addressed by the act was  the use of collection or enforcement data to assess performance. The act  restricted the use of records of tax enforcement results for assessing  employee performance.", "We have previously looked at various aspects of IRS collection programs.  For example, in 2002 we reported on the lack of data on the effects of  collection programs on compliance. Also, although we have not assessed  the implementation of the private debt collection program, during our  reviews of IRS\u2019s planning for the program in 2006, we reported that IRS  had not completed work on a suite of balanced measures for use in  evaluating the results of the program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "IRS Collects or Otherwise Resolves Unpaid Tax Debt through a Complex, Three-Phase Process", "paragraphs": ["IRS\u2019s process for collecting unpaid debt has three phases.

IRS officials  attributed the increase in collections and in debt inventory in part to  increased enforcement actions. Comparing fiscal years 2004 and 2007,  IRS\u2019s assessments made from enforcement efforts accounted for a  growing portion of the new potentially collectible debt inventory,  increasing from about 30 percent to about 50 percent, respectively.

However, not all potentially collectible debt has a high  potential for collection. Rather, potentially collectible means that the debt  has not been defined as uncollectible for a variety of reasons, such as the  taxpayer being bankrupt or facing a financial hardship or IRS being unable  to find the taxpayer or temporarily suspending the debt from collection  actions.", "From fiscal year 2002 to 2007, IRS placed more of the inventory with  collection potential into \u201cactive collection status.\u201d Comparing fiscal years  2002 and 2007, debt in active collection increased from 62 percent to 75  percent of the potentially collectible inventory, respectively, as shown in  figure 4.", "Active collection status means that IRS makes the debt available to be  pursued in a phase of the collection process. This status does not mean  that IRS is actively and continuously contacting the taxpayer or using its  enforcement tools in the telephone or in-person contact phases until all  debt is resolved. Depending on competing priorities and IRS resources, for  example, some of this inventory could remain in this active status for  some time before it is acted upon or resolved. IRS also could decide to  move the debt to an inactive status during which no further collection  action is taken.", "For debt that is resolved by removing it from the debt inventory, IRS often  does not collect any revenue. During each of fiscal years 2002 through  2007, over half of the annual resolutions in terms of dollar amounts were  removed from the debt inventory through abatements and collection  statue expirations, as shown in table 1.", "Abatements occur for a number of reasons. For example, section 6404(a)  of the Internal Revenue Code, in part, authorizes IRS to abate the unpaid  taxes or any related liability which is:    excessive in amount,    assessed after the applicable period of limitation has expired, or    assessed erroneously or illegally.", "Among reasons for abatements are errors by taxpayers or IRS and changes  to assessments resulting from additional information provided by  taxpayers or obtained by IRS that adjusts the appropriate tax assessment  and related penalty and interest amounts that have accrued over time.  Abatements can occur years after an original tax assessment was made. In  sum, the amount that IRS abates can exceed the amount collected during a  given year.", "An example in which additional information leads to abatements involves  ASFR assessments. IRS uses the best information available when it  prepares returns for taxpayers who failed to file returns. When responding  to the IRS-prepared return, taxpayers may provide additional information,  such as on deductions to which they are entitled, which would produce a  lower tax assessment compared to the ASFR-generated assessment.  Accordingly, IRS abates any assessed taxes and any applicable penalties  associated with the ASFR return. Abatements also can be required when:    a taxpayer uses a net operating loss carryover amount to offset a tax    a taxpayer files an amended tax return that changes the tax liability,    a taxpayer provides information as part of a request to abate certain types  of penalty assessments due to reasonable cause,    a bankruptcy court has discharged a tax assessment,    a taxpayer has met the terms of the agreement for an offer in compromise  to reduce the amount the taxpayer must pay to satisfy a tax debt, or    a corporate officer has fully paid a trust fund recovery penalty amount  assessed for unpaid payroll taxes, which means that IRS then can abate  any other assessments of this amount against other officers.", "Likewise, the law allows IRS a period of time to collect outstanding tax  debts through its collection process or court proceeding. This period,  which IRS refers to as the Collection Statue Expiration Date, generally is  10 years and usually begins from the date a tax liability is assessed. In  general, if IRS does not collect the full unpaid tax debt amount before the  statute period ends, then any remaining balance on the debt is removed  from the unpaid tax debt inventory because it is exempt from further IRS  collection action. Expired debt can happen, for example, when the  taxpayer does not have sufficient resources to pay the debt before the  statutory period elapses, such as when the taxpayer is a defunct business  or dies, or when IRS\u2019s limited resources do not enable it to actively pursue  all debts. IRS officials noted that the increase in the portion of debt  removed due to statute expirations in the 2003 through 2005 period, for  instance, was attributable to the inability of failed financial institutions to  pay large tax assessments associated with Resolution Trust Fund cases  arising during the 1990s."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "IRS-Wide Collection Performance Measures Cover the Collection Process and Some Outcomes", "paragraphs": ["As shown in table 2, two of the IRS-wide collection performance measures  cover all phases of the collection process and focus on the extent to which  debt cases were closed and the efficiency in using staff resources for those  closures.

We corroborated data on  the resolutions of tax debt with other IRS data and determined that they  were reliable for our purposes.", "We conducted this performance audit from July 2007 to May 2008 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those  standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient,  appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence  obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Challenges in Tracking the Inventory and Collection of Tax Debts across Fiscal Years", "paragraphs": ["To help provide context on the magnitude of the Internal Revenue  Service\u2019s (IRS) unpaid tax debt inventory and changes in the inventory  over time we requested data from IRS to show the flow of debt into and  out of the inventory during fiscal years 2002 through 2007. For example,  we requested for each fiscal year:  the amount of new debt that came into the inventory and the amount of  debt resolved during the year, and  the balance of the inventory at year\u2019s end.", "In addition, we requested data from IRS that tracked the dispositions and  status of unpaid tax debts identified in fiscal year 2002 through the end of  fiscal year 2007. For example, for each \u201cnew\u201d unpaid tax debt assessed in  fiscal year 2002, we requested data that showed the amounts collected,  abated, or otherwise resolved by fiscal year. For the balance remaining at  the end of each fiscal year, we requested data on the status of the debt, for  example, where the debt was in the collection phase, such as, in the notice  phase or assigned for an in-person field contact.", "Our data requests were a challenge for IRS, in part, because of how IRS  maintains data for the unpaid tax debts inventory and the resulting  complexity in trying to reconcile the data and ensure its reliability. For  example:  IRS does not have one information system that tracks, in detail, what  happens to unpaid tax debts over time. The unpaid tax debt data come  from several sources including reports from IRS\u2019s Master file and  Compliance Data Warehouse (CDW). As such, doing the tracking that we  requested required much of it to be provided in the form of queries that  had to be analyzed and adjusted for things such as duplicate records,  anomalies in the data, or both.  IRS\u2019s beginning and ending unpaid tax debt inventory balances for each  fiscal year represents a snapshot of the balances at those points in time.  Yet the inventory is based on what happens during each fiscal year to  accumulated tax debt from multiple tax years; therefore, a snapshot of the  balances at the end of a specific fiscal year will not reflect the details of  what occurred to the debt during the year.", "IRS could provide mostly summary-level data. An IRS official responsible  for the data believed that the methodology used to produce the summary- level data provided enough details to reflect the various activities that  occurred in each fiscal year at the time the reports were generated. More  useful and reliable information that tracked all activity affecting the  unpaid tax debt inventory balances across fiscal years was difficult for IRS  to produce.", "According to this IRS official, the difficulty in trying to produce this level  of detailed information is one reason that IRS requested and eventually  received an exemption from the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory  Board. This exemption relieved IRS from a financial reporting requirement  to disclose detailed information on the flow of debt into and out of the  unpaid assessment inventory."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: IRS Efforts to Improve the Collection Process as of May 2008", "paragraphs": ["The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has numerous projects planned or  underway to improve the collection process. To better understand the  improvements, we asked IRS to provide us with a list of all improvement  projects on the collection process, and details such as their goals, their  objectives, their measures of success, and their status. We received a list  of projects from the Small Business/Self-Employed Division (SB/SE) and  Wage and Investment Division (W&I).
