The program is overseen by CMS, while the states that administer Medicaid are tasked with taking actions to ensure its integrity. Such actions include implementing IT systems that provide program integrity analysts with capabilities to assess claims, provider, beneficiary, and other data relevant to Medicaid; and supporting efforts to prevent and detect improper payments to providers.", "GAO was asked to review states' implementation of IT systems that support Medicaid. GAO determined (1) the types and implementation status of the systems used by states to support program integrity initiatives; (2) the extent to which CMS is making available data, technical resources, and funds to support Medicaid programs' efforts to implement systems, and the effectiveness of the states' systems; and (3) key challenges that Medicaid programs have faced in using IT to enhance program integrity initiatives, and CMS's actions to support efforts to overcome them. To do this, GAO analyzed information from 10 selected states covering a range of expenditures on such systems, reviewed program management documentation, and interviewed CMS officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In the 10 selected states reviewed, GAO found the use of varying types of information technology (IT) systems to support efforts to prevent and detect improper payments. All 10 states had implemented a Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS) to process claims and support their program integrity efforts, and 7 had implemented additional types of systems to meet specific needs. Three states were operating MMISs that were implemented more than 20 years ago, but 7 states had upgraded their MMISs, and 2 of those had done so in the past 2 years. In addition, 7 states had implemented other systems, such as data analytics and decision support systems that enabled complex reviews of multiple claims and identification of providers' billing patterns that could be fraudulent. While the MMISs and other systems implemented by the 10 states were designed primarily for administering Medicaid as a fee-for-service program, in which providers file claims for reimbursement for each service delivered to patients, officials with 7 of the 10 states also administered managed care plans\u2013plans for which provider organizations are reimbursed based on a fixed amount each month\u2013and 1 state administered Medicaid exclusively as managed care. Officials with the 9 states who administered fee-for-service plans said they used their systems to help conduct pre- and post-payment reviews of claims.", "All 10 states received technical and financial support from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) for implementing the systems. For example, they accessed the agency's databases to collect information that helped determine providers' eligibility to enroll in Medicaid. In addition, all 10 states had participated in training, technical workgroups, and collaborative sessions facilitated by CMS. With the agency's approval, the 10 states received up to 90 percent in federal matching funds to help implement systems. All 10 states reported that agency support, particularly training, helped them to implement systems needed to prevent and detect improper payments.", "However, the effectiveness of the states' use of the systems for program integrity purposes is not known. CMS does not require states to measure or report quantifiable benefits achieved as a result of using the systems; accordingly, only 3 of the 10 selected states measured benefits. Without identifying and measuring such benefits (i.e., money saved or recovered) that result from using MMISs and other systems, CMS and the states cannot be assured of the systems' effectiveness in helping to prevent and detect improper payments. Moreover, without requiring states to institute approaches for measuring and reporting such outcomes, CMS officials lack an essential mechanism for ensuring that the federal financial assistance that states receive to help fund these systems effectively supports Medicaid program integrity efforts.", "Five of the 10 states faced challenges with using systems for managed care program integrity\u2013introduced by the content, quality, and definitions of data on services provided. However, 1 state had taken steps to overcome such challenges and had integrated data and implemented functionality needed to review managed care data both prior to and after payment. For its part, CMS had conducted training related specifically to collecting and analyzing these data to help prevent and detect improper payments in the Medicaid program."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that CMS require states to measure and report quantifiable benefits of program integrity systems when requesting federal funds, and to reflect their approach for doing so.

Federal laws authorize both federal and state  entities to protect the program from fraud, waste, and abuse. Specifically,  various provisions of federal law give CMS the authority to oversee  Medicaid program integrity and to set requirements with which state  Medicaid programs must comply. CMS oversees the states\u2019 Medicaid  programs by providing administrators with guidance related to statutory  and regulatory requirements, as well as technical assistance on specific  program integrity activities, such as the implementation of supporting  information systems.", "Further, the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 established the Medicaid  Integrity Program within CMS to support and oversee state program  integrity efforts. To carry out its oversight responsibilities, CMS  established within that program the Medicaid Integrity Group, which was  responsible for conducting comprehensive reviews of states\u2019 Medicaid  program integrity activities to assess their compliance with federal  program integrity laws and regulations.", "Administrators of the 56 state-based programs are responsible for the  day-to-day operations, including program integrity activities, of Medicaid.  State Medicaid administrators employ the expertise of program integrity  analysts to screen providers and determine whether the providers are  eligible to enroll in the program. These analysts are also responsible for  reviewing claims filed for services before they are paid, and for reviewing  claims after they have been paid.", "Provider enrollment: When enrolling providers to participate in the  program, states are to first verify the providers\u2019 eligibility. As part of  the enrollment screening process, state program integrity analysts  collect certain information about the providers, which may include the  results of any criminal background checks and whether they are  identified on lists that exclude or bar them from participating in other  states\u2019 Medicaid programs or the federal Medicare program. Any  providers who are determined to be ineligible as a result of  information obtained through the screening process are excluded from  participating in Medicaid.", "Prepayment claims review: The states also conduct reviews of  claims data submitted by providers prior to payment in attempts to  ensure that the claims were filed properly. For example, program  integrity analysts conduct reviews to identify errors in individual  claims, such as incorrect medical codes, and return claims that are  found to have errors to the providers, thus preventing payment of  such claims until the errors are corrected. The analysts may also  compare claims data to prior incidents of known fraudulent behavior in  their efforts to identify providers for further investigation.", "Post-payment claims review: Medicaid administrators also are to  take steps to identify payments that were made to providers for  improperly filed claims. In this regard, states\u2019 program integrity  analysts may compare data from multiple paid claims to related  provider records as they attempt to identify behaviors consistent with  fraudulent activity that had been identified previously. Providers  demonstrating such behaviors would then be subjected to additional  review by states\u2019 auditors and investigators, who are tasked to take  actions intended to recover the amounts reimbursed for improper or  fraudulent claims.", "Figure 1 presents a simplified illustration of the provider enrollment,  prepayment review, and post-payment review activities.", "The implementation of information systems is integral to states\u2019 efforts to  conduct the program integrity activities covering provider enrollment  through post-payment claims review. In this regard, the Social Security   provides that, to receive federal funds for Medicaid,  Act, as amended,every state must implement a claims processing and information retrieval  system to support the administration of the program. For the Medicaid  program, this system is the Medicaid Management Information System  (MMIS).", "In accordance with the act, as amended, and relevant regulations, CMS  further defined criteria that states must meet to be approved to receive  federal funds, including the implementation of system functionality that  supports key Medicaid business areas. Such areas would include  program performance management, business relationships, and  operations management. Program integrity is a component of the  performance management business area.", "CMS also defined requirements for implementing MMISs, including  various subsystems that support program integrity activities, such as  provider screening, claims processing, and utilization reviews.", "The MMIS provider subsystem is to be used to enroll and maintain a  state\u2019s network of providers for serving the Medicaid beneficiary  population. Among other things, this subsystem is to include  functionality needed to determine the eligibility of the providers  participating in Medicaid. For example, the system is to allow  Medicaid program administrators the ability to cross-reference license  and sanction information with other states and federal agencies in  order to identify providers who may not be eligible to enroll. State  Medicaid programs are to define and implement functionality within  this subsystem to validate providers\u2019 enrollment based on state- specific criteria, such as license and permit expiration dates.", "The MMIS claims processing subsystem is to be used to review data  from claims filed by providers before they are paid and is to provide  functionality needed to prevent improper payments of claims. For  example, when analyzing claims data prior to payment, this  subsystem is to be used by Medicaid administrators to identify  improperly filed claims through the implementation of prepayment  edits\u2014i.e., instructions that system developers code into the  subsystem to electronically compare claims data to program  requirements in order to assure that claims are filed properly before  they are approved for payment. Any claims that do not pass such  edits are denied for payment or flagged for additional review by  program integrity analysts.", "The MMIS surveillance and utilization review subsystem (SURS) is to  be used by program integrity analysts when they conduct post- payment reviews of claims in an attempt to detect any that were paid  improperly. Specifically, the subsystem provides functionality to  analyze data supporting the denial or payment of multiple claims  submitted by a particular provider to help identify patterns that may  indicate inappropriate provider behavior and, therefore, detect  improper payments of claims. For example, payments made to a  provider for an unusually large number of services for an uncommon  type of procedure over a relatively short period of time could indicate  fraudulent behavior on that provider\u2019s part and, therefore, warrant  additional review or investigation of the provider\u2019s practices.", "Additionally, within their MMIS IT environment, states may implement  other components, such as databases and data warehouses, to store the  beneficiary, claims, and provider data that are collected for processing  and analysis by the system and its subsystems.", "Further, in accordance with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care  Act (PPACA), CMS identified certain prepayment edits and required state  Medicaid administrators to incorporate these edits into their MMIS claims  processing subsystem.for identifying incorrect coding on Medicaid claims that, if undetected,  could lead to improper payments for ambulatory surgical center services,  outpatient hospital services, and durable medical equipment.", "Specifically, states are to implement functionality  Prepayment edits that provide such functionality were developed through  efforts of the National Correct Coding Initiative (NCCI)\u2014a program  implemented by CMS in 1996 for the Medicare fee-for-service program.  Through this initiative, CMS defined more than a million standard claims  processing prepayment edits to identify coding errors that are applicable  to state programs. For example, some of the edits can identify pairs of  medical billing codes that indicate to program integrity analysts any  services that should not be reported together, such as two codes for the  same service for the same beneficiary on the same date. In such cases,  the first code would be eligible for payment but the second code would be  denied. Other NCCI edits required for Medicaid programs are designed to  identify procedures that could not be performed during a patient\u2019s visit  because they would not be feasible based on anatomic or gender  considerations. For example, processing claims data against the edits  may identify services such as prenatal treatment for a male patient that  would not be a likely or feasible medical service. In addition to the NCCI  edits, states may design and implement prepayment edits based on their  own program experiences and needs to identify improperly filed claims  and prevent payment of such claims.", "Provider enrollment and pre- and post-payment claims data review  activities, and the MMIS subsystems that support them, were designed  primarily to address program integrity goals of states\u2019 delivery of fee-for- service health care to Medicaid beneficiaries. In fee-for-service plans,  providers are paid for each service that is delivered; they file claims for  reimbursement from Medicaid that include detailed data specific to the  service delivered during a patient\u2019s visit.", "However, as we noted in May 2014, over the past 15 years, states have  more frequently implemented managed care delivery systems for  providing health care services for Medicaid beneficiaries.care delivery, beneficiaries obtain some or all of their medical services  from organizations of providers that are under contract with the state to  provide Medicaid benefits in exchange for a monthly payment. The  payments to these managed care organizations are typically made by the  state Medicaid programs on a predetermined, per-person basis. While the  individual managed care providers do not file claims for reimbursement by  Medicaid, the managed care organizations are expected to report data to  state Medicaid programs that allow the Medicaid administrators to track  the services received by beneficiaries enrolled in managed care. These  data are referred to as encounter data and are obtained from claims for   With managed  reimbursement that providers submit to their managed care organizations  for services delivered.", "Encounter data are similar to the fee-for-service claims data, but they  typically do not include the same level of detail, and specific encounter  data elements may be defined differently than they are for claims data.  For example, encounter data generally would not include a Medicaid- billed amount for a particular beneficiary\u2019s visit to a provider because the  state does not pay the provider directly. In contrast, the data included on  a Medicaid fee-for-service claim would include a specific amount for  services delivered to a beneficiary during a visit since providers in fee-for- service plans bill and are reimbursed on a service-by-service basis. Thus,  all the data needed for analyses by MMISs and other systems that were  designed to process fee-for-service claims data will not always be  consistent or available from the encounter data that managed care  organizations collect and report to state Medicaid program administrators.  In contrast to the program integrity reviews conducted when administering  fee-for-service plans, which are largely based on pre- and post-payment  review of claims data, states\u2019 oversight of managed care organizations  often occurs through contracts and reporting requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Ten Selected States Rely on a Variety of Systems to Support Program Integrity", "paragraphs": ["All 10 of the states in our study had implemented MMIS subsystems to  support their program integrity efforts.

As a result, the data could not be effectively  analyzed by the systems to identify patterns in claims and services that  may help identify fraudulent or abusive provider behaviors and detect  improper payments. Thus, any analyses of such erroneous data could not  produce valid or reliable outcomes.", "Additionally, differences between the way some data values are defined  for managed care encounter and fee-for-service claims data cause  problems with using systems to prevent and detect improper payments  for managed care services. For example, claims processing subsystems  that were designed to process claims data for specific services covered  by fee-for-service plans may not properly process encounter data for  different services allowed under managed care (but not allowed by fee- for-service). Thus, some of the prepayment edits designed to analyze fee- for-service claims data can provide erroneous results when applied to  managed care encounter data. Additionally, managed care encounter  data analyzed by SURS during post-payment review could include  estimated rather than actual costs associated with services delivered to  patients, which would not reflect any providers\u2019 overcharges.  Consequently, services for which providers overcharged would not be  identifiable by SURS.", "Virginia administrators said they had experienced such challenges in  using their MMIS claims processing subsystem and SURS for analyzing  encounter data to support oversight of managed care plans because of  the way encounter data are defined.

Additionally, Maryland administrators  continued to experience challenges with using their SURS to conduct  post-payment reviews of managed care data for this reason. For  example, they said that encounter data do not typically include the same  values or level of detail as claims data.

Tennessee\u2019s Medicaid administrator told  us that, to do so, the state defined the data required from the managed  care organizations to include the content and level of detail that would be  reported by fee-for-service claims, rather than the less detailed data the  organizations had been reporting.", "Tennessee also required the organizations to report quality encounter  data in a timely manner so that they could be analyzed by the MMIS and  other systems.

If the data do not pass the edits, they are returned to the  managed care organization for corrections to be made. If the data are not  corrected and returned within 45 days, the organization is fined a certain  amount for each day it is late. When the corrected data are returned, they  are further reviewed by analysts who ensure the data needed to conduct  analyses are present before the data are stored in the state\u2019s Medicaid  data warehouse.

To  select the states for our sample, we obtained data on states\u2019 expenditures  for systems implementation and program integrity activities for fiscal  years 2004 through the first quarter of fiscal year 2014. We collected the  data from a CMS database to which the states are required to report  Medicaid program expenditures for which they request federal  reimbursements. We assessed the reliability of the CMS data by  reviewing prior GAO work that had accessed and used the data and prior  determinations that the data provided reliable evidence to support  findings, conclusions, and recommendations. We also held discussion  with CMS officials knowledgeable of the specific types of data recorded in  the database. Based on how we intended to use the information, we  determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the purpose of  selecting states for our study.", "We sorted the data we obtained based on states\u2019 total expenditures for  development and maintenance of their Medicaid Management Information  Systems (MMIS) and the reported administrative costs for program  integrity. We grouped the states, territories, and the District of Columbia  according to low, medium, and high levels of spending based on their  expenditures reported from fiscal year 2004 through the first quarter of  fiscal year 2014. For example, those in the low spending group were the  three states and two territories reporting the lowest expenditures, from  $574,836 to $66,497,668; those in the medium spending group were the  five states that reported expenditures, based on the median of all  amounts reported, from $202,724,728 to $240,891,446; and those in the  high spending group were the five states that reported the highest  expenditures, from $825,026,677 to $2,578,096,036. We calculated the  median expenditure for each group and identified the two states directly  above and the two states directly below each median, which identified 12  states. Of the 12 states that we identified based on the expenditure data  we collected and assessed, we selected 10 states\u2014three low- expenditure states (U.S. Virgin Islands, Tennessee, and Vermont), four  middle-expenditure states (Kentucky, Mississippi, Virginia, and Maryland),  and three high-expenditure states (North Carolina, Texas, and California).  Based on our assessment of the extent to which they met the selection  criteria defined within our methodology, we determined that any  information collected from these states would be sufficient for our use.", "We then developed and administered a questionnaire to collect  information regarding the selected states\u2019 use of systems to support  program integrity activities in their Medicaid programs, the technical  support they received from CMS, and any challenges the states faced  regarding their efforts to implement information systems for program  integrity purposes. The results of our study are not generalizable to  Medicaid programs administered by all states, territories, and the District  of Columbia.", "To address the first objective, we analyzed information taken from the  questionnaire responses about the selected states\u2019 program integrity  efforts and supporting systems. We also obtained and analyzed  documentation describing the types of systems they used to analyze  provider and claims data in support of program efforts to prevent and  detect improper payments. To determine the status of the systems, we  examined relevant project management documents, including project  plans and status reports, that provided information about systems  implementation dates and dates any significant enhancements and  replacements of the states\u2019 information systems were completed or  planned. For the states that were planning significant enhancements,  updates, or replacements of systems, we also reviewed requests for  proposals issued to potential contractors, along with statements of work  for ongoing initiatives, to identify the types of changes or enhancements  that the programs had planned to implement.", "To address the second objective, we obtained and examined federal  legislation, along with relevant agency plans, to identify legal and program  requirements for CMS to provide financial support, data, and other  technical resources to help states implement information systems for  program integrity purposes. We included in our scope resources such as  agency guidance and training provided to states and examined  documentation that described the funding, data sources, systems, and  other technical resources intended to help state Medicaid administrators  implement the system functionality they need to prevent and detect  improper payments.", "To determine how states use the resources, we examined information  from the questionnaires and analyzed documentation the states provided  describing their use of federal funds and the data sources, systems, and  technical training and guidance from CMS. We identified how each of the  states used federal financial support to develop and implement new  systems, operate existing systems, and fund the staff who use the  systems in support of program integrity efforts. We also identified various  ways the states integrated the data provided by CMS within their IT  environment and individual systems, along with the types of training  opportunities and technical support the states used to improve their ability  to develop and enhance information systems that effectively support  program integrity analysts\u2019 efforts. We examined states\u2019 responses from  the questionnaire to determine the extent to which the financial, data, and  other technical resources provided by the agency were reported to be  useful to states in their efforts to implement new and update existing  information systems that support the prevention and detection of improper  payments.", "To describe the extent to which the use of the systems were effective in  improving outcomes of the states\u2019 program integrity initiatives, we  reviewed best practices identified in our IT Investment management  framework for agencies\u2019 management of IT portfolios, including practices  for conducting investment analyses and determining financial and other  effects of maintaining systems. We obtained from Medicaid program  administrators documentation such as performance plans and audit  reports regarding practices for determining the effectiveness of the  different types of systems. We identified state programs that had  developed methodologies and practices for measuring any quantifiable  benefits realized from the use of specific systems. From those states we  collected additional documentation that identified ways the states had  measured quantifiable benefits, such as return on investments and cost  avoidances, attributable to the use of the systems, and compared them to  practices identified by our IT investment framework. Specifically, we  examined methods and calculations used to determine measures such as  amounts of payments withheld because of errors detected by the systems  during prepayment review and amounts of improper payments recovered  as a result of post-payment review activities supported by the systems.  For the states that did not measure quantifiable benefits, we discussed  with the Medicaid administrators their reasons for or inability to do so. We  used the information collected from the questionnaires and document  reviews to develop additional questions and conducted interviews with  state Medicaid officials.", "Finally, to address the third objective we analyzed information from our  questionnaire and interviews about states\u2019 experiences with implementing  information systems for program integrity purposes and any challenges  they faced in doing so. We identified challenges that were relevant to the  role that CMS plays in supporting states\u2019 efforts\u2014i.e., those other than  challenges related to state-based issues such as local funding levels,  internal data sharing between state entities, and economic conditions. We  obtained and reviewed CMS documentation, such as the Medicaid  Integrity Program\u2019s descriptions and plans that discussed activities  planned and initiated by the agency\u2019s Medicaid program integrity officials  to support states\u2019 administration of Medicaid, and compared the intent of  such activities to challenges the states identified. We also examined  agency schedules and training curricula to determine whether recent and  planned training and technical assistance sessions were relevant to  challenges the states identified. To identify any other actions CMS had  taken or planned to help states address any such challenges, we  examined annual reports the agency had provided to Congress that  described steps taken over the previous year to address goals and  objectives of the Medicaid Integrity Program. In addition, we held  discussions with CMS Medicaid officials regarding their efforts and intent  to address any known challenges associated with states\u2019 efforts to  implement information systems for program integrity purposes.", "For each of the objectives, we supplemented the information gained from  our documentation reviews by holding discussions with CMS officials and  state Medicaid program administrators, including those responsible for  implementing information systems used to help program integrity analysts  prevent and detect improper payments of Medicaid claims.", "We conducted this performance audit from November 2013 to January  2015 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Department of Health and Human Services", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contacts named above, Catina R.
