However, a 2005 Department of Transportation Inspector General investigation found that FAA had issued medical certificates to a small percentage of pilots with disqualifying medical conditions, such as heart conditions, schizophrenia, and drug or alcohol addiction. In response to your request, our report addresses the following questions: (1) what procedures does FAA use to certify that pilot applicants meet medical standards and (2) how does FAA determine that medical certificates have been properly issued? In addressing these objectives, GAO researched FAA guidance and federal regulations; interviewed federal officials; analyzed FAA's application review procedures, quality assurance program, and its use of the National Driver Register; and conducted a data match between FAA's pilot registry and Social Security Administration's disability programs. The data match does not determine if pilots receiving disability benefits have medical conditions that would disqualify them from holding an FAA medical certificate. GAO is not making recommendations in this report. The Department of Transportation generally agreed with our findings. FAA and the Social Security Administration provided technical clarifications, which we incorporated as appropriate."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["FAA's pilot medical certification procedures consist of a multi-step process intended to determine whether pilots meet medical standards. As part of its certification procedures, aviation medical examiners (AME) review information provided by pilot applicants and the results of their physical examination before issuing medical certificates. In the majority of cases (about88 percent in 2007), applicants meet medical standards and AMEs issue certificates. FAA uses a computer system to process all the applications. It designates some applications for additional review by FAA application examiners, such as when AMEs do not issue the medical certificate or defer the decision. The computer system also identifies for FAA review the applications in which AMEs issued the medical certificate and the application indicates potentially disqualifying medical conditions. Finally, FAA checks each pilot applicant against the National Driver Register to look for drug- and alcohol-related motor vehicle actions and indications of substance abuse. FAA has developed programs to help it determine whether it has properly issued medical certificates. Specifically, FAA has established two quality assurance review programs--one evaluating certificates that the AMEs issued and the other evaluating certificate decisions made by FAA application examiners. In its 2007 reviews, FAA identified 19 instances in which AMEs issued certificates to pilots who have disqualifying medical conditions as well as 16 cases in which FAA application examiners overlooked relevant medical documents and 44 with clerical errors. According to FAA officials, they plan to continue reviewing AME-issued certificates and collecting the results. These additional data from subsequent years could help FAA identify how well its procedures are ensuring that medical certificates are being properly issued. In addition, FAA relies on the National Driver Register check to help ensure pilots meet medical standards. Finally, due to recently resolved litigation, FAA currently does not check federal disability benefits databases for indications that pilots may have disqualifying medical conditions. Although our analysis of the Social Security Administration's disability databases found that 1,246 of 394,985 medically certified pilots were receiving disability benefits, this does not necessarily mean these pilots do not meet FAA medical standards. It may, however, indicate that federal disability databases can provide useful information on potentially disqualifying medical conditions."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is charged with regulating the  aviation industry and seeks to make the U. S. system one of the world\u2019s  safest. As part of its regulatory role, FAA currently oversees about 590,000  active pilots, in part by requiring periodic medical exams that certify the  pilots meet federal medical standards. Pilot medical checks are critical  because physically or mentally unfit pilots can pose a danger to  themselves and to the public. Conditions that disqualify applicants for  medical certification include heart disease, diabetes, impaired hearing or  vision, psychosis, drug and alcohol dependence, and any disease,  condition, defect, or treatment that prevents or could prevent a pilot from  safely performing his or her duties. During 2007, 438,152 pilots applied for  a medical certificate and were examined by FAA-designated physicians.", "A 2005 joint investigation by the Department of Transportation Office of  the Inspector General (DOT IG), Social Security Administration\u2019s Office of  Inspector General, and California\u2019s U.S. Attorney Office, known as  \u201cOperation Safe Pilot\u201d and reported by the DOT IG revealed that FAA had  issued medical certificates to a small percentage of pilots who had  disqualifying medical conditions that they did not report on their medical  certification applications. The DOT IG study compared pilots with medical  certificates in the state of California with the Social Security  Administration\u2019s disability information and found 48 pilots who had not  made FAA aware of their disqualifying medical conditions. Because of  concerns raised by this investigation, you asked us to assess FAA\u2019s efforts  for screening medical certification applicants and identifying medically  unqualified pilots. Accordingly, we answer the following questions (1)  what procedures does FAA use to certify that pilot applicants meet  medical standards and (2) how does FAA determine that medical  certificates have been properly issued? In addition, you asked us to  identify the number of pilots with current medical certificates who are  receiving disability benefits and determine if they provided FAA a Social  Security number. We issued a report in February 2008 describing federal  requirements for medical certification and background checks for pilots,  vessel masters, and commercial drivers.", "To identify FAA\u2019s procedures for pilot medical certification, we reviewed  agency guidance and federal regulations and met with FAA officials to  discuss FAA\u2019s procedures for assessing, certifying, and documenting the  physical condition of pilot applicants. We obtained information about how  FAA\u2019s application computer system sorts applications and identifies which  ones can be closed and which need review. We also obtained information  about how FAA accesses the National Driver Register to determine  whether pilot applicants have recent convictions for drug- and alcohol-  related motor vehicle actions. To identify how FAA determines that  medical certificates are properly issued, we analyzed FAA\u2019s application  review procedures and quality assurance programs. We obtained  information about FAA\u2019s progress in implementing DOT IG  recommendations to identify pilots receiving disability benefits. Finally,  we matched FAA\u2019s list of medically certified pilots with the Social Security  Administration\u2019s disability databases as of February 2008, to identify  whether pilots with medical certifications received disability benefits and  how many pilots who provided FAA with their Social Security numbers  received disability benefits compared to those who did not provide FAA  their Social Security numbers. We conducted our performance audit from  July 2007 through September 2008 in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards.

FAA authorizes pilots to fly specific types of  airplanes or use specific types of aeronautical instruments after they meet  certain training and testing requirements.", "Federal regulations establish three classes of medical certification that  correspond to the duties that pilots perform. Airline transport pilots that  serve as pilots in command of scheduled air carrier operations must hold  first-class medical certificates. Pilots that fly for compensation or hire or  serve as flight engineers or flight navigators, as well as air traffic control  tower operators, generally hold second-class medical certificates. Private  pilots hold third-class medical certificates. Pilots must undergo medical  examinations periodically to renew medical certificates (see table 1).", "A pilot begins the medical certification process by completing an  application, including reporting his or her medical history on the  application, certifying that it is complete and true, and authorizing the  National Driver Register, through a designated state department of motor  vehicles, to furnish to the FAA information pertaining to his or her driving  record.", "A pilot applicant is examined by an aviation medical examiner (AME),  who is a qualified physician in private practice in whom FAA has  delegated the authority to examine pilot applicants and make certification  decisions on behalf of FAA. To become an AME, FAA requires physicians  to receive basic training at its Civil Aerospace Medical Institute and  recurrent training through seminars to stay abreast of any changing  medical science. FAA collects information through a database to monitor  and evaluate the performance of AMEs. For example, if an AME makes an  error, FAA describes the type of error that was made in its database.", "Finally, FAA has the authority to supersede and modify an AME\u2019s decision  to issue or deny a medical certificate."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FAA Uses Medical Examinations and Application Review Procedures to Determine Whether Pilots Meet Standards", "paragraphs": ["FAA has established medical certification procedures to identify whether  pilots meet medical standards.

Pilots are responsible for providing  information on the application describing their medical history to alert the  AME of any health-related condition, such as cardiac problems or mental  disorders. Pilots also report whether their FAA medical certificate has  ever been denied, suspended, or revoked. In addition to answering medical  questions, the application requires the pilot to report any convictions and  administrative actions (e.g., suspensions or revocations) involving driving  while intoxicated, impaired, or under the influence of alcohol or drugs.  The AME is responsible for reviewing the applicant\u2019s responses on the  application form to identify inconsistencies, missing information, and  disqualifying conditions.", "The AMEs next conduct a physical examination. In 2007, FAA had about  4,400 AMEs conducting physical exams. To verify pilot information and  identify potential medical issues, the AME examines the pilot for vision,  hearing, mental, neurological, cardiovascular, and general medical  conditions. Additionally, if the pilot is applying for a first-class medical  certificate, the AME must conduct an electrocardiogram annually for  pilots over the age of 40. During the course of the medical examination,  the AME should use the information obtained from the review to ask the  applicant pertinent questions, especially questions that deal with type of  medications and pilot\u2019s medical history. For example, if the applicant  reported use of anticoagulants or indicated that he or she had a coronary  artery angioplasty procedure, then the AME would be prompted to ask the  applicant to provide a copy of any FAA correspondence that authorized  medical certification on the medication or following the procedure; or  request the applicant to provide medical documentation regarding these  treatments and conditions. Certain aspects of the applicant\u2019s medical  history may require more information. For example, if the pilot answered  yes to having experienced heart or vascular trouble on his or her  application, the AME is required to ask the pilot to clarify the significance  of that item of history by asking for supplementary reports from the  applicant\u2019s personal physician.", "After reviewing the medical history and completing the medical  examination, AMEs make one of the following determinations: issue a  medical certificate, issue a special certificate, defer making a decision, or  deny the certificate.", "The AME may issue a medical certificate when the applicant meets all  medical standards. In such cases, the pilot leaves the AME\u2019s office with his  or her medical certificate in hand.", "AMEs may also issue a special, time-limited medical certificate (or special  issuance) to pilots whose medical conditions do not meet the federal  medical standards but have received FAA authorization to obtain a  medical certificate because they can perform their duties without  endangering public safety. FAA may require pilots to take a special  medical flight test, practical test, or medical evaluation for this purpose.", "The AME may defer the application for FAA review when the applicant  exhibits one or more disqualifying medical conditions.

FAA\u2019s computer system, called  Document Imaging Workflow System (DIWS), initially processes all  medical certification applications and designates each one as either a  priority or a non-priority application. See table 2 for definition of priority  and non-priority applications. In 2007, of the 438,152 medical certification  applications received, DIWS designated 34,590 applications as priority  applications, 399,962 applications as non-priority, and 3,600 as in process.  FAA\u2019s computer system identifies and closes most non-priority  applications. In 2007, for example, FAA automatically processed and  closed the applications where AMEs issued medical certificates\u2014about 88  percent of all medical applications.", "After AMEs submit the applications, DIWS routes priority applications to  application examiners for review. These examiners review the medical  certification applications, supporting documentation, and any previous  medical issues in a pilot\u2019s medical file. They follow FAA regulations,  guidance, and consult with FAA physicians in order to decide whether to  issue or deny the certificate. In 2007, FAA application examiners  evaluated all 34,590 priority applications (see fig. 2). In 2006, as a result of  growing concern by pilots and FAA\u2019s management about the length of time  to review priority applications, FAA established a goal of completing each  application review in 30 days. According to FAA, as of February 2008, the  average time to process a priority application is 24 days.  0.82% In process(3,600)", "71.2% (34,590)", "Priority applications  (deferred, denied, and  special issuances)", "28.8% (13,967)", "Non-priority  applications with  potentially disqualifying  medical conditions  (48,557)", "FAA\u2019s computer system also evaluates non-priority applications  (applications where the AME decided to issue a certificate) and identifies  ones where the pilot or AME indicated one or more potentially  disqualifying medical conditions on the application. FAA programmed  DIWS to route these applications to application examiners for review due  to the presence of a potentially disqualifying medical condition. For  example, in 2007, of the applications that were designated as non-priority  applications, DIWS identified 13,967 with one or more potentially  disqualifying medical condition such as a history of heart or vascular  trouble, diabetes, or epilepsy. However, according to FAA officials, FAA\u2019s  application examiners rarely if ever review these applications due to  workload and time constraints and these applications are removed from  the examiners\u2019 workload after about two months. Once removed, non- priority applications are closed without being reviewed by an application  examiner, thus making the AME\u2019s decision to issue the medical certificate  final. A random sample of closed non-priority applications are  subsequently selected for quality assurance review.", "FAA officials indicated that one impact of not reviewing non-priority  applications is a greater reliance on AMEs to make a correct  determination and identify pilots that may have potentially disqualifying  medical conditions. Because FAA application examiners rarely have time  to review these non-priority applications, the burden is on the AME to  make the correct determination. According to FAA, this makes the AMEs  the first and sometimes the only line of defense because few if any non- priority applications are ever reviewed. More often than not, the AME  decisions are considered final.", "Because of their importance, FAA trains AMEs to identify pilots that have  potentially disqualifying medical conditions or may not be medically fit to  fly. Moreover, FAA teaches AMEs how to detect discrepancies in  applicant responses. However, officials we spoke to also acknowledged  that no matter how well-trained the AMEs, the current medical  certification procedures are based on an honor system and rely on pilots  being truthful on the application form. Failure to disclose medical  information on the application form can be the basis for suspension or  revocation of a medical certificate.

FAA  transmits applicants\u2019 names, dates of birth, and Social Security numbers, if  available, to the National Driver Register weekly. If the search results  indicate the applicant has drug- or alcohol-related motor vehicle actions,  the FAA investigator contacts the state motor vehicle agency for  information to request the driving record for review. When applicants do  not provide their Social Security numbers, FAA investigators use  applicants\u2019 demographic information and physical descriptive information  to validate identities. According to FAA officials, the lack of a Social  Security number does not present a significant barrier, at this time, for  completing their investigation. However, according to FAA officials,  access to the Social Security number is the most efficient means of  verifying a pilot\u2019s identity.", "Once FAA verifies the alcohol-related action, it determines whether the  person was a pilot at the time of the offense and whether he or she  reported the conviction to FAA. If the FAA investigator finds that the  pilot failed to properly report a drug- or alcohol-related action, he or she  conducts the investigation and sends the case to FAA legal counsel for  possible enforcement action. If an applicant did not report the convictions  or license actions on the application for medical certification, FAA may  deny, suspend, or revoke the applicant\u2019s pilot and/or medical certificates,  if the applicant was aware of the conviction or license action. Applicants  can appeal certificate denials, suspensions, and revocations. (See fig. 3).  According to FAA officials, in 2007 FAA found 2,708 potential matches in  the National Driver Register and recommended 875 enforcement actions  for failure to properly report an alcohol-related motor vehicle action.  These enforcement actions included issuing warning letters, assessing civil  penalties, and suspending or revoking the pilot\u2019s license and/or medical  certificate.", "FAA officials reported that the National Driver Register investigation is  taking longer to complete than before July 2007, because FAA  investigators no longer have electronic access to each states\u2019 records. FAA  investigators had used the National Crime Information Center (NCIC) to  access state records electronically and obtain driving-related conviction  information back from the states\u2019 motor vehicle agencies in minutes.  However, in May 2007, FAA lost access to NCIC after the Justice  Department concluded FAA\u2019s investigations unit did not have a criminal  justice function and therefore had no need to access databases containing  criminal information. According to FAA officials, the lack of electronic  access to states\u2019 data has increased the time it takes to complete the  preliminary investigation to confirm a reportable alcohol-related incident  is on the driving record. FAA officials told us staff turnover at the state  agencies also creates delays because new employees do not understand  why FAA is requesting the information and investigators have to take time  to educate the new staff about FAA\u2019s authority. During the first half of  fiscal year 2008, FAA investigations took about 59 days on average,  although the time it takes to complete an investigation varies depending  on the facts of the case. However, FAA has tried to limit the impact by  shifting staff and workload and authorizing compensatory time.

In addition, this  quality assurance program in part takes the place of application  examiners\u2019 reviews. Application examiners rarely review these  applications under current staffing levels, according to FAA officials, if  they are to meet the 30-day performance goal.", "FAA conducted the first quality assurance review of AME issuance  decisions in 2006, and found that about 95.7 percent of the applications  were appropriately issued, 1.8 percent had insufficient information, and  2.5 percent were inappropriately issued. In most cases, the applications  that were inappropriately issued contained information that should have  led the AMEs to defer the decision to FAA rather than issuing the medical  certificate.

Of those selected, FAA found that AMEs appropriately issued  96.6 percent or 483 of the certificates and issued 3.4 percent (17  certificates) when the application lacked complete information. However,  once FAA collected the appropriate documentation, it determined that  none of these certificates were inappropriately issued by AMEs.", "FAA randomly selected another 500 non-priority applications from 5,305  issued applications that DIWS identified as having one or more potentially  disqualifying conditions. FAA found that AMEs appropriately issued 93.8  percent or 469 of the certificates, issued 2.4 percent (12 certificates) when  the application lacked complete information, and inappropriately issued  3.8 percent (19 certificates) of the sampled certificates. According to FAA,  if this rate were also applied to the 5,305 pilot applications that were  processed without further review, 202 medical certificates would have  been issued inappropriately in the January through June 2007 period. In  general, these were applications in which the AME issued the certificate  when he or she should have deferred the decision to FAA due to  indications of disqualifying medical problems. For example, a pilot who  had reported having a seizure was hospitalized overnight, and prescribed  anti-seizure medication for a month. The AME issued the medical  certificate when the application should have been deferred to FAA for  final determination. According to FAA, it took a range of actions  depending on the nature of the error, such as gathering additional  information about the medical condition, contacting the pilot or AME, and  revoking the medical certificate, although it did not track the number of  medical certificates that were revoked. FAA officials noted that they share  the results with managers, supervisors, and AMEs and at meetings to make  AMEs aware of the problems they are finding.", "FAA officials indicated that they plan to continue the quality assurance  reviews of non-priority applications on a semi-annual basis and collect  data from the reviews. These additional data from subsequent years could  help identify increases or decreases in incomplete or inappropriately  issued certificates and demonstrate how well its certification procedures  are ensuring that medical certificates are being properly issued.", "The second quality assurance program consists of quality assurance  specialists reviewing at least ten percent of (1) priority applications that  each FAA application examiners had evaluated and (2) some non-priority  applications with potentially disqualifying medical conditions. These  applications are selected randomly by DIWS. FAA established this  program in 2002 to ensure application examiners\u2019 determinations comply  with FAA documentation standards and certification guidelines. FAA  officials told us that quality assurance specialists review up to 50 percent  of applications for application examiners who are new or in training.  Following their review of the applicant\u2019s medical information, the quality  assurance specialists determine whether they agree with the decision the  FAA application examiner made and look for errors that may lead to  incorrect determinations. FAA uses monthly reports on the results of these  reviews to identify trends in error types. For example, FAA reported in  2007 it reviewed 1,646 applications and found that application examiners  made clerical errors in 44 applications and overlooked relevant medical  documentation in 16. In its 2007 reviews, FAA did not find any medical  certificates that application examiners had inappropriately issued.

DOT IG\u2019s investigation indicated that federal agencies  that provide disability benefits (e.g., the Social Security Administration  (SSA) or the Departments of Labor or Veteran Affairs) would have  information that FAA could use to compare with its information about  pilot medical qualifications.

As we report above, one of FAA\u2019s  quality assurance programs found that the majority, but not all, of the  sampled medical certificates were properly issued. Because FAA only has  two years of quality assurance data, it has not yet identified potential  trends regarding the number of improperly issued medical certificates.  However, if FAA continues collecting the quality assurance data, as it  plans to do, it will have an opportunity to analyze the data for such trends  and further help FAA identify weaknesses in its guidance and practices.  Finally, due to recent litigation, FAA has decided not to use independent  databases that contain disability information.
