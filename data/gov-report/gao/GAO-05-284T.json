Proper accounting and reporting practices are essential in the public sector. The U.S. government is the largest, most complex, and most diverse entity on earth today. Its services--homeland security, national defense, Social Security, health care, mail delivery, and food inspection, to name a few--directly affect the well-being of almost every American. Sound decisions on the current results and future direction of vital federal government programs and policies are made more difficult without timely, reliable, and useful financial and performance information. Until the problems discussed in GAO's audit report on the U.S. government's consolidated financial statements are adequately addressed, they will continue to (1) hamper the federal government's ability to reliably report a significant portion of its assets, liabilities, costs, and other information; (2) affect the federal government's ability to reliably measure the full cost as well as the financial and nonfinancial performance of certain programs; (3) impair the federal government's ability to adequately safeguard significant assets and properly record various transactions; and (4) prevent the federal government from having reliable financial information to operate in an economical, efficient, and effective manner."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The federal government completed its consolidated financial statements on December 15, 2004. This is just 76 days after the end of the fiscal year--a record for timeliness. However, as in the previous 7 fiscal years, certain material weaknesses in internal control and in selected accounting and financial reporting practices resulted in conditions that continued to prevent GAO from being able to provide the Congress and American citizens an opinion as to whether the consolidated financial statements of the U.S. government are fairly stated in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Three major impediments to an opinion on the consolidated financial statements continue to be (1) serious financial management problems at the Department of Defense, (2) the federal government's ineffective process for preparing the consolidated financial statements, and (3) the federal government's inability to adequately account for and reconcile intragovernmental activity and balances between federal agencies. Further, in our opinion, the federal government did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and compliance due to numerous material weaknesses. While GAO was unable to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements of the U.S. government, several key items deserve emphasis in order to put the information contained in the financial statements and Management's Discussion and Analysis in perspective. First, the federal government reported a $412.3 billion unified budget deficit and a $568 billion on-budget deficit in fiscal year 2004, representing approximately 3.6 percent and 4.9 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), respectively. Second, the U.S. government's reported liabilities, commitments, and other obligations grew by over $13 trillion in fiscal year 2004, primarily due to enactment of the new Medicare prescription drug benefit, and now surpass $43 trillion, representing close to four times current GDP. In addition, while the size of the nation's long-term fiscal imbalance grew significantly during the fiscal year, the retirement of the \"baby boom\" generation is closer to becoming a reality. Given these and other factors, it seems clear that the nation's current fiscal path is unsustainable and that tough choices by the President and the Congress will be necessary in order to address the nation's large and growing fiscal imbalance. An emerging issue during fiscal year 2004 that merits concern and close scrutiny was the growing number of Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act agencies that restated certain of their financial statements for fiscal year 2003 to correct errors. Frequent restatements to correct errors can undermine public trust and confidence in both the entity and all responsible parties. The material internal control weaknesses discussed in this testimony serve to increase the risk that additional errors may occur and not be identified on a timely basis by management or the auditors, resulting in further restatements."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss our report on the U.S.  government\u2019s consolidated financial statements for fiscal years 2004 and  2003.

With accelerated reporting, which we support in concept, it is even  more imperative that federal agency management continue to work toward  fully resolving the pervasive and generally long-standing material  weaknesses that have been reported at the agency level for the past 9 fiscal  years.

Once again, the trustees\u2019 reports confirmed  that both the Social Security and Medicare programs are unsustainable in  their present form. The trustees also noted that Medicare\u2019s financial  difficulties are much more severe than those confronting Social Security.  Furthermore, the new prescription drug benefit has significantly increased  the federal government\u2019s commitments associated with the Medicare  program. Specifically, in their 2004 report, the trustees estimated the  present value cost to the federal government of this new benefit over the  next 75 years to be $8.1 trillion as of January 1, 2004. The trustees  reiterated the message contained in their previous reports that action to  address the financial difficulties facing Social Security and Medicare  should be taken in a timely manner and that the sooner these financial  challenges are addressed, the more varied and less disruptive the solutions  can be.", "The federal government\u2019s gross debt as of September 2004 was about $7.4  trillion, or about $25,000 for every man, woman, and child in the country.  But that number excludes such items as the gap between promised and  funded Social Security and Medicare benefits, veterans\u2019 health care, and a  range of other liabilities, commitments, and contingencies that the federal  government has pledged to support. If these items are factored in, the  current dollar burden for every American rises to about $145,000 per  person, or about $350,000 per full-time worker.", "Current financial reporting does not clearly and transparently show the  wide range of responsibilities, programs, and activities that may either  obligate the federal government to future spending or create an  expectation for such spending.  Thus, it provides an unrealistic and even  misleading picture of the federal government\u2019s overall performance,  financial condition, and future fiscal outlook.  Few federal agencies  adequately show the results they are getting with the taxpayer dollars they  spend.  In addition, too many significant federal government revenues\u2014as  well as commitments and obligations such as those associated with Social  Security and Medicare\u2014are not adequately and consistently disclosed in  the federal government\u2019s consolidated financial statements and budget, and  current federal financial reporting standards do not require such  disclosure.  The Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board recently  completed a project on accounting and reporting of earmarked funds,  which include the Social Security and Medicare trust funds, and has a  project underway to consider recognition, measurement, and display of  social insurance obligations.", "Figure 1 shows some selected fiscal exposures.  The spectrum of these  exposures ranges from explicit liabilities shown on the consolidated  financial statements to implicit promises embedded in current policy or  public expectations. These liabilities, commitments, and promises have  created a fiscal imbalance that will put unprecedented strains on the  nation\u2019s future spending and tax policies.  Although economic growth can  help, the projected fiscal gap is now so large that the federal government  will not be able to simply grow its way out of the problem.  Tough choices  by the President and the Congress are inevitable.", "GAO\u2019s fiscal policy simulations illustrate that the fiscal policies in place  today\u2014absent substantive entitlement reform or unprecedented changes  in tax and/or spending policies\u2014will result in large, escalating, and  persistent deficits that are economically unsustainable over the long term.  Assuming that discretionary spending grows with inflation and all existing  tax cuts are allowed to expire when scheduled under current law, spending  for Social Security and health care programs would grow to consume over  three-quarters of federal revenue by 2040.  Moreover, if all expiring tax  provisions are extended and discretionary spending keeps pace with the  economy, by 2040 total federal revenues may be adequate to pay little more  than interest on the federal debt.  Without reform, known demographic  trends, rising health care costs, and projected growth in federal spending  for Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid will result in massive fiscal  pressures that, if not effectively addressed, could cripple the economy,  threaten our national security, and adversely affect the quality of life of  Americans in the future.", "The President and the Congress face the challenge of sorting out the many  claims on the federal budget without the budget enforcement mechanisms  or fiscal benchmarks that guided the federal government through the years  of deficit reduction into a brief period of federal surpluses. While a number  of steps will be necessary to address this challenge, as outlined in my  February 2, 2005, remarks at the Press Club, truth and transparency in  federal government financial reporting and budgeting are essential  elements of any attempt to address the nation\u2019s long-term fiscal challenges.  Further, Congress needs to have access to the long-term cost of selected  spending and tax proposals before they enact related laws.  The fiscal risks  just mentioned can be managed only if they are properly accounted for and  publicly disclosed, including the many existing commitments facing the  federal government. In addition, new budget control mechanisms will be  required, along with effective approaches to successfully engage in a  fundamental review, reassessment, and reprioritization of the base of  federal government programs and policies. In this regard, we should not  assume that all defense and homeland security expenditures are both  necessary and prudent. Furthermore, the use of across-the-board  adjustments to address the spending imbalance serves to avoid making the  necessary difficult choices, is inequitable, and simply will not get the job  done."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Potential Impact of Restatements on Agencies\u2019 Financial Statements", "paragraphs": ["An emerging issue during fiscal year 2004 that merits concern and close  scrutiny was the growing number of CFO Act agencies that restated certain  of their financial statements for fiscal year 2003 to correct errors.  As  shown in appendix II, at least 11 of the 23 CFO Act agencies fell into this  category as compared with at least 5 CFO Act agencies that had  restatements covering their fiscal year 2002 financial statements in fiscal  year 2003.  At least 3 CFO Act agencies had restatements in both years. For  example, in fiscal year 2003, one agency misstated certain of its fiscal year  2002 financial statements by about $1 billion.  The following year, this same  agency restated certain of its fiscal year 2003 financial statements by over  $5 billion.  Nonetheless, for both years, the agency received unqualified  audit opinions on its financial statements.", "Nine of the 11 agencies having restatements for fiscal year 2003 had  received unqualified opinions on their originally issued fiscal year 2003  financial statements.  Seven of the nine auditors issued unqualified  opinions on the restated financial statements, which in substance replace  the auditors\u2019 opinions on their respective agencies\u2019 original fiscal year 2003  financial statements.  For two of these nine, the auditors not only withdrew  their unqualified opinion on the fiscal year 2003 financial statements but  also issued other than unqualified opinions on their respective agencies\u2019  restated fiscal year 2003 financial statements because they could not  determine whether there were any additional misstatements and the effect  that such could have on the restated fiscal year 2003 financial statements.", "The material internal control weaknesses discussed in this testimony  increase the risk that additional misstatements may occur and not be  identified on a timely basis by management or the auditors, resulting in  further restatements.  Frequent restatements to correct errors can  undermine public trust and confidence in both the entity and all  responsible parties.  According to Statement of Federal Financial  Accounting Standards (SFFAS) No. 21, Reporting Corrections of Errors  and Changes in Accounting Principles, prior period financial statements  presented should only be restated for corrections of errors that caused  such statements to be materially misstated.  Errors in financial statements  result from mathematical mistakes, mistakes in the application of  accounting principles, or oversight or misuse of facts that existed at the  time the financial statements were prepared.  The restatements to CFO Act  agencies\u2019 fiscal year 2003 financial statements ranged from correcting two  line items on one agency\u2019s balance sheet to numerous line items on several  of another agency\u2019s financial statements.  The amounts of the agencies\u2019  restatements ranged from several million dollars to over $91 billion.", "As part of our fiscal year 2004 audit, we reviewed certain federal agencies\u2019  fiscal year 2003 Statement of Budgetary Resources (SBR) for consistency  of (1) certain information reported in the SBR with related information  reported in the agencies\u2019 other financial statements and notes and (2) the  offsetting receipts and net outlays reported in the SBR with published  governmentwide reports.  We found significant inconsistencies in these  areas, which we brought to the attention of these agencies and their  auditors prior to completion of their fiscal year fiscal year 2004 audits.  For  example, we notified a federal agency that the net outlays reported in its  fiscal year 2003 SBR were overstated by about $91 billion due to certain  offsetting receipts that were not reported in the SBR as offsets to outlays,  as required by OMB guidance.  In fiscal year 2004, this agency\u2019s fiscal year  2003 SBR was restated, reducing its previously reported net outlays from  $596 billion to $505 billion.  At least four of the nine agencies that received  unqualified opinions on their fiscal year 2003 financial statements restated  certain of these financial statements in fiscal year 2004 to address some of  the significant inconsistencies we identified in the SBR.", "The transparency of the restatements in the agency auditors\u2019 reports and  the agencies\u2019 financial statements is also a concern of ours. We believe  that the auditor\u2019s report should clearly inform the reader about the  correction of a material misstatement.  In our view, the reader of the  financial statements and auditor\u2019s report should be able to readily  understand that the financial statements originally issued by management  in the previous year and the opinion thereon should no longer be relied on  and instead the restated financial statements and the related auditor\u2019s  opinion should be used. The reader should also be able to gain at least a  basic understanding as to why the agency needed to restate its prior year  financial statements and the impact of the restatement on the financial  statements.", "In our preliminary review of the fiscal year 2003 restatements, several  issues regarding the inadequate transparency in connection with the  reporting on the restatements were readily apparent.  First, two of the nine  agency auditors that had issued unqualified opinions the previous year on  their respective agencies\u2019 originally issued fiscal year 2003 financial  statements did not include a reference to management\u2019s restatement  footnote in their audit reports.  Second, while our analysis of restatements  is just underway, the information included in the auditors\u2019 reports along  with the agency\u2019s financial statements were in some instances not  sufficient in our view for a reader of the financial statements to clearly  understand the error that occurred and the effects it had on the financial  statements.  Third, while U.S. generally accepted accounting principles do  not expressly require financial statements to be labeled as restated, 9 of the  11 agencies having fiscal year 2003 restatements did so, which we support.  However, 2 of the 11 did not label their prior year restated financial  statements as restated, which we believe also demonstrates a lack of  transparency.  As I highlighted earlier, in keeping with full transparency and  accountability, when restatements occur, all readers should be able to  understand the ramifications of what happened and that the financial  statements originally issued by management, along with the related  auditor\u2019s opinion, should no longer be relied on.  Furthermore, agencies  that have to restate their prior year financial statements for material errors  should not refer to their prior year opinions as having been unqualified  since, by definition, the restatement means they should not have received  an unqualified opinion on their prior year\u2019s statement(s).", "We plan to perform a more detailed review of the nature and causes of the  restatements during our audit of the fiscal year 2005 consolidated financial  statements, and later this year will report separately on the results of this  work."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Highlights of Major Issues Related to the U.S. Government\u2019s Consolidated Financial Statements for Fiscal Years 2004 and 2003", "paragraphs": ["As I mentioned earlier, as has been the case for the previous 7 fiscal years,  the federal government continues to have a significant number of material  weaknesses related to financial systems, fundamental recordkeeping and  financial reporting, and incomplete documentation.  Several of these  material weaknesses, which generally have existed for years, contributed  to our disclaimer of opinion on the U.S. government\u2019s consolidated  financial statements for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2004, and  2003. Appendix IV describes these material deficiencies in more detail  and highlights their primary effects on the consolidated financial  statements and on the management of federal government operations.  There may also be additional issues that could affect the consolidated  financial statements that have not been identified.  The material  deficiencies we identified were the federal government\u2019s inability to satisfactorily determine that property, plant, and equipment and  inventories and related property, primarily held by the Department of  Defense (DOD), were properly reported in the consolidated financial  statements; reasonably estimate or adequately support amounts reported for certain  liabilities, such as environmental and disposal liabilities, or determine  whether commitments and contingencies were complete and properly  reported; support significant portions of the total net cost of operations, most  notably related to DOD, and adequately reconcile disbursement activity  at certain agencies; ensure that the federal government\u2019s consolidated financial statements  were consistent with the underlying audited agency financial  statements, balanced, and in conformity with GAAP; adequately account for and reconcile intragovernmental activity and  balances between federal agencies; and resolve material differences that exist between the total net outlays  reported in federal agencies\u2019 SBRs and the records used by Treasury to  prepare the Statements of Changes in Cash Balance.", "In addition to these material deficiencies, we found four other material  weaknesses in internal control as of September 30, 2004. These weaknesses  are discussed in more detail in appendix V, including their primary effects  on the consolidated financial statements and on the management of federal  government operations. These material weaknesses were the federal  government\u2019s inability to  implement effective processes and procedures for properly estimating  the cost of certain lending programs, related loan guarantee liabilities,  and value of direct loans; determine the extent to which improper payments exist;  identify and resolve information security control weaknesses and  manage information security risks on an ongoing basis; and effectively manage its tax collection activities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Continuing Systems Problems Hinder Accountability", "paragraphs": ["The ability to produce the data needed for efficient and effective  management of day-to-day operations in the federal government and  provide the necessary accountability to taxpayers and the Congress has  been a long-standing challenge at most federal agencies. The results of the  fiscal year 2004 assessments performed by agency inspectors general or  their contract auditors under FFMIA show that these problems continue to  affect financial management systems at most of the 23 CFO Act agencies.  While the problems are much more severe at some agencies than at others,  the nature and severity of the problems indicate that overall, management  at most CFO Act agencies lacks the complete range of information needed  for accountability, performance reporting, and decision making. These  problems include nonintegrated financial systems, lack of accurate and  timely recording of data, inadequate reconciliation procedures, and  noncompliance with accounting standards and the U.S. Government  Standard General Ledger (SGL).", "The inability of agencies to meet federal financial management systems  requirements continues to be the major barrier to achieving compliance  with FFMIA. Under FFMIA, CFO Act agency auditors are required to report  whether agencies\u2019 financial management systems substantially comply  with (1) federal financial management systems requirements, (2)  applicable federal accounting standards, and (3) the SGL at the transaction  level as part of the agencies\u2019 financial statement audits.  These factors are  critical for improving accountability over government operations and  routinely producing sound cost and operating performance information.  As shown in figure 3, instances of noncompliance with federal financial  management systems requirements were the compliance issue most  frequently reported by auditors. These instances of noncompliance  involved not only core financial systems, but also administrative and  programmatic systems.", "For fiscal year 2004, auditors for 16 of the 23 CFO Act agencies reported  that the agencies\u2019 financial management systems did not comply  substantially with one or more of FFMIA\u2019s three requirements. For 6 of the  remaining 7 CFO Act agencies, auditors provided negative assurance,  meaning that nothing came to their attention indicating that the agencies\u2019  financial management systems did not substantially meet FFMIA  requirements. The auditors for these 6 agencies did not definitively state  whether the agencies\u2019 systems substantially complied with FFMIA  requirements, as is required under the statute. In contrast, auditors for the  Department of Labor provided positive assurance by stating that, in their  opinion, the department\u2019s financial management systems substantially  complied with the requirements of FFMIA.  The Department of Homeland  Security (DHS) was not subject to the requirements of the CFO Act in fiscal  year 2004 and, consequently, was not required to comply with FFMIA.  Accordingly, DHS\u2019s auditors did not report on DHS\u2019s compliance with  FFMIA. However, the auditors identified and reported deficiencies that  related to the aforementioned three requirements of FFMIA.  With the  recent passage of the Department of Homeland Security Financial  Accountability Act, DHS has been designated as a CFO agency.  With this  designation, DHS is now required to implement and maintain financial  management systems that comply with FFMIA, and its auditors will be  required to report on the department\u2019s financial management systems\u2019  compliance beginning with fiscal year 2005.", "In an effort to address problems such as nonintegrated systems, inadequate  reconciliations, and lack of compliance with the SGL, a number of agencies  have efforts underway to implement new financial management systems or  to upgrade existing systems.  Agencies expect that the new systems will  provide reliable, useful, and timely data to support managerial decision  making and assist taxpayer and congressional oversight.  Whether in  government or the private sector, implementing and upgrading systems is a  difficult job and brings a degree of new risk.  Organizations that follow and  effectively implement accepted best practices in systems development and  implementation (commonly referred to as disciplined processes) can  manage and reduce these risks to acceptable levels.  However, our work at  DOD, the Department of  Health and Human Services (HHS), and the  National Aeronautics and Space Administrationhas shown that these  agencies, which all have experienced significant problems in implementing  new financial management systems, are not following the necessary  disciplined processes for efficient and effective development and  implementation of such systems.  Further, the Department of Veterans  Affairs recently halted pilot implementation of its new core financial  system, in which it had invested a reported $249 million.  The problems  cited by the Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Inspector General  were similar to those we noted at DOD, HHS, and the National Aeronautics  and Space Administration.  As the federal government moves forward with  ambitious modernization efforts to identify opportunities to eliminate  redundant systems and enhance information reliability and availability,  adherence to disciplined processes will be a crucial element to reduce risks  to acceptable levels.  Given the nature and magnitude of the problems  facing federal agencies, we recognize that it will take time, investment, and  sustained emphasis to successfully modernize agencies' underlying  financial management systems."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Addressing Major Impediments to an Opinion on Consolidated Financial Statements", "paragraphs": ["For the past 8 fiscal years, the federal government has been required to  prepare, and have its consolidated financial statements audited.  Successfully meeting this requirement is closely linked to the requirements  for the CFO Act agencies (and now all covered executive agencies) to also  have audited financial statements.

With  the benefit of the past 8 years\u2019 experience in having the required financial  statements subjected to audit, more intensified attention will be needed on  the most serious obstacles to achieving an opinion on the U.S.  government\u2019s consolidated financial statements.  There are three primary  ongoing reasons why the consolidated financial statements remained  unauditable for fiscal year 2004: (1) serious financial management  problems at DOD, (2) the federal government\u2019s ineffective process for  preparing the consolidated financial statements, and (3) the federal  government\u2019s inability to adequately account for and reconcile  intragovernmental activity and balances between federal agencies."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Financial Management at DOD", "paragraphs": ["Essential to achieving an opinion on the consolidated financial statements  is resolution of the serious financial management problems at DOD, which  we have designated as high risk since 1995.

DOD\u2019s financial  management problems are pervasive, complex, long-standing, and deeply  rooted in virtually all business operations throughout the department. To  date, none of the military services or major DOD components has passed  the test of an independent financial audit because of pervasive  weaknesses in financial management systems, operations, and controls.  The seriousness of the weaknesses in DOD\u2019s business operations  underscores the importance of no longer condoning the status quo at DOD.  Although the Secretary of Defense and several key agency officials have  shown commitment to transformation, as evidenced by key initiatives such  as the Business Management Modernization Program and the Financial  Improvement Initiative, little tangible evidence of significant broad-based  and sustainable improvements has been seen in DOD\u2019s business operations  to date. For example, the department\u2019s former comptroller started the  Financial Improvement Initiative with the goal of obtaining an unqualified  opinion for fiscal year 2007 on DOD\u2019s departmentwide financial statements;  however, the initiative still lacks a clearly defined, well-documented, and  realistic plan to make the stated goal a reality. In particular, the initiative  lacks several of the key elements critical to success, including (1) a  comprehensive, integrated plan; (2) results-oriented goals and performance  measures; and (3) effective oversight and monitoring. For DOD to  successfully transform its business operations, it will need a  comprehensive and integrated business transformation plan; people with  the skills, responsibility, and authority to implement the plan; an effective  process and related tools, such as a business enterprise architecture; and  results-oriented performance measures that link institutional, unit, and  individual personnel goals and expectations to promote accountability for  results."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements", "paragraphs": ["The federal government continued to have inadequate systems, controls,  and procedures to ensure that the consolidated financial statements are  consistent with the underlying audited agency financial statements,  balanced, and in conformity with GAAP.

Many Americans are too focused on today and  aren\u2019t thinking enough about tomorrow.  As Walter Shapiro pointed out in a  recent column in USA Today, low interest rates and modest inflation give  many Americans a false sense of security.  These false perceptions are  reinforced by the government\u2019s financial statements, which currently do  not provide a full and fair view of our nation\u2019s current financial condition  and long-term outlook.  The simple truth is that our nation\u2019s financial  condition is much worse than advertised.  In addition, due largely to the  looming retirement of the baby boomers, surging health care costs, and  relatively low federal revenues as a percentage of the economy, we now  face decades of red ink.", "One aspect of government financial reporting in which I\u2019m directly involved  as Comptroller General of the United States is the audit of the federal  government\u2019s consolidated financial statements.  Every year, the federal  government is required to issue a comprehensive report on its finances and  operations.  My agency, the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO),  has a statutory responsibility to audit these financial statements.  As the  person who has to sign GAO\u2019s audit report, and a CPA, I have an official as  well a professional and personal interest in ensuring that the federal  government is accountable to the taxpayers.  The federal government\u2019s  fiscal 2004 report was issued in record time.  Unfortunately, for the eighth  year in a row, GAO was unable to vouch for the accuracy and completeness  of the information in the financial statements.", "Recent accountability failures in the private sector underscore the  importance of accurate and timely financial reporting.  The scandals at  Enron, Worldcom, and other corporations have led to restatements of  financial statements and bankruptcies that have harmed countless  shareholders, employees, pensioners, and other stakeholders, including  entire communities.  Here in Washington, the recently announced  restatements at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac hit uncomfortably close to  home.  We at GAO are committed to doing our best to ensure that such  accountability failures are not repeated in the federal government.", "Beyond the financial statement numbers, what does the federal  government\u2019s annual report say about the results that are being achieved  with the taxpayer dollars being spent?  The answer is not much!  It\u2019s bad  enough that too few agencies adequately show the results they are getting  with the taxpayer dollars they spend, but policymakers also frequently do  not focus on the long-term impact of new spending and tax proposals  before taking action on related legislation.  Particularly troubling are the  enormous commitments that we face in connection with Social Security,  Medicare, Medicaid, and veteran\u2019s health care.  Down the line, we could  also be facing potential federal bailouts of several entities like the Pension  Benefit Guaranty Corporation.", "Over the years, our federal fiscal debates have gone from millions to  billions to trillions.  Unless you\u2019re an economist, a statistician, an actuary,  or a CPA, these numbers are mind-boggling.  What\u2019s a million dollars?  When it comes to the federal government, a million dollars is practically  pocket change.  Last year, the federal government experienced a deficit  that averaged more than $1 billion each and every day.  That is more than  $750,000 a minute.", "If you\u2019re honest about keeping score and include promised but unfunded  Social Security and Medicare benefits along with explicit benefit and other  commitments, the federal government\u2019s obligations, current liabilities and  unfunded fiscal commitments are over $43 trillion and rising. In the last  year alone, this amount has risen by more than $13 trillion, largely due to  the new Medicare prescription drug benefit.  Yes, that\u2019s trillions with 12  zeros rather than billions with 9 zeros.  To put that number into  perspective, even with the recent run up in housing prices, the estimated  total net worth of every American, including Bill Gates and other  billionaires, is only about $47 trillion.  That means that every American  would have to fork over more than 90 percent of their net worth to cover  the government\u2019s current promises.  Stated differently, the current burden  for every American works out to more than $145,000.  The numbers are  even worse for full-time workers, whose share now exceeds $350,000.  That  amount is growing every day and it isn\u2019t even tax deductible!  Keep in mind  that the average family income in this country is around $42,000 a year.", "As bad as these numbers are, it\u2019s the real-life consequences of unchecked  deficits that are truly frightening.  For example, if we continue as we have,  higher interest rates are inevitable.  It\u2019s only a matter of when and how  high.  As government borrows more and more money to finance its debt,  less money will be available for companies to invest to stay competitive in  today\u2019s global economy.  Without meaningful changes, long-term economic  growth will suffer, and along with it American jobs and purchasing power.  And don\u2019t forget that high budget deficits can lead to slower growth, higher  interest rates and higher inflation, which in many respects is the cruelest  tax of all.", "By continuing to run huge budget deficits, America is partially ceding  control over its own destiny to others.  Why?  Because America\u2019s personal  savings rate has reached historic lows.  So guess who\u2019s been financing  much of our spending spree in recent years?  The answer is foreign  investors.  Since 1993 the share of publicly held debt owned by  international investors has more than doubled, from 19% to over 40%.  Last  year, foreign investors purchased nearly $399 billion in Treasury  securities\u2014just $13 billion less than the size of the 2004 deficit! If these  foreign investors lose confidence in U.S. securities as a safe haven and start  to move their money elsewhere, our economy could take a serious and  sudden hit.  The recent decline in the value of the dollar may be a warning  shot in this regard.", "Mounting deficits and debt will also eventually imperil many government  programs and services that Americans have come to take for granted.  The  reality is that government functions like national defense, homeland  security, education, transportation, and our judicial system fall under the  category of \u201cdiscretionary spending.\u201d  These programs are facing  increasing budget pressures, and our ability to respond to new and  emerging needs is also being constrained.  If we don\u2019t get serious soon,  many important programs at the state and local level will also feel the  crunch.  Right now, state and local governments play a key role in a range  of important functions, such as educating our children, housing the poor,  delivering health care, and building roads and bridges.  But in the future,  state and local governments may not be able to count on as much federal  help.  Furthermore, states may also face additional unfunded federal  mandates.", "In the past, particularly in the decades since World War II, America was the  world\u2019s engine of economic growth.  We still are, but our long-term fiscal  gap is so great today that there\u2019s no way we\u2019ll be able to grow our way out  of the problem.  Using plausible assumptions, closing our fiscal gap would  require average real growth in double-digits for the next 75 years.  By any  measure, that\u2019s unrealistic.  In fact, even during the boom years of the  1990s, the economy grew at an average annual real rate of only 3.2 percent.", "If we continue on our present path, we\u2019ll see pressure for deep spending  cuts or dramatic tax increases.  GAO\u2019s long-term budget simulations paint a  chilling picture.  If we do nothing, by 2040 we may have to cut federal  spending by more than half or raise federal taxes by more than two and half  times to balance the budget.  Clearly, the status quo is both unsustainable  and difficult choices are unavoidable.  And the longer we wait, the more  onerous our options will become and the less transition time we will have.", "So how do we start to turn things around?  At the federal level, a crucial  first step is to insist on truth and transparency in government operations,  including federal financial reporting.  The federal government must provide  a fuller and fairer picture of existing budget deficits, the so-called \u201ctrust  funds,\u201d and the growing financial burdens facing every American.", "On the budget side, the current 10-year cash-flow projections are an  improvement over past practices.  But given known demographic trends,  even these projections fail to capture the long-term consequences of  today\u2019s spending and tax policy choices.  In my view, elected  representatives should have more explicit information on the present value  dollar costs of major spending and tax bills\u2014before they vote on them.  This was not the case when Congress passed the Medicare prescription  drug bill with its $8.1 trillion price tag.  The time has also come to reinstate  budget controls, such as reasonable spending caps and responsible \u201cpay\u00ad go\u201d rules which would require any new spending increases or tax cuts to be  paid for by equivalent tax increases and/or spending cuts.", "Further reforms to the substance and timing of the current appropriations  and authorization processes may also be needed.  When considering these  reforms, we should look to the states.  In some ways, the states are way  ahead of the federal government in dealing with fiscal imbalances. They  have made hard choices in the past\u2014 partly driven by their state  constitutions, partly by their inability to print money and partly by their  sensitivity to their bond ratings!", "From a more strategic and results based perspective, we also need to  develop a set of key national performance and outcome-based indicators to  measure America\u2019s position and progress on a range of economic, security,  environmental, and social issues.  Key indicators can help to inform  strategic planning, enhance performance and accountability reporting, and  improve key decision-making.  Several countries, states, and localities have  already adopted key indicator systems, but I\u2019m sorry to say the United  States still lacks such a system at the national level.  This has meant that at  times our policymakers have been flying blind, not unlike an airplane pilot  at night without an instrument panel.  Importantly, we are currently looking  at how states use performance information to reprioritize their budgets in  tight fiscal times.  We are also working with the National Academies and  the OECD to help make key indicators become a reality in the U.S. and  elsewhere.", "Think about it.  Each year, the federal government spends more than $2  trillion on a wide range of programs and operations, provides hundreds of  billions of dollars in tax preferences, and issues thousands of pages of  regulations.  And it does all this without having enough knowledge about  whether federal policies, programs, and activities are making a real  difference.  Based on where we are headed, we need to engage in a base\u00ad line review of the entire federal government that encompasses three key  dimensions.", "First, we need to undertake a top-to-bottom review of government  programs, policies, functions, and activities to ensure their relevance for  the 21st century.  This includes both discretionary and mandatory spending.", "Today, many if not most government policies and programs are based on  conditions that existed when Harry Truman or Dwight Eisenhower were  President.  We cannot afford to spend increasingly limited taxpayer dollars  on government policies and programs that were designed to deal with the  problems of the past or can\u2019t show they\u2019re that making a meaningful  difference today.  Congress and the President need to decide which  programs and policies remain priorities, which should be overhauled, and  which have outlived their usefulness.  Importantly, increases in targeted  earmark spending combined with across-the-board cuts are not substitutes  for making tough and informed choices about the base of government.  These trends can result in adding fat and protecting ineffective programs  while cutting muscle from high-priority and high-performing programs.", "Second, we need to revisit existing tax policy and enforcement efforts.  Every year, our government forgoes hundreds of billions of revenue  because of existing tax preferences, significant uncollected back taxes, and  tax evasion.  In fact, in some years, the cost of tax preferences exceeds  total discretionary spending. Our complex tax system distorts decisions to  work, save, and invest\u2014and that dampens economic growth.  Complexity  also creates opportunities for tax evasion through vehicles such as tax  shelters.  All of this raises questions about fairness with taxpayers  wondering whether their friends, neighbors and business competitors are  paying their fair share.  Clearly, comprehensive tax reform is needed.  Reform could also better position the United States to compete in today\u2019s  global economy\u2014one that is increasingly knowledge-based and subject to  fast-paced technological change.  It\u2019s important to recognize that the ripple  effects of comprehensive tax reform will be felt at all levels of government.", "Third, entitlement reform is essential.  We need to put Social Security and  Medicare on a sound footing and make them solvent, sustainable, and  secure for both current and future generations.  Actually, the problems with  Social Security are not that difficult to solve.  In fact, we now have a  window of opportunity to exceed the expectations of all Americans\u2014  whether they\u2019ll be retiring 30 days or 30 years from now.  I\u2019d be happy to tell  you more about how we can do this during the question and answer period.", "On the other hand, it seems clear that the biggest single domestic challenge  is health care, of which Medicare and Medicaid are a big part.  Mounting  health care costs are a problem for governments, employers, and  individuals.  Despite repeated efforts to rein in health care spending, costs  continue to climb. Between 1990 and 2000, U.S. health care spending rose  from $696 billion to $1.3 trillion.  Spending on health care is projected to  more than double again by the end of this decade.  Clearly, such growth is  unsustainable, and it\u2019s one of the main reasons why both the Medicare and  Medicaid programs are on GAO\u2019s high-risk list.  It\u2019s also one of the reasons  that Medicaid costs represent the fastest growing and one of the largest  budget items\u2014second only to education\u2014for states.", "The problems affecting Medicare and Medicaid will be much more difficult  to solve than Social Security.  More broadly, we need to reconsider how we  define, deliver, and finance health care in this country\u2014both in the public  and the private sectors.  We need to weigh unlimited individual wants  against specific societal needs and decide how responsibility for health  care should be divided among employers, individuals, and governments.", "Despite the huge amounts of money we\u2019re spending on medical care, broad  access to basic coverage remains an elusive goal.  The rising cost of  government health care programs increases budget pressures at both the  federal and state levels.  Rising health care costs are also discouraging  additional pension coverage, constraining wage increases, and reducing the  tax base because an increasing percentage of employee compensation is  coming in the form of nontaxable benefits like health insurance. Some  reports suggest that rising health care premiums are also causing  companies to move jobs offshore, cut overall employment levels, and hire  part-time rather than full-time workers.", "As you may have heard about in news stories, GAO recently released its  new high-risk report, which deals primarily with the here and now.  GAO\u2019s  high-risk report lists current government programs and functions that need  special focus and immediate attention.  In addition, yesterday we issued a  report on the results of a GAO forum on our long-range fiscal challenges.", "In the next couple of weeks, GAO will be issuing its 21st Century Challenges  Report, which will discuss where we are and where we\u2019re headed as a  nation.  This report will include a number of illustrative questions that  policymakers should consider in examining the base of government.  Frankly, it\u2019s going to take many years to get us back on a prudent and  sustainable long-term fiscal track but the time to start is now.", "There\u2019s clearly a real payoff for prompt action.  By acting now, both  America and Americans can minimize the need for drastic measures and  give all of us more time to adjust to any changes.  By acting now, we can  help to ensure that the miracle of compounding eventually works for us  rather than against us\u2014as it is today.  By acting now, we can also avoid a  dangerous upward spiral of deficits and debt that will ultimately harm  America and every American family.  By acting now, we can enhance our  credibility with investors and improve public confidence in the  government\u2019s ability to deal with large, complex and controversial fiscal  issues before a crisis is upon us.  Finally, by acting now, we can reduce the  burdens that will otherwise be imposed on our children and grandchildren  and give them more freedom of choice over what role they would like for  government to play in the future.", "As a member of the Sons of the American Revolution, I sometimes wonder  what the Founding Fathers would think if they came back today.  George  Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, Alexander Hamilton,  and the other founders can seem larger than life, but most of them earned a  living as farmers and businessmen.  They understood first hand both the  value of thrift and the perils of personal and public debt.  Theirs was, after  all, a world with debtors\u2019 prisons.  With good reason, Ben Franklin said, \u201cHe  who goes a borrowing goes a sorrowing.\u201d", "At the same time, our first Secretary of the Treasury, Alexander Hamilton,  was a realist who recognized that adding debt in times of war or economic  recession may be a temporary necessity.  It seems clear, however, that our  Founding Fathers did not believe that adding debt in the normal course of  events was either prudent or appropriate.", "No less than the father of our country, George Washington felt that the  most important personal value was courage and the most important  institutional value was fiscal responsibility.  His views are particularly  timely at this point in our nation\u2019s history.", "Somehow, in the last 200 years we seem to have forgotten the sound advice  from Washington, Hamilton and Franklin.  If the Founding Fathers were to  return today, I have no doubt they\u2019d be justifiably proud of many things our  nation has accomplished, as we are.  But I suspect many of them would be  shocked and saddened by our willingness to forgo fiscal discipline and pile  on both personal and public debt.  It\u2019s likely that our Founding Fathers  would see our mounting debt as a violation of our stewardship  responsibility to future generations of Americans.", "This is at the heart of my message.  For the debate about our fiscal future is,  ultimately, not about numbers but about values.  The debate we are really  having is about the kind of world we\u2019re prepared to pass on to our children  and grandchildren.  The time has come for responsible public officials to  heed George Washington\u2019s words by demonstrating more individual  courage and recommitting to institutional fiscal responsibility.", "It\u2019s very important to emphasize here that the nation\u2019s fiscal imbalance is  not a partisan issue.  There are many players we could blame for our  current financial situation.  After all, it\u2019s been many years in the making.  The point is that while we can\u2019t change the past, we can and must do  something about our future.", "Overcoming our fiscal challenges will take the combined efforts of both  sides of the aisle in Washington and in every state capital.  Right now, what  we need are leaders who will acknowledge that we have a problem and are  willing do something about it.  In this regard, actions speak louder than  words.", "In my judgment, the worst thing that could happen is to continue on our  present path and do nothing.  Because once a crisis is upon us, we face  terrible choices.  And while it\u2019s true that other nations also have long-range  fiscal challenges, who wants to be the best looking horse in the glue  factory?", "Although my message is sobering and I want you to take our situation  seriously, I don\u2019t want you to go away thinking that things are hopeless or  that I am pessimistic.  That\u2019s far from true and those who know me will  attest to the fact that I am a results oriented optimistic by nature.  After all,  America has overcome much more serious challenges in the past.  Furthermore, in America, anything is possible with leadership, vision,  commitment, and persistence.

After all, why should any elected official  stick his or her neck out on a complex and controversial issue if no one  cares?

The goal of the new system  is to be able to directly link information from federal agencies\u2019 audited  financial statements to amounts reported in the consolidated financial  statements, a concept that we strongly support. Once Treasury is able to  achieve this, it would eliminate a major impediment to our being able to  audit the consolidated financial statements.", "For the fiscal year 2004 reporting process, Treasury\u2019s GFRS was able to  capture certain agency financial information from agencies\u2019 audited  financial statements, which is an important first step. The automated  system, though, was not yet at the stage of development that it could be  used to compile the consolidated financial statements from the information  that was captured. Therefore, for fiscal year 2004, Treasury had to rely  primarily on Excel spreadsheets and extensive manual procedures to  prepare the consolidated financial statements. As discussed in our scope  limitation section of our audit report, the federal government could not  produce the fiscal year 2004 consolidated financial statements in time for  us to complete all of our planned auditing procedures. In addition, for fiscal  year 2004, the federal government continued to have inadequate systems,  controls, and procedures to ensure that the consolidated financial  statements are consistent with the underlying audited agency financial  statements, balanced, and in conformity with U.S. generally accepted  accounting principles (GAAP). Specifically, during our fiscal year 2004  audit, we found the following:", "Treasury\u2019s process for compiling the consolidated financial statements  did not ensure that the information in these statements was fully  consistent with the underlying information in federal agencies\u2019 audited  financial statements and other financial data.", "Treasury\u2019s ability to timely prepare a complete set of consolidated  financial statements was greatly impaired because in some cases the  financial information provided by federal agencies to Treasury did not  agree to the agencies\u2019 audited financial statements, causing Treasury to  have to resort to last-minute, alternative methods to gather the needed  information. These problems were compounded by Treasury\u2019s reliance  on internal controls that were dependent on procedures that would  attempt to identify any errors after they were made by an agency  (detective controls) rather than implementation of internal controls that  may have prevented or minimized the errors from occurring (preventive  controls).", "Other internal control weaknesses existed in Treasury\u2019s process for  preparing the consolidated financial statements, involving a lack of (1)  segregation of duties, (2) appropriate documentation of certain policies  and procedures for preparing the consolidated financial statements, (3)  adequate support for adjustments made to the consolidated financial  statements, and (4) required management reviews.", "Information system weaknesses existed within the segments of GFRS  that were used during the fiscal year 2004 reporting process.
