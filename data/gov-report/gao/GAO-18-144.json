However, CAPE's guidance does not require the military services and other DOD components to identify and document risks as part of its recommendation tracking processes. As a result, DOD does not consistently identify and document risks, and it may not be identifying and communicating potential risks related to the nuclear enterprise. One of the 2014 nuclear enterprise reviews found that the avoidance of managing risks by many leaders within the enterprise adversely affected the mission. Developing additional guidance on identifying and documenting risks could enhance DOD's ability to provide oversight of its efforts to monitor progress and make informed responses to address any identified risks.", "For recommendations made in the 2015 NC3 report, DOD's Office of the Chief Information Officer (DOD CIO) uses an internal spreadsheet to track implementation but has not yet identified performance measures, milestones, or risks. DOD CIO has drafted a template that, once it has been approved and implemented, will provide a form that could be used for documenting performance measures, milestones, and risks. By identifying and communicating this information, DOD CIO could improve its efforts to track the progress of DOD's actions, evaluate their effects, and formulate responses to risks.", "DOD and the military services have implemented changes to their personnel reliability assurance programs in response to recommendations from the 2014 nuclear enterprise reviews. These programs are intended to ensure that DOD personnel who work with nuclear weapons and nuclear weapons systems, NC3 systems and equipment, and special nuclear material are trustworthy, reliable, and capable of performing their assigned nuclear weapons-related mission. The 2014 nuclear enterprise reviews found that these personnel reliability assurance programs were overly complex and administratively burdensome and that frequent and intrusive inspections left nuclear units more focused on preparing for and responding to inspections than on ensuring personnel reliability. DOD and the services have updated their guidance for personnel reliability assurance programs, including focusing on nine essential elements of reliability. For example, the Air Force has incorporated these elements into the standards it uses for its security forces. Additionally, the Air Force has centralized some of its administrative processes, and the Joint Staff has updated inspection procedures in a way that may ease the burden on personnel being inspected."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["DOD should develop additional guidance on identifying and documenting risks, and should identify and communicate performance measures and risks.

For example, CAPE has supplemented its  review of the military services\u2019 proposed budgets by conducting a review  of funding risks related to the nuclear enterprise in areas such as  modernization, investment, and personnel. CAPE briefs the results of this  review to senior leadership within the NDERG to provide them information  about whether the services are including funds to address these items in  their yearly budget requests. Additionally, CAPE personnel have identified  key risks regarding some of the recommendations and have entered this  information into the centralized tracking tool. According to CAPE officials,  63 of the 247 sub-recommendations include information in the Key Risks  and Issues field in the tracking tool. However, these officials told us that  none of the remaining 184 sub-recommendations include information in  this field, because either no key risks or issues were identified or the risks  that were identified were not formally documented within the tool.", "Additionally, risks that are introduced as a result of actions taken to  implement a recommendation are not consistently included in the  centralized tracking tool or otherwise documented by CAPE. For  example, according to Navy and CAPE officials regarding a  recommendation to increase the number of skilled shipyard workers to  keep up with the maintenance demands of ballistic missile nuclear  submarines, the centralized tracking tool documents the risks as the need  to complete hiring and training of new shipyard personnel. However,  according to Navy officials, the risks resulting from the prioritization of  maintenance of ballistic missile nuclear submarines over other vessels  not associated with the nuclear deterrent mission, such as fast attack  submarines and nuclear aircraft carriers, were discussed and accepted by  the Navy, but not documented in the centralized tracking tool. Similarly,  the risks associated with recommendations that the Air Force provide  additional incentive pay for personnel serving in nuclear positions were  identified but not documented in the centralized tracking tool prior to  implementation and closure. According to a CAPE official, the Nuclear  Deterrent Working Group determined that implementing incentive pay  could negatively affect morale, because some Air Force personnel in  nuclear positions are not eligible to receive this additional pay. The official  stated that the Nuclear Deterrent Senior Oversight Group was briefed on  this risk and responded by requesting updates from the Air Force\u2019s  annual review on the effectiveness of this incentive pay.", "The department is not consistently identifying and documenting risks  associated with the recommendations, because CAPE\u2019s guidance does  not direct the military services and DOD components to document and  update information on risk in the centralized tracking tool. According to  CAPE officials, since the release of the December 2016 memorandum  directing the transition of the tracking and analysis responsibilities for the  2014 nuclear enterprise reviews\u2019 recommendations from CAPE to the  military departments and other DOD components, the military services  have not, to date, formally identified any key risks for inclusion in the  centralized tracking tool. According to one Air Force official, the Air Force  identifies and responds to risks through its day-to-day operations;  however, this information is not captured by the tracking tool or otherwise  documented. According to a CAPE official, additional guidance on  documenting risk could encourage the military services and DOD  components to capture risks that they have identified in the tracking tool.", "In a November 2014 memo announcing the department\u2019s response to the  nuclear enterprise reviews, the Secretary of Defense stated that the  nuclear deterrent plays a critical role in assuring U.S. national security  and that it is DOD\u2019s highest priority mission. The Independent Review of  the Department of Defense Nuclear Enterprise found that the avoidance  of managing risks by many leaders within the enterprise resulted in  adverse impacts to the mission. The review noted that avoiding risk by  avoiding the problem until it becomes a major issue is a near inevitable  outcome of risk-averse cultures and that, too often, it takes a significant  event for the leadership to recognize major problems within the force.  Similarly, the Internal Assessment of the Department of Defense Nuclear  Enterprise stated that many of the senior leaders within DOD and the  military services were not cognizant of the problems faced by the  enterprise. According to that review, many issues were already being  reported through internal self-assessments, but many senior leaders  within DOD and the military services were not aware of the conclusions of  these self-assessments and so were unable to take action to address  them. Given the critical role the nuclear enterprise plays in national  security, and given the challenges the Independent Review of the  Department of Defense Nuclear Enterprise identified with respect to  managing risks and communicating them across the defense nuclear  enterprise, it is essential that risks be consistently identified and  documented. By documenting information on risks in its centralized  tracking tool, DOD could enhance its ability to provide oversight of the  recommendations throughout its review processes in the military services,  the Nuclear Deterrent Working Group, the Nuclear Deterrent Senior  Oversight Group, and the NDERG. By developing additional guidance for  identifying and documenting information about these risks, CAPE can  also aid the components of the defense nuclear enterprise in their efforts  to communicate and formulate responses to the risks\u2014either by  deliberately determining to accept the risk or by taking steps to avoid,  reduce, or share the risk across the enterprise."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Identifying Performance Measures, Milestones, and Associated Risks could Improve DOD CIO\u2019s Efforts to Evaluate the Actions Taken in Response to the 2015 NC3 Report", "paragraphs": ["DOD CIO uses an internal spreadsheet to track the implementation of the  13 recommendations from the 2015 NC3 report, but it has not identified  performance measures, milestones, or associated risks to evaluate these  actions.

DOD  CIO could also use performance measures to evaluate the actions DOD  has taken and determine whether the actions have fully addressed the  root cause of the recommendation. DOD officials leading some of the  recommendation implementation efforts told us that a number of the  issues identified in the 2015 NC3 report stem from enduring problems.  These officials noted that an overemphasis on identifying easily attainable  performance measures and closing recommendations quickly may  improve the overall percentage of recommendations implemented but  also could result in underlying root causes continuing to go unaddressed.  Our prior work on performance measurement has identified several  important attributes\u2014such as the inclusion of baseline and trend data\u2014 that performance measures must have if they are to be effective in  monitoring progress and determining how well programs are achieving  their goals.", "Additionally, by identifying and communicating risks to NC3 stakeholders,  DOD leadership may be in a better position to formulate responses to  these risks\u2014including deliberately determining to accept the risk or take  steps to avoid, reduce, or share the risk across the defense nuclear  enterprise. Promoting the sharing of quality information on the status of  the recommendations and potential risks from the 2015 NC3 report  among the services and other DOD components with a role in NC3 could  help DOD to integrate its nuclear deterrent efforts and help decision  makers to formulate responses to any potential risks.", "The DOD CIO officials that we met with said that it will be important to  incorporate performance measures and milestones into their tracking and  evaluation process and to consider operational risk and its management  when discussing effects on the nuclear enterprise and its NC3 systems.", "The draft template that DOD CIO is developing, once it is finalized and  implemented, could aid the department in identifying performance  measures and milestones for these 2015 recommendations in the same  way that the centralized tracking tool CAPE developed has been used to  collect performance measures and milestones for the 2014  recommendations. In addition, including an assessment of risks  associated with the implementation of the recommendations from the  2015 NC3 report similar to the follow-up to the recommendations of the  2014 nuclear enterprise reviews could enhance DOD\u2019s ability to provide  oversight of the recommendations and make informed responses to  address any identified risks throughout its review processes, all the way  to their closure by the Oversight Council."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "DOD and the Military Services Have Implemented Recommended Changes to their Personnel Reliability Assurance Programs to Reduce Administrative Burdens", "paragraphs": ["DOD and the military services have implemented changes to their  personnel reliability assurance programs in response to 17  recommendations from the 2014 nuclear enterprise reviews.

Additionally,  the Air Force has incorporated these nine essential elements into its  Arming and Use of Force program, allowing the Air Force to use this  program to ensure that its security forces meet nuclear surety  requirements. The Air Force has also created a new office within the Air  Force Personnel Center, the Personnel Reliability Program Administrative  Qualification Cell, to assist with the administrative review process for  personnel newly assigned to Personnel Reliability Program positions or  returning to Personnel Reliability Program positions after working  elsewhere. In response to both the personnel recommendations and the  inspections-related recommendations of the 2014 nuclear enterprise  reviews, the Joint Staff, the Navy, and the Air Force have made changes  to the procedures they use to conduct nuclear personnel reliability  inspections at nuclear facilities."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "DOD and the Military Services Have Altered Personnel Reliability Standards to Focus on Nine Essential Elements of Reliability", "paragraphs": ["In response to recommendations from the 2014 nuclear enterprise  reviews, the Joint Staff led a review of the department\u2019s guidance on the  personnel reliability assurance program. The Joint Staff, with the  assistance of the military services, identified nine elements from DOD\u2019s  personnel reliability assurance requirements that it considered essential  to ensure that personnel working with nuclear weapons fully met nuclear  surety standards of reliability and trustworthiness.", "These nine essential elements are that an individual must  1.  be a U.S. citizen  2.  have a security clearance and be reinvestigated every five years  3.  be fully qualified for the position in which he or she will serve  4.  have reliability verified by the commander before being assigned to a  Personnel Reliability Assurance Program position  5.  be continuously monitored by peers, supervisors, and commander for  issues that could affect reliability  6.  have his or her personnel file checked for issues that could affect  7.  undergo a medical evaluation to identify any conditions that could  8.  have a personal interview with the commander who will be assessing  9.  exhibit the character and competence to do the job, including  allegiance to the United States and a positive attitude toward nuclear  weapons  In response to the Joint Staff review, the Office of the Assistant Secretary  of Defense for Nuclear Matters, through the Office of the Under Secretary  of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics, issued a new  version of the Personnel Reliability Program manual in January 2015,  followed by a reissue and renaming of the overarching DOD instruction\u2014 changing the name to DOD Nuclear Weapons Personnel Reliability  Assurance\u2014in April 2016. This guidance requires that all DOD  personnel occupying positions subject to nuclear personnel reliability  assurance program standards must meet the nine essential elements of  reliability. Additionally, the revised guidance removed a procedure for  temporary decertification, which under the previous guidance was to  occur immediately on receipt of information that was, or appeared to be, a  reason for decertification. The manual also makes it clear that personnel  reliability assurance programs are the commanders\u2019 programs, and the  commander is exclusively accountable for determining the fitness for duty  of individuals subject to the program. The updated manual also provides  some clarity regarding requests for reinstatement by personnel who had  previously been decertified from the Personnel Reliability Program.", "The military services have responded to DOD\u2019s changes by updating their  own guidance. The Navy has released a new version of its department- specific Personnel Reliability Program manual, applicable to the Navy and  Marine Corps, and Army officials told us that the Army plans to release a  new version of its manual in early 2018. The Air Force has released a  new version of its Personnel Reliability Program manual, in addition to  other guidance changes.", "Specifically, in response to a provision in DOD\u2019s updated personnel  reliability guidance that authorizes the military departments to develop  reliability guidance specific to their security force personnel guarding  nuclear weapons, the Air Force has made changes to its Arming and Use  of Force program. Air Force Arming and Use of Force standards include  qualification requirements under which all Air Force security forces,  whether assigned to a nuclear facility or a non-nuclear facility, are  authorized to carry a weapon as part of their official duties. In addition, Air  Force nuclear security forces no longer require separate Personnel  Reliability Program certification, as they previously did. The 2014 nuclear  enterprise reviews determined that requiring nuclear security forces to  meet the standards of two reliability programs at the same time was  redundant. Air Force officials told us that utilizing the two reliability  programs caused manning problems for the Air Force, because the  availability of security force personnel qualified under both programs was  limited. As a result of the changes to DOD\u2019s guidance, the Air Force  rewrote its Arming and Use of Force guidance to incorporate a new  chapter that outlines procedures for assessing security forces against  each of the nine essential elements of reliability. This change has allowed  the Air Force to use its Arming and Use of Force program as its sole  method of establishing personnel reliability assurance for Air Force  security force personnel. The Air Force continues to use its Personnel  Reliability Program to certify nuclear operators and maintainers.", "Prior to the implementation of its new version of Arming and Use of Force  standards, the Air Force conducted an assessment of the new Arming  and Use of Force reliability standards as the sole standard for security  forces at six Air Force installations (four nuclear installations and two non- nuclear installations), to identify any gaps or areas for improvement of the  new guidance prior to its Air Force-wide implementation. The assessment  found that the new Arming and Use of Force standard adequately  addressed the nine essential elements required of a personnel reliability  assurance program, streamlined monitoring of security forces for  commanders by merging the Arming and Use of Force standards with the  Air Force Personnel Reliability Program standards, and held the security  force personnel to a higher standard to perform armed duty. The Air  Force fully implemented its new version of Arming and Use of Force  standards across the service in February 2016.", "As a result of the Air Force\u2019s changes to its Arming and Use of Force  guidance, Air Force security forces are now qualified to serve at nuclear  facilities and do not need to certify under the Personnel Reliability  Program (see fig. 5). Air Force officials told us that requiring security  forces to qualify under Arming and Use of Force standards had helped to  address manning challenges among nuclear security forces, as well as  allowing the Air Force to move experienced security forces personnel  from non-nuclear facilities to nuclear assignments. According to several  Air Force officials in command of security forces at non-nuclear  installations, the changes to the Arming and Use of Force guidance have  led to a slight increase in administrative work but have been an overall  positive development, in part due to improvements in communication with  medical personnel about factors that may affect a determination that an  airman should not be armed.", "All Air Force security force personnel are required to meet the standards  of Arming and Use of Force to carry a firearm and perform many of their  duties. The Air Force implemented the new version of the Arming and  Use of Force standards in 2016. According to Air Force officials, during  the implementation, the Air Force decided that security force personnel  who were, at that time, disqualified or permanently decertified under the  Personnel Reliability Program would not be allowed to certify under the  new version of Arming and Use of Force until they had been restored to  eligibility for the Personnel Reliability Program. In early 2016, the Air  Force conducted a review of 3,167 security force personnel who had  previously been decertified or disqualified from the Personnel Reliability  Program. The Air Force determined that 2,628 of these personnel were  able to attain Personnel Reliability Program eligibility during this review,  while 539 were not. Because qualifying under the new version of Arming  and Use of Force is now a positional requirement, Air Force officials  noted that those who do not qualify must retrain for a different job or  separate from the Air Force. Air Force officials told us that the security  forces career field received a greater number of new security forces  personnel than they had been allocated in previous years to account for  the loss of personnel who were unable to qualify under the new Arming  and Use of Force standards.", "The Air Force tracks metrics from the Personnel Reliability Program and  from the Arming and Use of Force program on an annual basis. Air Force  officials told us that they have not yet reviewed the extent to which the  changes to Arming and Use of Force made in February 2016 have been  effective. Air Force and DOD officials told us that they are waiting until  sufficient data are available before making additional changes to the  guidance for their personnel reliability assurance program. The Air Force  is currently developing a nuclear enterprise health assessment, which will  include further assessment of the effects of the changes the Air Force has  made to its Personnel Reliability Program and Arming and Use of Force  guidance. Air Force officials told us that data collection for this  assessment began in the spring of 2017 and that the first summary report  will be released in September-October 2017. Once implemented, this Air  Force nuclear health assessment will provide an overarching assessment  on a periodic basis, similar to a biennial assessment that the Navy  conducts of the Navy nuclear enterprise.", "Unlike the Air Force, the Navy and the Army have opted not to develop  separate guidance on nuclear personnel reliability assurance for their  security forces personnel. Navy and Army officials told us that there was  no reason to create separate guidance for their security forces personnel  because, unlike the Air Force, they have not faced manning challenges or  administrative burdens related to these positions. The Air Force has a  much larger nuclear security force, and personnel transfer between  nuclear and non-nuclear facilities more frequently within the Air Force  than the other services. The Navy fills security forces positions at the two  Navy nuclear facilities with Navy and Marine Corps personnel who report  directly from training. According to a Marine Corps official, once these  personnel move on to non-nuclear assignments, they generally do not  return to nuclear security positions. Army officials told us that their nuclear  security forces are highly specialized, very few in number, and serve at  only one facility."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Air Force Has Created a Personnel Reliability Program Administrative Qualification Cell to Facilitate the Assignment Process for Personnel New to Personnel Reliability Program Positions", "paragraphs": ["The Air Force has taken additional steps to improve the Personnel  Reliability Program by creating the Air Force Personnel Reliability  Program Administrative Qualification Cell to aid with the review of non- security force personnel (e.g., operations personnel, maintenance  personnel) as they transition into Personnel Reliability Program positions.  Personnel transferring into these positions are subject to an  administrative qualification process, which includes a review of their  personnel file, medical information, and security clearance information as  well as an interview by the new, gaining, commander to assess them for  factors that affect their reliability.", "Prior to October 2015, the commander for the unit that the individual was  leaving reviewed the individual\u2019s administrative paperwork and then  provided an assessment of the individual\u2019s reliability under the Personnel  Reliability Program standards to the commander of the gaining unit.  Because this initial review was often conducted by commanders outside  of the nuclear field, they had less experience than nuclear commanders in  conducting such an assessment. According to Air Force officials, this lack  of experience often resulted in the standards being applied either too  stringently or too loosely and the initial reviews often being completed  late. Additionally, although Air Force guidance indicated that personnel  transferring directly from one Personnel Reliability Program position to  another were not required to undergo administrative qualification, one of  the 2014 nuclear enterprise reviews found that some administrative file  reviews were occurring.", "As of November 2016, the Air Force Personnel Reliability Program  Administrative Qualification Cell has been staffed by personnel  experienced with the standards, and they assist in conducting reviews of  many of the Air Force personnel moving to nuclear assignments. The cell  performs the administrative review formerly conducted by the commander  of the individual\u2019s losing unit and provides a recommendation to the  commander of the gaining unit before that commander makes an  assessment (see fig. 6).", "As a result, according to Air Force officials, the qualification process is  now completed more quickly, and the administrative burden on  commanders has been lessened. Officials from the Air Force Personnel  Center told us that the Personnel Reliability Program Administrative  Qualification Cell was currently assisting all Air Force Major Commands  but had not yet begun working with all Personnel Reliability Program  units.", "In addition, in response to a recommendation from the 2014 nuclear  enterprise reviews, the Air Force has eliminated administrative reviews  that some commands were conducting of personnel transferring directly  from one Personnel Reliability Program position to another, but which  were not required in the Air Force\u2019s guidance. These personnel have  remained subject to continuous monitoring, so they do not require new  administrative qualification reviews."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD, the Air Force, and the Navy Have Made Changes to the Inspections Processes for Their Personnel Reliability Programs", "paragraphs": ["DOD, the Air Force, and the Navy also made changes to their nuclear  inspections processes in response to the 2014 nuclear enterprise  reviews. Nuclear units are subject to a number of different inspections.  For example, Joint Staff guidance requires that each of the services  conduct Nuclear Weapon Technical Inspections biennially at each of their  nuclear units. These inspections are intended to examine every aspect  of the nuclear mission at that unit, including the processes of the  personnel reliability assurance program. Because of the importance of  maintaining nuclear surety by keeping nuclear weapons safe and secure,  units that receive an unsatisfactory rating on an inspection may be  decertified from conducting operations or have a portion of their nuclear  capabilities withdrawn and retain only a limited nuclear capability in  mission areas that would not jeopardize the safety, security, or reliability  of the nuclear weapons.", "The 2014 nuclear enterprise reviews found that inspections of nuclear  forces occurred too frequently, and that the procedures for inspections of  personnel reliability assurance programs had become overly burdensome  because of their focus on records review. The reviews found that, as a  result, these personnel reliability assurance programs had become  dominated by processes that were intended to prepare for inspections,  rather than to ensure personnel reliability. Before the 2014 nuclear  enterprise reviews, DOD personnel working with nuclear weapons were  subject to frequent inspections by multiple organizations. According to  DOD officials, Air Force major commands and Navy commands were  performing inspections at nuclear units under their control every 18  months. One such inspection was conducted as a combined military  service and Defense Threat Reduction Agency inspection. Each service  inspected additional specific areas. For Navy units, the Navy inspectors  would accept the Defense Threat Reduction Agency inspection report and  the Navy inspectors would review additional, service-specific items; this  resulted in a larger number of inspectors present. For Air Force units, the  combined inspection was performed concurrently, with the Air Force  inspecting the same items as the Defense Threat Reduction Agency  inspectors as well as reviewing additional, service-specific items; this  resulted in two separate inspection teams. The 2014 nuclear enterprise  reviews found that a mistake by a single individual could result in an  entire submarine or wing receiving an unsatisfactory rating\u2014even in  cases not involving a clear, critical error\u2014potentially leading to the  withdrawal of their nuclear weapons capabilities. The Independent  Review of the Department of Defense Nuclear Enterprise found that the  high frequency of inspections resulted in nuclear units spending  significant time preparing for inspections rather than focusing on  performing their mission.", "The Independent Review of the Department of Defense Nuclear  Enterprise also stated that the portions of these inspections concerned  with the personnel reliability assurance program were heavily focused on  records review, especially at Air Force nuclear units. During each  inspection, inspectors would review hundreds of personnel files and  medical records to assess whether the commander and medical staff had  made the correct decision in determining an individual to be reliable. Air  Force officials told us that commanders and their medical staffs could be  found deficient for improperly certifying individuals as reliable even if  these individuals had been able to perform their duties without any  issues\u2014for example, after routine medical procedures like a regular  check-up with an eye doctor. As a result, commanders and medical staff  at these units implemented additional procedures beyond those outlined  in DOD guidance, such as temporarily suspending personnel from  Personnel Reliability Program duties for every off-base medical  appointment regardless of whether it could affect their reliability.  Additionally, according to the Internal Assessment of the Department of  Defense Nuclear Enterprise, inspectors also cited minor administrative  deficiencies that were unrelated to personnel reliability, such as using the  improper color of ink to fill out a form.", "To address the recommended improvements identified by the 2014  nuclear enterprise reviews, DOD has updated its inspection procedures.  The Joint Staff has updated the Nuclear Weapons Technical Inspections  guidance to reduce the frequency of inspections at nuclear units from  every 18 months to every 24 months. DOD\u2019s Defense Threat Reduction  Agency no longer conducts joint inspections with the services but is  responsible for providing oversight of the services\u2019 inspectors on behalf of  the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. For the portion of the  inspection concerned with personnel reliability assurance, the updated  guidance de-emphasizes records reviews in favor of focusing on  processes and procedures through observation, interviews, and scenario- based discussions. The Navy and the Air Force have also updated their  inspection procedures to implement these changes in DOD\u2019s guidance.  For example, Air Force inspectors do not conduct records checks unless  the interviews and scenario-based discussions reveal a lack of procedural  knowledge. Similarly, Navy officials stated that Navy inspectors review  additional records as needed if a lack of procedural knowledge is  revealed. To aid the Navy in assessing the overall effectiveness of the  updated inspection procedures, the Navy has opted to also review a  sample of the health records of personnel recently certified or reinstated  into the Personnel Reliability Program.", "According to Air Force officials at one nuclear wing that had recently  undergone a Nuclear Weapons Technical Inspection, the changes to  inspection procedures for their personnel reliability assurance programs  that DOD and the Air Force have implemented have had a positive effect.  These officials stated that the increased use of scenario-based  discussions and knowledge checks, combined with inspectors taking a  less adversarial and more conversational discussion approach to their  inspection inquiries, has resulted in an environment where personnel feel  more comfortable self-disclosing problems or mistakes, and where the  focus of the inspection is on process improvement rather than on  identifying administrative errors, independent of whether the errors were  substantive deficiencies."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["DOD has taken steps to improve the defense nuclear enterprise in  response to the 2014 nuclear enterprise reviews and the 2015 NC3  report.
