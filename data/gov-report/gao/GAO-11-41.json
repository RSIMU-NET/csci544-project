Almost all of the fund's resources come from appropriations advanced from federal clients for NIST's technical services through interagency agreements. Monitoring and tracking key information about agreements and the funds advanced for them is critical for both NIST and its clients to make well-informed budget decisions, comply with applicable fiscal laws and internal controls, and ensure the proper use of federal funds. GAO was asked to review (1) the factors contributing to the working capital fund's carryover balance and (2) NIST's processes for managing its interagency agreements and workload. To do so, GAO reviewed laws and fiscal requirements, analyzed NIST budget data and policies related to its interagency agreements, analyzed a random sample of agreements, and interviewed NIST officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["NIST's working capital fund carryover balance is largely driven by appropriations advanced from federal clients to support interagency agreements. Most agreements cross fiscal years and because more than half were accepted in the second half of the fiscal year, some carryover of funds and work is expected. NIST's processes for managing agreements are insufficient to help ensure compliance with applicable fiscal laws. 1) NIST does not monitor the period of availability of appropriations advanced from client agencies and therefore cannot be sure that funds are legally available when it bills against them. If NIST were to use funds after an account closes, its clients could be exposed to possible Antideficiency Act violations. GAO found two reasons for this. First, NIST treats these funds as being available without fiscal year limitation. Second, NIST does not manage agreements in a way that would allow it to monitor the availability of client advances. 2) NIST does not ensure that it starts work on its agreements within a reasonable amount of time after client agencies advance funds to NIST. Long delays in starting work may lead to the improper use of appropriated funds. There is no governmentwide standard for a reasonable time in which to begin work. NIST has not considered such a standard for itself, but some agencies use 90 days as a general guide. NIST took, on average, an estimated 125 days to start work. Further, GAO estimates that NIST began work about 7 months after receiving funds advanced from clients for about half of its agreements. In some cases the delay was 1-2 years. There were several reasons for this, including that NIST does not record or monitor the date it begins work on agreements, and does not consider whether it has the appropriate resources agencywide before accepting new work. NIST lacks a high-level, senior management focus on managing its interagency agreement workload. Strategic workforce planning requires the effective deployment of staff to achieve agency goals. NIST places a high priority on its interagency agreements; however, senior managers play no role in determining whether appropriate resources are available agencywide to support its workload. Further, although NIST shares responsibility with its federal clients for ensuring the proper use of appropriated funds, it does not sufficiently communicate important information to clients--such as when work is expected to begin on agreements--that would better inform client decisions about how to best use their funds. Absent strategic workload management and improved client communications, NIST cannot meet the needs of this high-priority area. As a result of our review, NIST began revising its interagency agreement process. Because NIST did not provide this information to GAO until after the review was complete, GAO was unable to determine the effect of those changes."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making 5 recommendations to improve NIST's management of its interagency agreements, including holding senior managers responsible for strategic workload management, improving internal monitoring and reporting, ensuring compliance with applicable fiscal laws, and communicating key information to clients on its agreement status.

Carryover is the reported dollar value of work that has been  ordered and funded (obligated) by clients but not completed by the end of  the fiscal year. Carryover consists of both the unfinished portion of work  started but not completed, as well as accepted work that has not yet  begun. The working capital fund largely comprises appropriations  advanced from other federal agencies to reimburse NIST for its technical  services. The payment terms for these services are generally documented  in interagency agreements between NIST and its federal clients. Managing  and monitoring key information associated with interagency agreements  between federal agencies and the funds advanced to support these  agreements is critical for both NIST and client agencies.

We also reviewed aspects of the financial management system  that NIST uses to track and manage these agreements. In August 2010,  NIST officials told us that they began changing the processes for managing  interagency agreements.

See appendix I for a  description of draft changes to NIST\u2019s processes.", "To assess NIST\u2019s processes for managing its workload, we analyzed NIST\u2019s  interagency agreement data and identified 354 interagency agreements  with performance periods of 1 or more fiscal years that began after  October 1, 2004 and ended on or before September 30, 2009. Because the  NIST financial system does not include when NIST started work on its  agreements, we drew a random sample of 76 agreements from the  population of 354 agreements to determine when NIST began work. To do  so, we reviewed and verified all transactions associated with 76  agreements to identify the time and amount of NIST\u2019s first charge\u2014 reflecting the beginning of NIST work\u2014in support of each of these  agreements.

Client advances  to the working capital fund that have not yet been earned retain the period  of availability from the original appropriation. Those advances are  available to NIST for covering costs of performance under the agreement  during the appropriation\u2019s period of availability plus 5 fiscal years,  regardless of the specified period of performance for an agreement. After  this time, those amounts are cancelled by operation of law and are no  longer available to cover NIST\u2019s costs. In other words, NIST cannot  liquidate, or bill against, these funds after the account closes.

Ten of these  agreements remain open and active in NIST\u2019s financial system. NIST  officials told us that the system prevents an agreement from being closed  and deemed inactive if there are any outstanding transactions. Further,  they said that some of those agreements may have outstanding  undelivered orders that need to be resolved. However, if the funds  advanced in support of these agreements are time-limited, it is possible  that they are legally unavailable to NIST for further billing. We found the  expiration date of funds advanced to NIST in the paper files of   3 agreements and were therefore able to determine their legal availability.  For the other 8 agreements, however, NIST lacked the necessary  information to allow it to determine the legal availability of funds without  requesting specific appropriation information from NIST\u2019s client  agencies\u2014agencies that were not included in the scope of our review.", "NIST shares responsibility with its client agencies to ensure the proper use  of federal funds when entering into interagency agreements.

First, NIST treats all client advances as if they are free from the  original appropriation\u2019s period of availability. Second, NIST manages  agreements by period of performance, which can be different from the  client appropriation\u2019s period of availability. Third, NIST does not manage  at the agreement level\u2014the legal level of control. Rather, it manages at the  project level, which can include multiple agreements.", "NIST officials treat funds advanced for agreements accepted under NIST\u2019s  statutory authority as no-year funds; that is, free from the time period of  availability associated with the original appropriation. This policy is  contained in NIST\u2019s Administrative Manual and is based on an  interpretation of Commerce policy described in a 1983 legal memo. When  we sought clarification on this policy in January 2010, Commerce\u2019s Office  of General Counsel clarified the interpretation of the legal memo and  responded that it is revising its policy and working with NIST to revise the  Administrative Manual in response to our inquiry. As we will discuss, NIST  officials provided additional details on these efforts in August 2010.  Further, NIST manages agreements by period of performance, which can  be different from the client appropriation\u2019s period of availability. The  period of performance is defined by the start and end dates of the  agreement. However, appropriations acts determine the period of  availability of appropriations.", "Lastly, NIST manages the technical work it performs for client agencies  and bills and records transactions through projects. NIST officials  explained that they manage by project because it allows them to track and  monitor related agreements together. However, client agencies advance  funds to NIST based on the terms and amounts specified in interagency  agreements, which is the legal level of control. Although most projects  relate to a single agreement, some projects comprise multiple agreements  (see fig. 4). For example, related agreements from a client agency are  sometimes grouped together under an umbrella project. Occasionally,  NIST combines several related agreements from different clients under a  consortium project.", "As a result of our review, Commerce is working with NIST to review and  revise policies described in the Administrative Manual and processes  related to interagency agreements. In August 2010, NIST officials told us  that they have begun to identify and resolve issues related to the  interagency agreement process, including drafting templates and  checklists for interagency agreements. The Commerce Office of General  Counsel has begun communicating these changes to NIST staff through  training sessions and town hall meetings. However, because we did not  receive this information until after we completed our review, we were  unable to determine what effect the changes may have on NIST\u2019s  interagency agreement process. See appendix I for more information  about these changes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NIST Does Not Monitor Interagency Agreements to Ensure that Work Begins within a Reasonable Time", "paragraphs": ["NIST does not record or monitor whether it begins working on agreements  within a reasonable amount of time after it received funds advanced by  client agencies. Performing agencies should begin work within a  reasonable period of time to ensure that the use of a client agency\u2019s funds  fulfill a bona fide need of the client arising during the fund\u2019s period of  availability. That is, appropriations may be obligated only to meet a  legitimate need, arising in\u2014or in some cases, arising prior to but  continuing to exist in\u2014the fiscal years for which the appropriation was  made. Long delays between when an agency accepts funds advanced from  clients and when it begins work on its agreements may lead to the  improper use of appropriated funds. Although client agencies bear  ultimate responsibility for proper use of their funds, performing agencies  share responsibility as well. Because NIST, as the performing agency, does  not record or monitor when work begins on its agreements, it would be  difficult for it to carry out this responsibility.", "There is no governmentwide standard for a reasonable time period for  performing work under an interagency agreement as it relates to a client  agency\u2019s bona fide need. A reasonable time frame depends on the nature  of the work to be performed and any associated requirements such as  hiring a subcontractor or developing a specialized tool or machinery.  Although neither Commerce nor NIST has established such a standard,  other federal agencies have done so. For example, both the General  Services Administration and the Department of Defense consider 90 days  as a reasonable period of time for starting work. Because NIST has not  considered what a reasonable standard for starting its work might be, we  use 90 days as a point of reference for the purposes of this report. We  recognize that if NIST were to consider a standard time frame for starting  work, it may not necessarily select 90 days.", "We estimate that NIST took, on average, 125 days to begin work on its  interagency agreements in fiscal years 2004 through 2009. We also  estimate that work began for almost half of all agreements at least 90 days  after NIST received funds advanced from client agencies. For these  agreements, NIST waited an average of 226 days\u2014or over 7 months\u2014 before beginning work (see table 5). We also found some agreements that  were delayed for as long as 301, 464, 669, and 707 days.", "Failure to begin work in a reasonable period of time raises legitimate  questions about whether the client\u2019s order fulfills a bona fide need of the  client agency. Long gaps between when NIST accepts advanced funds and  when it begins work on agreements may lead to NIST using funds that are  no longer legally available. Further, client agencies may incur opportunity  costs associated with funds advanced to NIST that remain untapped for a  prolonged period of time.", "Because determining whether work began within a reasonable period of  time depends on specific facts, we reviewed 11 agreements in more depth  to better understand why work was delayed in some instances. In one  case, NIST did not begin work on an agreement it entered into in  December 2006 until October 2007\u2014over 300 days later. NIST officials  explained that staff who could perform the work could not start earlier  because they were working on other projects. This suggests that NIST did  not assess whether it had appropriate resources available before accepting  the agreement. In another case, NIST said that it took over 260 days to  establish a relationship with the National Cancer Institute and coordinate  work plans with nine NIST divisions before work could begin for an  agreement. Assessing whether it has appropriate resources available  before accepting an agreement is critical, because long gaps between  when NIST accepts advanced funds from clients and when it begins work  raises concerns about whether an agreement reflects a bona fide need of  the client agency, and may lead to an improper use of appropriated funds  and, as such, noncompliance with fiscal law.", "We found two reasons why NIST does not know whether it begins work  within a reasonable period of time. First, the start date in NIST\u2019s financial  system\u2014the system NIST uses to track its interagency agreements\u2014does  not reflect when work actually begins on an agreement. According to  finance division officials, NIST tracks the date that it enters into an  agreement with a client agency; however, we found that this is usually not  the date that work actually begins. NIST also does not electronically track  or monitor the date it received funds advanced from client agencies.  Without monitoring the amount of time that elapsed between when funds  were advanced and when work actually began, NIST cannot know whether  it is starting work within a reasonable period of time.", "Second, because NIST manages by project instead of by agreement, it does  not record information about agreements that is important for knowing  whether work begins within a reasonable period of time. For example,  billing information is only tracked at the project level and cumulatively by  fiscal year. When we requested the individual charges for each agreement  to analyze when work began, NIST said it does not manage or review  billing information that way and had to create a special report.  Accordingly, NIST could not provide any billing data for umbrella projects  (see fig. 4 above). Each agreement is funded by different appropriations  and may be conducted under unique authorities and circumstances.  Absent information on billed costs at the agreement level, NIST cannot  determine whether it is starting work within a reasonable period of time  given the facts of each particular agreement."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some Interagency Agreement Files Were Incomplete or Contained Incorrect Information", "paragraphs": ["In our case file review, we found that some of NIST\u2019s interagency  agreements were incomplete or included incorrect information.

Absent  these types of robust internal controls, NIST cannot provide reasonable  assurance that it is efficiently using its resources and complying with  applicable fiscal laws.", "Some agreement files we reviewed lacked documentation of information  needed to provide a complete and accurate record of the agreement as  well as transactions between NIST and client agencies. For example, we  found instances where required documents were not included in the  agreement files. One agreement file we reviewed did not include a  statement of work. At the time NIST and the client agency enter into an  interagency agreement, the client incurs an obligation for the costs of the  work to be performed. However, to properly record an obligation, the  client must have documentary evidence of a binding agreement between  the 2 agencies for specific goods and services. In another example, only  one of the agreements we reviewed documented how NIST handled  unused funds that had been advanced in support of an agreement. Federal  internal control standards require clear documentation of all transactions  and significant events. Moreover, NIST\u2019s processes for closing out  completed agreements require it to return unused funds if they are greater  than $1,000 to the client. Absent clear authority, NIST may not write off  any amount of unearned funds to the working capital fund.", "We also found agreement files that incorrectly recorded the dates of when  funds were advanced to NIST from client agencies. One file showed that  NIST accepted advanced funds before a formal interagency agreement  with the agency was in place. Federal agencies are prohibited from  transferring funds for an interagency transaction like orders placed with  NIST without a binding legal agreement. When we asked NIST finance  officials to explain this, they said that the date was recorded in error and  should be 1 year after the date indicated in the file. The corrected date  would indicate that NIST accepted advanced funds after a binding  agreement was in place; however, the error reflects an inaccurate record  of this transaction. Federal internal control standards require an accurate  recording of transactions to maintain their relevance to managers in  controlling operations and making decisions. In another example, the file  incorrectly recorded an advance as having been made 10 months later than  the actual transaction date.", "NIST\u2019s Deputy Chief Financial Officer told us that NIST does not maintain  a single consolidated file of all pertinent documents related to each  agreement, and that such information is generally spread among files  maintained by other Operating Units across the agency.

Because NIST does not monitor and communicate clearly and  consistently the status and progress of its interagency agreements, both  parties lack important information that would help ensure compliance  with applicable fiscal requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To improve the management of NIST interagency agreements and provide  reasonable assurance that NIST is efficiently using its resources and  complying with applicable fiscal laws, we recommend that the Secretary  of Commerce direct the NIST Director to take the following five actions:  (1) To help ensure efficient, effective deployment of NIST\u2019s workforce and  be a responsible steward of federal resources, hold senior management  accountable for strategically managing its interagency agreements. This  includes periodic senior management involvement in reviewing whether  NIST has the appropriate resources to begin and perform new and existing  work.  (2) To meet its responsibilities in ensuring the proper use of federal funds,  (a) develop, implement, and communicate to its clients policies regarding  reasonable time frames for beginning work on interagency agreements; (b)  track and monitor the work start date for each agreement; and (c) monitor  and report internally, and periodically inform federal clients about, the  amount of time elapsed between when funds were advanced to it from  client agencies and when it actually began billing against an agreement.  For example, NIST could provide estimated work start dates for each  agreement based on agencywide resource considerations; devise a  notification system that would indicate when work has not begun within a  certain time frame and provide the date work actually began; or  periodically provide clients with a report detailing the balance of unbilled  funds as the account closing date approaches.  (3) To help guard against the use of cancelled appropriations,  electronically record and monitor key information about the period of  availability of appropriations advanced to NIST from client agencies.  (4) To provide reasonable assurance that its interagency agreements are  complete, accurate, and constitute a binding legal agreement, create,  document, and implement a robust fiscal and legal review process for  interagency agreements. This could include (a) developing and delivering  periodic training to staff involved in accepting, processing, managing, and  overseeing interagency agreements on how to appropriately accept,  process, review, and monitor its interagency agreements and (b)  maintaining complete, accurate, and easily accessible files for all  agreements.  (5) To comply with fiscal law, NIST should review its close-out policies  regarding returning unearned funds to client agencies and adjust its  accounts accordingly."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Director of NIST.

For each recommendation NIST described corrective actions it is taking.  NIST expects to fully implement these actions by September 30, 2011.  NIST also provided technical comments which we incorporated in the  report as appropriate.", "In its comments, NIST stated that it immediately began revising its  interagency agreement operating procedures and related financial  management policies and practices in response to Commerce\u2019s  clarification of the policy on which these procedures were based. NIST  said that it provided documentation on these policies and procedures for  our review but that we did not examine them as a part of our audit. We  note that Commerce clarified its policy in February 2010 and that NIST  provided us with information about its proposed changes in August 2010 at  the exit conference for this engagement. We responded that we would  include the existence of the new policies in our report (see appendix I for  a summary of these changes) but since NIST chose not to provide this  information until the end of our review, we would be unable to determine  what effect the new policies may have.", "NIST also stated that the 1983 legal opinion upon which the operating and  financial policies of its interagency agreement were based has not been  disputed until recently and that the propriety of its treatment of  interagency agreement funding has never been in question. We note that a  2004 Commerce Office of Inspector General review of NIST questioned the  1983 Commerce opinion and raised numerous concerns regarding the  agency\u2019s management of interagency agreements.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of Commerce, the  NIST Director, and other interested parties.

Nevertheless, our  review of the interim trainings and draft documents indicate that NIST is  taking steps to help ensure its interagency agreements comply with fiscal  laws. Some changes include the following:    Documenting time limitations on the use of federal funds. NIST  agreements are required to include the Treasury Account Symbol (TAS)  code, which indicates the period of availability of appropriations. Draft  agreement templates include a placeholder for both the TAS code and the  date of expiration. Additionally, the review checklists specifically ask for  the inclusion of this information. The expiration date should also be  included in NIST\u2019s financial management system for tracking purposes.", "Documenting NIST criteria for accepting work.
