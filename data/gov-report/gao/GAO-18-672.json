SBA (1) reduced the share of the total scorecard grade devoted to prime contracting achievement, which is the dollar amount of contracts awarded directly to small businesses, and (2) added an element calculating changes in the number of small businesses receiving prime contracts. SBA made two additional revisions\u2014with input from other agencies' representatives\u2014to increase the share of subcontracting achievement results and peer review of required activities designed to facilitate small business procurement (see figure).

SBA uses its scorecard methodology to  calculate a numeric score for each agency annually. SBA then converts  those numeric scores to letter grades on an A+ through F scale. Each  year, SBA negotiates small business prime contracting goals with each  federal agency with procurement authority such that, in the aggregate, the  federal government meets its overall 23-percent goal for the percentage  of prime contract dollars awarded to small businesses. In setting annual  agency goals, SBA considers prior-year achievement and other factors.", "In addition to an overall prime contracting goal, Congress also  established statutory contracting goals for various socioeconomic  subcategories of small businesses. These small business subcategories  are small disadvantaged businesses, women-owned small businesses,  service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, and businesses  located in Historically Underutilized Business Zones (HUBZone). SBA  does not negotiate agency-specific goals for prime contracting and  subcontracting achievement within each small business socioeconomic  subcategory.

SBA adjusted the  weights of other scorecard elements, increasing subcontracting  performance from 10 percent to 20 percent of the total scorecard result  and increasing the peer review evaluation element from 10 percent to 20  percent. SBA also established that the new statutorily required element to  assess changes in the number of prime contractors would be weighted at  10 percent.

Congress required that SBA  recommend by March 31, 2019, whether to continue or modify the  scorecard program.", "In addition, the scorecard appears to have played a role in drawing  attention to agencies\u2019 performance in identifying small business  procurement opportunities. However, there were errors in the initial fiscal  year 2017 scorecards published on SBA\u2019s website, and SBA did not  initially take steps to notify the public after it made corrections. SBA  officials said that SBA does not have a process to ensure that published  scorecard results are accurate. Errors in the published scorecards and a  lack of timely disclosure about corrections may impair other agencies\u2019 or  Congress\u2019s access to quality information to make informed decisions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["We are making the following two recommendations to SBA:  The SBA Administrator or her designee should complete the design and  implementation of a comprehensive evaluation of the Small Business  Procurement Scorecard aligned with key attributes of effective program  evaluations to assess the effectiveness of the revised scorecard in  measuring agency performance and promoting small business  procurement opportunities.

In  written comments, reproduced in appendix II, SBA generally agreed with  both of our recommendations.", "Regarding our recommendation that SBA design and implement an  evaluation of the revised scorecard methodology, SBA said it planned to  evaluate the changes to the scorecard methodology mandated by the  2016 NDAA. As discussed in our report, in revising the scorecard, SBA  also made other changes not specifically mandated by the 2016 NDAA,  such as increasing the emphasis on small business subcontracting  activity and incorporating a revised peer review process to facilitate a  more in-depth review of agencies\u2019 compliance with section 15(k)  requirements. As stated in our report, we recommend that SBA plan and  implement an evaluation of all aspects of the revised scorecard  methodology. SBA also indicated that it will not complete the evaluation  until after it has validated data for the fiscal year 2018 procurement  scorecard. We note that SBA can prepare an evaluation plan and begin to  consider potential evaluation findings using available scorecard data from  fiscal year 2017. We also note that our recommendation states that SBA\u2019s  evaluation plan should be aligned with the key attributes of effective  evaluation design.", "Regarding our recommendation that SBA institute a process to review  scorecards for accuracy prior to publication and a mechanism for publicly  identifying when issued scorecards have been revised, SBA said it had  taken several steps to revise the processes for publishing accurate  scorecard results, including adding steps to compare the prepared  scorecard documents to source documents prior to publication and to  annotate any score corrections that are made to published scorecards.  While we have not yet had the opportunity to assess SBA\u2019s actions, the  steps SBA describes in response to our recommendation could improve  other agencies\u2019 or Congress\u2019s access to quality information.", "We will send copies to the Administrator of SBA and other interested  parties.

We also interviewed officials from SBA and four other  agencies about the revisions to the scorecard calculation methodology,  the peer review guidance, the process for providing input on scorecard  revisions, and how revisions were implemented. The four agencies (the  Departments of Agriculture, Defense, Energy, and Homeland Security)  represented a judgmental, nongeneralizable sample of federal agencies  with procurement powers, selected based on small business procurement  volume, recent improvement in scorecard results, and level of  participation in discussions with SBA and other agencies about potential  changes to the scorecard. We also interviewed SBA officials about their  plans to evaluate the effects of scorecard revisions on small business  procurement opportunities and about their plans, if any, to evaluate the  revised scorecard. In addition, we reviewed federal internal control  standards and GAO\u2019s key attributes for designing effective evaluations.", "We analyzed the distribution of agencies\u2019 letter grade results (A+, A, B, C,  D, and F) from the fiscal year 2017 scorecard and compared this  distribution to fiscal years 2014 through 2016, which used a different  scorecard methodology. We also reviewed the distribution of results of  fiscal year 2017 individual scorecard elements\u2014specifically, results of  prime contracting achievement, subcontracting achievement, and peer  reviews\u2014and compared this distribution to results for fiscal year 2016.", "We compared agencies\u2019 prime contracting and subcontracting  performance against their small business procurement goals for fiscal  years 2016 and 2017. To compare peer review results across years, we  made adjustments to account for changes in the value of peer review  results (raised from 10 points to 20 points from fiscal years 2016 to 2017).  To adjust for this difference, we doubled the value of fiscal year 2016  scores to put both years\u2019 scores on a 20-point scale. Finally, we  compared actual fiscal year 2017 scorecard results to the results if SBA  had used the 2016 scorecard weighting. To do this, we increased the  weighting of fiscal year 2017 prime contracting results from 50 percent to  80 percent of each agency\u2019s total scorecard grade, decreased the weight  of subcontracting results from 20 percent to 10 percent, and decreased  the weight of peer review results from 20 percent to 10 percent. We also  excluded results from the new scorecard element calculating changes in  the number of small business contractors, which was not part of the 2016  methodology.", "To examine the extent to which SBA\u2019s revised scorecard methodology  considers relevant and reliable information, we interviewed officials from  SBA and the Departments of Agriculture, Defense, Energy, and  Homeland Security. We reviewed documents describing the prior and  revised scorecard methodology. We discussed limitations, if any, in the  electronic data systems that capture government-wide data on prime  contracting and subcontracting (which SBA uses to calculate those  respective scorecard elements). We also reviewed our prior work that  assessed these data systems. To assess the data reliability of the  published scorecards, we reviewed them for obvious errors and  interviewed SBA officials about the cause of errors we identified. We  found the scorecards to be reliable for analyzing scorecard results for  fiscal year 2017. We also compared SBA\u2019s revised scorecard  methodology against the agency\u2019s policies on information quality and  against GAO\u2019s standards for internal control in the federal government.", "To collect views on the extent to which SBA\u2019s revised scorecard  methodology may encourage agencies to expand small business  procurement opportunities, we interviewed officials from SBA and the four  selected departments cited above, as well as representatives from three  organizations representing the interests of small businesses. These three  organizations were selected to represent a mix of small business types:  one (The American Small Business Chamber of Commerce) represented  all types of small businesses; one (Women Impacting Public Policy)  represented a small business socioeconomic subcategory with a 5  percent goal for prime contracting and subcontracting (as a percentage of  total prime contracting and subcontracting); and one (The Task Force for  Veterans\u2019 Entrepreneurship, also known as Vet-Force) represented a  small business subcategory with a 3 percent goal for prime contracting  and subcontracting.", "We conducted this performance audit from January 2018 to September  2018 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.
