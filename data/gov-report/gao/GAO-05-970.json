The safety measures aim to reinforce and clarify procedures, bolster safety monitoring, enhance language skills of ABD personnel, and improve communication channels. We found the safeguards were being implemented by the Colombians and U.S. safety monitors. In addition, the program managers perform periodic reviews and evaluations, including an annual recertification of the program, and have made efforts to improve civilian pilots' awareness of the ABD program's procedures. Our analysis of available data indicates that the ABD program's results are mixed, but the program's progress cannot be readily assessed because performance measures with benchmarks and timeframes do not exist. The stated objective for the program--for the Colombian National Police to take control of suspicious aircraft--seldom happens. During October 2003 through July 2005, the Colombian Air Force located only 48 aircraft out of about 390 suspicious tracks pursued; and the military or police took control of just 14 aircraft--four were already on the ground. Only one resulted in a drug seizure. However, many of the suspicious aircraft land in remote locations controlled by insurgent groups that require time to enter safely. Yet, the air force rarely involves the police besides calling them at the start of a mission and before firing at the suspicious aircraft. In addition, many of the suspicious tracks are near border areas with Brazil and Venezuela, which is too far from an ABD air base for aircraft to intercept without refueling. Nevertheless, the number of suspicious tracks has apparently declined from 49 to 30 per month, but the track counts may not be consistent over time because they are based on subjective criteria, such as whether an aircraft has inexplicably deviated from its planned flight path. According to U.S. and Colombian officials, the reduction in suspicious tracks indicates that Colombia is deterring traffickers and regaining control of its airspace."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Drug traffickers in South America often move illegal drugs by aircraft in  and out of Colombia.

The ABD program  identified aircraft suspected of drug trafficking and forced them to land,  using lethal force if necessary. However, the program was suspended in  April 2001 after a legitimate civilian aircraft was shot down in Peru, killing  two U.S. citizens. In August 2003, Colombia and the United States resumed  ABD operations in Colombia after entering into a Letter of Agreement  outlining each country\u2019s responsibilities and safety measures to address  concerns.", "The ABD program\u2019s stated goal is to help Colombia stop the trafficking of  illegal drugs\u2014primarily cocaine\u2014in its airspace by forcing suspicious  aircraft to land safely so that law enforcement authorities can take control  of the aircraft, arrest suspects, and seize drugs. Aircraft suspected of  involvement in drug trafficking are usually first identified by relocatable  over-the-horizon radar. Following this initial identification, a surveillance  aircraft containing tracking equipment is sent to visually identify the source  of the suspicious radar track, and, if it appears to be a drug trafficking  aircraft, an aircraft equipped with weapons is sent to intercept or force the  aircraft to land using the minimal force necessary. The Colombian Air  Force operates the ABD program and provides crews for both the U.S.- owned surveillance aircraft and Colombia\u2019s interceptor aircraft. The  program is overseen by the Department of State\u2019s (State) Bureau for  International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL), which has a  contract with a U.S. company, ARINC, to maintain the surveillance aircraft  and provide safety monitors and operational and training support. In  addition, the Department of Defense\u2019s (Defense) Joint Interagency Task  Force-South (JIATF-South) provides radar intelligence to the Colombian  Air Force regarding suspicious tracks in and approaching Colombia,  collects and analyzes data on the performance of the program, and helps  ensure that the aircrews perform the required safety procedures.", "At your request, we examined the status of the Colombian ABD program.  Specifically, we examined (1) the changes made to the ABD program to  address safety concerns raised after the Peru incident and whether these  new safeguards were being followed and (2) the program\u2019s progress in  attaining U.S. and Colombian objectives.", "To address these objectives, we reviewed ABD program and budget  documentation and met with cognizant U.S. officials at the Departments of  State and Defense in Washington, D.C. We traveled to Colombia and met  with officials from the Colombian government, Colombian Air Force, and  the U.S. Embassy, as well as ARINC personnel operating the ABD program.  We also visited an ABD air base in Apiay, Colombia, where many ABD  missions originate, and visited the Colombian Air Force\u2019s ABD command  center in Bogot\u00e1.

After initial  discussions, the United States decided to assist Colombia in restarting a  revised ABD program that would be managed by the Colombian Air Force  and overseen by State/INL. In addition, U.S. officials said that Colombia  had existing infrastructure that facilitated the program\u2019s restart, such as air  bases and a national air command center.", "Prior to the restart of Colombia\u2019s ABD program, a committee of  representatives from the Departments of State, Defense, and Justice, as  well as the Colombian government developed a Letter of Agreement  outlining the program\u2019s goal, safety requirements, operational procedures,  and each country\u2019s responsibilities. The Letter of Agreement, which was  signed in April 2003, states that the program\u2019s goal is to increase the  Colombian government\u2019s ability to stop aerial drug trafficking over  Colombia. Colombia is required to provide personnel and interceptor  aircraft, designate the areas where the program can operate in Colombia\u2019s  airspace, and manage the daily operations. The United States is primarily  responsible for providing the program with surveillance aircraft, personnel,  training, and funds to maintain and operate the equipment, while ensuring  that the program is regularly reviewed. Finally, a U.S. Presidential  determination was necessary to restart the program, and is required  annually to allow U.S. employees and its agents to assist Colombia in the  use of force against civilian aircraft reasonably suspected to be primarily  engaged in illicit drug trafficking.", "Since 2002, the United States has provided $68.4 million and surveillance  aircraft for the ABD program (see table 1) and plans to provide an  additional $25.9 million in fiscal year 2006. State/INL provided $57.2 million  to support ARINC operations, including the U.S. personnel involved in the  program and maintenance of the surveillance aircraft. State\u2019s Narcotics  Affairs Section (NAS) in the U.S. Embassy in Bogot\u00e1 provided $11.2 million  for training, aircraft operations, logistics support, and construction at ABD  air bases. At no cost to State, the department also transferred five U.S.- owned Cessna Citation surveillance aircraft used in the prior ABD  programs, which are equipped with tracking systems. Also, Defense gave  Colombia two additional surveillance aircraft, which have yet to be used  for surveillance. The fiscal year 2006 request for approximately $26 million  for the program is planned to continue existing operations and construct  additional infrastructure. U.S. and Colombian officials said they do not  intend for Colombia to fully finance the program in the near future."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "United States and Colombia Implemented New Safety Requirements", "paragraphs": ["In response to the findings of the Peru investigation and other  determinations, the United States and Colombia developed new safeguards  for the renewed ABD program which were implemented consistently in the  interdiction missions we observed.

The investigation of the Peru  incident found that crewmembers did not fully perform some procedures,  neglected the safety of the mission, had limited foreign language skills, and  were talking on a congested communication system. In response,  safeguards were developed to reinforce and clarify procedures, bolster  safety monitoring, enhance language skills of ABD personnel, and improve  communication channels. Another factor of the accident\u2014the civilian  pilot\u2019s unawareness of the ABD program\u2019s procedures\u2014was addressed by  teaching civilian pilots about the program.", "In the Letter of Agreement for the renewed program, U.S. and Colombian  officials require ABD personnel to follow specific procedures summarized  in a safety checklist to ensure safe operations and clarify the roles of the  United States and Colombia (see app. I). According to the Peru  investigative report, the aircrews involved in the accident did not fully  execute the program\u2019s procedures, particularly aircraft identification. Also,  the documentation of ABD procedures had become less specific over time.  The procedural checklist for the renewed program lists the specific steps  that must be taken to execute an ABD mission, including visually  identifying the suspicious aircraft; calling to the aircraft over the radio; and,  if necessary, requesting permission from the Commander of the Colombian  Air Force to fire at the aircraft. In particular, the list provides the exact  wording for crewmembers to use when confirming the completion of  checklist steps to avoid confusion among the participants. While at the  Colombian Air Force\u2019s ABD command center in Bogot\u00e1, we observed ABD  personnel following the checklist during the start of an ABD mission.", "While, at the time of the accident, the program did not have U.S. personnel  dedicated to monitoring safety, three U.S. personnel are now responsible  for safety and implementation of safeguards for each mission. The Peru  investigation concluded that the interceptor crewmembers were focused  on forcing aircraft to land and not on the overall safety of the mission.  Under the renewed program, the three U.S. safety monitors are located at  the Colombian Air Force\u2019s command center in Bogot\u00e1; at JIATF-South in  Key West, Florida; and onboard the surveillance aircraft. The safety  monitor onboard the aircraft observes the completion of checklist  procedures and alerts the U.S. monitors on the ground when each  procedure is accomplished. If any of the three monitors objects to an  action taken during the mission, the monitor immediately stops the  mission. For example, if a monitor objects to the firing of warning shots  because he is not confident that the suspicious aircraft is involved in drug  trafficking, he will immediately pull all U.S. resources out of the mission,  including the surveillance aircraft and U.S. personnel. However, if the  problem is resolved, the mission can resume. As of June 2005, the U.S.  monitors had objected to actions in ten missions, two of which were due to  incorrect implementation of the checklist.", "The Letter of Agreement with Colombia requires all U.S. safety monitors to  be fluent in Spanish and the Colombian crewmembers, besides the  weapons controllers, to be proficient in English because language barriers  among the aircrew members contributed to the Peru accident. The  aircrews involved in the Peru accident had flown on previous operational  missions together and had some foreign language skills; however, they  were not proficient enough to communicate clearly during the high stress  of an interception. For example, one of the crewmembers in the Peru  incident obtained the suspicious aircraft\u2019s tail number so that ground  personnel could determine the owners of the aircraft. However, other  participants in the mission did not understand the message, and never  learned that the plane was a legitimate civilian aircraft. Under the renewed  program, the U.S. safety monitors are native Spanish speakers or were  formerly trained as linguists with the U.S. military. Annually, ARINC tests  the U.S. monitors fluency in Spanish and the NAS tests the Colombians\u2019  proficiency in English.", "Additionally, the renewed ABD program has incorporated improved  communications systems and procedures to ensure the communications  mishaps that contributed to the Peru accident do not reoccur. An ABD  interception requires the coordination of many individuals, including  ground personnel in the ABD command center in Bogot\u00e1 and JIATF-South  in Key West, Florida, and aircrews in the surveillance and interceptor  aircraft. During the Peru accident, the aircrews were talking  simultaneously over the same radio channels and were not able to hear  each other clearly. For example, the crew of the suspicious aircraft called  the closest air control tower when they saw the interceptor aircraft  following them, but the control tower did not receive the call because it  was too far away. Although the ABD aircrews were monitoring the tower\u2019s  radio frequency, they did not hear the call because other communication  was occurring at the same time. For the new program, a satellite radio  channel is dedicated to the U.S. monitors, and the Colombian  crewmembers communicate on various radio channels. A satellite phone is  also available if radio communication is impaired. The U.S. monitors must  suspend the mission if communication among them is lost, which has  happened three times.", "Although not a finding of the Peru investigation, the Letter of Agreement  with Colombia recognizes that a community of civilian pilots unaware of  the ABD program can threaten the safety of the program\u2019s operations.  Pilots who do not know how to respond to an ABD interception may put  themselves and the ABD aircrews at undue risk. The pilot of the suspicious  aircraft in Peru was unaware that he was being called over the radio by the  ABD aircrew. The Letter of Agreement with Colombia requires the  Colombian government to inform the public of the program\u2019s operating  procedures, which the government does through publicly posted notices  and required training courses for pilots and air traffic controllers.

Tracks are often difficult to locate because the relocatable over-the-horizon  radar does not provide the suspicious aircraft track\u2019s altitude or the exact  location. Furthermore, according to Colombian Air Force officials, drug  traffickers use hundreds of clandestine airstrips in Colombia. Often the  airstrips are camouflaged and suspicious aircraft are hidden from view.  Therefore, when surveillance aircraft do not interdict suspicious aircraft in  the air, they are unlikely to find them once they land and disappear from  radar.", "Recently, the Colombian Air Force asked the United States to permanently  increase the number of flight hours (from 180 to 300 per month) for the  surveillance aircraft to spend more time training and locating clandestine  airstrips. According to U.S. and Colombian officials, once these airstrips  are located, the ABD aircrews can focus on them when searching for a  suspicious aircraft in the area. To date, based on our review of ABD  documents, identification of clandestine airstrips has not assisted in  locating any suspicious aircraft.

Moreover, the accuracy of the  suspicious track data over time is suspect due to the nature of the process,  which relies on some subjective criteria. The process for determining  whether a track is suspicious or legitimate is partly based on the judgment  of JIATF-South and Colombian Air Force personnel, who screen thousands  of tracks every month looking for suspicious movements. For example,  personnel consider whether the aircraft has inexplicably deviated from its  planned flight path or the aircraft\u2019s altitude is unusually low.

Because State/INL has not established performance measures  regarding law enforcement activities, determining whether the objectives  of the ABD program are being met is difficult.

Further, the  police face various challenges in reaching the locations where suspicious  aircraft land\u2014often in remote areas of Colombia that are not accessible by  road. The police cannot travel to some locations without additional  resources, including security and transportation, according to INL  officials. But, according to U.S. officials, greater planning and  coordination between the Colombian Air Force and National Police could  enable law enforcement to more frequently take control of suspicious  aircraft. For example, in the February 2005 ABD mission that yielded 1,300  pounds of cocaine, one armed Colombian Navy helicopter provided cover  for another Navy helicopter to land and seize as much cocaine from the  aircraft as it could carry, while the Colombian Army and National Police  arrived later and confiscated the remaining cocaine."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Changes in Suspicious Tracks Locations Limit Interdiction Capability", "paragraphs": ["In recent months, the majority of suspicious tracks are concentrated along  Colombia\u2019s borders (see fig. 3), making it more difficult for surveillance and  interceptor aircraft to reach the aircraft before it lands or leaves Colombian  airspace.
