GAO recommended that FEMA take steps, as it develops its new grant management system, to collect project information with sufficient detail to identify potential duplication among the grant programs. FEMA has since addressed these recommendations. Specifically, in 2014, FEMA modified a legacy grants data system to capture more robust grant project-level data, and in fiscal year 2017, procured a software tool and developed a set of standard operating procedures to assist its staff in identifying potentially duplicative projects. These actions should help FEMA strengthen the administration and oversight of its grant programs. Furthermore, FEMA is also developing a new grants management modernization system to consolidate and better manage its grants. GAO is currently reviewing the system for this Committee and will report out next year.", "GAO reported in March 2011 on the need for FEMA to improve its oversight of preparedness grants by establishing a framework with measurable performance objectives for assessing urban area, state, territory, and tribal capabilities to identify gaps and prioritize investments. Specifically, GAO recommended that FEMA complete a national preparedness assessment of capability gaps at each level based on tiered, capability-specific performance objectives to enable prioritization of grant funding. FEMA has taken some steps to address GAO's prior recommendation. Specifically, in February 2018, FEMA reported developing capability-specific performance objectives that will enable a national preparedness assessment of capability gaps. However, FEMA plans to finalize these efforts in 2020 and it is too early to tell how this will impact grant allocations.

Our work over the last seven years has  focused on FEMA\u2019s efforts to coordinate federal interagency  preparedness and manage and assess the impact of FEMA\u2019s  preparedness grants on state and local preparedness. As described in  more detail below, our recommendations have identified additional steps  FEMA can take to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of these  efforts, including enhancing coordination and providing guidance on  preparedness. FEMA has taken actions to address some of these  recommendations, but more fully addressing all of them could lead to  additional savings, better services to the public, improved program  performance and accountability, and, ultimately, a better prepared nation.", "Following the federal response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Congress  enacted the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006  (Post-Katrina Act). In response to the act, among other things, DHS  centralized its preparedness grants under FEMA\u2019s Grant Programs  Directorate (GPD) to better integrate and coordinate grant management.  The act also requires that FEMA develop a national preparedness system  and assess preparedness capabilities to determine the nation\u2019s  preparedness. GPD provides preparedness grants to state, local, tribal,  and territorial governments, as well as transportation authorities, nonprofit  organizations, and the private sector, to improve the nation\u2019s readiness in  preventing, protecting against, responding to, recovering from and  mitigating terrorist attacks, major disasters and other emergencies. In  fiscal year 2017, DHS announced the availability of 10 preparedness  grant programs totaling more than $1.6 billion for fiscal year 2017.  According to DHS, from fiscal years 2002 through 2017 the department  has awarded over $49 billion to a variety of DHS preparedness grant  programs to enhance the capabilities of state, local, tribal, and territorial  grant recipients to carry out the above activities related to terrorist attacks  and other disasters.", "My testimony today covers our prior work on FEMA preparedness efforts  from March 2011 through February 2016 and selected updates conducted  in December 2017 and February 2018. This statement specifically  addresses FEMA\u2019s efforts to manage preparedness grants and our prior  recommendations.", "To conduct our prior work, we reviewed relevant presidential directives,  laws, regulations, policies, strategic plans, and key program documents;  and interviewed federal, state, and local officials, among others. More  detailed information on our scope and methodology can be found in each  of the reports cited throughout this statement. To update our work, we  interviewed relevant FEMA officials to obtain updates on efforts to  improve coordination among preparedness grant programs. The work  upon which this testimony is based was conducted in accordance with  generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards  require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate  evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained  provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on  our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Over the past decade, the federal government has expanded financial  assistance to public and private stakeholders for preparedness activities  through various grant programs administered by DHS through its  component agency, FEMA. Through these grant programs, DHS has  sought to enhance the capacity of states, localities, and other entities,  such as ports or transit agencies, to prevent, respond to, and recover  from a natural or manmade disaster, including terrorist incidents. Two of  the largest preparedness grant programs are the State Homeland  Security Program and the Urban Areas Security Initiative.", "The State Homeland Security Program provides funding to support  states\u2019 implementation of homeland security strategies to address the  identified planning, organization, equipment, training, and exercise  needs at the state and local levels to prevent, protect against, respond  to, and recover from acts of terrorism and other catastrophic events.  FEMA allocated $402 million for the program in fiscal year 2017.", "The Urban Areas Security Initiative provides federal assistance to  address the unique needs of high-threat, high-density urban areas,  and assists the areas in building an enhanced and sustainable  capacity to prevent, protect, respond to, and recover from acts of  terrorism. FEMA allocated $580 million for the program in fiscal year  2017.", "The State Homeland Security Program (SHSP), awarded to the nation\u2019s  56 states and territories, and the Urban Areas Security Initiative (UASI),  awarded to urban areas based on DHS\u2019s risk assessment methodology,  are the largest of the preparedness grant programs, accounting for about  60 percent of Fiscal Year 2017 grant funding. See figure 1 for a history of  funding levels for these programs. Eligible candidates for the FY 2017  UASI program are determined through an assessment of relative risk of  terrorism faced by the 100 most populous metropolitan statistical areas in  the United States, in accordance with the Homeland Security Act of 2002,  as amended."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FEMA Has Strengthened Its Coordination, Oversight, and Assessments of Grants But Challenges Remain in the Effectiveness of FEMA\u2019s Grant Management", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "FEMA Has Taken Some Steps to Address Coordination Challenges Between Headquarters and Regional Offices, But Some Challenges Still Remain", "paragraphs": ["In February 2016, we reported that FEMA has taken some steps, but has  not fully addressed longstanding preparedness grant management  coordination challenges between its headquarters and regional offices.  We found that for several preparedness grant programs, FEMA  headquarters staff in GPD and regional staff share management and  monitoring responsibilities. For example, we found that assessments by  GPD and others since 2009 had recommended that regional offices,  rather than headquarters offices, be responsible for managing and  monitoring preparedness grants to avoid confusion and duplication, and  to strengthen coordination with state and local grantees. Further, in July  2011, we found that GPD had efforts underway to regionalize grant  management responsibilities and improve coordination of preparedness  grants, and that these efforts were consistent with internal control  standards. However, GPD officials reported that in 2012 it changed course and decided to continue sharing grant management roles between  headquarters and regions, referred to as a hybrid grant management  structure. GPD officials told us that they changed course because, among  other things, estimates that the costs of regionalization would be greater  than the annual savings FEMA identified in an earlier study and concerns  that inconsistent program implementation would occur across the regions,  and outweighed the potential benefits. GPD officials at that time said they  had taken steps to address coordination challenges associated with this  hybrid grant management structure.", "However, we found in February 2016 that these challenges continue. For  example, states and FEMA regional officials told us that GPD staffs in  headquarters and regions did not always coordinate their monitoring  visits, which can be disruptive to the state emergency management  agency\u2019s day-to-day operations. FEMA regional officials also reported  that GPD staffs in headquarters and regions sometimes provided  inconsistent guidance to grantees. Further, while GPD officials identified  some steps they plan to take to address the challenges, we found that  GPD lacked a plan with time frames and goals for addressing them. We  recommended that FEMA develop a plan with time frames, goals,  metrics, and milestones detailing how GPD intends to resolve  longstanding challenges associated with its existing hybrid grants  management model, which divides responsibilities between regional and  headquarters staff. FEMA, however, did not concur with our  recommendation, stating that it disagreed with our characterization of  longstanding challenges in managing preparedness grants. As we stated  in the report, multiple assessments dating back to 2009 have reported  challenges with the hybrid model. As also noted in our report, officials  from four FEMA regional offices and officials from three states within  those regions provided various examples of a lack of coordination  between headquarters and regional staff in managing preparedness  grants, including instances that took place in 2014 and as recently as  September 2015.", "In October 2017, FEMA developed a plan\u2014the Milestone Action Plan\u2014to  track efforts aimed at improving coordination issues associated with its  hybrid grants management model, as we recommended in February  2016. The plan divides responsibilities for the management of  preparedness grants between regional and headquarters staff and  describes completed, ongoing, and planned efforts taken by FEMA to  improve grants management coordination along with steps taken, goals,  and time frames, among other things. For example, the plan shows that  FEMA developed and finalized the Monitoring Actions Tracker in August  2016, a tool shared by GPD in FEMA headquarters and staff in regional  offices. Through the tracker, GPD headquarters and regional staffs are  able to view planned and completed monitoring activities related to grants  management, as well as the status of any open corrective actions. In  addition to developing the Milestone Action Plan, FEMA officials  described other efforts taken to improve coordination issues. For  example, FEMA officials told us they increased the use of an online  collaboration tool, which allows for instant information sharing between  GPD and the regions. By taking these steps, FEMA should be better  positioned to track and evaluate efforts to improve regional coordination,  as we recommended in 2016."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FEMA Has Taken Steps to Increase Oversight Across Preparedness Grant Programs", "paragraphs": ["FEMA has been delayed in addressing the need for improved  coordination among grant programs identified in our prior work.  Specifically, we found in February 2012 that multiple factors contribute to  the risk of duplication among four FEMA preparedness grant programs\u2014 the State Homeland Security Program, Urban Areas Security Initiative,  Port Security Grant Program, and Transit Security Grant Program\u2014as  these programs share similar goals, fund similar projects, and provide  funds in the same geographic regions. Further, we found that DHS\u2019s  ability to track grant funding, specific funding recipients, and funding  purposes varies among the programs, giving FEMA less visibility over  some grant programs. Also, DHS\u2019s award process for some programs  based allocation decisions on high-level, rather than specific, project  information, which could further contribute to the risk of duplication.  Although our February 2012 analysis identified no cases of duplication  among a sample of grant projects, the above factors collectively put  FEMA at risk of funding duplicative projects. As a result, in 2012, we  included these challenges in our annual report on duplication, overlap,  and fragmentation in federal programs, agencies, offices, and initiatives.  FEMA has not yet taken action to fully address our concerns.", "We recommended in February 2012 that as FEMA developed its new  grants management information system (the Non-Disaster Grants  Management System, or ND Grants at that time), that the agency collect  project information with the level of detail needed to better position the  agency to identify any potential unnecessary duplication within and  across the four grant programs. In December 2012, FEMA officials  reported that the agency intended to start collecting and analyzing  project-level data from grantees in fiscal year 2014. Further, in December  2017, FEMA took actions to identify potential unnecessary duplication  across four preparedness grant programs, as we recommended in  February 2012. Although the development of FEMA\u2019s grants  management information system is ongoing, FEMA issued guidance and  adopted interim processes to help identify potential duplication across  these preparedness grant programs until the system\u2019s capabilities are  upgraded over the next several years. For example, in fiscal year 2014,  FEMA modified a legacy grants data system to capture more robust  project-level data\u2014such as project budget data\u2014for the Homeland  Security Grant Program, which includes the State Homeland Security  Grant Program and the Urban Areas Security Initiative.", "In addition, in fiscal year 2017, FEMA procured a software visualization  tool and developed a set of standard operating procedures to assist staff  in identifying potentially duplicative projects. Specifically, the visualization  tool will use grants award data from the Port Security Grant Program, the  Transit Security Grant Program, and compare the grant programs named  above to highlight ZIP codes that contain multiple projects. These projects  will then be analyzed by FEMA officials. According to the standard  operating procedure, if duplication is suspected within a particular  geographic area, further collaborative reviews should be conducted in  coordination with the Office of Chief Counsel to determine appropriate  remedies. Using an interim approach to collect more specific project-level  data during the grant application process and utilizing the new software  visualization tool should help FEMA strengthen the administration and  oversight of its grant programs until FEMA implements its long-term  solution for the agency\u2019s grants management information system."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FEMA Is Validating Grant Performance Data,", "paragraphs": ["In the area of performance assessment, we reported in June 2013 on  limitations in FEMA\u2019s ability to validate the performance data it collects.  Specifically, we found that two of FEMA\u2019s preparedness grant  programs\u2014Emergency Management Performance Grants (EMPG) and  Assistance to Firefighters Grants (AFG) programs\u2014collect performance  information through a variety of reporting mechanisms but face  challenges in identifying verifiable program outcomes. These reporting  mechanisms collect performance data used by FEMA regional offices and  headquarters for different purposes. For example, headquarters focuses  on the development of future program priorities and on reporting progress  toward the National Preparedness Goal, while regions use program  information to monitor primary grant recipients for compliance. DHS  developed agency priority goals that reflect agency-wide, near-term  priorities. According to FEMA officials, the EMPG and AFG programs  have an indirect link to a DHS agency priority goal, as well as the National  Preparedness Goal, because they support states\u2019 level of preparedness  for disasters. According to FEMA officials, neither program has a  standardized tool with which to validate the performance data that are  self-reported by recipients; additionally, the regions are inconsistent in  their approaches to verifying program performance data. We concluded  that the absence of a formal established validation and verification  procedure, as directed by the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s  Circular No. A-11, could lead to the collection of erroneous performance  data.", "In our June 2013 report, we recommended that FEMA ensure that there  are consistent procedures in place at the headquarters\u2019 office and  regional level to ensure verification and validation of grant performance  data that allow the agency to attest to the reliability of EMPG and AFG  grant data used for reporting progress toward goals. DHS concurred with  our recommendation and stated that FEMA would explore effective and  affordable ways to verify and validate EMPG and AFG grant performance  data. In April 2015, FEMA officials reported that FEMA was in the process  of developing the data verification and validation checks of EMPG  grantee performance reporting. For example, according to FEMA officials,  they have revised reporting templates and uniform table definitions to  make it easier for grantees to submit accurate, complete, and consistent  information on programmatic activities such as the completion of training  and exercise requirements. However, these processes have not yet been  fully implemented, and FEMA officials have not yet provided similar tools  and checklists for the AFG program. In March 2017, FEMA grants  management staff provided us with documentation on the process FEMA  uses to verify and validate grantee data from the EMPG and AFG grant  programs, as we recommended. As a result of having a consistent  approach to verifying data, FEMA\u2019s efforts should reduce the collection of  erroneous performance data.", "In addition, as part of our September 2016 review of FEMA Fire  Assistance Grant program, we reported that FEMA officials said they  planned to develop and implement a consolidated grant management  system to integrate data used to manage fire grant programs with the  data gathered for FEMA\u2019s other preparedness grants, and ultimately  better measure the impact of fire grants on national preparedness  efforts. Specifically, as we reported in May 2016, FEMA plans to develop  and implement a new Grants Management Modernization system to  provide agency-wide management for all of FEMA\u2019s disaster and  preparedness grants. Further, we are currently performing an on-going  review of FEMA\u2019s consolidated grant management system and plan to  report on this effort later this year."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FEMA Has Made Progress Assessing Its Grant Preparedness Capabilities, but Continues to Face Challenges Developing a National Preparedness System", "paragraphs": ["We also reported in March 2011 that FEMA needed to improve its  oversight of preparedness grants by establishing a framework with  measurable performance objectives for assessing urban area, state,  territory, and tribal capabilities to identify gaps and prioritize investments.  Specifically, we recommended that FEMA complete a national  preparedness assessment of capability gaps at each level based on  tiered, capability-specific performance objectives to enable prioritization of  grant funding. With such an assessment, FEMA could identify the  potential costs for establishing and maintaining capabilities at each level  and determine what capabilities federal agencies should provide. We  reported in March 2013 that FEMA has made some progress in assessing  its preparedness capabilities, but continued to face challenges developing  a national preparedness system that could assist FEMA in prioritizing  preparedness grant funding. For example, in March 2012, FEMA issued  the first National Preparedness Report, which describes progress made  to build, sustain, and deliver capabilities. In April 2012, FEMA issued  guidance on developing Threat and Hazard Identification and Risk  Assessments (THIRA) to facilitate the self-assessments of regional, state,  and local capabilities. FEMA requires state, territory, tribal, and urban  area governments receiving homeland security funding to annually  complete THIRAs and use the results to determine the resources required  to achieve the capability targets they set for their jurisdiction. However,  we found in March 2013 that FEMA faced challenges that may reduce the  usefulness of these efforts. For example, the National Preparedness  Report noted that while many programs exist to build and sustain  preparedness capabilities, challenges remain in measuring their progress  over time. According to the report, in many cases, measures do not yet  exist to gauge the performance of these programs, either quantitatively or  qualitatively.", "FEMA has taken some steps to address our recommendation.  Specifically, FEMA reported in February 2018 that the agency has  developed capability-specific performance objectives that will enable a  national preparedness assessment of capability gaps, but no such report  has been issued at this time. FEMA reported that it plans on  implementing new methodology for some core capabilities in December  2018 and for all core capabilities by December 2019, and will be able to  provide complete results in 2020. In addition, FEMA reported that they  are developing a new Threat and Hazard Identification and Risk  Assessment (THIRA) methodology that will assist in measuring the  effectiveness of state and urban areas\u2019 grant projects in reducing risk.  According to FEMA, the new methodology will measure changes in state  and urban area preparedness through the use of standardized capability  targets and key indicators that will show how FEMA preparedness grants  are being used to address gaps in capability targets. This should also  lead to a better understanding of the Nation\u2019s overall preparedness.  Regardless, as of February 2018, FEMA had taken steps to assess  preparedness capabilities, but had not yet completed a national  preparedness assessment with clear, objective, and quantifiable  capability requirements against which to assess preparedness, as we  recommended. Developing such an assessment would help FEMA to  identify what capability gaps exist at the federal level and what level of  resources are needed to close such gaps.", "Chairman Donovan, Ranking Member Payne, and Members of the  Subcommittee, this concludes my prepared statement.
