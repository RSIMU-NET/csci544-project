HUD has also provided some financial incentives to promote green building, including energy efficiency, for public housing and for a small segment of the multifamily properties HUD supports. Additionally, HUD has developed some performance measures to track the progress of its energy efficiency efforts. However, HUD has not begun requiring energy-efficient products and appliances in its public housing properties, as required by statute. HUD has also not implemented major energy efficiency updates to the building code for manufactured housing in more than a decade. Without such requirements and updates, public housing authorities may be spending more on utility expenses than is necessary and manufacturers may lack an incentive to build energy- efficient manufactured homes. Green building practices can increase up-front costs but may also provide long-term benefits, including financial, environmental, and health benefits. But the benefits in rental housing may not go to the party incurring the up-front costs, potentially discouraging the use of green building practices in a significant segment of affordable housing. HUD has partnered with others to develop a utility benchmarking tool for identifying savings in public housing, but only for the public housing portfolio. Utility benchmarking is often used to assess energy consumption and to help identify properties that could improve their energy efficiency. HUD does not collect the data needed to understand its current utility costs or future savings possibilities in some parts of its multifamily housing portfolio. HUD officials told GAO that developing a utility benchmarking tool for this portfolio would be helpful but could be costly to HUD and property owners. However, a 2003 study by Harvard University--and funded by HUD--found that collecting consumption data in insured privately owned multifamily housing would not be unreasonably burdensome. Without such a tool, HUD cannot fully understand the utility costs for over 1.6 million units in its portfolio and may be missing opportunities to reduce utility expenses for some properties. HUD has focused its attention on incentives that encourage energy efficiency but has few financial incentives, such as those used by states, to encourage other green building practices such as water conservation. Many state and local governments have used financial incentives to promote the development of green affordable housing. For example, in the scoring systems for some competitive funding, applicants are awarded additional incentive points for energy and nonenergy green building practices. Without financial incentives for nonenergy green building, HUD is likely missing opportunities to make its affordable housing more resource efficient and environmentally friendly."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Rising energy costs and concerns about health and the environment have  fueled interest in \u201cgreen building\u201d\u2014resource-efficient construction and  maintenance practices that reduce adverse impacts on the natural  environment\u2014in both the private and the public sectors. Residential  buildings in the United States accounted for an estimated 22 percent of the  nation\u2019s total energy consumption and an estimated 18 percent of the  country\u2019s total carbon emissions in 2005, a fact that could contribute to  long-term global climate change. The costs associated with this energy  usage are particularly significant for low-income individuals. According to  HUD officials, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)  spends an estimated $5 billion\u2014more than 10 percent of its budget\u2014on  energy costs, either directly in the form of public housing operating  subsidies or indirectly through utility allowances and contracts for  assisted multifamily housing. Many of these expenditures are for older  properties, which often have higher energy-related operating costs than  newer ones. Residents of some HUD-assisted housing who are responsible  for their own utilities are also affected by high energy prices.", "Energy efficiency and other forms of resource conservation are relevant to  most HUD housing programs, which incur energy costs as well as other  resource expenses (such as water expenses and building materials for new  or existing housing units). For example, HUD administers federal aid to  local public housing authorities (PHA) that manage public housing  developments for about 1.2 million low-income households. In addition,  HUD assists privately owned and operated properties to help provide  affordable housing for over 3 million households. This housing includes  properties that get some form of rental assistance from HUD, properties  whose mortgages are insured by HUD, and properties that are financed by  HUD. HUD also administers billions of dollars in grant programs to local  jurisdictions that support a range of activities, including the development  of housing and rental assistance, and federally regulates all new  manufactured homes under a national building code.", "In 2001, HUD established an Energy Task Force, which adopted an Energy  Action Plan aimed at promoting energy efficiency in public and assisted  housing and in housing financed through its competitive and formula grant  programs. As part of this plan, HUD has disseminated information and  provided training on energy efficiency, offered incentives for green  building practices in some programs, and tracked energy performance  measures for some of its programs. In 2006, HUD outlined its Energy  Strategy, which updated the Energy Action Plan in compliance with a  provision in the Energy Policy Act of 2005 that directed the agency to  develop a department wide strategy for reducing energy costs in assisted  and public housing.", "In light of the opportunities associated with green building for HUD and  residents of HUD-sponsored housing and interest in HUD\u2019s efforts to  promote green building practices, you asked us to review the actions that  HUD has taken to promote green building and issues related to those  efforts. Specifically, we examined (1) the status of HUD\u2019s current efforts  to promote energy efficiency and the performance measures the agency  uses to assess these efforts; (2) the potential costs and long-term benefits  of incorporating green building practices into HUD\u2019s affordable housing  programs; and (3) lessons learned elsewhere that HUD could apply to  promoting green building practices in its programs. We also examined  HUD\u2019s legal authority to incorporate mandatory green building  requirements into its affordable housing programs (see app. II).", "To address these objectives, we reviewed relevant program  documentation and interviewed officials from a number of HUD program  offices, including three HUD field offices (Boston, San Francisco, and  Seattle). We also reviewed studies on green building and interviewed  knowledgeable individuals from building industry associations, affordable  housing organizations, and environmental organizations. We reviewed  legal documents and interviewed officials from HUD\u2019s Office of General  Counsel. Finally we conducted site visits (Austin, Boston, Oakland, San  Francisco, and Seattle), and interviewed five state housing finance  agencies (California, Massachusetts, Vermont, Virginia, and Washington).  We selected the five site visit locations based on several factors, including  (1) discussions with knowledgeable individuals in the field of green  building, (2) a review of literature on local and state efforts to promote  green building, (3) active green building efforts at the state or local level,  and (4) proximity to HUD regional offices.", "We conducted this performance audit from October 2007 to September  2008 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

Also, an energy coordinator representing each HUD regional  office on the task force is responsible for a range of energy-related  activities, including hosting trainings and identifying local opportunities to  promote energy efficiency. All members of the task force participate on a  part-time basis and have other full-time responsibilities in HUD.", "Several HUD program offices play a role in the implementation of the  Energy Action Plan, including the following:    The Office of Public and Indian Housing (PIH) oversees about 3,300 PHAs.", "PHAs are typically local housing agencies that manage public housing  units. HUD supports over 1 million public housing units, which represent  about 25 percent of HUD\u2019s total rental assistance units. HUD provides  PHAs with operating subsidies to assist in funding the operating expenses  of their dwellings, including utilities, and capital funds to modernize  existing public housing developments. PIH also administers the Urban  Revitalization Demonstration Program, commonly known as HOPE VI.  HOPE VI seeks to improve the living environment of residents in severely  distressed public housing by redeveloping obsolete public housing,  revitalizing public housing sites and their surrounding neighborhoods, and  providing housing that avoids or decreases the concentration of poverty.  The HOPE VI program has awarded 239 grants totaling approximately $5.7  billion dollars, between fiscal years 1993 and 2006. PIH also administers  the Housing Choice Vouchers Program, which supports over 2 million  housing units. This program provides rental vouchers to low-income  tenants for use in the private rental market through the local PHA. Tenants  are responsible for finding a suitable housing unit that the owner agrees to  rent under the program. Rental units must meet minimum health and  safety standards set by the PHA. The PHA pays a housing subsidy to the  landlord, and the tenant pays the difference between it and the actual  market rent. PIH also seeks to provide decent, safe, and affordable  housing for Native American, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian families.", "The Office of Multifamily Housing administers a number of rental  assistance programs that deal with new construction, preservation,  property assistance, and finance programs. These programs support over  1.6 million housing units. The Office of Multifamily Housing manages  competitive grant programs that include the Section 202 and 811  programs. These programs provide capital advance grants for the  development of elderly housing under Section 202, and persons with  disabilities under Section 811. Both 202 and 811 projects receive operating  assistance through Project Rental Assistance Contracts. In addition, HUD  also administers mortgage insurance to multifamily properties under a  multitude of programs through the Federal Housing Administration (FHA).  These programs seek to enhance the credit for rental housing  developments through the provision of federal loan guarantees that  provide a financing option in addition to those available in the private  conventional market. Through these programs, FHA supports the  construction of new apartment projects and the refinancing of the  rehabilitation of older ones.", "The Office of Community Planning and Development administers the  Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) and the HOME Investment  Partnerships (HOME) programs. These are formula grant programs that  divide billions of dollars across local jurisdictions and numerous activities  on an annual basis using funding formulas established through statute and  by HUD. Activities funded by CDBG can include housing, economic  development, neighborhood revitalization, and community development.  CDBG funds can be used by local jurisdictions to support a range of  eligible activities, including energy conservation and renewable energy  resources. The HOME program provides federal assistance to participating  jurisdictions for housing rehabilitation, rental assistance, homebuyer  assistance, and new housing construction. Recipients of CDBG and HOME  funding have a great deal of flexibility in how they use these grants, and  must submit an annual action plan to HUD.", "Other HUD program offices play a role in the implementation of the energy  action plan. The Office of Single Family Housing administers a program to  insure private lenders against losses from borrower defaults on mortgages  that meet certain criteria for properties. HUD\u2019s Office of Healthy Homes  and Lead Hazard Control provides funding for the development of  programs to address and study the effects of lead-based paint and other  home health hazards on children and families. The office is also  responsible for enforcing HUD\u2019s lead-based paint regulations. The Office  of Policy Development and Research conducts housing research for HUD  and coordinates the Partnership for Advancing Technology in Housing  (PATH). PATH focuses on accelerating the development and use of  technologies to improve the quality, durability, energy efficiency,  environmental performance, and affordability of housing nationwide.  HUD\u2019s Office of Manufactured Housing regulates the production of  manufactured housing in the United States. The National Manufactured  Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974 directed HUD to  establish a national building code, known as the HUD Code, for  manufactured housing. HUD monitors industry compliance to ensure that  every manufactured home is built to this code.", "Energy Star\u00ae is a joint program of EPA and DOE that aims to protect the  environment by promoting the use of energy-efficient products and  practices. The Energy Star labeling program was created to identify energy  efficiency standards for several categories of household products and  appliances without sacrificing performance. Manufacturers are permitted  to apply the Energy Star label to qualified products that meet EPA or DOE  criteria. The Energy Star for Qualified Homes program provides an Energy  Star label for newly built homes that meet strict guidelines of energy  efficiency set by EPA. Energy Star homes certified under this program are  at least 15 percent more energy efficient than homes built to the 2004  International Residential Code.", "Green building is the practice of creating structures and using practices  that are environmentally friendly and resource efficient. There are a  number of green building standards that builders and developers can use  to certify whether a particular structure is a green building. These  standards include the Leadership in Energy Efficiency and Design (LEED)  rating system, which is a nationally accepted standard developed and  administered by the U.S. Green Building Council. Many of these standards  use a system that assigns points for a variety of practices and certify a  building at various levels of \u201cgreen\u201d depending on the number of points  acquired (see table 1). While energy conservation is an integral part of  green building, these standards also include several other categories of  green building measures such as water conservation, sustainable site  selection, building material conservation, and enhanced occupant health.

But some of HUD\u2019s efforts have  limitations. HUD has sought to promote energy efficiency by providing  information, training, and technical assistance; offering program  incentives; and leveraging resources outside of HUD. However, HUD has  not instituted certain requirements that were set forth in its Energy Action  Plan and Energy Strategy, and some HUD program areas offer limited  program incentives to promote energy efficiency. For example, HUD has  not implemented a regulation requiring PHAs to purchase energy-efficient  products and appliances, and its Office of Manufactured Housing has not  implemented major energy efficiency updates to its code for more than a  decade. The lack of requirements and limited incentives could mean that  program recipients are not taking advantage of opportunities to reduce  energy consumption and expenses. Also, HUD\u2019s efforts to provide  information about energy efficiency opportunities are limited by outdated  program guidance.

Table 2 illustrates the objectives included in HUD\u2019s  Energy Strategy. HUD\u2019s efforts to promote energy efficiency have focused  on areas including providing information and technical assistance, offering  program incentives, and leveraging outside resources.", "HUD provides information, training, and technical assistance on energy  efficiency to HUD staff and program participants to promote greater  awareness and voluntary adoption of energy-efficient practices. In  partnership with DOE and EPA, HUD committed to expand the use of  Energy Star products in public and assisted housing. HUD publishes  information on its Web site, and some HUD program offices provide  information specific to the needs of their program participants through  newsletters and brochures. For example, on its Public Housing  Environmental and Conservation Clearinghouse Web site, PIH posts  information on promoting energy conservation in public housing  properties and information about HUD policies related to energy  efficiency. PIH also has a monthly newsletter, \u201cEcoWise,\u201d covering utility  conservation issues for PHAs. According to HUD officials, PATH\u2019s  Roadmap for Energy Efficiency in Existing Homes identified a variety of  strategies for increasing energy efficiency in the existing housing sector,  including the development of uniform protocols for energy-efficient  remodeling. To increase awareness about energy efficiency and available  HUD informational resources, regional energy coordinators and other  HUD staff have incorporated energy efficiency into presentations to and  discussions with program participants. For example, in presentations to  HOME and CDBG grantees, HUD has encouraged construction to the  Energy Star standard for new homes. HUD provides training and technical  assistance resources that can also increase awareness and in some cases  help to build greater expertise with certain energy-efficient practices.  Examples of this training have included the development of an Internet- based training curriculum on energy efficiency for its staff and HOME  grantees, and HUD has launched a Web tool, the Energy Efficiency Rehab  Advisor, that provides homeowners and HUD program participants with  guidelines on incorporating energy efficiency into rehabilitation projects.  HUD\u2019s Office of Native American Programs has also sponsored training  opportunities targeting Native American tribes and related to green  building that have included a focus on energy efficiency. HUD officials  told us that Regional Energy Coordinators have also assisted with hosting  training workshops and identifying local opportunities and informational  needs in their respective regions.", "Some HUD programs offer incentives for energy conservation measures.  PHAs receive funds from HUD\u2019s capital fund that may be spent on energy  conservation measures, but HUD officials told us that these funds are  generally insufficient to cover both the up-front cost of many energy  improvements and ongoing repair needs. HUD\u2019s operating fund standard  rules provide a disincentive to implementing high-cost energy  improvements. According to HUD officials, a PHA\u2019s annual operating  subsidy is based in part on the prior 3 years of utility consumption, which  would be expected to fall in the years following such improvements. This  \u201c3-year rolling base\u201d policy allows PHAs to retain 75 percent of savings  from reducing utility consumption over a 3-year period, but according to  HUD officials, PHAs cannot retain enough savings over this short time to  recoup the up-front cost of many large energy efficiency improvements  such as high-energy-efficiency boilers. Two HUD incentives can enable  PHAs to overcome these challenges by allowing them to capture energy  savings over a longer period and use these savings in lieu of capital fund  dollars to finance energy efficiency improvements. First, under certain  conditions, HUD will freeze the 3-year rolling base utility consumption for  up to 20 years at the level that existed before the energy improvements  were made, enabling the PHA to finance expensive energy improvements  with the longer stream of energy savings it can retain. Second, HUD can  approve an incentive by increasing a PHA\u2019s operating subsidy for up to 20  years. The additional operating subsidy is then used to pay off the loan  that financed the energy conservation improvements. When actual energy  savings exceed debt payments under both incentives, PHAs can retain a  portion of these savings for eligible operating expenses. HUD officials told  us that a PHA may employ both incentives, but no single energy  conservation measure may double dip, using both incentives for the same  measure.", "PHAs using either of these two incentives can identify and finance  improvements through energy performance contracting. An energy  performance contract is an agreement with an energy services company  (ESCO) that in exchange for a fee, the ESCO could identify, finance, and  oversee the installation of energy conservation measures. To reduce the  burdens on PHAs seeking to engage in energy performance contracts,  HUD officials told us that PIH has made progress toward streamlining its  review approval process for energy performance contracts through field  office and PHA workshops and technical assistance contractor support to  field offices and PHAs.  HUD has published guidelines instructing field  offices to complete the review of energy performance contracts within 45  days and has begun training field office staff to develop the expertise  needed to oversee and support these contracts. To speed up and  standardize the process for selecting a contractor for a performance  contract, HUD plans to pilot a program similar to the Federal Emergency  Management Program, which provides a preapproved contractor list and a  document that standardizes the aspects of contracting with each of the  included contractors. HUD officials acknowledged that energy  performance contracting has limitations, but said that contracting with  ESCOs had helped to effect energy efficiency improvements and also  water conservation measures that might not have been implemented  otherwise. HUD officials said that water conservation savings were  significant and among the biggest potential opportunities for financial  savings. As of 2007, 195 energy performance contracts were in progress,  achieving gross savings of about $50 million annually.", "The transition to asset management in PHAs may provide stronger market- based incentives for energy efficiency. Under asset management, HUD  has discontinued the practice of collecting utility consumption and  expenditure data at the PHA level (which might have numerous  properties), and has begun collecting these data for individual public  housing properties. According to HUD officials, to the extent that this  information facilitates the identification of particularly energy-inefficient  properties, the switch to asset management will result in greater  opportunities to improve energy efficiency. HUD has contracted with a  third party to pilot using energy and water consumption data collected  from PHAs to develop a benchmarking model that may help HUD and  PHAs to identify properties that are not energy efficient. Benchmarking  compares utility consumption data among comparable properties to  determine potential utility savings opportunities.", "In addition, the Mark-to-Market program of the Office of Affordable  Housing Preservation (OAHP) has created unique incentives for green  building. The Mark-to-Market program reduces rents on multifamily  properties participating in the Section 8 program. The Section 8 program  subsidizes the rent of low-income individuals and multifamily property  owners that have contracts with HUD through which HUD is committed to  continue to subsidize rents in their properties or units until the contract  expires. The Mark-to-Market program restructures the mortgages on  properties to a level that can be supported by lower rents. According to  HUD officials, restructurings under the Mark-to-Market program generally  take place when Section 8 contracts are renewed.", "In 2007, OAHP launched its Green Initiative, a pilot program designed to  incorporate green building principles, including energy efficiency, into the  rehabilitation and ongoing maintenance of project-based Section 8  properties undergoing Mark-to-Market restructurings. Through a Mark-to- Market restructuring, the owner is able to add to the debt on his or her  property the cost of any rehabilitation of the property. In exchange for  choosing a Mark-to-Market restructuring, owners virtually always receive  a new project-based Section 8 contract with HUD. OAHP identified Mark- to-Market restructurings involving property rehabilitation as an  opportunity to offer incentives to encourage the adoption of energy- efficient and other green building practices. For property owners  voluntarily participating in the pilot, HUD has offered to reduce the  amount that must be initially paid towards rehabilitation costs from 20  percent to as little as 3 percent if the property owners make certain green  improvements. HUD created the Green Initiative pilot program within  existing statutory authority by determining that certain green building  improvements to a property are eligible \u201csignificant additions,\u201d as was  already allowed in the relevant statute for the Mark-to-Market program.  Property owners participating in a Mark-to-Market restructuring are  eligible to receive a payment from the program. Under the new pilot  program, property owners may also be eligible for an increase in the  amount they will be paid by the program if they take advantage of all  opportunities that HUD identifies during a special assessment of green  building characteristics of their properties, meet certain threshold green  principles, and provide evidence that a professional with a LEED  accreditation\u2014or equivalent green building accreditation\u2014has been  actively involved in the project. HUD officials noted that while this  initiative sets a positive example in incentivizing energy efficiency and  other green practices in Section 8 properties, the restructuring event is  unique to the Mark-to-Market program. Moreover, HUD officials estimated  that only about 100 Section 8 contracts become eligible for these Mark-to- Market green incentives each year, a small portion of the total project- based Section 8 portfolio of over 31,000 contracts.", "Finally, HUD has leveraged existing energy efficiency resources outside of  the agency through partnerships and other efforts in an effort to direct  program participants toward such resources. Some state and local  governments, utility companies, nonprofit organizations, and other groups  have resources that can supplement HUD\u2019s efforts to promote energy  efficiency. HUD field offices have entered into partnerships with several  such groups to educate HUD program participants about ways to reduce  energy costs. For example, in September 2005, HUD\u2019s Fort Worth Regional  Office partnered with the University of North Texas to cohost a  regionwide conference that provided information and technical training on  green building practices. The 260 conference attendees included officials  from public housing authorities, community development entities, city  leaders, home builders, and many other members of the housing industry.  In addition to these partnership efforts, some HUD regional energy  coordinators and field office staff have helped HUD program participants  identify existing funding, informational, and technical resources available  within their states or localities for green building. Staff in HUD\u2019s San  Francisco Regional Office developed comprehensive state directories of  energy efficiency resources to facilitate access to financial incentives,  rebates, services, and tools. HUD officials said that leveraging these  outside resources not only helped to expand the reach of HUD\u2019s energy  programs but also promoted more efficient use of HUD\u2019s resources by  avoiding unnecessary duplication of existing efforts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HUD Is Beginning to Address Limitations in Program Incentives and Management for Energy Efficiency in Certain Program Areas", "paragraphs": ["While program incentives for its public housing, multifamily housing, and  mortgage insurance programs have limitations, HUD officials told us that  they are working to address some of these limitations.

The majority of public  housing authorities are small. According to HUD officials, as of June 2008,  53 small housing authorities out of a total of about 3,200 PHAs have an  energy performance contract agreement in process. HUD has encouraged  smaller PHAs to pursue aggregated energy performance contracts or to  use the additional operating subsidy incentive for specific improvements.  HUD officials told us that in two instances, small PHAs have banded  together with other nearby small PHAs in aggregated contracts. These  contracting arrangements can be complicated to execute.

To date, activity in this program has been very small (just  over 1,000 of these mortgages have been reported as of 2007). EEMs are  mortgage loans insured by FHA that borrowers can use to finance energy  efficiency improvements. Homebuyers, or homeowners when refinancing,  may use the EEM program to borrow a minimum of $4,000 and a  maximum of 5 percent (up to $8,000) of the home\u2019s appraised value to  finance these improvements. HUD officials we spoke with cited numerous  obstacles to this product, including the additional time associated with the  required home energy inspection\u2014such as a Home Energy Ratings System   inspection\u2014and loan limits. HUD officials said that EEM loan limits on  the amount that can be financed for energy efficiency improvements may  be set too low to attract many potential users. According to HUD officials,  FHA\u2019s 203(k) streamlined product, which has a higher loan limit of $35,000  and does not require a home inspection, overcomes some of the  limitations of the EEM product. However, in contrast to the EEM,  borrowers must qualify for the loan funds used for energy efficiency  improvements. Moreover, the 203(k) streamlined product faces some of  the same obstacles to market acceptance. EEM loan limits were recently  raised by the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008. According to  HUD officials, HUD will implement the new loan limits based on this  statute.

For example, a  2005 study on the costs and benefits of green affordable housing estimated  that 14 of 16 properties reviewed by the authors would experience a net  financial benefit that includes utility savings and lower product  replacement costs. There are several ways of calculating potential  savings from green building. One way involves assessing the \u201clife-cycle\u201d  costs of certain green building practices. Life-cycle costing assesses not  only the initial costs of materials and equipment but also the operating  costs associated with them. Using this type of calculation, green building  products with higher up-front costs may provide financial benefits over  time. For example, using highly durable linoleum flooring may cost more  than using sheet vinyl flooring initially but can actually cost less over time  because the flooring may not have to be replaced as often. A second  method of calculating the savings opportunities from using green building  materials is to assess the amount of time required to \u201cpay back\u201d the added  up-front costs through the operational savings generated by a particular  green building practice. For example, compact fluorescent light bulbs pay  back their initial added costs in less than 1 year (see table 4 to view the  payback period for Energy Star-labeled products and appliances).  Acceptable payback periods can vary depending on the situation.", "Energy efficiency and water conservation measures can reduce utility  costs and provide relatively quick payback on their initial investment.  Measures such as properly installing insulation, using energy-efficient  heating and cooling equipment, and using efficient products and  appliances can reduce a building\u2019s overall energy use and lower its utility  bills. The Energy Star program estimates that a certified home uses  approximately 30 percent less energy than an uncertified home and can  save homeowners from $200 to $400 per year. Additionally, the utility  savings achieved from these practices can be used to pay the additional  costs associated with these products and lower a building\u2019s ongoing  operating costs over time. One green building cost and benefits study  estimated that energy cost savings alone accounted for an average $5.79  per square foot financial benefit in LEED-certified buildings studied in the  report. Water conservation measures, such as low-flow fixtures, front- loading Energy Star clothes washers, and capturing rainwater for  landscaping, can also lower a building\u2019s utility use significantly. For  example, high-efficiency toilets use approximately 20 percent less water  per flush than a standard toilet. According to officials we spoke to from  the Seattle Housing Authority, the agency has saved approximately  $800,000 per year by replacing the toilets in its properties with higher- efficiency models. Attention to building operations and maintenance is  essential to ensure that the benefits of green building are maximized for  the long term. Green building practices such as performing regularly  scheduled (and unscheduled) maintenance of equipment can sustain  original energy savings investments over the life span of the building\u2019s  equipment. DOE reports that a building operations and maintenance  program that targets energy efficiency can save 5 percent to 20 percent on  energy bills with little capital investment. Equally important is tenant  education, so that building occupants understand how to operate the  equipment within their units in the most efficient manner.", "Green building practices can also improve health for residents and benefit  the environment, but these benefits are difficult to measure. Health  benefits can result from building practices that improve the indoor air  quality of a building and its units. For example, using material\u2014such as  carpet and furniture\u2014free of volatile organic compounds (VOC) can  decrease incidents of health problems such as respiratory illnesses. Also,  many green building standards place a high priority on the design of  ventilation systems that improve indoor air quality by replacing  contaminated indoor air with fresh outdoor air. It has been acknowledged  for some time that the condition of buildings can have an effect on  occupant health. According to the Centers for Disease Control, an array of  health ailments have been linked to substandard housing nationwide. Also  EPA cites indoor air pollutants such as mold, radon, formaldehyde, and  tobacco smoke as contaminants that can lead to a variety of health  ailments, such as asthma, respiratory illness, and some forms of cancer.  However, according to a representative from a national health  organization we spoke to, evidence documenting the benefits of particular  green building improvements is lacking due to limited research funding.  Currently, the National Center for Healthy Homes is conducting a study of  the health benefits of green building on an affordable housing  development in Minnesota, but the results are not expected until 2009. One  study we reviewed acknowledged that assessing the health benefits of  green buildings can be complicated.", "Green building practices such as using lower carbon-emitting energy and  resource-efficient building materials, and managing rainwater in a way  that limits the contamination of local waterways, can improve the overall  environment. For example, capturing rainwater on site can reduce the  amount of contaminates that run off the property into local waterways and  limit a building\u2019s impact on a city\u2019s storm water and sewer system. Other  practices, such as using sustainably harvested wood products, can reduce  a building\u2019s global impact by limiting the environmental effect of  extracting natural resource\u2014e.g., wood products\u2014for use in building  construction. Also, lower carbon dioxide emissions from energy use in  buildings can improve human and environmental health.", "The financial benefits of green building improvements in a residential  building are typically directed to the party responsible for the long-term  costs. A 2005 study found that tenants living in the multifamily green  affordable housing properties reviewed would benefit the most because  they typically do not pay the up-front costs, but accrue most of the  benefits through lower energy and water bills. On the other hand, the  developers and owners of these buildings paid most if not all of the initial  costs, but receive little benefit from the improvements. For example, in a  property where rents are established through contracts with HUD, if a  building owner assumes the up-front costs of installing a more expensive  and energy-efficient boiler, the direct utility savings that may result will be  primarily experienced by the tenant rather than the owner if the tenant is  responsible for paying the energy bills. Such challenges can occur when  the party responsible for the initial investment does not capture the  benefits associated with that investment. This dynamic is referred to as the  presence of \u201csplit incentives\u201d in multifamily housing, which can create  disincentives for owners and tenants (see fig. 1 for an example of how  these costs and benefits can be distributed).", "Utility allowance policies\u2014related to HUD supported properties\u2014can  exacerbate these split incentives. For example, when assisted multifamily  housing building owners reduce their energy use by making energy  efficiency improvements to a property, HUD policy requires that the utility  allowance be adjusted to account for the energy savings. By decreasing  the utility allowance, HUD captures the utility savings, and neither the  tenant nor the owner receives the benefit.

High-performing buildings  that use this tool can earn recognition from EPA and be labeled as Energy  Star buildings. Commercial buildings that are Energy Star rated use on  average 35 percent less energy than standard commercial buildings and  generate one-third of the carbon dioxide. HUD has recently worked with  EPA and DOE\u2019s Oak Ridge National Laboratory, through an existing  interagency agreement, to develop energy and water benchmarking  systems that can be used to identify savings opportunities in public  housing across the country. HUD believes that this tool will allow it to  establish a fair and measurable basis to accurately assess energy use in  public housing by comparing a given public housing property\u2019s utility  consumption with consumption at other public housing properties with  similar characteristics such as age, number of units, and location.

Because almost all applicants  that were deemed eligible to receive funding received the point, it does not  appear to have been a determining factor for most applicants that received  funding. We did not examine the extent to which applicants believed 1  point (out of a total of 100 or 120 points) would make a significant  difference in their prospects for success. According to a HUD official, it  generally does not verify that planned improvements have been  implemented; the impact of this incentive on energy efficiency also  remains unclear. According to HUD, it has not assessed whether the single  incentive point is sufficient to stimulate higher levels of energy efficiency  in HUD-funded projects, and does not verify the installation of all energy  efficiency improvements. When providing an incentive in a competitive  grant process, it is important to understand whether the incentive point is  having its intended effect. This lack of understanding makes it difficult for  HUD to know whether these single point incentives are strong enough to  encourage energy efficiency in its programs.", "Although green building practices can provide long-term benefits and  savings opportunities, HUD has focused its attention primarily on energy  efficiency and currently has few incentives to encourage nonenergy green  building in its affordable housing portfolio. Occasionally, HUD funding is  used to build green affordable housing, but according to PHA officials we  spoke to, these decisions are typically made at the local level and not in  response to HUD incentives or encouragement. For example, the Boston  Housing Authority used HOPE VI funding to build a LEED-certified  redevelopment project. According to officials from the housing authority,  the decision to build green was influenced primarily by the city\u2019s overall  housing and environmental strategies. A number of building professionals  we spoke to stated that their decision to build new green affordable  housing was in response to state and local requirements or incentives\u2014 such as the LIHTC\u2014but not HUD\u2019s policies. However, some of HUD\u2019s  affordable housing portfolio may not participate in programs such as the  LIHTC.", "High Point, locted in the Delridge  neighorhood in Sttle, Washington was  originlly  716-nit public housing project  built dring World Wr II.

Currently, nearly all states have used competitive funding to  encourage some level of green building in affordable housing. The most  prominent program in this regard is the LIHTC. LIHTC dollars are  provided to local developers in accordance with state Qualified Allocation  Plans that states are required to develop and that outline the competitive  processes that will be used to award these funds. Most states employ a  competitive point system to award LIHTC funds and have provided  incentive points for projects that agree to use green building practices.  For example, Virginia\u2019s Qualified Allocation Plan provides 30 points to  applicants that agree to build to the EarthCraft or LEED green building  standards. Applications that don\u2019t meet a threshold of a total of at least 450  points will not be considered for the tax credits. California also provides  competitive points for green building and offers additional LIHTC funding  for projects that agree to build green. In addition to the LIHTC, states have  used other funding sources to encourage green building. For example,  Washington State requires that all projects receiving state housing trust  fund dollars agree to use green building practices, and Texas has  developed a Green Building Revolving Loan Fund that is self-sustaining  and provides financial support to projects that agree to build green.", "California Low-Income Houin Tax Credit Cliforni dminiter federnd te  low-income tx credit progr.

For instance, the City of Seattle required that  applicants for the city\u2019s affordable housing funds submit a sustainability  plan that incorporates elements of its SeaGreen Green Building Guide.  However, the city recently retired SeaGreen and currently requires  projects funded through the city to incorporate the Washington State  Evergreen Sustainable Development Criteria. City officials told us that  green building practices are not required to remain competitive for city  funds.  However, these developers must incorporate elements of the  SeaGreen guide. Nonprofit groups like the Local Initiative Support  Corporation (LISC) and the Enterprise Community Partners have also  developed strong financial incentives to support green building. At the  local level, the California Bay Area LISC chapter has developed a \u201cgreen  loan fund.\u201d Eligibility for loans from the fund is contingent upon  demonstrating that projects will meet minimum green building standards.", "Enterprise Community Partners provides loans and grants to affordable  housing projects that follow its Green Communities Criteria. These  programs include a predesign grant program meant to support the early  planning and adoption of green building practices\u2014energy and  nonenergy\u2014at the design stage of development (see app. V for a list of  sample state, local, and nonprofit green building financial incentives).  However, the lack of nonenergy green building incentives in many of  HUD\u2019s programs makes it less likely that HUD funding will be used to  support the development of green affordable housing."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Energy costs account for a significant portion of HUD\u2019s expenditures for  assisted housing, and these costs are expected to rise as the cost of energy  increases. To offset these costs and benefit from the growing body of  knowledge about the environmental and health effects of buildings, HUD  could benefit from expanding its efforts to support the building and  rehabilitation of sustainable, healthy, and energy-efficient housing. While  HUD has made some progress in encouraging green building practices,  more remains to be done to ensure that the agency itself, its grantees, and  program recipients are benefiting to the extent possible from the  advantages that green building offers. In part because of a decision to  delay the issuance of a proposed regulation due to concerns about a  separate proposed regulation, a statutory requirement to require energy- efficient products and appliances in all public housing has not been met,  and this may result in housing authorities purchasing products and  appliances that are not energy efficient. Although manufactured housing is  an area in which HUD has significant influence because it has been  responsible for establishing manufactured building code requirements  since 1974, HUD has not made significant energy efficiency updates to  code for this program since 1994. HUD officials told us that they intended  to wait to make energy efficiency updates to the code due to their  concerns about overlapping agency responsibilities between DOE and the  Office of Manufactured Housing. However, the current energy efficiency- related codes are antiquated by HUD\u2019s own description, and DOE is not  required to develop its energy standards for manufactured housing until  2012. Waiting for DOE to take action when DOE has until 2012 to do so  and when the current code is already so outdated could result in  additional years of some manufactured homes being built without  improved energy efficiency standards. As a result, the agency has missed  an opportunity to reduce the energy costs and other green building  impacts associated with manufactured housing. Program handbooks have  not been updated to reflect current guidance on green building, so that  many staff may be unaware of opportunities to make properties more  energy efficient and green.", "While some green building practices can add to up-front costs, they can  also provide long-term financial and health benefits. HUD invests  significant resources in support of utilities in multifamily properties, but  does not fully understand the differences in utility consumption across  these properties. HUD\u2019s public housing office has shown leadership and  initiative in partnering to develop a utility benchmarking tool that could be  used to identify properties with high levels of utility consumption, but  HUD\u2019s multifamily assisted housing has no such tool. In the absence of  such a tool, HUD cannot target certain multifamily properties for green  building improvements, which could result in benefits, including reduced  resource consumption.", "A number of state and local governments provide targeted green building  financial incentives that have helped to support the development of green  affordable housing, but HUD has few such incentives. HUD\u2019s incentives for  its competitive grant programs have focused entirely on energy efficiency  through the awarding of one incentive point, but the impact of these  incentives is unclear. Recognizing that HUD awards incentive points in  numerous competing priority areas in its application, HUD\u2019s lack of  understanding about the impact of the single incentive point for energy  efficiency makes it difficult to assess whether these incentives are strong  enough to sufficiently encourage greater energy efficiency in its programs.  In recent years HUD has devoted limited resources to financing green  building efforts or studying the costs and benefits of green building.  Additional resources may expand HUD\u2019s reach in green building beyond  its current efforts to include an improved understanding of national and  regional green building standards as well as the costs and benefits of green  building practices. Models for targeting resources to green building exist  in a number of states and localities. For example, Texas has created a self- sustaining revolving loan fund that provides initial funding for green  building. Such HUD green building programs could provide affordable  housing developers with financial assistance to deal with the added costs  of green building and HUD with the data it needs to understand the  relationship between the up-front costs and long-term benefits of green  building. HUD\u2019s public housing and Mark-to-Market programs are able to  promote green building, in part because they provide financial incentives  to program participants. Participants in other HUD programs may not  build green without incentives similar to those provided by state and local  governments. Without green building-focused incentives, HUD may be  missing an opportunity to stimulate higher levels of resource-efficient and  environmentally friendly housing."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["In order to better promote green building practices, we recommend that  the Secretary of HUD direct the appropriate program offices to take the  following actions:    ensure completion of the regulation that would require the use of  energy-efficient products and appliances for public housing as directed  by the Energy Policy Act of 2005,    proactively work with DOE to expeditiously implement energy- efficiency updates to the HUD Manufactured Housing Code,    ensure that updates to handbooks are regularly completed in a timely  fashion to provide more current guidance on energy-efficient and other  green building practices,    consider working with DOE\u2019s Oak Ridge National Laboratory and EPA  to develop a utility benchmarking tool for multifamily properties, and    assess whether the single-point incentive awarded for energy efficiency  is sufficient to stimulate higher levels of energy efficiency for its  competitive grant programs and consider providing nonenergy green  building incentive points for these programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to HUD for review and comment. In  written comments, HUD\u2019s Deputy Secretary stated that HUD welcomed  our recommendations and that the agency would give serious  consideration to their implementation with the resources it has available.  The Deputy Secretary\u2019s letter is reprinted in appendix VI. We also received  general and technical comments from HUD that provided additional detail  on issues discussed in the letter that we have incorporated as appropriate.  HUD made comments suggesting that we did not provide enough  information describing HUD\u2019s progress in implementing green building  practices or provide enough direction in how HUD should manage its  programs. Discussed below are a number of concerns HUD had with  certain aspects of the report and our response.", "First, HUD stated that we did not sufficiently distinguish between energy- related and non-energy-related green building strategies and the costs and  benefits associated with them. While we did distinguish between energy- related and non-energy-related green building strategies and also describe  the potential costs and benefits for a variety of green building practices,  we did not compare the costs and benefits of the different approaches. As  we note in the report, energy efficiency is one of a number of important  elements of green building. We continue to believe that other non-energy- related measures, such as conserving water and improving indoor air  quality, may also provide important benefits and thus merit HUD\u2019s  consideration. As discussed in the report, HUD officials we interviewed  identified water conservation savings as significant and among the biggest  potential opportunities for financial savings.", "Second, HUD stated that we did not sufficiently distinguish among the  different strategies that would be needed to expand green building in the  wide array of HUD programs. Our report is not intended to suggest that  HUD adopt any particular green building criteria or strategy but rather  aims to point out that a variety of strategies are available and that HUD  may want to consider some or all of them for its programs. We recognize  the diversity of HUD\u2019s programs and have emphasized the fact that many  green building strategies are available for HUD\u2019s consideration.", "Third, in acknowledging that we identified the potential added costs of  green building, HUD also commented that we had made no  recommendations on how to address these costs. In additional comments  provided to us, HUD stated that such higher costs would translate into  fewer units that would be assisted or subsidized by HUD. While we agree  that these costs may vary across HUD programs, sufficient data were not  available to perform the type of cost-benefit analysis necessary to make  such recommendations. The limited availability of data such as utility cost  and consumption information was one of the reasons that we  recommended that HUD work with DOE\u2019s Oak Ridge Laboratory and EPA  to develop a utility benchmarking tool for multifamily properties. HUD  could consider whether the agency needs to address the potentially higher  costs associated with green building incentives or requirements in every  program. For example, some state housing finance agencies that  administer programs supporting affordable housing told us that they had  not observed a drop in the number of affordable housing units built after  incentives or requirements for green building were added to their  programs. As a result, these agencies did not need to address the issue of  higher costs.", "Fourth, HUD commented that in describing the growing number of state  and local green building standards and initiatives, our report did not say  whether HUD should set standards of its own or defer to the state and  local initiatives. Our report did not seek to make such a determination for  the wide array of diverse housing programs that HUD administers. Rather,  it was intended to present the experiences of other governments and  nonprofits in developing their green building efforts as useful practices for  HUD to consider in developing its green building efforts.", "Fifth, HUD noted that we did not fully address staffing or resource issues.  We acknowledge in our report that additional dedicated resources may be  needed if HUD is to continue harnessing the potential benefits of green  building. However, the extent to which additional staffing or resources  would be needed is an internal management issue that we leave to HUD\u2019s  discretion.", "Sixth, HUD noted that our report did not highlight the activities of certain  offices or programs, such as HUD\u2019s efforts to support affordable housing  in transit-oriented development. In this report we did not provide a  complete listing of all HUD\u2019s efforts related to energy efficiency and green  building and we have added language to our scope and methodology to  clarify this point. HUD itself has provided a description of its efforts in its  original Progress Report to Congress on the status of its energy efficiency  efforts and is scheduled to provide an updated report soon. As an  overview of HUD\u2019s efforts, we have provided highlights of HUD\u2019s efforts,  targeted descriptions, and examples that reflect the scope of these efforts  in the areas of energy efficiency and green building. Appendix III, which  was included in the draft report, provides additional information on all of  the actions items identified in HUD\u2019s Energy Strategy. Finally, we have  ongoing work on HUD\u2019s efforts to support affordable housing in transit- oriented developments, and we may conduct more focused work on other  particular areas of HUD\u2019s green building efforts in the future.", "In addition, HUD noted that our report misstates the extent of the  authority that Congress has given HUD to require green building practices  other than those related to energy efficiency. We did not mean to suggest  in our report that Congress had given HUD specific authority to require  green building measures. In fact, HUD is currently promoting green  building practices in programs for which the underlying statutory  authority does not explicitly authorize those practices. For example, in the  Mark-to-Market program, HUD is relying on its authority to require \u201cthe  addition of significant features\u201d to a housing project\u2019s rehabilitation plan  to induce eligible owners to participate in the program\u2019s Green Initiative.  Further, in the HOME program, HUD is relying on the statutory provision  that mandates the competitive reallocation of $1.5 million dollars  previously allocated but never spent to jurisdictions that agree to build  green affordable housing. In addition, in support of the goals of the  President\u2019s National Energy Policy, HUD recently issued Public and Indian  Housing Notice 2008-25, \u201cRenewable Energy and Green Construction  Practices in Public Housing,\u201d which \u201cstrongly encourages Public Housing  Agencies (PHAs) to use solar, wind, and other renewable energy sources,  and other \u2018green\u2019 construction and rehab techniques whenever they  procure for maintenance, construction, or modernization.\u201d Finally,  through its authority under the Native American Housing Assistance Act to  provide block grants for the \u201cnew construction . . . of affordable housing\u201d  (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 4132), HUD allows costs for \u201cincorporating green building,  energy efficiency or other innovative practices\u201d into such housing (Public  and Indian Housing Notice 2006-17). These examples demonstrate that a  particular program\u2019s authorizing legislation can provide HUD the  discretion to mandate green building measures.", "Finally, HUD disagreed with GAO\u2019s characterization of HUD\u2019s  implementation of the Energy Policy Act requirement mandating the  purchase of energy-efficient appliances in public housing. In our draft  report, we provided a narrative of events at HUD that described a  \u201cmiscommunication\u201d between HUD officials as contributing to the delay in  HUD implementing the Energy Policy Act requirement. HUD stated in its  technical comments that GAO\u2019s narrative of events was not accurately  portrayed by the term \u201cmiscommunication.\u201d We removed the discussion of  the miscommunication, as it was not necessary to support our finding that  HUD has not yet implemented this Energy Policy Act requirement from  2005. As stated in our report, HUD said that it had not implemented this  requirement because the agency wished to consolidate related rules and  save clearance and process time for the public. However, we continue to  believe that a single rule could have been implemented to address the  statutory requirement to purchase energy-efficient products and  appliances in public housing. Given that HUD\u2019s process has thus far  resulted in a 3-year delay in implementing this statutory requirement, in  our view, it would have been appropriate to promulgate a single rule  rather than incurring a delay by trying to develop a consolidated rule.  Without such a rule, public housing authorities may be purchasing  products and appliances that are not energy efficient. We also noted in our  report that HUD had issued a notice encouraging the purchase of energy- efficient products, but such a notice does not take the place of or have the  same effect as a requirement. Further, of the 52 percent of public housing  authorities that responded to a HUD survey on the issue of purchasing  energy-efficient appliances, only about half of the respondents, or about  one-quarter of all PHAs, specifically identified plans to make such  purchases. Given these results, it is unclear whether three-quarters of all  PHAs are purchasing the required appliances, which can provide  significant savings on energy and water costs.", "We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees and the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development.

Section  153 of the act amended Section 109 of the Cranston-Gonzalez National  Affordable Housing Act to require that all public and assisted housing  rehabilitated or constructed with Urban Revitalization Demonstration  Program (HOPE VI) funds must meet the 2003 International Energy  Conservation Code.
