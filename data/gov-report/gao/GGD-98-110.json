As you know, we were asked by the leadership in the House of Representatives to review and evaluate this plan as well as plans developed by other agencies. These requesters were the Speaker of the House; the House Majority Leader; and the Chairmen of the House Committees on the Budget, Appropriations, and Government Reform and Oversight. Although this work will contribute to an overall evaluation of the performance plans submitted by the 24 agencies that have Chief Financial Officers, which will be provided to our congressional requestors, we agreed with key congressional staff that it would be useful to provide further details about our observations to you.", "To do our review, we used the criteria in the Results Act; the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s (OMB) guidance on developing the plan (Circular A-11, part 2); our February 1998 guidance for congressional review of the plans (GAO/GGD/AIMD 10.1.18); our evaluator\u2019s guidance for assessing annual performance plans (GAO/GGD-10.1.20); and the December 17, 1997, letter to the OMB Director from several congressional leaders. Where appropriate, we also incorporated findings from our past work and the work of the GSA Inspector General (IG). Appendix I contains a compilation of the various types of guidance available for assessing the plan, including the Results Act, GAO reports, and OMB documents. We did our work in March and April 1998 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. We sent a draft of this report to you for review and comment. On April 9, 1998, GSA officials provided oral comments on that draft, which are discussed at the end of this letter."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["As one of the federal government\u2019s principal real estate and business agents, GSA has diverse activities and programs that have governmentwide implications. Its real estate portfolio, supply procurement and distribution activities, travel and transportation services, telecommunication and computer services, and property management and disposal functions involve huge sums of money and extensive interaction with both the federal and private sectors. In many respects, GSA is comparable to a large, diversified commercial business. If GSA were a private sector company, it would rank high, in terms of sales, on the Fortune 500 list of the largest U.S. companies.", "GSA spends billions of dollars to provide many of the facilities, goods, and services that federal agencies need to carry out their missions. Through various revolving or trust fund-type arrangements, GSA buys most of these goods and services from private vendors and resells them to agencies. Additionally, GSA arranges for federal agencies to purchase billions of dollars\u2019 worth of goods and services directly from private vendors through its governmentwide supply, travel and transportation, automated data processing, and telecommunications contracts. Furthermore, when it was established in 1949, GSA was envisioned, primarily but not exclusively, as a policymaking body with the option of delegating its authority to other agencies while maintaining comprehensive accountability to Congress for economy and efficiency.", "In recent years, public sector organizations have faced demands to be more effective and less costly, coupled with a growing movement toward a performance-based approach to management. Congress enacted the Results Act in 1993 in conjunction with the Chief Financial Officers Act and information technology reform legislation, such as the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, to address these twin demands and to instill performance-based management in the federal government. The Results Act seeks to shift the focus of government decisionmaking and accountability away from a preoccupation with activities\u2014such as grants and inspections made\u2014to a focus on the results of those activities\u2014such as real gains in employability, safety, responsiveness, or program quality. Under the Results Act, agencies like GSA are to develop strategic plans, annual performance plans, and annual performance reports. GSA and other agencies submitted the first cycle of the strategic plans to Congress in September 1997. Like other agencies, GSA submitted its first performance plan to OMB in the fall of 1997. OMB used these draft performance plans to develop and submit the first federal government performance plan to Congress in February 1998 with the President\u2019s fiscal year 1999 budget. Agencies submitted their final performance plans to Congress after the submission of the President\u2019s budget. Appendix II provides a more detailed discussion of the Results Act\u2019s planning and reporting requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GSA\u2019s Plan Does Not Provide a Clear Picture of Intended Performance Across the Agency", "paragraphs": ["We found that overall, GSA\u2019s performance plan does not provide a clear picture of expected performance across the agency. First, most of the performance goals and related measures are not quantifiable or results oriented. Second, GSA\u2019s performance plan goals are not always linked to the specific program activities and funding in its budget. Finally, the performance plan does not adequately discuss its coordination with other agencies on GSA\u2019s many crosscutting activities."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Defining Expected Performance", "paragraphs": ["GSA\u2019s performance plan does not provide a succinct and concrete statement of expected performance for subsequent comparison with actual performance. Despite the expectations of the Results Act and related OMB guidance that annual performance goals be quantifiable, in our view, only 9 of the 31 performance goals in the plan have measures and targets that decisionmakers can use to gauge progress. For example, the performance goal of improving energy systems is expressed in quantifiable and time-bound terms and has a specific unit of measurement, a baseline, and numerical targets. Likewise, the performance goal on keeping GSA\u2019s prices competitive has measures that are expressed in percentages or costs with baselines and accompanying targets. However, for the remaining 22 performance goals, 16 lack measures and targets needed to gauge performance; and 6 had a mix of some quantifiable measures and some still under development or had measures that are not specific enough to gauge performance.", "Furthermore, some of the performance measures do not appear to provide meaningful information as they relate to their stated goal. For example, the measure tracking the percentage of repair and alteration or new construction projects that are completed on or ahead of schedule seems unrelated to its goal of ensuring that its prices for primary products and services are competitive with those in the private sector. In addition, the plan has some goals that relate to space management but has no measures that relate to cost effectively managing its space\u2014one of GSA\u2019s primary functions.", "Finally, the goals as written in the performance plan are typically more activity or output oriented rather than results oriented as envisioned by the Results Act. For example, for the performance goal to \u201ccontinue enhancement of financial, administrative and expert services contracts for Governmentwide asset management,\u201d GSA set forth the following \u201cmeasures\u201d: awarding master contracts for payment systems; developing contracts for temporary services; completing the Management, Organization, Business Improvement Schedule; and developing a program for sale of receivables. These activities may be initially important to GSA in achieving its strategic goals and accomplishing its mission. However, these measures appear to us to be activities rather than measures, and the accompanying narrative provides no information that describes what these activities are or what outcomes they aim to achieve so that decisionmakers can understand their importance and gauge progress over time."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Connecting Mission, Goals, and Activities", "paragraphs": ["Contrary to the Results Act and OMB guidance, GSA\u2019s performance plan does not always show clear connections between the performance goals and the specific program activities and funding in its budget. Without such a linkage, decisionmakers cannot relate the performance goals in the plan to the program activities in the budget. Furthermore, they cannot readily assess how GSA intends to allocate its anticipated budgetary resources among its performance goals. Although the plan identifies a specific \u201cfunding\u201d and \u201cactivity\u201d category for most performance goals, the activity does not generally correspond to the specific program activities used in the agency\u2019s budget request. For example, the performance goal to improve energy systems in federal buildings to meet or exceed the federal energy consumption standards for 2005 identifies the \u201cFederal Buildings Fund\u201d as the funding and \u201cenergy\u201d as the activity, but the President\u2019s budget for the Federal Buildings Fund does not have an energy program activity. Also, for some performance goals, the plan shows that \u201cmultiple\u201d activities are involved but does not specifically identify the activities.", "Furthermore, because the plan does not identify the funding level for most of the activities named in the plan or the program activities in the budget request, the reader cannot determine how much funding GSA proposes to use to meet its performance goals. In addition, contrary to the criteria in the Results Act, some program activities assigned large levels of funding in the budget, such as construction and acquisition of facilities and construction of lease purchase facilities, are not linked to specific performance goals. We believe the plan would be more useful if the activity and funding identified with each performance goal could be easily linked to GSA\u2019s budget request.", "The plan includes GSA\u2019s mission statement and gives abbreviated versions of its strategic goals presented in its strategic plan, but they are not identified as such. Further, although none of the strategic goals were revised for the performance plan, we noted that GSA appears to have dropped two of the five objectives related to the fourth strategic goal but provides no rationale for this revision. Consequently, it may be difficult for the reader to judge whether the performance goals in the annual performance plan are related to and consistent with GSA\u2019s strategic plan, as envisioned by the Results Act and OMB guidance.", "In addition, we noted that like the strategic plan, the performance plan does not address major management problems we and the GSA\u2019s IG have identified in recent years. These include data reliability, which will be discussed in more detail later; insufficient management controls; and impediments to businesslike asset management in the real property area. In a January 29, 1998, memorandum to agencies, the Director of OMB said that \u201cperformance goals for corrective steps for major management problems should be included for problems whose resolution is mission-critical, or which could materially impede the achievement of program goals.\u201d As we reported in January 1998, our work has shown over the years that major management problems at GSA have significantly hampered GSA\u2019s and its stakeholder agencies\u2019 abilities to accomplish their missions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recognizing Crosscutting Efforts", "paragraphs": ["Although GSA\u2019s performance plan recognizes the crosscutting nature of its activities, it does not adequately explain how it will coordinate its crosscutting functions with the federal community. OMB Circular A-11, Sec. 220.8, states that the annual performance plan should identify performance goals that reflect activities being mutually undertaken to support programs of an interagency, crosscutting nature. Because GSA is an agency with governmentwide policysetting, oversight, and operational functions, its major activities collectively affect the whole federal community.", "Some of GSA\u2019s specific performance goals are crosscutting in nature. For example, according to the plan, three of the performance goals under the goal to \u201cpromote responsible asset management\u201d involve \u201ccollaboration among many federal agencies brought together by GSA\u201d and \u201cmeasurement of the results of policy initiatives will require collection of other agencies\u2019 costs.\u201d However, although the discussion of some of the efforts contain references to coordination with other federal agencies, the plan does not discuss how GSA will coordinate these efforts. In another example, GSA\u2019s performance goal to improve access to quality child care for all federal employees does not explain exactly how GSA is coordinating with the federal community for this wide-reaching goal. In the excel-at-customer-service section, GSA generally describes what it is doing to better understand its customers\u2019 needs. These actions include face-to-face meetings with customers or their agency representatives and working with interagency groups and councils. However, it is difficult to relate these actions to the specific crosscutting aspects of the goals in this section of the plan."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "GSA\u2019s Plan Does Not Adequately Discuss How Strategies and Resources Will Help GSA Achieve Its Goals", "paragraphs": ["GSA\u2019s performance plan does not explicitly discuss the strategies\u2014how it will use its operational processes, skills, and technologies\u2014and resources (human, capital, information, or other resources) that will be needed to achieve its goals.

Specifically, we found that the narrative accompanying each objective and specific performance goal provides descriptive information on GSA activities. However, the narrative does not describe how GSA intends to meet the performance goals in the plan.", "For example, two of the three measures under the performance goal to increase market share for primary services are (1) the combined market share for information technology solutions and network services and (2) market share for fleet. Target percentages for fiscal years 1998 and 1999 are listed. The accompanying narrative, however, gives little indication of how GSA intends to increase its market share in these areas. GSA makes general statements about leveraging its competitive pricing with broad market penetration and government downsizing\u2014\u201cas the government downsizes agencies are looking to GSA to provide cost effective solutions to the workload needs and requirements.\u201d However, it offers no information on its specific approach or strategy for how it plans to leverage prices or take advantage of downsizing to increase its market share for its vehicle fleet.", "Although the Results Act does not require that the performance plan specifically discuss the impact of external factors on achieving performance goals, we believe that a discussion of such factors would provide additional context regarding anticipated performance. In its September 1997 strategic plan, GSA identified four external factors\u2014economic conditions, social policy, changes in technology and the marketplace, and legislative framework\u2014that could likely affect its overall performance. GSA\u2019s performance plan does not explicitly discuss these factors or their impact on achieving the performance goals. In addition, other external factors that we have reported on over the years\u2014such as the lengthy prospectus authorization process and budget scorekeeping rules that favor operating leases over ownership\u2014are not mentioned in the performance plan."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Connecting Resources to Performance Goals", "paragraphs": ["GSA\u2019s performance plan does not adequately discuss the resources it will use to achieve the performance goals.

Even in these three cases, there is no explanation of specifically how the funds will be used. We also noted that two goals made a limited reference to staffing issues. For example, for the performance goal to implement capital planning for information technology to comply with the Clinger-Cohen Act, the plan identifies the type of staff (project managers, planners, budget analysts, and executives) that will be involved.

These include audits of its financial records and systems by an independent accounting firm and top level quarterly meetings to review the financial and programmatic results of its various business lines. However, we believe that the performance plan would be greatly improved if GSA were to also highlight some of the specific controls it may use for its major systems to verify and validate performance information on an ongoing basis. Such controls could include periodic data reliability tests, computer edit controls, and supervisory reviews of data used to develop performance measures.", "Various financial audits and management reviews are certainly useful steps to identifying data problems that require management attention; but they are no substitute for effective front-end procedures, practices, and controls to ensure data reliability\u2014a critical component of performance measurement. GSA has had financial and program audits on an ongoing basis for many years. However, despite these efforts, the agency has a history of data problems as shown by our work and that of the IG (this work is discussed later in more detail).

Between 1994 and 1997, IG audits of the internal controls over the production of reliable data to support various GSA performance measures found problems. Specifically, of the eight audits conducted, controls designed to produce reliable data to support various GSA performance measures were found to be at moderate risk in three, high risk in one, and low risk in the other four. In February 1998, the IG reported on reviews of two additional performance measures; one was low risk, and the other was removed from the Fiscal Year 1997 Annual Report as a result of issues raised during the IG review.", "In addition, the IG reported in its October 31, 1997, Semiannual Report to Congress that many of the 87 major systems GSA uses to support its functions are old and incorporate inefficient technologies compared with today\u2019s advanced systems. Modification and maintenance of these old systems have become complex and costly. Finally, the independent audit of GSA\u2019s 1996 and 1997 financial statements noted data problems related to property account classifications for construction projects and access controls over the Federal Supply Service\u2019s information systems. Also, the independent auditors reported that although the Public Buildings Service has addressed certain deficiencies in its internal control structure, attention to improving internal controls in its business and financial processes is required to assess, improve, and report the results of program performance. Despite such evidence that suggests data reliability is still a major problem, the performance plan is silent on this critical issue.
