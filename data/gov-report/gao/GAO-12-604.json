Specifically, NOAA established a Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS) program office, documented its requirements, and transferred existing contracts for earth-observing sensors to the new program. DOD established its Defense Weather Satellite System program office and modified contracts accordingly. However, recent events have resulted in major program changes at both agencies. NOAA plans to revise its program requirements to remove key elements, including sensors and ground-based data processing systems, to keep the program within budget. Further, in early 2012, DOD decided to terminate its program and reassess its requirements.", "Over the past year, NOAA has made progress in developing its satellite system, but critical decisions and milestones lie ahead. In October 2011, the JPSS program office successfully launched a satellite originally called the NPOESS Preparatory Project (NPP). Data from the satellite are currently being calibrated and validated, and NOAA meteorologists started using selected satellite data products in their weather forecasts in May 2012. Further, the three major components of the JPSS program (the flight, ground, and free-flyer projects) are at different stages of development. Within the flight project, development of the sensors for the first JPSS satellite is well under way; however, selected sensors are experiencing technical issues. The ground project is currently in operation supporting NPP and NOAA is planning to upgrade parts of the ground system infrastructure to increase its security and reliability. The free-flyer project, intended to integrate and launch key instruments that could not be accommodated on the JPSS satellites, is still in a planning stage because NOAA has not yet decided which satellites will host the instruments or when these satellites will launch.", "The JPSS program office has implemented elements of an effective risk management process; however, the program still faces significant risks. It does not yet have a cost and schedule baseline in place, the program office is not yet fully staffed, and there will likely be a gap in satellite data lasting 17 to 53 months from the time NPP is projected to cease operations and the first JPSS satellite begins to operate. There are also potential satellite data gaps in the DOD and European polar satellite programs, which provide supplementary information to NOAA forecasts. The JPSS program office is managing the first two risks, but NOAA has not established plans to mitigate potential satellite gaps.

These satellites obtain  environmental data that are processed to provide graphical weather  images and specialized weather products. These satellite data are also  the predominant input to numerical weather prediction models, which are  a primary tool for forecasting weather days in advance\u2014including  forecasting the path and intensity of hurricanes. The weather products  and models are used to predict the potential impact of severe weather so  that communities and emergency managers can help prevent and  mitigate its effects. Polar satellites also provide data used to monitor  environmental phenomena, such as ozone depletion and drought  conditions, as well as data sets that are used by researchers for a variety  of studies such as climate monitoring.", "Unlike geostationary satellites, which maintain a fixed position relative to  the earth, polar-orbiting satellites constantly circle the earth in an almost  north-south orbit, providing global coverage of conditions that affect the  weather and climate. Each satellite makes about 14 orbits a day. As the  earth rotates beneath it, each satellite views the entire earth\u2019s surface  twice a day. Currently, there is one operational POES satellite and two  operational DMSP satellites that are positioned so that they cross the  equator in the early morning, midmorning, and early afternoon.

Satellite sensors observe different bands of radiation  wavelengths, called channels, which are used for remotely determining  information about the earth\u2019s atmosphere, land surface, oceans, and the  space environment. When first received, satellite data are considered raw  data. To make them usable, processing centers format the data so that  they are time-sequenced and include earth-location and calibration  information. After formatting, these data are called raw data records. The  centers further process these raw data records into channel-specific data  sets, called sensor data records and temperature data records. These  data records are then used to derive weather and climate products called  environmental data records. These environmental data records include a  wide range of atmospheric products detailing cloud coverage,  temperature, humidity, and ozone distribution; land surface products  showing snow cover, vegetation, and land use; ocean products depicting  sea surface temperatures, sea ice, and wave height; and  characterizations of the space environment. Combinations of these data  records (raw, sensor, temperature, and environmental data records) are  also used to derive more sophisticated products, including outputs from  numerical weather models and assessments of climate trends.

The converged  program, NPOESS, was considered critical to the nation\u2019s ability to  maintain the continuity of data required for weather forecasting and global  climate monitoring. NPOESS satellites were expected to replace the  POES and DMSP satellites in the morning, midmorning, and afternoon  orbits when they neared the end of their expected life spans.", "To manage this program, DOD, NOAA, and NASA formed a tri-agency  Integrated Program Office, with NOAA responsible for overall program  management for the converged system and for satellite operations, the  Air Force responsible for acquisition, and NASA responsible for facilitating  the development and incorporation of new technologies into the  converged system.", "When the primary NPOESS contract was awarded in August 2002, the  program was estimated to cost about $7 billion through 2018.

By November 2005, we estimated that the  program\u2019s cost had grown to $10 billion, and the schedule for the first  launch was delayed by almost 2 years. These issues led to a 2006  decision to restructure the program, which reduced the program\u2019s  functionality by decreasing the number of planned satellites from 6 to 4,  and the number of instruments from 13 to 9. As part of the decision,  officials decided to reduce the number of orbits from three (early morning,  midmorning, and afternoon) to two (early morning and afternoon) and to  rely solely on the European satellites for midmorning orbit data.", "Even after the restructuring, however, the program continued to  encounter technical issues in developing two sensors, significant tri- agency management challenges, schedule delays, and further cost  increases.

As a result of this review, in February 2010, the Director of the  Office of Science and Technology Policy announced that NOAA and DOD  would no longer jointly procure the NPOESS satellite system; instead,  each agency would plan and acquire its own satellite system.  Specifically, NOAA would be responsible for the afternoon orbit and the  observations planned for the first and third satellites. DOD would be  responsible for the early morning orbit and the observations planned for  the second and fourth satellites.

When NPOESS was  first disbanded, program officials anticipated launching the JPSS satellites  in 2015 and 2018 (while acknowledging that these dates could change as  the program\u2019s plans were firmed up). Over the past year, as program  officials made critical decisions to defer work on JPSS in order to keep  NPP on track, the launch dates for JPSS-1 and JPSS-2 have changed.  Program officials currently estimate that JPSS-1 will be launched by  March 2017 and JPSS-2 will be launched by December 2022.", "NOAA officials acknowledge that there is a substantial risk of a gap in  satellite data in the afternoon orbit, between the time when the NPP  satellite is expected to reach the end of its life and the time when the  JPSS-1 satellite is to be in orbit and operational. This gap could span  from 17 months to 3 years or more. In one scenario, NPP would last its  full expected 5-year life (to October 2016), and JPSS-1 would launch as  soon as possible (in March 2017) and undergo on-orbit checkout for a  year (until March 2018). In that case, the data gap would extend 17  months. In another scenario, NPP would last only 3 years as noted by  NASA managers concerned with the workmanship of selected NPP  sensors. Assuming that the JPSS-1 launch occurred in March 2017 and  the satellite data was certified for official use by March 2018, this gap  would extend for 41 months. Of course, any problems with JPSS-1  development could delay the launch date and extend the gap period.  Given the history of technical issues and delays in the development of the  NPP sensors and the current technical issues on the sensors, it is likely  that the launch of JPSS-1 will be delayed.

To illustrate this, the National Weather  Service performed several case studies to demonstrate how its weather  forecasts would have been affected if there were no polar satellite data in  the afternoon orbit. For example, when the polar satellite data were not  used to predict the \u201cSnowmaggedon\u201d winter storm that hit the Mid-Atlantic  coast in February 2010, weather forecasts predicted a less intense storm,  slightly further east, and producing half of the precipitation at 3, 4, and 5  days before the event.
