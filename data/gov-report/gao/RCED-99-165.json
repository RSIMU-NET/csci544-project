However, the Bureau has not defined fair annual rental and  does not have a clear policy on how that amount should be estimated.  The  Bureau\u2019s appraisal handbook, revised in October 1998, states that the  policies it contains apply to all real estate transactions and makes no  exception for leases, and Bureau officials have said they believe that fair  annual rental can be determined only through an appraisal.  In effect, fair  annual rental has come to mean no less than \u201cfair market rental\u201d as  estimated in an appraisal.  However, we found no statutory or regulatory  requirement that appraisals be used to estimate fair market rental, and, in  fact, some area offices use other methods in addition to appraisals to  establish lease values.", "Appraisals are opinions, or estimates, of the fair market value of property,  and the Bureau uses them to estimate property values for such transactions  as sales, exchanges, leases, gifts, or inheritances.  The value may be  estimated using one or more of three approaches\u2014comparable sales, cost,  or income capitalization.  The approach the Bureau\u2019s appraisers most often  use is the comparable sales approach, in which a property\u2019s value is  inferred from recent transactions involving properties similar to the one  being appraised.  In the cost approach, the appraiser estimates the value of  the property on the basis of costs that would be incurred to replace an  existing structure or improvement.  In the income capitalization approach,  the appraiser estimates a property\u2019s capacity to generate benefits (usually  income) and uses these benefits to derive the property\u2019s present value.  The  appraised value of real property is estimated on the basis of its \u201chighest and  best use.\u201d  The highest and best use is that which is legally permissible,  physically possible, and financially feasible and results in the highest value  consistent with the market.  While an appraisal is a tool to estimate the  value of a property, its actual value is established only when it is sold or  leased.", "Because of such practical considerations as land uses and staffing levels,  different approaches are sometimes used to establish lease values in some  areas.  Officials in the Aberdeen and Billings offices told us that they do not  have enough appraisers to appraise all leases and that they sometimes use  other methods to determine the lease value of land.  Some expressed  concern that if appraisals are indeed required for all lease transactions,  they are out of compliance with the Bureau\u2019s requirements by using these  other methods.  An official from the office of the Bureau\u2019s Deputy  Commissioner emphasized that it is not the Bureau\u2019s policy that staffing  levels should dictate the methods used to establish the fair annual rental  for trust land.  The official said that the Bureau needs to have consistent  procedures that apply to all offices.", "The Bureau has identified three general types of Indian trust land leases:   agriculture, business, and other.

For  example, in the Phoenix area, business leases make up about 13 percent of  all leases.  Two of the tribes in the area\u2014the Salt River and Gila River  Pima-Maricopa Indian Communities\u2014have properties with opportunities  for business development because of their proximity to Phoenix, Arizona.   The Salt River community leases its property for a 140-acre retail center  (described as the nation\u2019s largest business development ever built on  Indian land), two golf courses, and a solid waste disposal operation that  serves the community and nearby cities.  The Gila River community leases  property for several tribal enterprises, including three industrial parks, a  retail store, a billboard company, an airfield, a telephone company, and a  marina.

These leases typically have nominal rents; they include leases of  homesites for tribal members (which can be leased to tribal members for as  little as $1 per year) and special-use permits for temporary uses, such as  fireworks stands.  According to the Portland Area Office\u2019s realty officer, the  values for these leases are sometimes established by appraisals (especially  when the landowner and lessee are unrelated individuals), and sometimes  the values are more arbitrary (when the landowner and lessee are related  or when the tribe owns the land and the lessee is a tribal member).", "This category can also include leases for residential use, when lessees rent  property under a long-term lease (generally up to 25 years) and build a  home on the land.  The rent for these leases is established by appraisal, and  appraisers use market data for comparable residential ground leases when  such data are available.  However, when comparable lease information is  not available\u2014as in the Portland Area Office--appraisers first estimate the  market value of the land on the basis of sales of comparable residential  properties, after adjusting the value to reflect that of the land only (without  buildings or other improvements).  Once that value has been determined, a  rate of return is applied to the property\u2019s estimated market value to arrive  at the annual rental.  In real estate markets where land values are rising,  this method can result in increasing rental rates.  These changes in rents  are reflected in adjustments to the leases that, under the Bureau\u2019s  regulations, must occur at least once every 5 years.

Managers of state-owned land\u2014 held in trust for such public institutions as schools\u2014use a range of  methods including market surveys and competitive bidding for cropland  and appraisals for residential and business uses.

For example, grazing fees on federal land (whether managed by BLM or the  Forest Service) are established by a statutorily defined formula.", "Leasing is a small part of BLM\u2019s appraisal workload\u2014officials\u2019 estimates  ranged from 5 to 30 percent in the BLM state offices we contacted.  BLM  officials said that the agency rarely leases land for agricultural or  residential use.

Specifically, in July 1994, we reported that many of BLM\u2019s fees for  communication sites were established on the basis of out-of-date  appraisals and that the Forest Service\u2019s fees were established on the basis  of a 40-year-old, outdated formula.  In April 1996, we reported that  although the fee schedules for rights-of-way were established on the basis  of rates for those uses on private land, they were subsequently adjusted  downward because the industry and the agency\u2019s management viewed the  rates as too high.

For example, in Washington, agricultural  leases are offered through a competitive public auction.  Minimum rents  for land used for crops, whether irrigated or not, are established on the  basis of a \u201cfair market value assessment,\u201d that considers such factors as  crop options, soil type, and water availability.  The rents for the state leases  in Washington reflect the private lease terms identified in the market value  assessment.  However, they may be lower than the rents for private leases  because, unlike private landowners, the state does not provide such  improvements as fences and water, and lessees pay certain state taxes on  operations on state land.  Rents for crops that are not irrigated, such as  wheat and other small grains, are generally paid by crop-share; that is, the  state takes possession of a percentage of the crop harvested and sells it at  market.  Rents for irrigated crops, such as corn, potatoes, and alfalfa, are  generally paid in cash.  Both the crop-share percentages and the cash rent  amounts are established on the basis of market surveys of private leasing  practices.  Taking a different approach, Colorado establishes rents for  agricultural leases by using income-based formulas\u2014that is, the rents  reflect the amount of income the land is expected to generate.", "The states we contacted that lease land for residential use generally  establish a minimum acceptable rent by applying a rate of return to the  property\u2019s estimated market value.  For example, Minnesota leases  lakeshore property for residential purposes; establishing leases for 10 years  with rents of 5 percent of the land\u2019s appraised fair market sales value.   Rents for business leases most often are established by using an appraisal  to estimate the land\u2019s sales value and then applying an annual rate of return  to that value, although, according to a Colorado official, business rents  sometimes also assess lessees a percentage of the business\u2019 revenues."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Private Landowners", "paragraphs": ["Private landowners may or may not use appraisals to value land leases,  depending on the intended use of the land.

The rent for a tract of land may be affected by the presence of such  improvements as fences or water delivery systems, which could increase  the market rent (if the landowner pays for them) or result in a rent credit (if  the lessee pays for them).

The landowners may choose not to lease the land or there may  be no demand for the land because of poor soil quality, a slow farming  economy, inaccessibility, or lack of water.  However, in cases where trust  land is in demand because, for example, it is near other valuable land (such  as in Phoenix) or it can support valuable crops, there may be other  impediments to leasing the land if it has not been leased.  Bureau officials,  tribal representatives, and lessees cited appraisal amounts, the time taken  to prepare and review appraisals, and the Bureau\u2019s cumbersome  bureaucracy.", "Some lessees and Bureau realty officials asserted that Indian trust land  remains unleased in some areas because the land is appraised at values  higher than lessees want to pay.  Bureau officials often will not approve a  lease if the negotiated or offered rent is less than the appraised value.   These officials interpret the requirement to obtain a fair annual rental to  mean that the appraised amount is the minimum acceptable lease amount  and told us they fear approving leases for less would cause the Indian  landowners to submit appeals or file lawsuits challenging their decisions.   However, Bureau officials told us that they can and do approve leases for  less than the appraised value if the Indian landowners agree to accept less.   According to Bureau and other appraisers, appraisals are estimates of a  property\u2019s value and should be used as a management tool for making  informed leasing decisions.  In our opinion, the estimates are not intended  to be a \u201cfloor price\u201d any more than a \u201cceiling price.\u201d", "Concern over this issue is not new.  According to a December 1987 report  of the National Indian Agriculture Working Group, \u201cthe unswerving  application of the appraised market rental rates has frequently resulted in  the complete loss of income to Indian landowners when their land sits  unleased due to the lack of flexibility in determining rental rates.\u201d While a  prospective lessee may believe that the appraised value of a tract of land is  too high, the owner of that same tract of land may believe that it is too low.   In the words of an administrative judge with the Interior Board of Indian  Appeals (IBIA), \u201cthe determination of \u2018fair annual rental\u2019 requires the  exercise of judgment and . . . reasonable people may differ in their  calculation of \u2018fair annual rental.\u2019\u201d", "Timing is an important factor affecting the accuracy of appraisals because,  as land values increase or decrease over time, appraisals become outdated.   For this reason, according to Bureau and other appraisers, appraisals have  a limited useful life.  The longer it takes to prepare and review an appraisal,  the more likely it is that the data used in it to estimate a property\u2019s value are  too old to accurately reflect the current market.", "Representatives of the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community  expressed frustration about the slowness of the Bureau\u2019s Phoenix Area  Office in reviewing and approving appraisals prepared by appraisers under  contract to the community.  According to Bureau officials, all appraisals\u2014 whether prepared by a Bureau appraiser or a contract appraiser\u2014must be  reviewed and approved by a Bureau review appraiser to ensure that they  are consistent with USPAP.

The Gila River community recently hired an  appraiser to estimate the value of some properties because the Bureau was  taking too long.  We calculated that the nine Gila River appraisals had an  average processing time of 82 days:  All were prepared, reviewed, and  approved in between 40 and 126 days.", "While we did not specifically determine the reasons for the time required to  prepare and review appraisals, the former chief review appraiser at the  Phoenix Area Office cited workload issues and concern about the quality of  contractor-prepared appraisals as reasons for some delays.  He emphasized  that USPAP requires a review appraiser to do sufficient work to be satisfied  that an appraisal meets the standards and does not limit the time allowed  for review.", "Some lessees and Bureau officials identified a variety of problems with the  Bureau\u2019s bureaucracy; for example, the Bureau\u2019s processes were  characterized as more cumbersome than the private sector\u2019s (for example,  the Bureau takes more time, requires more paperwork, and is less flexible).   Some said Bureau staff show a lack of initiative and accountability for such  things as being responsive to lessees and for leasing land on behalf of  landowners.

This occurs when an Indian landowner dies without a  will, and the property is divided among the landowner\u2019s heirs in accordance  with the Indian General Allotment Act of 1887, as amended. Over time, the  number of owners of some tracts of land has increased as the ownership  interests have passed through several generations of multiple heirs.  The  landowners may all be individual Indians; sometimes the tribe or  non-Indians also own an interest.  For example, in 1992 we reported that  over one-third of the trust land tracts on the Yakama Reservation had  multiple owners and that 19 percent of these tracts had more than 25  owners. Under the Bureau\u2019s regulations, officials must notify and obtain  concurrence from landowners owning a majority interest before leasing  land; therefore, the more owners a tract of land has, the longer it may take  for the Bureau to obtain their concurrence."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Bureau Could Use Methods Other Than Appraisals to Establish Lease Values for Indian Land", "paragraphs": ["In addition to appraisals, a number of other methods may be used to  establish lease values.  These methods do not preclude the use of  appraisals, but appraisals would not necessarily be prepared for every  lease transaction.  These other methods include advertising for competitive  bids, conducting market surveys, and applying fee schedules or formulas.   We did not analyze the costs and benefits of these methods, but they are  used to varying degrees by other federal and state land management  agencies and by private landowners.  While we recognize that the Bureau\u2019s  trust responsibility to Indian landowners is unique and differs from the  relationships of other federal agencies to federal taxpayers and of state  land managers to school trust funds, these other methods may be  appropriate in some circumstances.  In fact, some area offices currently  use some of these methods, in some cases because they do not have  enough appraisers to appraise all tracts of land before leasing them.", "Alternative approaches that are already in use in some Bureau offices  include competitive bidding and the use of market surveys:", "Under its regulations, the Bureau is allowed to advertise tracts of  unleased trust land for competitive lease bids if the landowner wishes to  explore the market and is required to do so for leases that are not  negotiated or for which a fair annual rental cannot be obtained through  negotiations.  When there is a competitive market, the high bid received  in a competitive auction would establish the market rental value.  The  Bureau would then approve the granting of a lease to the highest bidder.   Two of the agencies we visited (in the Billings and Portland areas) have  advertised unleased trust land for competitive lease bids with mixed  success (see app. I).  Competitive bidding is also used to lease  state-owned trust land in some states, such as Montana (for cabin and  homesite leases) and Washington (for agricultural leases).  In addition,  when the demand for land is high, private landowners may use  competitive bidding techniques by soliciting sealed bids from potential  renters.", "Market surveys may be used to identify the range of prevailing lease  rates for land in a specified area, particularly where the land use is  homogeneous.  Some Bureau offices\u2014such as those in Aberdeen and  Billings (for agricultural leases)\u2014already use this method.  Market  surveys result in generalized statements of what rents should be, or  parameters that decisionmakers can use in negotiating leases.  The lease  rate for a specific tract of land is compared with the range of rates  identified in the market survey to determine if the lease rate is within  that range.  The market survey approach differs from an appraisal in that  an appraisal is done for a specific property and is used to estimate the  market value of that property.  Some states also use this method for  determining whether the rent for their trust land is consistent with  prevailing rents in an area.", "Other approaches, which are not currently being used for Indian trust land,  include the use of fee schedules and formulas:", "As with market surveys, fee schedules could be used where land is used  for homogeneous purposes, such as grazing or the cultivation of some  crops.  Instead of appraising each site, land managers would refer to a  fee schedule to establish the rent.  We have reported on BLM\u2019s and the  Forest Service\u2019s use of fee schedules for communication sites (for  television and radio, for example) and rights-of-way (for oil and gas  pipelines and power lines).  While we support the concept of fee  schedules, we have reported on weaknesses in their implementation in  cases where they did not reflect fair market value.", "Some states, such as Colorado, use formulas to determine the  appropriate lease value for cropland.  Formulas can be used where  information is available on expected income and costs associated with  the land.  For example, the Colorado State Land Board determines the  per-acre rent value of irrigated cropland on the basis of the farmer\u2019s  expected per-acre income for the parcel of land.  The board multiplies  the state's share by the per-acre income (the state\u2019s share varies by  agricultural crop and practices) and reduces the total to reflect the  farmer's irrigation costs.  Washington also uses formulas to set rates for  grazing permits on its trust land.", "Changes in current laws or regulations would not be necessary for the  Bureau to adopt these or other alternative methods.  Consistent with this  view, in December 1998, a workgroup studying appraisal issues reported to  the Deputy Commissioner for Indian Affairs that it found no statutes that  specifically require the Bureau to conduct appraisals. A representative of  the Deputy Commissioner\u2019s office emphasized that this position has not  been adopted by the Bureau and that a legal review that examines laws and  court cases that apply Bureau-wide would be required before it would  consider doing so.

The first directed the Bureau\u2019s Office of Trust  Responsibilities, with assistance from Interior\u2019s Office of the Solicitor, to  determine whether and to what extent existing laws, regulations, and court  rulings require appraisals of trust land.  The second directed Bureau offices  to develop and maintain a database for tracking appraisals.  In November  1998, the Bureau convened a workgroup to consider and recommend ways  to reduce the backlog of appraisal requests, which are made for many types  of land transactions, including sales, exchanges, rights-of-way, and leases  of property.  In December 1998, the workgroup made its recommendations  to the Deputy Commissioner for Indian Affairs.", "The field solicitor in the Minneapolis Area Field Office reviewed the legal  requirements for appraisals.  He concluded that no laws specifically require  the Bureau to conduct appraisals of property or interests in that property  and that the statutes give the Secretary of the Interior discretion in  determining the fair value of property.  However, Bureau officials stated  that the review was preliminary and that a comprehensive legal review by  Interior\u2019s Office of the Solicitor would be required before the Bureau would  consider making changes to the program on that basis.", "The appraisal workgroup also reported that each area or agency office  maintains its own tracking system and that all systems are adequate to  monitor, or track, appraisal requests.  According to the improvement plan,  these tracking systems are designed to provide the Bureau with  information on when most of the appraisals are needed and to enable  Bureau management to use appraisal resources (funding and staff) more  effectively.", "However, we obtained appraisal tracking data from four offices and found  wide variability in the usability of the data; in some cases, data on an  individual appraisal were virtually unusable for analyzing the status of the  appraisal.

Short-term changes include establishing  reservation- or neighborhood-specific computer-generated models for  determining the value of multiple ownership interests in land and training  realty specialists on when to request appraisals and what type of report is  sufficient for the realty action to be taken.", "According to Bureau officials, a great deal of their time is spent estimating  the value of each of the multiple ownership interests in tracts of land.  For  homogeneous land such as cropland, grassland, or hayland within a  reservation or neighborhood, the appraisal workgroup has recommended  that Bureau offices use computer-generated models\u2014similar to those used  by tax assessors\u2014to estimate the market value of these multiple interests.   The appraisers would be responsible for collecting and entering  capitalization and market rental rates for the land into the computer  modules on a regular basis.  In a separate initiative, the Department of the  Interior has proposed legislation that would provide a way to consolidate  very small ownership interests in Indian-owned land.  It has requested a  budget increase of $10 million in fiscal year 2000 to expand an ongoing pilot  project to consolidate land ownership interests of 2 percent or less.", "According to the workgroup, many appraisals are prepared for transactions  that are never completed (if, for example, the landowner or tribe decides  not to lease the land).  Although the exact number is not known, these  unnecessary appraisals could be canceled\u2014or never requested\u2014if realty  clerks were better trained in evaluating the need for appraisals.  Also, the  workgroup noted, the type and format of appraisal report has a significant  impact on the cost and time required to complete the appraisal, and realty  clerks often request more extensive reports than are called for by the type  of transaction being considered.", "Long-term actions the workgroup recommended that the Bureau take  include, among other things, creating appraisal guidelines that address  specific circumstances in different geographic areas.

However,  fair annual rental has not been defined and the Bureau does not have a  clearly stated policy on how it should be determined.

Consistent policies and procedures for deciding how  lease values should be determined would alleviate these concerns and  clarify for realty officials what methods they may rely on for valuing leases.", "Appraisals were cited as an impediment to leasing, both because officials  adhere to the appraised value as a minimum lease value and because the  processes are considered by some to be too time-consuming.  However, we  believe that, in addition to appraisals, other methods are available to  Bureau officials for estimating a fair annual rental for Indian land and could  be used under certain circumstances.

Given the small amounts they invested, lessees  could choose with relative ease not to renew their leases (thereby losing  their investments) if their rents increased over time.

Annual rents increased from an average of about  $1,200 to between $5,000 and $6,000, and the improvements resulted in  utility assessments that ranged from $8,000 to $11,500 for each of the lots  and, in many cases, were charged to the lessees.  The Community arranged  for funds from Skagit County (under a state block grant) of up to $8,000 per  lot to defray the utility assessment costs for low-income lessees; 30  lessees\u2014about one-third\u2014qualified for the grant.", "Lessees asserted that the new appraisals overstated the value of the lots  and that the resulting lease increases were inappropriately high; however,  landowners asserted that the appraisals might have understated the value  of the lots.
