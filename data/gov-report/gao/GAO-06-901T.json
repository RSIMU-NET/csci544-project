This testimony summarizes our report, GAO-06-720 , that describes how Labor carries out its H-1B program responsibilities and how Labor works with other agencies involved in the H-1B program."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["While Labor's H-1B authority is limited in scope, it does not use its full authority to oversee employers' compliance with program requirements. Labor's review of employers' applications to hire H-1B workers is timely, but lacks quality assurance controls and may overlook some inaccuracies. From January 2002 through September 2005, Labor electronically reviewed more than 960,000 applications and certified almost all of them. Labor's review of the applications is limited by law to checking for missing information or obvious inaccuracies and does this through automated data checks. However, in our analysis of Labor's data, we found more than 3,000 applications that were certified even though the wage rate on the application was lower than the prevailing wage for that occupation. We also found approximately 1,000 certified applications that contained erroneous employer identification numbers, which raises questions about the validity of the applications. In its enforcement efforts, Labor's Wage and Hour Division (WHD) investigates complaints made against H-1B employers. From fiscal year 2000 through fiscal year 2005, Labor reported an increase in the number of H-1B complaints and violations, and a corresponding increase in the number of employer penalties. In fiscal year 2000, Labor required employers to pay back wages totaling $1.2 million to 226 H-1B workers; by fiscal year 2005, back wage penalties had increased to $5.2 million for 604 workers. Program changes, such as a higher visa cap in some years, could have been a contributing factor. In April 2006, WHD began randomly investigating willful violators of the program's requirements. Labor uses education as its primary method of promoting compliance with the H-1B program by conducting compliance assistance programs and posting guidance on its web site. Labor, Homeland Security, and Justice all have responsibilities under the H-1B program, but Labor and Homeland Security face challenges sharing information. After Labor certifies an application, USCIS reviews it but cannot easily verify whether employers submitted petitions for more workers than originally requested on the application because USCIS's database cannot match each petition to Labor's application case number. Also, during the process of reviewing petitions, staff may find evidence that employers are not meeting their H-1B obligations. For example, Homeland Security may find that a worker's income on the W-2 is less than the wage quoted on the original application. USCIS may deny the petition if an employer is unable to explain the discrepancy, but it does not have a formal process for reporting the discrepancy to Labor. Moreover, current law precludes WHD from using this information to initiate an investigation of the employer. Labor also shares enforcement responsibilities with Justice, which pursues charges filed by U.S. workers who allege they were displaced by an H-1B worker. From 2000 through 2005, Justice found discriminatory conduct in 6 out of the 97 investigations closed, and assessed a total of $7,200 in penalties."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to assist you in your oversight of the H-1B  nonimmigrant visa program. This program was established to assist U.S.  employers in temporarily filling certain positions with highly-skilled  foreign workers. Employers who want to hire H-1B workers must attest to  meeting certain labor conditions\u2014such as notifying all employees of the  intention to hire H-1B workers and offering H-1B nonimmigrants the same  benefits as U.S. workers. A small number of H-1B employers are required  to make additional attestations concerning the non-displacement and  recruitment of U.S. workers. In recent years, employers have requested  more of these workers than are allowed to come into the country\u2014the cap  on H-1B visas has been reached before or shortly after the beginning of  each fiscal year. Currently, the annual number of H-1B workers authorized  to enter the United States is 65,000, but in previous years the cap has been  as high as 195,000.", "Several agencies are involved in the H-1B visa program. The Departments  of Labor (Labor), Homeland Security (Homeland Security), and Justice  (Justice) each have specific responsibilities during certain stages of the   H-1B visa process, ranging from reviewing and approving an employer\u2019s  request to hire an H-1B worker, to investigating complaints from both U.S.  and foreign workers. The Department of State also has a role in issuing the  worker\u2019s visa. Recently, there has been considerable interest regarding  how Labor, in conjunction with the other agencies, is ensuring that  employers comply with the requirements of the H-1B program.", "I will draw on the results of a report we are releasing today that was  conducted at the request of Chairmen Sensenbrenner and Hostettler,  Ranking Member Jackson Lee, and Representative Smith, which describes  (1) how Labor carries out its H-1B program responsibilities and (2) how  Labor works with other agencies involved in the H-1B program. To  address these questions, we interviewed officials from Labor, Homeland  Security\u2019s U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), and Justice.  We also reviewed laws and regulations pertaining to the H-1B program. We  analyzed data on the applications electronically reviewed by Labor as well  as data on the H-1B complaints received by Labor and the outcomes of the  associated investigations. We also analyzed data on the H-1B petitions  received by USCIS and conducted site visits to the California and Vermont  service centers. Finally, we analyzed reports from Justice regarding the  outcomes of its investigations into charges of U.S. worker displacement by  H-1B workers. A detailed discussion of our methodology is available in our  full report.", "In summary, Labor\u2019s oversight of the H-1B program is limited even within  the scope of its existing authority. Labor\u2019s review of employers\u2019   H-1B applications is limited by law to identifying omissions and obvious  inaccuracies, but we found it does not consistently identify all obvious  inaccuracies. For example, Labor certified more than 3,000 applications  even though the wage on the application was lower than the wage the  employers were required to pay for that occupation and location. Labor\u2019s  Wage and Hour Division (WHD) enforces H-1B program requirements by  investigating complaints made against H-1B employers and recently began  random investigations of previous program violators. From fiscal year  2000 through fiscal year 2005, complaints and violations increased but  changes in the program, such as temporary increases in visa caps, may  have been a factor. Labor shares H-1B responsibilities with Homeland  Security and Justice, but Labor and Homeland Security face challenges  sharing information across agencies. Homeland Security cannot easily  verify whether employers submitted petitions for more workers than they  originally requested on their application to Labor because USCIS\u2019s data  system does not match each petition to Labor\u2019s application case number.  Additionally, during the process of reviewing petitions, USCIS staff told us  they may find evidence that employers are not meeting their H-1B  obligations. However, USCIS does not have a formal mechanism to report  such information to Labor, and current law precludes WHD from using  this information to initiate an investigation of an employer. Justice pursues  charges filed by U.S. workers alleging they were not hired or were  displaced so that an H-1B worker could be hired instead, but it has not  found discriminatory conduct in most cases.", "To increase employer compliance with the H-1B program and protect the  rights of U.S. and H-1B workers, Congress should consider eliminating the  restriction on Labor using petition information submitted by employers to  Homeland Security as the basis for initiating an investigation. Congress  should also consider directing Homeland Security to provide Labor with  information received during the adjudication process that may indicate an  employer is not fulfilling its H-1B responsibilities. To strengthen oversight  of employers\u2019 applications to hire H-1B workers and to help ensure  employers are complying with program requirements, we recommend that  Labor improve its procedures for checking for completeness and obvious  inaccuracies, and, as Homeland Security\u2019s USCIS transforms its  information technology system, it include Labor\u2019s application case number  in the new system.", "The agencies gave us technical comments on our report and Homeland  Security agreed with our recommendations. Labor questioned whether  more stringent checks were necessary and believes Congress intentionally  limited Labor\u2019s role and placed program integrity with USCIS.", "We believe there are cost-effective methods Labor could use to check the  applications more stringently that would enhance the integrity of the H-1B  process."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The H-1B program was created by the Immigration Act of 1990, which  amended the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). The H-1B visa  category was created to enable U.S. employers to hire temporary workers  as needed in specialty occupations, or those that require theoretical and  practical application of a body of highly specialized knowledge. It also  requires a bachelor\u2019s or higher degree (or its equivalent) in the specific  occupation as a minimum requirement for entry into the occupation in the  United States. The Immigration Act of 1990 capped the number of H-1B  visas at 65,000 per fiscal year.", "Since the creation of the H-1B program, the number of H-1B visas  permitted each fiscal year has changed several times. Congress passed the  American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act of 1998  (ACWIA), which increased the limit to 115,000 for fiscal years 1999 and  2000. In 2000, Congress passed the American Competitiveness in the  Twenty-First Century Act (AC-21), which raised the limit to 195,000 for  fiscal year 2001 and maintained that level through fiscal years 2002 and  2003. The number of H-1B visas reverted back to 65,000 thereafter.", "Generally, an H-1B visa is valid for 3 years of employment and is  renewable for an additional 3 years.", "Filing an application with Labor\u2019s Employment and Training  Administration is the employer\u2019s first step in hiring an H-1B worker, and  Labor is responsible for either certifying or denying the employer\u2019s  application within 7 days. By law, it may only review applications for  omissions and obvious inaccuracies. Labor has no authority to verify the  authenticity of the information. Employers must include on the application  information such as their name, address, rate of pay and work location for  the H-1B worker, and employer identification number. All employers are  also required to make four attestations on the application as to:  1.  Wages:  The employer will pay non-immigrants at least the local  prevailing wage or the employer\u2019s actual wage, whichever is  higher, and pay for nonproductive time caused by a decision made  by the employer; and offer nonimmigrants benefits on the same  basis as U.S. workers.  2.  Working conditions:  The employment of H-1B nonimmigrants will  not adversely affect the working conditions of U.S. workers  similarly employed.   3.  Strike, lockout, or work stoppage:  No strike or lockout exists in  the occupational classification at the place of employment.   4.  Notification:  The employer has notified employees at the place of  employment of the intent to employ H-1B workers.", "Certain employers are required to make three additional attestations on  their application. These additional attestations apply to H-1B employers  who: (1) are H-1B dependent, that is, generally those whose workforce is  comprised of 15 percent or more H-1B nonimmigrant employees; or (2) are  found by Labor to have committed either a willful failure to meet H-1B  program requirements or misrepresented a material fact in an application  during the previous 5 years. These employers are required to additionally  attest that: (1) they did not displace a U.S. worker within the period of   90 days before and 90 days after filing a petition for an H-1B worker;   (2) they took good faith steps prior to filing the H-1B application to recruit  U.S. workers and that they offered the job to a U.S. applicant who was  equally or better qualified than an H-1B worker; and (3) prior to placing  the H-1B worker with another employer, they inquired and have no  knowledge as to that employer\u2019s action or intent to displace a U.S. worker  within the 90 days before and 90 days after the placement of the H-1B  worker with that employer.", "After Labor certifies an application, the employer must submit a petition  for each worker it wishes to hire to USCIS. On March 1, 2003, Homeland  Security took over all functions and authorities of Justice\u2019s Immigration  and Naturalization Service under the Homeland Security Act of 2002 and  the Homeland Security Reorganization Plan of November 25, 2002.  Employers submit to USCIS the application, petition, and supporting  documentation along with the appropriate fees. Information on the  petition must indicate the wages that will be paid to the H-1B worker, the  location of the position, and the worker\u2019s qualifications. Through a  process known as adjudication, USCIS reviews the documents for certain  criteria, such as whether the petition is accompanied by a certified  application from Labor, whether the employer is eligible to apply for H-1B  workers, and whether the prospective H-1B worker is qualified for the  position.", "The Wage and Hour Division of Labor\u2019s Employment Standards  Administration performs investigative and enforcement functions to  determine whether an employer has complied with its attestations on the  application. An aggrieved individual or entity or certain non-aggrieved  parties may file a complaint with Labor that an employer violated a  requirement of the H-1B program. To conduct an investigation, the  Administrator must have reasonable cause to believe that an employer did  not comply with or misrepresented information on its application.", "Employers who violate any of the attestations on the application are  subject to civil money penalties or administrative remedy, such as paying  back wages to H-1B workers or debarment, which disqualifies an employer  from participating in the H-1B program for a specified period of time.  Employers, the person who filed the complaint, or other interested parties  who disagree with the findings of the investigation then have 15 days to  appeal by requesting an administrative hearing.", "The Office of Special Counsel for Immigration Related Unfair Employment  Practices (OSC) of the Department of Justice also has some enforcement  responsibility.

Labor defines an obvious inaccuracy as when an  employer:  files an application after being debarred, or disqualified, from  participating in the H-1B program;    submits an application more than 6 months before the beginning  date of the period of employment;  identifies multiple occupations on a single application;    states a wage rate that is below the Fair Labor Standards Act  minimum wage;  identifies a wage rate that is below the prevailing wage on the  application; and  identifies a wage range where the bottom of the range is lower than  the prevailing wage on the application.", "Despite these checks, Labor\u2019s system does not consistently identify all  obvious inaccuracies. For example, although the overall percentage was  small, we found 3,229 applications that were certified even though the  wage rate on the application was lower than the prevailing wage for that  occupation in the specific location (see table 1).", "Additionally, Labor does not identify other errors that may be obvious.  Specifically, Labor told us its system reviews an application\u2019s employer  identification number to ensure it has the correct number of digits and  that the number does not appear on the list of employers who are  ineligible to participate in the H-1B program. However, we found 993  certified applications with invalid employer identification number  prefixes. Officials told us that in other programs, such as the permanent  employment program, Labor matches the application\u2019s employer  identification number to a database with valid employer identification  numbers. However, they do not formally do this match with H-1B  applications because it is an attestation process, not a verification process.", "Likewise, Labor officials told us they frequently review the application  process to determine where improvements can be made, but they rely on a  system of data checks rather than a formal quality assurance process  because of the factual nature of the form and the number of applications  received. Also, officials said if they conducted a more in-depth review of  the applications, they could overreach their legal authority and increase  the processing time for applications.

As shown in table  2, we found that the number of complaints increased from 117 in fiscal  year 2000 to 173 in fiscal year 2005, and the number of cases with  violations more than doubled, along with a corresponding increase in the  number of employer penalties. In fiscal year 2000, Labor required  employers to pay back wages totaling $1.2 million to 206 H-1B workers; by  fiscal year 2005, back wages penalties had increased to $5.2 million for 604  workers. The most common type of violation each fiscal year involved a  failure to pay H-1B workers the required wage. Labor officials told us it is  difficult to attribute changes in complaints and violations to any specific  cause because of multiple legislative changes to the program, such as the  temporary increase in the number of H-1B workers allowed to enter the  country and the additional attestations for certain employers that expired  and then were reinstated.", "Labor\u2019s Wage and Hour Division has recently begun random investigations  of employers who have willfully violated H-1B program requirements in  the past.

First, these employers  frequently go out of business because they are not allowed to participate  in the H-1B program for a period of time. Second, there are only a limited  number of willful violators\u2014just 50 nationwide in late fiscal year 2005. In  addition, we were told that H-1B investigators have heavy caseloads.

During investigations  of employers, Labor explains the employer\u2019s legal obligations and asks the  employer about the changes it plans to make to comply with the law.  When an investigation results in an employer\u2019s debarment, Labor  publicizes the case through press releases highlighting the consequences  for not complying with H-1B program requirements.
