Barracks privatization involves a number of unique challenges ranging from the funding of privatization contracts to the location of privatized barracks. Recently, each service has independently given increased attention to developing privatization proposals. A collaborative, rather than independent, approach could minimize duplication and optimize lessons learned. DOD could reduce the construction costs of government-owned barracks through the widespread use of residential construction practices rather than traditional steel frame, concrete, and cement block. The Army estimated that residential type construction could reduce barracks construction costs by 23 percent or more. However, concerns about barracks durability and unanswered engineering questions have prevented widespread use of these practices. DOD's full use of required existing barracks space could reduce the cost of housing allowances paid to unmarried junior members to live off base in local communities. GAO found that the services have authorized housing allowances for unmarried members to live off base even when existing barracks space was available. This occurred because of lenient barracks utilization guidance, which in some cases does not require full use of existing barracks, and possible noncompliance with guidance. The Air Force could have potentially reduced annual housing allowances by about $20 million in fiscal year 2002 by fully using available barracks space."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Each year the Department of Defense (DOD) spends billions of dollars to  house unmarried servicemembers at their permanent duty locations in the  United States. Unmarried junior enlisted members are normally required  to live on base in furnished living quarters commonly referred to as  barracks. If barracks space is unavailable, these members can be  authorized a housing allowance and live off base in local civilian  communities. Because DOD views housing as a key factor affecting quality  of life, the services have initiated plans to improve barracks living  conditions. Over the next several years, the services plan to spend about   $6 billion to eliminate barracks with multi-person bathroom facilities, or  \u201cgang latrines,\u201d and provide private sleeping rooms for all permanently  assigned members. The Navy has an additional goal to provide barracks  for approximately 20,000 sailors who currently live aboard ships even  when in homeport. To improve military housing faster than could be  achieved if only traditional military construction funds were used,  legislation was enacted in 1996 at DOD\u2019s request to authorize private  sector financing, ownership, operation, and maintenance of military  housing, including barracks. Because of the cost of the program and the  importance of housing on servicemembers\u2019 quality of life, we examined,  on the basis of the Comptroller General\u2019s authority, DOD\u2019s housing  program for unmarried members and explored whether opportunities  exist to reduce costs.", "Since 1998, we have issued six reports on DOD\u2019s military housing  program\u2014three about the military housing privatization initiative, one  about the services\u2019 barracks design standard, one about DOD\u2019s process for  determining military housing requirements, and one about the opportunity  for the services to reduce future barracks construction costs and improve  quality of life by allowing more unmarried members to live off base.

Commonly referred to as barracks, housing for unmarried members is  often cited by DOD officials as a problem area because many military  barracks are old, rundown, and otherwise do not meet contemporary DOD  standards for size, privacy, and other amenities designed to enhance the  quality of life of unmarried members. Junior unmarried members often  share dilapidated barracks rooms with one or two other members and a  gang latrine with occupants from several other rooms. Also, about 20,000  junior enlisted members assigned to Navy ships continue to live in  cramped onboard quarters even when their ships are in homeport. The  living conditions in barracks are far different from an apartment or  townhouse with two bedrooms, living area, bath, and full kitchen that is  the normal housing standard for junior enlisted married members.", "The services have established specific goals and milestones for improving  the housing provided to unmarried junior enlisted members. First, the  services plan to eliminate permanent party barracks\u2014i.e., barracks for  servicemembers at their permanent duty locations\u2014with common bath  and shower facilities, or \u201cgang latrines,\u201d through barracks replacement or  renovation. The Air Force already has achieved this goal and the Army,  Navy, and Marine Corps plan to eliminate gang latrines by fiscal years  2008, 2007, and 2005, respectively. Second, the Army and the Navy plan to  provide each junior enlisted member in the United States a private  sleeping room with a kitchenette and bath shared by one other member\u2014 referred to as the 1+1 barracks design standard\u2014by fiscal years 2010 and  2013, respectively. The Air Force, which already provides private sleeping  rooms, plans to eliminate its barracks deficit and replace its worst  barracks by fiscal year 2009. The Marine Corps, given a permanent waiver  from the Secretary of the Navy to use a different barracks design standard,  plans to provide barracks with sleeping rooms and baths shared by two  junior members by fiscal year 2012. Third, the Navy plans to complete its  homeport ashore initiative by fiscal year 2008, which will provide barracks  spaces for about 20,000 junior members who are currently required to live  aboard their ships while in homeport. To improve barracks conditions and  achieve these goals, the services plan to spend about $6 billion over the  next 6 years. Appendix II shows photographs of old and new style  barracks as well as typical living conditions aboard Navy ships.", "Service officials state that unmarried junior enlisted servicemembers  should live in barracks to help instill service core values, provide for team  building and mentoring, and meet operational requirements. However,  significant differences exist among the services regarding personnel who  are required to live in barracks. More specifically:  the Army requires unmarried personnel in pay grades E1 through E6 to  live in barracks,  the Navy requires unmarried personnel in pay grades E1 through E4  with fewer than 4 years of service to live in barracks,  the Air Force requires unmarried personnel in pay grades E1 through  E4 to live in barracks, and  the Marine Corps requires unmarried personnel in pay grades E1  through E5 to live in barracks.", "The Military Housing Privatization Initiative, authorized by law on  February 10, 1996, provided new authorities that, among other things,  allows DOD to provide direct loans, loan guarantees, and other incentives  to encourage private developers to construct and operate military family  and unaccompanied housing (barracks) either on or off military  installations. According to DOD, the initiative was aimed at solving its  inadequate housing problem faster and more economically by taking  advantage of the private sector\u2019s investment capital and housing  construction expertise. With private-sector investment, DOD planned to  obtain at least 3 dollars in military housing improvements for each dollar  that the government invested, thereby reducing the amount of government  funds initially required to revitalize housing and accelerating the  elimination of inadequate housing. Although there can be exceptions,  DOD\u2019s position is that the government\u2019s estimated total costs for a  privatization project also should be equal to or less than the total costs for  the same project financed by military construction funding.  Servicemembers who live in privatized housing receive a housing  allowance to pay for rent and utilities. In fiscal year 1997, the Congress  appropriated $5 million for the services to use to initiate privatized  barracks projects. However, the Congress rescinded these funds in fiscal  year 1999 because the services had developed no plans for privatized  barracks.", "In June 1997, DOD and the Office of Management and Budget agreed to a  set of guidelines that would be used as a frame of reference for scoring  privatization projects. The guidelines state that if a project provides an  occupancy guarantee, then funds for the project must be available and  obligated \u201cup front\u201d at the time the government makes the commitment of  resources. In other words, if a project provides an occupancy guarantee,  then the value of the guarantee\u2014the cumulative value of the rents to be  paid for the housing over the entire contract term\u2014must be obligated at  the beginning of the project. As a result, DOD officials stated that such a  project might not be financially attractive because the amount of  appropriated funds required would be approximately equivalent to the  military construction funding that would be required to build the barracks.  According to DOD officials, this issue has not been a problem for family  housing privatization projects because DOD does not provide occupancy  guarantees and does not mandatorily assign members to family housing.  Military families can choose where to live and the project contracts  include provisions for civilians to rent privatized housing if military  families choose not to live there."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Prior GAO Reports on the Military Housing Program", "paragraphs": ["Since 1998, we have issued six reports on DOD\u2019s military housing  program\u2014three about the military housing privatization initiative, one  about the services\u2019 barracks design standard, one about DOD\u2019s process for  determining military housing requirements, and one about the differences  among the services concerning who is required to live in barracks.", "In July 1998, we reported on several concerns related to the new  military housing privatization program. These included (1) whether  privatization would result in significant cost savings and whether the  long contract terms of many projects might result in building housing  that will not be needed in the future; (2) whether controls were  adequate to protect the government\u2019s interests in the event developers  might not operate and maintain the housing as expected; and (3)  whether DOD would face certain problems if privatized housing units  were not fully used by military members and were subsequently rented  to civilians, as the contracts permit.  In March 1999, we reported on the status of the services\u2019  implementation of the 1+1 barracks design standard. The report also  discussed DOD\u2019s rationale for adopting the standard, the costs of  alternatives to the standard, and service views of the impact of the  standard from a team-building, individual isolation, or similar  perspective.  In March 2000, we reported that initial implementation progress for the  privatization program was slow, the services\u2019 life-cycle cost analyses  provided inaccurate cost comparisons because DOD had not issued  standardized guidance for preparing the analyses, and DOD lacked a  plan for evaluating the effectiveness of the program. DOD  subsequently quickened the pace of family housing privatization, issued  standard guidance for privatization life-cycle cost analyses, and  developed a program evaluation plan.  In August 2001, we reported that despite earlier recommendations,  DOD had not implemented a standard process for determining military  housing requirements. In that report, we pointed out that the initiative  to increase housing allowances heightened the urgency for a consistent  process, because the initiative could lessen the demand for military  housing by making housing in local communities more affordable. In  January 2003, DOD approved a new standard family housing  requirements determination process.  In June 2002, we noted that by investing about $185 million of military  construction funds in the first 10 family housing privatization projects,  DOD should obtain housing improvements that would have required  about $1.19 billion in military construction funds had only government  funds been used. We also reported that privatization projects were not  supported by reliable or consistent needs assessments, and the overall  requirement for military housing was not well defined. Further,  although DOD had included provisions in project contracts designed to  protect the government\u2019s interests, our report identified several areas  where DOD could further enhance protections to the government. DOD  responded by outlining ongoing and planned management actions to  address the concerns noted in the report.", "In January 2003, we reported on the widely varying standards among  the services regarding who should live in barracks and the effect this  can have on program costs and quality of life. We noted that requiring  more personnel (more pay grades) to live in barracks than is justified  results in increased barracks program and construction costs and has  negative quality-of-life implications because most junior  servicemembers would prefer to live off base. We noted that by  allowing junior enlisted personnel already living off base with a  housing allowance to continue to live off base, the Air Force could  reduce planned barracks construction spending by $420 million.  Accordingly, we recommended that the rationale behind the services\u2019  barracks occupancy requirements be based, at least in part, on the  results of objective, systematic analyses that consider the  contemporary needs of junior servicemembers, quality-of-life issues,  the services\u2019 mission requirements, and other relevant data that would  help provide a basis for the services\u2019 barracks occupancy requirements.  While DOD agreed in principle with our recommendation, it reiterated  the importance of military judgment in such decisions and left unclear  the extent to which it is likely to make changes."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOD and the Military Services Have Not Determined the Feasibility of Barracks Privatization", "paragraphs": ["While the services have considered barracks privatization over the past  several years, they have not yet initiated pilot project proposals to  determine the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of private sector financing,  ownership, operation, and maintenance of military barracks. According to  DOD officials, barracks privatization involves unique challenges compared  to family housing privatization. These challenges range from the  potentially higher amount of appropriated funds needed to secure a  privatization contract (as a result of the services\u2019 requirement that  unmarried junior members live in barracks) to the differences in where  private developers and the military prefer barracks to be located.  Deferring to the individual services, DOD has provided limited centralized  direction and focus to help overcome the challenges associated with  barracks privatization. Recently, each service has independently given  increased attention to developing project proposals, with the Navy hoping  to do so by the end of 2003. Still, there are unresolved issues associated  with barracks privatization and, without more coordination of activities to  address these issues, efforts might be duplicated and the benefits from  collaboration might be lost."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Barracks Privatization Involves Unique Challenges Compared to Family Housing Privatization", "paragraphs": ["Compared to family housing privatization, barracks privatization includes  unique challenges that, thus far, have prevented the development of pilot  project proposals. DOD has actively pursued privatization of military  family housing and has awarded contracts to construct or improve about  26,000 family housing units by the end of fiscal year 2002 and has plans to  privatize an additional 96,000 units by the beginning of fiscal year 2006.  The primary problem with privatizing barracks lies in the services\u2019  mandatory assignment policy for unmarried junior enlisted  servicemembers and whether this policy implies that DOD would provide  private-sector housing developers with an occupancy guarantee.  Mandatory assignment, if viewed as an occupancy guarantee, might make  a proposed barracks privatization project financially unattractive because  a higher amount of appropriated funds would be needed to secure the  contract than would be needed for a similar military construction project.  Other challenges are related to barracks locations, unit deployments, and  funding for housing allowances.", "The current policy in each service requires mandatory assignment of  unmarried junior members to barracks located on base, provided that  space is available. According to DOD officials, most military leaders  support this policy because they believe that mandatory assignments  provide for military discipline and unit integrity. Mandatory assignments,  however, might result in the need for more appropriations\u2014in comparison  to military construction financing\u2014to cover the obligations that the Office  of Management and Budget determines should be recorded at contract  award. This could make a proposed barracks privatization project  financially unattractive. The amount of appropriations needed hinges on  whether the mandatory assignment policy would provide private-sector  housing developers with a DOD guarantee of occupancy.", "Because there have been no barracks privatization project proposals to  date, it is unclear whether the services\u2019 mandatory barracks assignment  policies for junior members might be viewed as an occupancy guarantee.  Office of Management and Budget officials stated that having a mandatory  assignment policy alone would not necessarily guarantee that the rent paid  to the developer over the life of the project would have to be scored up  front. However, if the privatization contract specifically stated that  mandatory assignment would occur, the officials stated that the office  probably would view this as an occupancy guarantee and the project\u2019s  projected rent would be scored up front.", "As with family housing projects, Office of Management and Budget  officials stated that the scoring of a barracks project depends on the  details and circumstances involved in a proposed project and the  associated risk to the government. Key issues that might be considered  include whether the project allows the private developer enough  autonomy to manage the project without significant military control and  whether the contract includes provisions for civilians to rent vacant  barracks spaces in the event of reduced government demand. Obviously,  such issues present problems for the services\u2014specifically, the  willingness of the services to relinquish their control of barracks and allow  civilians to occupy vacant barracks spaces. With a specific barracks  privatization proposal, the Office of Management and Budget officials  stated they would work with DOD to address the associated scoring  questions.", "Although the potentially high amount of appropriated funds needed to  secure a contract appears to be the most significant challenge to barracks  privatization, there are other challenges as noted below.", "Barracks location. According to DOD officials, private developers have  indicated that they would prefer that privatized barracks be located off  base or along an installation\u2019s boundary and be severable from the  installation. Developers would then have greater flexibility in renting  the units to civilians in the event of reduced government demand.  However, the services do not want barracks located off-base or near  installations\u2019 perimeter fences largely for force protection reasons and,  currently, most existing barracks are not located along installation  boundaries.", "Deployments. In the event of unit deployments, many servicemembers  would not be in the barracks and possibly entire buildings could be  empty for months. As a result, the developer\u2019s normal rental income  could be reduced or eliminated even though the developer would still  need to pay for expenses such as mortgage payments and operations  and maintenance costs. This is less of a problem in privatized family  housing because family members normally continue to occupy the  housing and pay rent if the servicemember deploys.", "Funding for housing allowances. Service officials stated that identifying  and shifting funds to pay housing allowances to servicemembers living  in privatized barracks could be an administrative problem. This is less  of a problem with privatized family housing because military family  housing has a separate operations and maintenance budget account.  When a private developer takes over existing military family housing,  funds from the family housing operations and maintenance account  can be shifted to help pay for housing allowances used to pay rent for  the families living in the housing. However, barracks operations and  maintenance is not funded by a similar separate account. Instead,  barracks operations and maintenance funds are included in each  installation\u2019s overall base operating budget. According to service  officials, it is more difficult to identify, break out, and shift barracks  funding to the personnel accounts to pay housing allowances for a  privatized barracks project."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Has Provided Limited Centralized Direction and Focus for Barracks Privatization", "paragraphs": ["With its attention largely concentrated on initiating and managing  privatization of military family housing, DOD has provided limited  centralized direction and focus to help the services overcome the  challenges associated with barracks privatization and proceed with pilot  project proposals. Also, in August 1998, 2 years after the military housing  privatization legislation was enacted, DOD shifted primary responsibility  for implementing the privatization program to the individual services.  Since that time, the services have independently studied the barracks  privatization concept but have not developed actual project proposals.

Navy officials stated that they  believe barracks privatization offers an opportunity for the Navy to more  quickly meet its barracks improvement goals, including the goal of  providing barracks space for all junior sailors currently required to live on  their ships even while in homeport.", "In order for barracks privatization to be feasible, Navy officials believed  that the Navy needed additional authorities not contained in the Military  Housing Privatization Initiative legislation. Specifically, Navy officials  believed that existing housing allowance rates provided more money than  would be needed to develop a privatized barracks project. The housing  allowance rate for unmarried junior members is targeted to cover the  costs of a one-bedroom apartment in the civilian community. Yet, the  barracks occupancy standard is based on a lesser standard\u2014the modern  1+1 barracks design standard where two members share a module  consisting of two small bedrooms with a kitchenette and bath. As a result,  Navy officials believe the current housing allowance could provide more  money than would be needed to pay rent for a similar design standard in a  privatized barracks, and the rental income received by the private-sector  developer would be more than is needed to finance the construction and  management of the project. To address this situation, the Bob Stump  National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2003 provided the Navy  with specific legislative authority to undertake three pilot projects to  privatize barracks. According to Navy officials, the legislation will allow  the Navy to pay occupants\u2019 allowances in the amounts needed to provide  the rental income to support the privatized barracks projects and will  allow junior sailors on ships to be assigned to privatized barracks.", "With this authority, Navy and Marine Corps officials stated that they plan  to develop specific proposals for privatization.

After making adjustments to account for  differences in geographic location and dates of construction, the Army  Corps of Engineers found significant cost differences between the projects  as shown in table 1.", "The extended stay hotel provided each occupant with more amenities and  space than the Army barracks at a construction cost per occupant of  $14,100, or 29 percent, less than the barracks\u2019 average construction cost  per occupant. The Army Corps of Engineers determined that although  many factors accounted for the cost difference between the projects, the  primary reason was the type of construction used to build the projects.  The barracks were constructed in accordance with Uniform Building Code  type I/II (commercial) standards that call for non-combustible  construction built from concrete, masonry, and/or steel. The private  extended stay hotel was constructed in accordance with Uniform Building  Code type V (residential) standards that permit use of any building  material allowed by the code, including wood. The Army Corps of  Engineers\u2019 data showed that if the barracks had been built using  residential construction practices instead of traditional barracks  construction practices, the Army\u2019s average construction cost per occupant  would have been about $37,500, a reduction of about $11,200, or 23  percent, per occupant. This study did not address differences in the  barracks\u2019 total costs\u2014i.e., construction costs and operations and  maintenance costs\u2014over their lifetimes.

The report  included an additional example comparing barracks built using traditional  construction practices with a residential condominium built using  residential construction practices.

One project is building 960 rooms using traditional non- combustible construction practices and the other project is building 608  rooms using traditional 1-hour fire resistive construction practices.  Compared to the Fort Bragg projects, it appears that use of the residential  construction practices in the Fort Meade project will result in  considerable cost reductions\u2014from $12,600 to $31,800 per occupant (see  table 2)."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Barriers Exist to Greater Use of Residential Construction Practices", "paragraphs": ["There are barriers to DOD\u2019s widespread adoption of residential  construction practices as a normal way of doing business. Because Army  studies and the pilot project at Fort Meade indicate the potential to reduce  some costs by using residential construction practices, it would seem that  the services would be eager to adopt these practices for all future barracks  construction projects. However, this has not been the case due to  concerns about barracks durability and concerns related to antiterrorism  force protection issues.", "According to Army officials, the services have been reluctant to change  construction practices because of the concern that switching to residential  construction practices would result in barracks that are less attractive and  less durable. However, the officials noted that the exterior appearance of  barracks constructed with residential and traditional practices normally  would be the same. Also, Army analyses indicate that there is little  difference in durability with each type of construction and a barrack\u2019s  total costs over its lifetime would be less if constructed with residential  practices because of its lower initial construction costs and comparable  operations and maintenance costs for many building components. (See  app. III for additional details.) Still, the officials stated that the idea of  switching construction practices continues to face resistance. Because of  this, even the Army had no definite plans, as of February 2003, for  additional barracks construction using residential construction practices.", "The Air Force also had no plans to use residential construction practices  for its barracks projects. The Navy, which has completed two barracks  projects using residential construction practices, has no additional  barracks projects underway or planned using these practices.", "Another barrier to widespread adoption of residential construction  practices for barracks relates to unresolved questions on whether use of  these practices would result in barracks that fully complied with new  antiterrorism guidance for force protection. In July 2002, DOD finalized  guidance requiring military components to adhere to common criteria and  minimum construction standards to mitigate antiterrorism vulnerabilities  and terrorist threats. The standards seek to minimize the likelihood of  mass casualties from terrorist attacks against DOD personnel in the  buildings where they work and live.", "As applied to barracks construction, two standards in the antiterrorism  force protection guidance are particularly important\u2014standoff distance  and prevention of building collapse. Standoff distance refers to the  minimum distance that buildings should be situated from roads, parking  lots, trash containers, and an installation\u2019s perimeter. According to the  guidance, the easiest and least costly way to achieve appropriate levels of  protection against terrorist threats is to incorporate sufficient standoff  distance into project designs. In situations where the standoff distance  standards cannot be achieved because land is unavailable, the guidance  calls for building hardening or other techniques to mitigate possible blast  effects. According to Army officials, because most barracks projects in the  United States could be situated to meet required standoff distances, use of  residential construction practices and compliance with this standard  would not be a problem in most instances. Navy officials, however, stated  that enough land to meet required standoff distances was not available at  many of its installations.", "The DOD standard for preventing building collapse applies to buildings of  three or more stories and requires that they be designed with provisions  that permit the structure to sustain local damage without the entire  building collapsing. According to Army officials, questions remain as to  whether barracks built using residential practices would comply with the  collapse standard. They stated that the primary issue is lack of engineering  data. Most available building collapse information addresses structural  systems typical of taller buildings that were not built using residential  construction practices. Army officials also stated that complying with the  collapse standard using residential barracks construction practices might  not be a problem or might be solved with inexpensive adjustments to  construction techniques. Designers do not have sufficient data on exactly  what, if anything, needs to be done to ensure compliance with the  standard when using residential construction practices.", "At the same time, some Army officials also questioned whether the  collapse standard should apply to low-rise three-story barracks buildings.  They noted that industry design standards usually make a distinction in  structural requirements at four stories and above\u2014not at three stories and  above as required by the collapse standard. They further noted that today\u2019s  1+1 barracks design standard provides relatively low occupancy densities  that are more similar to family housing which is exempt from the force  protection requirements as long as a family housing building contains no  more than 12 family units."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Opportunities Exist to Make Better Use of Existing Barracks", "paragraphs": ["The services could minimize housing costs by ensuring full use of existing  barracks space.

Had  these members been assigned to the barracks, the Air Force potentially  could have reduced its annual housing allowance costs by about   $20 million.

First, widespread  adoption of residential construction practices in building government- owned barracks has been hampered because of concerns about barracks  durability and unanswered questions about the ability of wood-frame  barracks to meet all antiterrorism force protection requirements. Without  engineering studies to resolve these questions and, if appropriate,  adoption of residential construction practices, the services could be  spending more than is needed on barracks construction.

Use of residential construction practices to build barracks  could also reduce renovation costs and result in additional cost reductions  in labor construction costs.", "Army officials noted that actual differences in barracks operations and  maintenance costs are dependent on the particular building designs. In  general, however, the officials stated that there should be no significant  operations and maintenance cost differences with use of either traditional  or residential construction practices in many architectural features, such  as exterior and interior finishes, electrical and plumbing systems, doors  and hardware, and windows. For other building components, such as roofs  and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems, operations and  maintenance costs could be lower with traditional construction. But,  because of the lower initial construction costs, use of residential  construction practices for such components could still result in lower  costs over the life of the barracks. For example, the roof system for many  traditionally constructed barracks consists of metal and concrete that  would normally last for the entire life of the barracks. When using  residential construction practices, the barracks roof system would  normally consist of heavy-duty shingles that would require replacement  during the life of the barracks. Yet, Army analyses show that a shingle roof  system would have lower life-cycle costs than a metal and concrete roof  system because of its lower initial construction costs.", "Army officials also noted that use of residential construction practices for  barracks would result in buildings that could be renovated at lower costs  than traditionally constructed barracks. They stated that many military  buildings, including barracks, become functionally obsolete in 25 years or  less because of changed missions or design standards, such as the change  in the barracks design standard in 1995 from multi-person to private  sleeping rooms. The costs to renovate and reconfigure a traditionally  constructed barracks with masonry interior walls would normally be  greater than the costs to renovate and reconfigure a barracks built with  residential construction practices using wood frame and sheetrock walls.", "According to Army officials, use of residential construction practices to  build barracks could result in additional reductions in construction labor  costs. Federal statutes, commonly referred to as the Davis-Bacon Act and  related legislation, require that workers on most government construction  projects be paid according to the prevailing local wage rates as determined  by the Department of Labor. However, there are different prevailing local  wage rate scales depending on the type of construction being performed.  Traditionally, barracks construction has been considered commercial  construction and the commercial wage rate scale has been used for these  projects. In contrast, military family housing construction has been  considered residential construction and the residential wage rate scale has  been used for these projects. According to Army officials, the residential  wage rate scale is normally 5 to 30 percent less than the commercial wage  rate scale. Thus, using residential construction practices in a low-rise  (three stories or less) barracks construction project and application of the  residential, instead of commercial, wage rate scale, could result in  additional reductions in barracks construction costs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Comments from the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}], "fastfact": []}
