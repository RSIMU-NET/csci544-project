Employee misconduct related to the two section 1203 provisions on whether employees filed their tax returns on time and accurately stated their tax liability (as opposed to the eight taxpayer and employee rights provisions) accounted for almost all of the violations and firings. Most of the IRS frontline enforcement employees who responded to GAO's survey said that they understood, but feared, section 1203. They also reported that, because of section 1203, their work takes longer and the likelihood of their taking an enforcement action, such as recommending a seizure, has decreased. However, employees also were more likely to say that other factors, such as IRS's reorganization, have had a greater impact on their ability to do their job than to say that section 1203 had a greater impact. IRS and TIGTA have taken steps intended to correct known problems in their processing of section 1203 employee misconduct cases--such as lengthy investigations and conflicts of interest during investigations--that may have negatively affected frontline employees' morale and productivity. However, the extent to which these steps have succeeded is unknown because IRS and TIGTA do not have a coordinated approach for evaluating how effectively they process section 1203 cases.

One  provision of the Restructuring Act, section 1203, defines 10 specific acts or  omissions for which an IRS employee may be fired during the performance  of official duties. Such acts or omissions include harassing a taxpayer,  taxpayer representative, or other IRS employee, or IRS employees not  complying with their tax obligations; they are investigated on the basis of  allegations made by taxpayers (or taxpayer representatives) or IRS  employees.

Specifically, these acts  or omissions are  (1) willful failure to obtain the required approval signatures on documents  authorizing a seizure of a taxpayer\u2019s home, personal belongings, or  business assets;  (2) providing a false statement under oath with respect to a material  matter involving a taxpayer or taxpayer representative;  (3) violating the rights protected under the Constitution or the civil rights  established under six specifically identified laws with respect to a  taxpayer, taxpayer representative, or other employee of the IRS;  (4) falsifying or destroying documents to conceal mistakes made by any  employee with respect to a matter involving a taxpayer or taxpayer  representative;  (5) assault or battery of a taxpayer, taxpayer representative, or employee  of the IRS, but only if there is a criminal conviction, or a final judgment by  a court in a civil case, with respect to the assault or battery;  (6) violating the Internal Revenue Code, Department of Treasury  regulations, or policies of the IRS (including the Internal Revenue Manual)  for the purpose of retaliating against, or harassing, a taxpayer, taxpayer  representative, or other employee of the IRS;  (7) willful misuse of the provisions of section 6103 of the Internal  Revenue Code for the purpose of concealing information from a  congressional inquiry;  (8) willful failure to file any return of tax required under the Internal  Revenue Code on or before the date prescribed therefore (including any  extensions), unless such failure is due to reasonable cause and not to  willful neglect;  (9) willful understatement of federal tax liability, unless such  understatement is due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect; and  (10) threatening to audit a taxpayer for the purpose of extracting personal  gain or benefit.", "The Restructuring Act provided the Commissioner with sole discretion,  which he cannot delegate, to determine whether to take a personnel action  other than firing an employee (i.e., mitigation) for a section 1203 violation.  Such determination may not be appealed in any administrative or judicial  proceeding.", "The process for receiving, investigating, and adjudicating section 1203  allegations involves TIGTA and IRS. Under the section 1203 process,  revised in March 2002, TIGTA has primary responsibility for receiving and  investigating the allegations, except for those that IRS receives and  investigates. For example, IRS\u2019s Employee Tax Compliance (ETC) unit,  using a computer match, has primary responsibility for identifying and  investigating employee tax compliance issues. Also, IRS\u2019s Office of Equal  Employment Opportunity (EEO) is to analyze EEO settlement agreements,  findings of discrimination, and taxpayer complaints of discrimination to  identify whether a potential section 1203 civil rights violation exists. IRS  is responsible for adjudicating all section 1203 allegations that are  substantiated as violations.", "Generally, each allegation of a potential section 1203 violation must be  initially evaluated to determine whether it merits a full investigation. Then,  if an investigation of an allegation uncovers sufficient facts to substantiate  it (i.e., support a section 1203 violation), the employee is to be issued a  letter notifying him or her of the proposed firing from IRS. The employee  has a right to respond to the letter. Afterwards, if the deciding official  determines that the evidence sustains the alleged violation, a board  established by the IRS Commissioner must review the case to determine  whether a penalty less than firing is appropriate. If the board does not find  mitigation to be appropriate, the case is not submitted to the IRS  Commissioner and the employee is fired. If the board recommends  mitigation, the Commissioner must consider it. If the Commissioner  mitigates the penalty, other disciplinary actions, such as counseling,  admonishment, reprimand, or suspension may be applied. Details on the  process are provided in appendix V.", "According to IRS senior management, the misconduct addressed in  section 1203 has always been regarded as serious and subjected to  disciplinary action. Prior to the enactment of section 1203, the general  rules for imposing discipline required a deciding official to consider a wide  range of factors in arriving at the appropriate disciplinary action.  Enactment of section 1203 eliminated the variation in penalty for  substantiated misconduct, requiring the employee to be fired unless the  Commissioner mitigates that penalty.", "The IRS Commissioner has expressed concerns over the appropriateness  of the mandatory firing penalty, especially when an IRS employee had  already paid his or her tax liability or when the allegation involves just IRS  employees. To address the concerns, IRS, through the Department of the  Treasury, is seeking legislation to amend section 1203 by eliminating this  penalty for (1) the late filing of tax returns for which a refund is due and  (2) action by IRS employees that violate another employee\u2019s rights. In  addition, IRS requested that the Commissioner be able to use a range of  penalties aside from firing employees, for the types of misconduct under  section 1203. Further, because of the associated seriousness and  sensitivity over privacy issues, IRS also asked that the unauthorized  inspection of returns or return information be added to the list of  violations under section 1203."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To determine the number, type, and disposition of section 1203  allegations, we analyzed data from IRS\u2019s Automated Labor and Employee  Relations Tracking System (ALERTS) database as of September 30, 2002.

Those audit or  collection employees included revenue agents, revenue officers, tax  compliance officers, and tax auditors from IRS\u2019s Small Business and Self- Employed Division (SB/SE). We asked questions about their  understanding and perceptions of section 1203 and its impacts on their  jobs. We sent the survey to 455 eligible frontline enforcement employees,  of which 350 responded via regular mail, fax, or the Internet between July  and September 2002, for a response rate of 77 percent.

We  also interviewed IRS and TIGTA officials who are responsible for the  section 1203 process. In addition, we reviewed a study done by IRS,  TIGTA, and a private consulting firm to streamline the section 1203  process, and discussed the study with their officials. To understand the  process and gauge the length of time that section 1203 cases take to  process, we reviewed 92 of the 100 most recently closed cases as of  August 30, 2002, according to IRS\u2019s ALERTS database; in 5 cases, the files  could not be located for employees who retired or otherwise left IRS and   3 cases were duplicates.

The rest of the violations and related firings involved the  remaining 8 provisions, which deal with employee and taxpayer rights. IRS  officials said that the bulk of the violations and firings involved the two tax  compliance provisions of section 1203 because IRS has a systemic  computerized process to identify and evaluate potential employee tax  compliance issues. Further, according to officials, these issues generally  are more factually based and involve clearer indicators of misconduct.", "To understand why 3,093 investigated allegations were not substantiated,  we analyzed IRS data and talked with IRS officials. As shown in appendix  II, 800 of these investigated allegations were not substantiated as section  1203 violations but were substantiated as misconduct violations unrelated  to section 1203. Of those remaining, 1,549 involved allegations of  retaliation and harassment of a taxpayer, taxpayer representative, or IRS  employee. Although IRS had not done a systematic analysis, IRS officials  offered possible reasons why these investigated allegations could not be  substantiated as section 1203 violations. These officials said that many  were not credible.

Our survey results on employees\u2019 perceptions of changes in job behavior  are broadly correlated with actual declines in enforcement activities, such  as seizures. However, this broad correlation should be interpreted with  caution because employee perceptions do not necessarily demonstrate  causation and section 1203 is unlikely to be the only reason for the decline  in enforcement activity. Further, any changes in enforcement activity  could be positive or negative, depending on whether the activity was  merited.", "One job behavior that employees reported being affected by section 1203  was the time spent to do their work.

Further, IRS and TIGTA cannot determine how effectively they process  section 1203 allegations or whether future changes to the section 1203  process will be needed.", "During December 2002, IRS officials told us they plan to develop goals and  measures for evaluating all IRS disciplinary processes, including section  1203.

On the basis of our survey results, most IRS enforcement  employees do perceive that section 1203 has affected their behavior, such  as taking longer to work audit or collection cases and having some  reluctance to take enforcement actions. The survey results by themselves,  however, do not provide a basis for conclusions about whether section  1203 has worked or should be changed. On the one hand, their perceptions  about longer case times and a reluctance to take action are consistent with  the fear of section 1203 felt by many enforcement employees. On the other  hand, any increase in the amount of time to work cases also could result  from other impacts of section 1203 seen by employees, such as promoting  increased employee accountability and respect for taxpayer rights.  Moreover, policymakers might be willing to accept longer case times and  some fear of taking enforcement actions when merited if the tradeoff is  greater respect for taxpayer rights.", "One influence on how enforcement employees perceive section 1203 is the  IRS and TIGTA process for handling section 1203 allegations. However,  our survey found widespread distrust of the process. Further, IRS and  TIGTA recognized that problems with the section 1203 process were  affecting employee morale and productivity. Consequently, they  implemented a new process in March of 2002. Evaluation of the new  process is important because of the potential impact on IRS employees  and ultimately taxpayers. While too few section 1203 cases have been  closed under the new process for an evaluation to date, IRS and TIGTA  have not developed an evaluation approach. Any evaluation of  effectiveness would have to be based on results-oriented goals and related  performance measures. Developing an approach now would help ensure  timely collection of the needed data."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Acting Commissioner of Internal Revenue and the  Acting Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration coordinate on  an approach for evaluating the section 1203 process.

In general, IRS agreed with our  recommendation that a coordinated evaluation of the section 1203 process  is desirable, and TIGTA neither agreed nor disagreed with our  recommendation. However, both agencies raised a similar concern about  the independence of each agency. Specifically, IRS said that TIGTA\u2019s  independent role makes it inappropriate for IRS to oversee TIGTA\u2019s  performance. TIGTA pointed to legislative challenges in implementing our  recommendation because Restructuring Act amendments to the Inspector  General Act of 1978 created TIGTA as an independent agency with  autonomy from IRS.", "We recognize that IRS and TIGTA are independent agencies.  As noted in  our report, this independence is why IRS and TIGTA need to coordinate on  the evaluation.  In this sense, coordination does not mean that either  agency evaluate, oversee, or direct the other agency.  Rather, coordination  means that IRS and TIGTA officials communicate on how each agency will  develop goals, measures, and methods for collecting related data to better  ensure that the entire section 1203 process is evaluated, using consistent  and valid goals and measures.", "We do not believe that such coordination would jeopardize the  independence of TIGTA from IRS, particularly when IRS and TIGTA  already have been working together on managing and improving the  section 1203 process, as discussed in TIGTA\u2019s as well as IRS\u2019s comments.
