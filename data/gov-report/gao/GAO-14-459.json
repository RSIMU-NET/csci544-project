Coast Guard officials stated that they intend to conduct such an assessment in the future, but did not provide details to show how it would address cybersecurity. Until the Coast Guard completes a thorough assessment of cyber risks in the maritime environment, the ability of stakeholders to appropriately plan and allocate resources to protect ports and other maritime facilities will be limited.", "Maritime security plans required by law and regulation generally did not identify or address potential cyber-related threats or vulnerabilities. This was because the guidance issued by Coast Guard for developing these plans did not require cyber elements to be addressed. Officials stated that guidance for the next set of updated plans, due for update in 2014, will include cybersecurity requirements. However, in the absence of a comprehensive risk assessment, the revised guidance may not adequately address cyber-related risks to the maritime environment.", "The degree to which information-sharing mechanisms (e.g., councils) were active and shared cybersecurity-related information varied. Specifically, the Coast Guard established a government coordinating council to share information among government entities, but it is unclear to what extent this body has shared information related to cybersecurity. In addition, a sector coordinating council for sharing information among nonfederal stakeholders is no longer active, and the Coast Guard has not convinced stakeholders to reestablish it. Until the Coast Guard improves these mechanisms, maritime stakeholders in different locations are at greater risk of not being aware of, and thus not mitigating, cyber-based threats.", "Under a program to provide security-related grants to ports, FEMA identified enhancing cybersecurity capabilities as a funding priority for the first time in fiscal year 2013 and has provided guidance for cybersecurity-related proposals. However, the agency has not consulted cybersecurity-related subject matter experts to inform the multi-level review of cyber-related proposals\u2014partly because FEMA has downsized the expert panel that reviews grants. Also, because the Coast Guard has not assessed cyber-related risks in the maritime risk assessment, grant applicants and FEMA have not been able to use this information to inform funding proposals and decisions.

They stated that they fulfill the role of the ISAC through the use of  Homeport\u2014a publicly accessible and secure Internet portal that supports  port security functionality for operational use. According to the officials,  Homeport serves as the Coast Guard\u2019s primary communications tool to  support the sharing, collection, and dissemination of information of  various classification levels to maritime stakeholders. However, the Coast  Guard could not show the extent to which cyber-related information was  shared through the portal.", "Though the Coast Guard has established various mechanisms to  coordinate and share information among government entities at a national  level and between government and private stakeholders at the local level,  it has not facilitated the establishment of a national-level council, as  recommended by NIPP. The absence of a national-level sector  coordinating council increases the risk that critical infrastructure owners  and operators would not have a mechanism through which they can  identify, develop, and share information concerning effective  cybersecurity practices, such as cybersecurity working groups, risk  assessments, strategies, and plans. As a result, the Coast Guard would  not be aware of and thus not be able to mitigate cyber-based threats."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Port Security Grant Program Provides Some Guidance for Cybersecurity Grants but Has Not Taken Additional Steps to Help Ensure Risks are Addressed", "paragraphs": ["Under the Port Security Grant Program, FEMA has taken steps to  address cybersecurity in port areas by identifying enhancing  cybersecurity capabilities as a funding priority in fiscal years 2013 and  2014 and by providing general guidance regarding the types of  cybersecurity-related proposals eligible for funding. DHS annually  produces guidance that provides the funding amounts available under the  program for port areas and information about eligible applicants, the  application process, and funding priorities for that fiscal year, among  other things. Fiscal year 2013 and 2014 guidance stated that DHS  identified enhancing cybersecurity capabilities as one of the six priorities  for selection criteria for all grant proposals in these funding cycles.  FEMA program managers stated that FEMA added projects that aim to  enhance cybersecurity capabilities as a funding priority in response to the  issuance of Presidential Policy Directive 21 in February 2013.", "Specifically, the 2013 guidance stated that grant funds may be used to  invest in functions that support and enhance port-critical infrastructure  and key resources in both physical space and cyberspace under  Presidential Policy Directive 21. The 2014 guidance expanded on this  guidance to encourage applicants to propose projects to aid in the  implementation of the National Institute of Standards and Technology\u2019s  cybersecurity framework, established pursuant to Executive Order 13636,  and provides a hyperlink to additional information about the framework. In  addition, the guidance refers applicants to the just-established DHS  Critical Infrastructure Cyber Community Voluntary Program for resources  to assist critical infrastructure owners and operators in the adoption of the  framework and managing cyber risks.", "While these actions are positive steps towards addressing cybersecurity  in the port environment, FEMA has not consulted individuals with  cybersecurity-related subject matter expertise to assist with the review of  cybersecurity-related proposals. Program guidance states that grant  applications are to undergo a multi-level review for final selection, including a review by a National Review Panel, comprised of subject  matter experts drawn from the Departments of Homeland Security and  Transportation. However, according to FEMA program managers, the  fiscal year 2013 National Review Panel did not include subject matter  experts from DHS cybersecurity and critical infrastructure agencies\u2014such  as the DHS Office of Cybersecurity and Communications, the DHS Office  of Infrastructure Protection, or the Coast Guard\u2019s Cyber Command. As a  result, the National Review Panel had limited subject matter expertise to  evaluate and prioritize cybersecurity-related grant proposals for funding.", "Specifically, according to FEMA guidance, the proposal review and selection process  consists of three levels: an initial review, a field review, and a national-level review. During  the initial review, FEMA officials review grant proposals for completion. During the field  review, Coast Guard captains of the port, in coordination with officials of the Department  of Transportation\u2019s Maritime Administration, review and score proposals according to (1)  the degree to which a proposal addresses program goals, including enhancing  cybersecurity capabilities, and (2) the degree to which a proposal addresses one of the  area maritime security plan priorities (e.g., transportation security incident scenarios),  among other factors. The captains of the port provide a prioritized list of eligible projects  for funding within each port area to FEMA, which coordinates the national review process.", "In March 2014, FEMA program managers stated that cybersecurity  experts were not involved in the National Review Panel in part because  the panel has been downsized in recent years. For the future, the officials  stated that FEMA is considering revising the review process to identify  cybersecurity proposals early on in the review process in order to obtain  relevant experience and expertise from the Coast Guard and other  subject matter experts to inform proposal reviews. However, FEMA has  not documented this new process or its procedures for the Coast Guard  and FEMA officials at the field and national review levels to follow for the  fiscal year 2014 and future cycles.", "In addition, because the Coast Guard has not conducted a  comprehensive risk assessment for the maritime environment that  includes cyber-related threats, grant applicants and DHS officials have  not been able to use the results of such an assessment to inform their  grant proposals, project scoring, and risk-based funding decisions. MTSA  states that, in administering the program, national economic and strategic  defense concerns based on the most current risk assessments available  shall be taken into account. Further, according to MTSA, Port Security  Grant Program funding is to be used to address Coast Guard-identified  vulnerabilities, among other purposes. FEMA officials stated that the  agency considers port risk during the allocation and proposal review  stages of the program funding cycle. However, FEMA program  managers stated that the risk formula and risk-based analysis that FEMA  uses in the allocation and proposal review stages do not assess cyber  threats and vulnerabilities.", "Additionally, during the field-level review, captains of the port score grant  proposals according to (1) the degree to which a proposal addresses  program goals, including enhancing cybersecurity capabilities, and (2) the  degree to which a proposal addresses one of the area maritime security  plan priorities (e.g., transportation security incident scenarios), among  other factors. However, as Coast Guard officials stated, and our review of  area maritime security plans indicated, current area maritime security  plans generally contain very limited, if any, information about cyber- related threats. Further, a FEMA Port Security Grant Program section  chief stated that he was not aware of a risk assessment for the maritime  mode that discusses cyber-related threats, vulnerabilities, and potential  impact. Using the results of such a maritime risk assessment that fully  addresses cyber-related threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences,  which\u2014as discussed previously\u2014has not been conducted, to inform  program guidance could help grant applicants and reviewers more  effectively identify and select projects for funding that could enhance the  cybersecurity of the nation\u2019s maritime cyber infrastructure.", "Furthermore, FEMA has not developed or implemented outcome  measures to evaluate the effectiveness of the Port Security Grant  Program in achieving program goals, including enhancing cybersecurity  capabilities. As we reported in November 2011, FEMA had not evaluated  the effectiveness of the Port Security Grant Program in strengthening  critical maritime infrastructure because it had not implemented measures  to track progress toward achieving program goals. Therefore, we  recommended that FEMA\u2014in collaboration with the Coast Guard\u2014 develop time frames and related milestones for implementing  performance measures to monitor the effectiveness of the program. In  response, in February 2014 FEMA program managers stated that the  agency developed and implemented four management and administrative  measures in 2012 and two performance measures to track the amount of  funds invested in building and sustaining capabilities in 2013. According  to a FEMA program manager, FEMA did not design the two performance  measures to evaluate the effectiveness of the program in addressing  individual program goals, such as enhancing cybersecurity capabilities,  but to gauge the program\u2019s effectiveness in reducing overall maritime risk  in a port area based on program funding. While these measures can help  improve FEMA\u2019s management of the program by tracking how funds are  invested, they do not measure program outcomes.", "In addition, in February 2012, we found that FEMA had efforts under way  to develop outcome measures for the four national preparedness grant  programs, including the Port Security Grant Program, but that it had not  completed these efforts. Therefore, we recommended that FEMA revise  its plan in order to guide the timely completion of ongoing efforts to  develop and implement outcome-based performance measures for all  four grant programs. In January 2014, FEMA officials stated that they  believe that the implementation of project-based grant application tracking  and reporting functions within the Non-Disaster Grant Management  System will address our February 2012 recommendation that the agency  develop outcome measures to determine the effectiveness of the Port  Security Grant Program. However, the officials did not provide details  about how these functions will address the recommendation.", "While the development of the Non-Disaster Grant Management System is  a positive step toward improving the management and administration of  preparedness grants, FEMA officials stated that the deployment of these  system functions has been delayed due to budget reductions, and the  time frame for building the project-based applications and reporting  functions is fiscal year 2016. Therefore, it is too early to determine how  FEMA will use the system to evaluate the effectiveness of the Port  Security Grant Program. Until FEMA develops outcome measures to  evaluate the effectiveness of the program in meeting program goals, it  cannot provide reasonable assurance that funds invested in port security  grants, including those intended to enhance cybersecurity capabilities,  are strengthening critical maritime infrastructure\u2014including cyber-based  infrastructure\u2014against risks associated with potential terrorist attacks and  other incidents."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Federal Agencies Have Taken Actions to Address Cybersecurity in the Maritime Port Environment", "paragraphs": ["In addition to DHS, the 2010 Transportation Systems Sector-Specific Plan  identified the Departments of Commerce, Defense, Justice, and  Transportation as members of the Maritime Modal Government  Coordinating Council.
