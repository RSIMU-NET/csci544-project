Not having consistent policies for which system should be used to store OEHS data is contrary to federal standards for internal control. As a result, officials' efforts to store these data have resulted in both fragmentation and duplication, which GAO's prior work has shown may result in inefficiencies. Correspondingly, in some cases, similar types of unclassified OEHS data are being submitted to both MESL and DOEHRS, and in other cases, identical OEHS data are being submitted to both systems. However, neither system serves as a central repository for these data, and as a result, it is difficult to identify complete and comprehensive OEHS data sets, which may lead to problems when officials attempt to use these data in the future. Additionally, DOD's policy for OEHS data does not specifically address quality assurance. Consequently, some of the military services have developed their own guidance, resulting in inconsistent approaches and levels of effort, which has reduced DOD's ability to be confident that the data are sufficiently reliable. Federal standards for internal control state that management should continually monitor information captured and maintained for several factors, including reliability.", "The military services use site assessments to identify and address potential occupational and environmental health risks at a deployment site. These assessments may include recommended countermeasures, such as the use of personal protective equipment. However, the extent to which these recommendations are being implemented is unclear because U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM)\u2014the combatant command responsible for military operations in the geographic area that includes Iraq and Afghanistan\u2014does not require base commanders to document their decisions on implementing them. Officials also said they are not monitoring these recommendations, and instead rely on others to elevate concerns, as necessary. In contrast, DOD's policy for its safety and occupational health program requires the department's components, including the combatant commands, to ensure that risk management decisions are documented and reevaluated. Federal standards for internal control also note that appropriate documentation is a key internal control activity and that agencies should monitor their activities for managing identified risks.", "Both DOD and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) have used OEHS data to a limited extent to address post-deployment health conditions. For example, DOD officials said that the primary limitation with OEHS data collected during deployments continues to be the inability to capture exposure data at the individual servicemember level, although a method to do so is currently being explored. Additionally, DOD and VA use OEHS data to conduct research that may help determine service connections for post-deployment health conditions, but it has been difficult for researchers to establish a causal link between exposures and specific health conditions."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DOD clarify its policies for the storage and quality assurance of OEHS data, and require other related policies to be amended accordingly.

Despite this effort, attempts to research and  investigate whether post-deployment health conditions are the result of  military service continue to be hindered by a lack of sufficient OEHS data.  This is of particular concern because, as we previously reported in 2010,  some returning servicemembers and veterans have health concerns they  believe are related to their deployment, such as conditions related to  smoke inhalation from open-air burn pits\u2014used for waste disposal\u2014on  military bases in Iraq and Afghanistan. In an effort to better ascertain and  monitor the possible health effects related to burn pits, the Department of  Veterans Affairs (VA) established the Airborne Hazards and Open Burn  Pit Registry in June 2014 that allows eligible servicemembers and  veterans to document their exposures and report their health concerns.", "Establishing a service connection for health conditions is important  because federal law generally entitles veterans with service-connected  disabilities to VA\u2019s disability compensation benefits. However, as we  have previously reported, establishing a relationship between  occupational and environmental exposures and health issues can be  difficult. For example, despite servicemembers\u2019 and veterans\u2019 reports of  health concerns related to smoke inhalation from burn pits in Iraq and  Afghanistan, the Institute of Medicine was unable to determine whether  long-term health effects are likely to result from this exposure due to  limited or inadequate evidence of an association.

Additionally, we recommended that DOD establish and implement  procedures to evaluate the effectiveness of risk management efforts, and  that DOD and VA work together to develop a federal research plan to  address the long-term health effects of these deployments. DOD  developed cross-service guidance in 2007, but did not implement the  other recommendations, although it partially concurred with them.

We reviewed the  numbers and types of OEHS data entries in each system to better  understand how OEHS data are being stored. We also interviewed DOD  and military service officials about their practices for storing and reviewing  OEHS data.

As part of  this study, DOD and VA conducted another study that found that, among other things, a  servicemember located within 3 miles of a documented burn pit was not significantly  associated with increased risk for respiratory symptoms or conditions compared to those  servicemembers located greater than 3 miles from a burn pit. See Smith et al., \u201cThe  Effects of Exposure to Documented Open-Air Burn Pits on Respiratory Health Among  Deployers of the Millennium Cohort,\u201d Journal of Environmental Medicine, vol. 54, no. 6  (2012): 708-716. deployment to Iraq and Kuwait and the development of respiratory  conditions post-deployment. However, neither study was able to identify  a causal link between exposures to burn pits and respiratory conditions.  Additionally, in its 2011 report, the Institute of Medicine was unable to  determine whether certain long-term health effects are likely to result from  exposure to burn pits during deployments because the studies it reviewed  lacked the support to conclude the absence or existence of an  association. As a result, it recommended that additional studies of  health effects in veterans deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan were needed.  Both VA and DOD have begun additional research as a result of this  recommendation.", "Since 2003, DOD and VA have collaborated through the DHWG on  deployment health issues related to occupational and environmental  hazards. For example, the DHWG sponsored an initiative related to  DOD\u2019s work on the individual longitudinal exposure record (ILER), the  intention of which is to provide linkages between different types of data\u2014 environmental monitoring, biomarkers of exposure, and troop locations  and activity\u2014and an individual\u2019s medical records. As a result, the ILER  would create a complete record of servicemembers\u2019 exposures over the  course of their careers, which could support disability benefits claims, as  well as retrospective studies. In April and May 2014, DOD outlined the  users of the data, the sources of the data, guidance on developing a  system to meet the needs of those who would use an ILER, and its  intended functions. DOD officials told us that the project is currently in the  second phase of its pilot program, and they are 6 to 8 years away from  completing its development.", "In 2013, the DHWG helped develop a data transfer agreement that was  intended to facilitate the exchange of data identified to assist both  departments in several ways, including making clinical decisions for  care. One aspect of the agreement specifies that DOD is to transfer to  VA lists of servicemembers or veterans determined by DOD to have had  an actual or potential environmental, occupational, or military-related  exposure that has the potential for adverse long-term health effects.  According to VA officials, DOD has not been proactively providing these  lists. However, a VA official told us that the department considers all  deployed servicemembers to have had potential exposures, and as a  result, they have been requesting lists of all servicemembers deployed to  an area with a burn pit. Further, VA officials said that when they learn of  an exposure incident and request data, DOD has generally fulfilled that  request. In addition, VA officials told us that DOD sends data on  servicemembers\u2019 and veterans\u2019 deployment status as requested by VA to  verify eligibility of those who have signed up for its Burn Pit Registry.", "In August 2014, DOD officials established the Exposure Related Data  Transfer Agreement Subgroup to improve the department\u2019s efforts in  proactively meeting the data transfer requirements. Specifically, the  workgroup met in January 2015 to finalize its objectives, which are to  determine the appropriateness and timeliness of sharing specific  exposure-related data and information with VA and to develop  recommendations for any medically relevant follow-up actions for  servicemembers or veterans exposed to occupational and environmental  health hazards. DOD officials did not have a time frame for when this  work would be completed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["In the wake of veterans\u2019 unexplained illnesses such as from the Persian  Gulf War, the collection of OEHS data has become increasingly important  because of its critical role in helping to identify exposures and determine  the causes of post-deployment health issues. Servicemembers deployed  to Iraq and Afghanistan have continued to express concerns about health  conditions they attribute to exposures during their deployment, and their  eligibility to obtain certain benefits is based on whether these conditions  can be connected to their military service. However, problems with the  storage and quality assurance for OEHS data compromise the  departments\u2019 ability to use them in determining service-connections for  specific health conditions, or in conducting other important research.  Specifically, fragmentation and duplication in the storage of unclassified  OEHS data\u2014due to inconsistent policies across DOD and the military  services\u2014hinder the use of these data, as there is no single repository  from which to retrieve them. Moreover, the reliability of OEHS data is also  potentially problematic as the military services have developed varying  approaches for quality assurance reviews in the absence of departmental  guidance. Of additional concern, DOD does not know the extent to which  recommended countermeasures for mitigating exposures to occupational  and environmental health hazards are being implemented at deployment  sites because CENTCOM does not require the documentation of these  decisions. Consequently, CENTCOM and its subordinate commands\u2014 USARCENT and U.S. Forces-Afghanistan\u2014do not proactively monitor  the extent to which base commanders are mitigating potential health risks  in Iraq or Afghanistan. The approach instead is to wait for concerns to be  elevated\u2014potentially putting servicemembers at risk for harmful  exposures. While the health and well-being of our servicemembers and  veterans is paramount, DOD\u2019s and VA\u2019s ability to prevent, diagnose, and  study post-deployment health conditions is compromised without  accessible and reliable information about risk mitigation activities and  OEHS data."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To eliminate the fragmentation and duplication in the storage of  unclassified OEHS data we recommend that the Secretary of Defense  determine which IT system\u2014DOEHRS or MESL\u2014should be used to  store specific types of unclassified OEHS data, clarify the department\u2019s  policy accordingly, and require all other departmental and military-service- specific policies to be likewise amended and implemented to ensure  consistency.", "To ensure the reliability of OEHS data, we recommend that the Secretary  of Defense establish clear policies and procedures for performing quality  assurance reviews of the OEHS data collected during deployment, to  include verifying the completeness and the reasonableness of these data,  and require that all other related military-service-specific policies be  amended and implemented to ensure consistency.", "To ensure that potential occupational and environmental health risks are  mitigated for servicemembers deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan, we  recommend that the Secretary of Defense require CENTCOM to revise its  policy to ensure that base commanders\u2019 decisions on whether to  implement risk mitigation recommendations identified in OEHSAs are  adequately documented and consistently monitored by the appropriate  command."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We requested comments on a draft of this report from DOD and VA. Both  departments provided written comments that are reprinted in appendixes I  and II. DOD also provided technical comments that we incorporated as  appropriate.", "In commenting on this draft, DOD concurred with all of our  recommendations, and VA generally agreed with our conclusions. DOD  also provided the following responses to each of our recommendations:  In responding to the first recommendation to clarify the department\u2019s  policy on which IT system (DOEHRS or MESL) should be used to  store specific types of unclassified OEHS data, DOD noted that it will  clarify DOD Instruction 6490.03 in a subsequent revision and will  issue appropriate guidance on the use of DOEHRS and MESL. DOD  also noted that we identified fragmentation and duplication, but that  our only evidence was the use of two systems to store data. However,  our evidence of fragmentation and duplication was based on the  storage of OEHS data, which results from the inconsistent use of two  systems. Specifically, as stated in our report, in some cases, similar  types of unclassified OEHS data have been submitted to both MESL  and DOEHRS, which would result in fragmentation of data storage. In  other cases, identical OEHS data has been submitted to both  systems, resulting in duplicate data storage.", "Additionally, in response to our recommendation that DOD require all  other departmental and military-service-specific policies to be likewise  amended, DOD stated that once a new policy is published, the entire  department, including the military services, revises related policies  accordingly. As stated in our report, the other departmental and  military service policies that are linked to the main DOD Instruction  are inconsistent in identifying which system to use for storing OEHS  data. Therefore, we believe that it is important for the department to  ensure that the appropriate revisions are made to all related policies.", "In responding to the second recommendation to establish clear  policies and procedures for performing quality assurance reviews of  OEHS data collected during deployment, DOD noted that the  implementation of such a process would be complex, in that it would  need to include definitions of completeness and reasonableness,  among other items. DOD also noted this would require additional  resources. While we appreciate DOD\u2019s comments, an appropriate  level of quality assurance needs to be performed to ensure the  reliability of the OEHS data being collected. Otherwise, these data will  not be useful for the intended purposes.", "In responding to the third recommendation to require CENTCOM to  revise its policy to ensure that base commanders' decisions on  whether to implement risk-mitigation recommendations are  documented and consistently monitored, DOD noted that DOD  Instruction 6055.01 already requires this. Specifically, DOD noted that  the Instruction requires that the DOD Components must establish  procedures to ensure these decisions are documented, archived, and  reevaluated on a recurring basis. However, as stated in our report,  current CENTCOM policy does not require documentation of risk- mitigation decisions, as is required by DOD Instruction 6055.01.  Further, CENTCOM officials told us that they are not monitoring the  implementation of these recommendations. Therefore, we continue to  believe that CENTCOM should revise its policy to align with  Instruction 6055.01.", "As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.
