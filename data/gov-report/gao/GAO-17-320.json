Four of these institutes were established prior to enactment of the Revitalize American Manufacturing and Innovation Act of 2014 (RAMI Act), which requires Commerce to establish a network of institutes for manufacturing innovation. Since 2014, the network\u2014called the Manufacturing USA network\u2014has grown as DOD, DOE, and Commerce have established seven more institutes, and Commerce, DOD, and DOE plan to sponsor up to four more institutes. Each institute is a public-private partnership between the sponsoring federal agency and a nonfederal entity in charge of operations, with the nonfederal entity matching or exceeding the federal financial assistance. GAO's analysis of institute membership from May through September 2016 shows that about 780 members had joined the seven institutes that were operating during GAO's review (i.e., supporting research projects in their technology focus areas). Members receive a variety of benefits, such as access to intellectual property and networking opportunities.", "Commerce, DOD, and DOE worked together to develop initial performance measures to track progress toward the Manufacturing USA program's statutory purposes. Additionally, DOD, working with Commerce and DOE, hired a consultant to review the Manufacturing USA program. The consultant's January 2017 report included recommendations on revised measures to track program progress. After considering the results of this review, Commerce plans to work with DOD and DOE to reach agreement on a revised set of measures. While Commerce may face challenges with assessing the program, such as the timeframe over which results may need to be measured, it has taken steps or has identified options to address these challenges.", "Commerce has used a variety of mechanisms to coordinate the Manufacturing USA program. These mechanisms incorporate several key practices GAO has identified for enhancing and sustaining interagency collaboration. However, GAO found that the process used to develop a governance system that outlines agencies' responsibilities for contributing to the program did not include all relevant non-sponsoring agencies (agencies that do not sponsor institutes), or ensure that their roles and responsibilities for contributing to the program are fully identified. Specifically, non-sponsoring agencies, such as the Department of Labor (DOL)\u2014which administers discretionary grant programs that can help increase the number of skilled workers in advanced manufacturing\u2014were not actively involved in developing the governance system. Additionally, the governance system does not specify any responsibility for non-sponsoring agencies to provide information or expertise related to their activities to the program. A Commerce official told GAO that the governance system is subject to revision, but participation in the program is up to each agency. However, including all relevant agencies in the process of revising the system and fully identifying non-sponsoring agencies' roles and responsibilities could strengthen Commerce's efforts to leverage and coordinate agencies' contributions to the program, consistent with key practices for interagency collaboration."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that Commerce work with all relevant federal agencies to fully identify roles and responsibilities for how agencies that do not sponsor institutes could contribute to the Manufacturing USA program.

However, according to a June 2011 report from the President\u2019s  Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST), the share of  U.S. economic activity from the manufacturing sector has declined over  several decades, and the U.S. trade balance in advanced technology  products, which was long a relative strength of the United States, shifted  from a surplus to a deficit starting in 2001. The report also stated that the  United States has been steadily losing the research and development  activities linked to manufacturing\u2014along with associated high-skilled  jobs\u2014to other nations, as well as losing the competitiveness to  manufacture products invented in the United States.", "Beginning with its 2011 report, PCAST issued a series of reports that  recommended a number of steps to increase U.S. competitiveness in  advanced manufacturing\u2014that is, manufacturing that uses innovative  technology to improve products or processes. PCAST\u2019s  recommendations included that the federal government establish a  national network of manufacturing innovation institutes as public-private  partnerships to create a manufacturing research infrastructure to help  bridge the gap between research and development activities and  domestic production. In 2012, at the request of the President and using  existing statutory authorities, the Department of Defense (DOD)  established a pilot manufacturing innovation institute with co-funding and  participation from the Department of Energy (DOE) and other agencies.  This pilot institute focused on additive manufacturing technology. In  2012, the President set forth a goal of establishing a network of up to 15  institutes. Also, in 2013, the National Science and Technology Council  released a report outlining a preliminary design for the national network,  citing the pilot manufacturing innovation institute as a benchmark for other  institutes. Subsequently, using their existing statutory authorities, DOD  and DOE established additional institutes, each with its own technological  focus.", "In December 2014, Congress passed, and the President signed into law,  the Revitalize American Manufacturing and Innovation Act of 2014 (RAMI  Act). Among other things, the RAMI Act requires the Secretary of  Commerce to establish a program within the Department of Commerce\u2019s  (Commerce) National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST); the  act refers to this program as the Network for Manufacturing Innovation  program. In September 2016, the Secretary of Commerce announced a  new public name for the program, Manufacturing USA; we use this name  for the program in this report. According to the RAMI Act, the purposes  of the program include stimulating U.S. leadership in advanced  manufacturing research, innovation, and technology; accelerating  development of an advanced manufacturing workforce; and creating and  preserving jobs. The RAMI Act requires the Secretary of Commerce to  establish, within NIST, a national program office to oversee and carry out  the program; this office is known as the Advanced Manufacturing National  Program Office (AMNPO). The RAMI Act specifies a number of functions  for the national program office, such as establishing procedures,  processes, and criteria as may be necessary and appropriate to maximize  cooperation and to coordinate the activities of the program with programs  and activities of other federal agencies whose missions contribute to or  are affected by advanced manufacturing.", "As part of the program, the RAMI Act requires the Secretary of  Commerce to establish a network of centers for manufacturing innovation  (which we refer to as the Manufacturing USA network). There are two  types of centers (which we refer to as Manufacturing USA institutes):  those that receive financial assistance from Commerce under the RAMI  Act and those that do not. Institutes that do not receive financial  assistance from Commerce pursuant to the RAMI Act either (1) are  considered institutes by the act because they were in existence and  formally recognized pursuant to law or executive action as manufacturing  innovation centers before the law\u2019s enactment or (2) are recognized by  the Secretary of Commerce, at the institute\u2019s request, as an institute for  manufacturing innovation for purposes of participating in the network and  are substantially similar to those established by Commerce under the act.  For example, under the RAMI Act the National Additive Manufacturing  Innovation Institute is considered an institute and the Secretary of  Commerce has recognized institutes established by DOD and DOE  pursuant to their statutory authority as part of the network. Each institute  is a public-private partnership between the sponsoring federal agency  and a nonfederal entity (generally a nonprofit organization or university) in  charge of the institute\u2019s operations.

The act requires that each assessment include, among other  things, a review of the management, coordination, and industry utility of  the program and an assessment of the extent to which the program has  furthered the purposes described in the RAMI Act. This is our first report  on this program in response to the statutory provision. This report  examines (1) the status of establishing the Manufacturing USA network  and the extent to which manufacturers and other entities have used the  institutes; (2) how federal agencies manage the Manufacturing USA  institutes and what challenges, if any, have been encountered to date; (3)  the extent to which performance measures are in place to help  Commerce assess progress toward achieving the statutory purposes of  the program; and (4) the extent to which Commerce has taken steps to  coordinate the efforts of agencies that contribute to the Manufacturing  USA program.", "To obtain information on Manufacturing USA institute status, use,  management, performance measures, and coordination, we reviewed  Manufacturing USA program and institute documentation, including the  cooperative agreements establishing the institutes; these agreements  include amounts of federal and nonfederal financial assistance. We also  interviewed Commerce, DOD, and DOE officials to obtain information  about the institutes their agencies sponsor. In addition, we asked  Manufacturing USA institute officials to respond to a structured set of  questions related to their institute\u2019s (1) structure and funding; (2) industry  use and data collection; (3) management, coordination, and challenges;  and (4) program assessment; among other questions. We analyzed  membership data provided by institute officials to obtain information on  membership participation by manufacturers and other entities. We relied  on institute officials to determine which of their members were from small  or large manufacturers because there is no agreed-upon definition for  manufacturers in each of these categories. We obtained information on  membership levels, benefits, and rights from institute documentation and  websites and verified its accuracy with institute officials.", "We also held three discussion groups with 19 representatives of institute  members to obtain their perspectives on various issues, such as how  their organizations benefited from membership in a Manufacturing USA  institute, and challenges related to institute operations. We held one  group for small manufacturers comprised of four institute member  representatives; one group for large manufacturers comprised of eight  representatives; and one group for academic and nonprofit organizations  comprised of seven representatives.

One of the  recommendations was to establish a national network of manufacturing  innovation institutes as public-private partnerships. After DOD established  the first such institute as a pilot institute in 2012, the National Science and  Technology Council released its January 2013 report proposing a  preliminary design for the network. This report envisioned a network of  public-private partnerships to be supported with a co-investment of  federal obligations ranging from $70 million to $120 million for each  institute and equal or greater amounts in nonfederal pledges (also known  as cost-share). The amount of investment would depend on such factors  as the magnitude of the opportunity and maturity of the technology and  would be distributed across 5 to 7 years. Total capitalization of an institute  across this time period was envisioned to be $140 million to $240 million.  The report also envisioned that an institute would become sustainable  within 7 years of the public announcement of an award of financial  resources to start up and operate the institute, and that the institute would  provide long-term economic impact in its region and nationwide. Building  on the July 2012 Advanced Manufacturing Partnership report, an October  2014 PCAST report provided 12 recommendations with further guidance  on how the United States could sustain its lead in innovation.

For project agreements, there are challenges in  negotiating the terms and conditions of the agreements and with the  amount of time it takes for sub-recipients and sponsoring agencies to  review and approve the agreements. Some institutes have taken  steps to address these challenges. For example, one DOD institute  used language from another DOD institute\u2019s membership agreement  to avoid schedule delays that could result from developing its own. In  addition, one DOD institute has increased the amount of time  allocated for the development of project agreements.", "Meeting cost-share requirements. Representatives of two academic  institutions and two small manufacturers expressed concerns about  cost-share requirements for institute participation. For example, one  representative said universities are not capable of providing the  amount of cash some institutes require under their membership  agreements, and another representative said it is a challenge for  small manufacturers to participate in some institutes because of the  cost-share requirements. However, according to an institute official,  the possibility of providing in-kind contributions could help some small  manufacturers and other organizations address these concerns.", "Ensuring institute sustainability.

Some DOD institute officials said that  the cooperative agreements require them to carry out activities  that do not contribute to sustainability. For example, a senior  official from one DOD institute said that education and workforce  development activities are required as a project component under  the institute\u2019s cooperative agreement, but these activities make  only a minor contribution to the institute\u2019s sustainability.", "Institute officials identified several options for how they might address  sustainability challenges. For example, officials from one DOD institute  said they will base their decision about which type of activities to fund,  after federal financial assistance ends, on which ones help make the  institute sustainable as well as on the availability of funds from nonfederal  sources. Similarly, another DOD institute official said that the institute  may stop funding education and workforce development activities after  federal financial assistance under the cooperative agreement ends.

In January 2017, the external  consultant reported on the results of its review. Among other  recommendations, the report recommended developing measures to  evaluate Manufacturing USA program performance using a phased  approach. For example, the report recommended developing measures at  the program level for two phases:  1.  start-up support and shared services provision (i.e., the phase in  which the program provides support to individual institutes in their  establishment and delivers services applicable to all the institutes);  and  2.  long-term outcomes (i.e., the phase in which the program tracks the  achievement of program goals on a manufacturing sector-wide and  national basis).", "AMNPO officials told us that they plan to incorporate the results of this  review into a set of revised performance measures.

First, institute officials told  us that some of the program\u2019s statutory purposes are difficult to measure.  In particular, some institute officials told us that measuring the number of  jobs created or preserved may not be feasible because, for example,  there are challenges with associating the number of jobs created and  preserved directly to an institute\u2019s activities. Second, several institute  officials also said that the timeline associated with measuring progress  toward achieving the program\u2019s statutory purposes may be too short. For  example, institutes are relatively new and generally still in the process of  establishing mechanisms to collect meaningful data related to many of  the program purposes. Further, measuring economic impact and job  creation, for example, requires performance measures with lagging  indicators that will not be measurable until years into the future, according  to institute officials. AMNPO officials told us that they tried to address  these challenges in the first Manufacturing USA program annual report by  including information on some leading indicators of success among  institutes that had available data, such as the level of involvement by  industry and academia and amount of cost-share. Also, as mentioned  above, AMNPO officials plan to incorporate the results of the recent  external consultant review, which recommended developing measures  that assess progress during the program\u2019s initial start-up phase in  addition to long-term outcome measures.

Institutes  currently track and report information required by their sponsoring agency  and cooperative agreements. Under the DOE cooperative agreements we  reviewed, financial assistance recipients are to continue to report annually  for five years beyond the project period on the utilization and impact of  the institute and technical progress in implementing and deploying the  technologies on the institute\u2019s roadmap. Conversely, DOD officials told  us the cooperative agreements the agency entered into before December  2016 do not require their institutes to continue to report on performance  after the agreements\u2019 period of performance ends. According to AMNPO  officials, one way to continue collecting this information is for institutes to  voluntarily continue providing performance information to federal  agencies, including Commerce. However, in the absence of ongoing  federal financial support from their funding agencies for the efforts and  expense of collecting and providing data, the officials said that institutes  may be reluctant to continue reporting on performance. AMNPO officials  told us of another option to ensure continued performance reporting but  said that they did not have plans in place to use it. Specifically, the  officials said the Secretary of Commerce could establish a requirement  for institutes funded by other agencies to submit performance reports to  Commerce after their cooperative agreements end as a condition of their  continued network participation because the Secretary has the statutory  authority to recognize those institutes for the purpose of participating in  the network.

These mechanisms incorporate several key practices for  enhancing and sustaining interagency collaboration. As our prior work  has found, an interagency mechanism for collaboration is any  arrangement or application that can facilitate collaboration between  agencies. One of these mechanisms is the December 2016  Manufacturing USA network charter. The charter says that AMNPO is  responsible for supporting network functions, which include establishing  the network; facilitating intra-network collaboration; fostering robust  communication between the network and external stakeholders; and  sustaining, strengthening, and growing the network. The charter also  identifies several subfunctions for each of these functions. For example,  the facilitating intra-network collaboration function includes, among other  subfunctions, establishing forums for network collaboration, information  exchange, and knowledge management; facilitating the organization and  sharing of lessons learned and best practices across the network; and  facilitating network-level discussions among institutes regarding  management of technology interfaces and technology gaps.", "Another mechanism that AMNPO has developed is the Manufacturing  USA strategic plan. AMNPO collaborated with federal agencies that  contribute to the Manufacturing USA program to develop the strategic  plan; these agencies included the Department of Agriculture, Commerce,  DOD, Education, DOE, the National Aeronautics and Space  Administration, and the National Science Foundation. According to the  strategic plan, agencies and institutes participating in the Manufacturing  USA program collectively work toward achieving program goals. For  example, to work toward the program goal of accelerating the  development of an advanced manufacturing workforce, the strategic plan  states that the network can help institutes navigate opportunities for  federal financial assistance that could support their efforts, including  workforce development programs such as those authorized by the  Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, as amended. AMNPO  officials told us that AMNPO has an ongoing effort to help institutes  navigate such opportunities. The strategic plan also identified other  opportunities for the network to enhance coordination across agencies  that contribute to the Manufacturing USA program, such as by serving as  a clearinghouse for information about workforce support.", "AMNPO also uses mechanisms such as hosting teleconferences,  convening in-person meetings, and using technologies that allow it to  collaborate with representatives of different agencies and institutes. For  example, according to AMNPO officials, AMNPO hosts monthly  teleconferences with directors from DOD and DOE institutes and senior  deputies from DOD and DOE and convenes in-person, semi-annual  Manufacturing USA network meetings that include institute and agency  staff. For instance, an August 2016 Manufacturing USA network meeting  included discussions on a public name for the program, communications,  and establishing a Directors Council. According to AMNPO officials, the  Manufacturing USA Directors Council will further facilitate cooperation  and collaboration among the institutes. The officials said AMNPO has  hosted other meetings, such as a workforce development workshop that  included workforce leaders from all institutes; subject matter experts;  Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership center officials; and agency  officials from Education, the National Science Foundation, Commerce,  DOD, and DOE. AMNPO also recently launched a web-based shared  services platform that allows institutes to share best practices and that  allows agencies that participate in the Manufacturing USA network to  share information with the institutes. AMNPO officials told us they are  working with the institutes to provide content for this system and expect to  continue working with them to ensure information is current and useful.", "A further coordination mechanism is a governance system that defines  roles and responsibilities for agencies contributing to the Manufacturing  USA program. According to Commerce, the process for developing the  October 2015 governance system document for the Manufacturing USA  network was initiated by the National Science and Technology Council\u2019s  Subcommittee on Advanced Manufacturing, and represented a joint effort  between Commerce, DOD, and DOE. The governance system identifies  the Manufacturing USA network functions and subfunctions for which  agencies that sponsor Manufacturing USA institutes, as well as those that  do not sponsor institutes (non-sponsoring agencies), are responsible,  accountable, informed, and consulted. For example, under the  governance system, as part of the facilitating intra-network collaboration  function, AMNPO and the agencies that sponsor institutes are  responsible for providing situational awareness to individual institutes  regarding key contextual landscape issues, such as industrial  developments. Alternatively, as part of the function to sustain, strengthen,  and grow the network, AMNPO and the agencies that sponsor institutes  are responsible for identifying and helping to establish long-term  nonfinancial support mechanisms for the program, which the governance  document notes should provide valuable nonfinancial support to help  institutes succeed and thrive. Non-sponsoring agencies are responsible  for one general function: promoting advanced manufacturing to a variety  of external stakeholders such as Congress to raise awareness about the  Manufacturing USA institutes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Process for Developing the Governance System Did Not Include All Relevant Non-sponsoring Agencies or Ensure That Their Roles and Responsibilities Are Fully Identified", "paragraphs": ["Although the governance system was developed by an interagency team,  the process used to develop the governance system did not ensure that  all relevant non-sponsoring agencies were included or that their roles and  responsibilities for contributing to the Manufacturing USA program were  fully identified.", "Specifically, the process used to develop the governance system did not  include working with all relevant agencies that could contribute to the  Manufacturing USA program. As described above, agencies that  contributed to the development of the governance system included  Commerce, DOD, and DOE. An AMNPO official told us that non- sponsoring agencies had an opportunity to comment on the governance  system but were not involved in its development. According to  Commerce, only the institute-sponsoring agencies were involved in  developing the governance system because the governance document  was chartered by the National Science and Technology Council as a  reference for how Manufacturing USA institutes are to be involved in the  network. Thus, non-sponsoring agencies, such as DOL the National  Science Foundation, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration,  and the Department of Homeland Security, among others, were not  involved in developing the governance system despite having missions  that contribute to or are affected by advanced manufacturing. For  example, DOL\u2019s mission is to foster, promote, and develop the welfare of  the wage earners, job seekers, and retirees of the United States; improve  working conditions; advance opportunities for profitable employment; and  assure work-related benefits and rights. In support of this mission, DOL is  a member of the National Science and Technology Council\u2019s  Subcommittee on Advanced Manufacturing, according to the  subcommittee\u2019s charter, and DOL has created resources to assist with  the development of programs that support secondary to post-secondary  career pathways related to advanced manufacturing. The governance  system itself does not specify which non-sponsoring agencies are  responsible for contributing to the Manufacturing USA program; rather, it  broadly identifies non-sponsoring agencies as agencies not acting in a  lead funding role and that are providing other types of support to an  institute in the network.", "Furthermore, in developing the governance system, the process  Commerce, DOD, and DOE used did not include fully identifying how  non-sponsoring agencies could contribute to the Manufacturing USA  program. For example, the governance system does not specify any  responsibility for non-sponsoring agencies to provide information or  expertise related to their activities to the program. Rather, where the  governance system indicates a role for non-sponsoring agencies, it  generally indicates that such agencies are to be informed and  consulted. However, some non-sponsoring agencies may be  implementing programs or other activities that could contribute to the  Manufacturing USA program. For example, DOL administers workforce  development programs that are carried out by state agencies and local  workforce development boards. According to DOL officials, state  workforce development boards could work with Manufacturing USA  institutes to develop sector partnership strategies, which help employers  in an industry address shared goals and hiring needs. In addition, DOL  administers discretionary grant programs, which can help increase the  number of skilled workers in advanced manufacturing. Financial  assistance provided under these discretionary grant programs is being  used to support some Manufacturing USA institutes\u2019 education and  workforce development activities, including:", "The Trade Adjustment Assistance Community College and Career  Training grant program, which provided nearly $2 billion to strengthen  manufacturing programs at community colleges; and", "The American Apprenticeship Initiative grant program, which will  provide $175 million to train and hire 34,000 new apprentices in  advanced manufacturing over the next five years.", "Information or expertise related to other agencies\u2019 programs, such as  these, if provided to AMNPO, could help it support the institutes with  navigating opportunities for federal financial assistance.", "Our work has shown that collaborative mechanisms, such as the  Manufacturing USA program\u2019s governance system, benefit from certain  key features, including the clarity of roles and responsibilities and  ensuring that the relevant participants are included in the collaborative  effort. Specifically, key collaboration practices call for clarifying the roles  and responsibilities of all participating agencies and determining whether  all relevant participants have been included. By agreeing on and clearly  defining the roles and responsibilities of their members as well as  documenting decisions, such as in a memorandum of understanding,  collaborating agencies can clarify which agency will do what, organize  their joint and individual efforts, and facilitate decision making. Moreover,  the RAMI Act identifies several AMNPO functions pertaining to  coordination, such as establishing procedures, processes, and criteria as  may be necessary and appropriate to maximize cooperation and  coordinate the activities of the Manufacturing USA program with the  programs and activities of other federal departments and agencies whose  missions contribute to or are affected by advanced manufacturing.", "An AMNPO official acknowledged that the governance system will require  revision as the network evolves. The official said that in revising the  system, AMNPO will work with sponsoring agencies to further define roles  and responsibilities. However, the official said that other agencies  participate in the program as it aligns with their respective missions and  AMNPO cannot prescribe functions and subfunctions for other federal  agencies participating in the Manufacturing USA network. However,  without ensuring that all relevant agencies have been included in the  process of developing the governance system and that non-sponsoring  agencies\u2019 roles and responsibilities have been fully identified, AMNPO  may miss opportunities to leverage and coordinate the efforts of non- sponsoring agencies in contributing to the Manufacturing USA program  consistent with key practices for interagency collaboration and effective  implementation of AMNPO\u2019s functions under the RAMI Act."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["In an effort to revitalize the U.S. manufacturing sector and increase U.S.  competitiveness in advanced manufacturing, Congress passed and the  President signed into law the RAMI Act, which requires the Secretary of  Commerce to establish a network of institutes for manufacturing  innovation, among other things.

We recognize that Commerce has no  authority to coordinate other agencies\u2019 programs, to manage the  institutes that they sponsor, or to compel agency participation in the  program. We believe that our report correctly characterizes improved  coordination as a collaborative effort between Commerce and other  agencies. The focus of the recommendation in our draft report was  not for NIST to compel agency participation or unilaterally define their  roles and responsibilities but rather for NIST to work with non- sponsoring agencies in an interagency collaborative effort to identify  their roles and responsibilities.

While our report provides more detailed information on  several DOL programs and activities that could potentially contribute  to the Manufacturing USA program (relative to other non-sponsoring  agencies), we provide this information as illustrative examples.  Because we believe collaboration on Manufacturing USA network  governance roles and responsibilities should include all relevant non- sponsoring agencies, we did not adjust our recommendation to  specifically focus on DOL or Education.", "Commerce also noted that the first generation of the Manufacturing  USA governance system was focused on how institutes would work  with the network and program, so the responsible entities that  developed it were limited to Commerce, DOD, and DOE. Commerce  further stated that our recommendation speaks to a next generation of  the Manufacturing USA governance with a broader scope. We  modified our report to more clearly reflect that Commerce, DOD, and  DOE were the agencies initially involved in developing the  governance system as chartered by the National Science and  Technology Council. However, we do not believe the scope of the  governance system as evidenced by documentation provided to us  during our review is substantially different than that envisioned by our  recommendation.
