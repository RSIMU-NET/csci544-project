Closing a contract includes tasks such as verifying that the goods and services were provided and making final payment to the contractor. Closing contracts within required time frames can limit the government\u0092s exposure to certain financial risks. One reason why some contracts are not being closed is the large backlog of incurred cost audits that must first be completed. These audits, conducted by DCAA, ensure that the costs contractors have incurred are permissible under government regulations.", "The Senate Armed Services Committee report accompanying the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 directed GAO to review the criteria and procedures for conducting incurred cost audits, among other things. In response, GAO assessed (1) efforts to reduce the backlog of incurred cost audits and (2) the challenges DOD faces in addressing the contract closeout backlog.

Incurred cost audits are conducted on a contractor's annual proposal that includes all costs incurred on certain types of contracts in that fiscal year. Under the initiative, DCAA raised the dollar threshold that triggers an automatic audit on a contractor's incurred cost proposal from $15 million to $250 million, revised the criteria used to determine a proposal's risk level, and significantly reduced the number of low risk audits that will be randomly sampled. This initiative appears promising, and DCAA plans to track certain characteristics, such as the number of risk determinations made and audits completed. But DCAA has not fully developed the measures by which it will assess whether the initiative reduces the backlog in a manner that protects the taxpayers' interests. Specifically, DCAA does not have a plan for how it will determine whether key features of the initiative, such as the revised risk criteria and the revised sampling percentages, should be adjusted in the future. By 2016, DCAA estimates it will reduce the backlog and reach a steady state of audits, which it defines as two fiscal years of proposals awaiting review. DCAA's ability to achieve this goal will depend on a number of factors, including the number of proposals determined to be high risk, which as of September 2012 was about two-and-a-half times more than anticipated.", "Reducing the backlog of incurred cost audits will ease one obstacle to closing over-age contracts, but other obstacles, such as limited data and performance metrics, must still be overcome. The military departments have limited data on the extent and nature of their contract closeout backlog, and the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA)--which performs contract administration services for the Department of Defense (DOD)--is missing information that would allow it to identify contracts that it could act on. Such data can cue agencies on how to identify or tailor approaches to address the backlog. Further, the military departments generally do not have performance metrics to measure progress in closing out contracts. The Army recently announced a goal of closing over 475,000 contracts by September 2014; however, it does not yet have the information necessary to know if it can reach this goal and does not have an implementation plan. The Navy and the Air Force had not established any department-wide performance metrics for contract closeout. In contrast, DCMA has established two agency-wide performance metrics related to contract closeout that are regularly monitored. While many officials said contract closeout was not a priority, GAO found some local contracting activities taking action to bring attention to contract closeout."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is recommending that DCAA develop a plan to assess its incurred cost audit initiative; that DCMA improve data on over-age contracts; and that the military departments develop contract closeout data and establish performance measures.

Once performance on these contracts has been  completed, they must be closed as the final step in the acquisition  process. DOD currently has a large backlog of both flexibly priced and  firm-fixed-price contracts\u2014reportedly numbering in the hundreds of  thousands\u2014that have not been closed within the time frames required by  federal regulations. Closing contracts within required time frames can  help to limit the government\u2019s exposure to certain financial risks by  identifying and recovering improper payments and avoiding paying  interest fees when the government does not pay contractors on time.  Timely closeout also ensures that DOD deobligates and uses unspent  funds from completed contracts before the funds are canceled and  returned to the U.S. Department of the Treasury. In addition, closing a  contract years after the performance is complete can present challenges  because key documentation and contracting personnel with firsthand  knowledge of the contract may no longer be available.", "One of the key factors affecting DOD\u2019s ability to close out flexibly priced  contracts is the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) backlog of  approximately 25,000 incurred cost audits as of the end of fiscal year  2011, some dating as far back as 1996. This backlog represents  hundreds of billions of dollars in unsettled costs, and according to DCAA  has quadrupled over 10 years. DCAA conducts incurred cost audits to  identify whether all costs incurred on flexibly priced contracts are  allowable, allocable, and reasonable\u2014information that contracting officers  need to close flexibly priced contracts. Contracting officers also use  information from incurred cost audits to help determine final indirect cost  rates for a contractor. Indirect cost rates are a mechanism for establishing  the proportion of indirect costs\u2014or costs that are not directly attributable  to a specific project or function such as a contractor\u2019s general and  administrative expenses and health benefits\u2014that can be charged to a  contract. Because of the need to settle indirect cost rates, flexibly priced  contracts can be more difficult and time-consuming to close than firm- fixed-price contracts. One tool for expediting the closeout of flexibly priced  contracts is a process known as the quick closeout procedure. The quick  closeout procedure can only be applied to certain contracts where the  unsettled contract costs are considered relatively insignificant and can  allow for closing these contracts without an incurred cost audit.", "The Senate Armed Services Committee report accompanying the  National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 directed GAO to  review DCAA\u2019s criteria and procedures for conducting incurred cost audits  and recommend steps DCAA could take to reduce the backlog and to  consider the feasibility and advisability of three options aimed at reducing  the contract closeout backlog. The three options we were asked to  consider were (1) restoring the authority of the head of an agency to close  out a contract that is administratively complete, was entered into 10 or  more years ago, and has an unreconciled balance of less than $100,000;  (2) authorizing the contracting officer, in consultation with DCAA, to waive  the requirement for an incurred cost audit in the case of a low risk, low- cost contract; and (3) authorizing the contracting officer to waive final  payment in a case where the contractor has gone out of business and  cannot be reached. It also asked us to assess the efficacy of a May 2011  change to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) that was intended, in  part, to increase the use of quick closeout procedures. In response, this  report addresses (1) DCAA\u2019s efforts to reduce the backlog of incurred  cost audits, and (2) the challenges DOD faces in addressing the contract  closeout backlog.

We also collected and reviewed documentation on DCAA\u2019s  processes and criteria for conducting incurred cost audits, such as  agency memorandums, guidance, and forms for documenting risk  determinations. We interviewed senior DCAA officials and DCAA auditors  from three field offices that performed a high volume of risk  determinations to obtain a better understanding of the process and  considerations by which they determine the risk associated with a  contractor\u2019s incurred cost proposals.

A contract is generally eligible to be  closed once all option provisions have expired, the contractor has  completed performance, and the government has accepted the final  delivery of goods or services, or when the government has provided the  contractor a notice of complete contract termination. From this point,  contracts are considered physically complete, and should be closed  within time frames set by the FAR\u20146 months for firm-fixed-price  contracts and 36 months for flexibly priced contracts. The FAR prohibits  the closing of contract files if the contract is in litigation, under appeal, or  where the contract is being terminated and all termination actions have  not been completed. Contract documents can be stored and retained  after the contracting officer signs and files the contract completion  statement.", "Additional time is allowed for the closeout of flexibly priced contracts  because there are additional steps necessary to close out these types of  contracts (see figure 1). Specifically, closing these contracts generally  requires an audit and settlement of the contractor\u2019s final indirect cost  rates. Contracting officers and DCAA need to ensure all costs incurred by  the contractor and charged to the government are allowable, allocable,  and reasonable. Contracting officers also need to establish final indirect  cost rates based on the contractor\u2019s incurred costs, which determine, in  part, the contractor\u2019s final payment on flexibly priced contracts.", "Contractors are required by the FAR to submit proposals that include  information on all of their flexibly priced contracts in a fiscal year. Once  submitted, DCAA audits the proposal to determine if the costs incurred  are reasonable, allowable and allocable to government contracts (see  figure 2 for incurred cost audit process). There is not a one-to-one  relationship between an incurred cost audit and an individual contract. In  a single fiscal year, a contractor may incur costs on multiple flexibly  priced contracts, and all of these contracts would be included in the  proposal. The total value of the proposal, called the auditable dollar value  (ADV), is the sum of all the costs on flexibly priced contracts for that  contractor during the fiscal year. Additionally, since the period of  performance on an individual contract may span several fiscal years,  several audits may need to be conducted to provide the information  necessary to close one flexibly priced contract. Further, DCAA may  assess a contractor\u2019s incurred cost proposal as inadequate for a variety of  reasons, for example if the proposal is not certified or contains math  errors, and request that the contractor review, revise, and resubmit its  incurred cost proposal.", "The responsibility for closing out a contract resides with the DOD  contracting officer within the military department or other defense agency  that awarded the contract. The contracting officer may, however, delegate  certain administrative responsibilities, including contract closeout, to  DCMA, which provides contract administration services to DOD.

For  example, the amount of unsettled direct and indirect costs to be allocated  to the contract, task order, or delivery order must be relatively  insignificant\u2014which is defined as costs that do not exceed the lesser of  $1,000,000 or 10 percent of the total contract, task order, or delivery  order amount. The contracting officer also must perform a risk  assessment and determine that the use of the quick closeout procedure is  appropriate and consider such factors as the contractor\u2019s accounting,  estimating, and purchasing systems, and any concerns of cognizant  DCAA auditors.

We recommended that DCAA  develop a risk-based contract audit approach across the agency that  included identification of resource requirements. DCAA officials reported  that as a result of our findings, it now requires more testing and stricter  compliance with government auditing standards, which adds to the  amount of staff time required to complete each audit. In September 2011,  we reported that DOD\u2019s ability to close the contracts it awarded to support  efforts in Iraq was hindered by several factors, including the failure to plan  for or emphasize the need to close these contracts until reconstruction  efforts were well under way.prioritized contract awards over other activities and DOD does not have  visibility into the number of Iraq contracts eligible for closeout.

According to DCMA, loss of this skill set meant that many of  the agency\u2019s pricing-related contract administration responsibilities, such  as establishing final indirect cost rates, were no longer performed to the  same level of discipline and consistency as in prior years.

Accordingly, DCAA reported that incurred cost audits were not prioritized  in fiscal year 2011 since they did not provide as many financial benefits  as other audits, such as forward pricing audits, which are used to  determine fair and reasonable rates for the award or modification of a  contract.", "In developing the initiative, DCAA performed an analysis of which audits  provided financial benefits by comparing how much money was saved or  recovered by various types of audits (such as incurred cost and forward  pricing audits) to how much money was invested in performing those  audits. As a part of this analysis, DCAA officials found that the agency  spent more in terms of staff resources to conduct incurred cost audits on  proposals valued at less than $1 million than the financial benefits derived  from the audits.

In addition to the changes to  criteria and procedures, DCAA officials noted they plan to increase their  staffing levels from 4,900 employees in 2011 to 5,600 by 2016. DCAA  provided refresher training to its staff, and created 17 dedicated teams to  incurred cost audit work.", "DCAA raised the threshold above which an audit is required based on  ADV from $15 million to $250 million, thereby decreasing the number of  proposals automatically qualifying for audit from 5,194 to 659, based on  the backlog as of the end of fiscal year 2011 (see table 1). Proposals  under the $250 million threshold will not be audited unless they are  determined to be high risk or randomly selected for audit.", "In conjunction with raising the threshold by which incurred cost proposals  were automatically selected for audit, DCAA revised two of the three  criteria that a contractor\u2019s incurred cost proposal under the $250 million  threshold must meet to be determined low risk (see table 2). For example,  under DCAA\u2019s prior criteria, DCAA must have performed an incurred cost  audit within the past three years; under the new initiative, for proposals  $100 million or under, the time frame for conducting the last incurred audit  was eliminated\u2014the requirement is now that the contractor has had at  least one incurred cost audit. These changes will increase the potential  number of contractor proposals that are eligible for low risk  determinations. The other criterion\u2014audit leads or other significant  risks\u2014did not change. However, DCAA did provide several examples of  the types of risks that should be considered under this criterion, such as  known business system deficiencies or risks identified by the contracting  officer.", "Once risk has been determined, those proposals that are determined to  be low risk will be randomly sampled at DCAA\u2019s five regional offices  based on the proposal\u2019s ADV, but now at a lower percentage than before.  Currently, between 1 and 20 percent of low risk proposals are sampled  depending on ADV, whereas under the previous procedure 33 percent of  low risk proposals were sampled (see table 3).", "Under DCAA\u2019s risk-based initiative, low risk proposals that are not  selected for audit are not subject to any further review, whereas  previously all proposals not selected for audit were subject to desk  reviews. Desk reviews included an evaluation of the proposal for unusual  items and changes from prior year proposals, among other actions. Now,  when a low risk proposal is not selected for audit, DCAA auditors issue  memorandums to the contracting officers recommending that the  contracting officer use his or her authority to determine the contractor\u2019s  final indirect cost rates, which allows the contracting officer to proceed  with closing the contract. However, in November 2011, DCAA issued  revised guidance to determine whether a contractor\u2019s proposal is  adequate, and DCAA officials explained that the revised adequacy review  provides a more comprehensive determination that includes many areas  previously covered in the desk review process.", "A summary of DCAA\u2019s revised incurred cost audit procedures are outlined  in figure 3.", "By revising its policies and procedures and dedicating resources to  incurred cost audits, DCAA estimates it will reduce its backlog and reach  a steady state by 2016, which it defines as having two fiscal years of  incurred cost proposals awaiting review.

However, DCAA has not yet fully developed measures to  evaluate the initiative\u2019s results and assess whether the changes will  require further adjustments. For example, DCAA is planning to track the  number of risk determinations completed, the numbers of proposals  deemed high and low risk, and the number of audits completed. Further,  DCAA regional offices will be responsible for monitoring risk  determinations on an ongoing basis to ensure that they are completed in  a timely manner and to identify any field audit offices that have a  significantly higher or lower percentage of high risk determinations than  other field audit offices.

DCAA stated that they plan to reassess the  initiative in about a year, but did not provide details on what would be  assessed at that time. Internal control standards require the  establishment of clear, consistent objectives and the identification and  analysis of what measures will be used to determine if an agency is  achieving those objectives.", "Additionally, it is too early to tell whether DCAA will achieve its goal of  eliminating the backlog by 2016, in part because DCAA does not yet  know how many proposals under $250 million ADV will be determined low  or high risk and its initial estimates have proven inaccurate. DCAA reports  that its auditors have completed risk assessments on 13,522 contractor  proposals that had an ADV of less than $15 million\u2014out of a universe of  approximately 20,000 proposals\u2014as of September 2012. Of 13,522 risk  assessments completed, DCAA determined that 7,815 proposals were  high risk, or about two-and-a-half times more than anticipated. DCAA  determined that the number of high risk proposals is higher than expected  because over 3,500 of those proposals belong to contractors with no  incurred cost audit history. DCAA\u2019s backlog includes multiple proposals  covering several fiscal years for some contractors. DCAA officials stated  the agency plans to audit older proposals first, thus contractors\u2019 proposals  for later years may become eligible for low risk status once an audit has  been conducted for a single fiscal year and an audit history is established.  DCAA\u2019s ability to reach a steady state by 2016 will also depend on  whether DCAA completes its audits within anticipated time frames.

DCMA officials reported  that specific categories of contracts are being targeted for closure, such  as firm-fixed-price contracts with no outstanding obligations.", "The limited visibility into the characteristics of the contract closeout  backlog, particularly at the military departments, made it challenging for  officials to fully assess the extent to which specific efforts to reduce the  backlog would impact their over-age contracts. For example, we asked  DOD officials their views on restoring the authority of the head of an  agency to close out a contract that is administratively complete, was  entered into 10 or more years ago, and has an unreconciled balance  under $100,000. Many DOD officials we spoke with at various levels  within the military departments and within DCMA stated they did not  believe the option would affect the backlog, as they did not believe their  contracting offices would have many contracts to which this option would  apply. For example, based on DCMA\u2019s over-age contract data, DCMA  officials estimated that as of July 2012, only 85 of the approximately  36,000 contracts in their backlog would meet the criteria of the option.  However, officials at the military departments, commands and local  contracting offices that we asked generally could not provide specific  numbers as to how many contracts this option would impact. Further,  several officials noted that a similar temporary authority was granted in  the mid-2000s that they believed was ineffective, in part because DOD  established a process and administrative requirements that they termed  burdensome. For example, DFAS officials reported that the authority  was only used to close out 14 contracts.", "Similarly, when we asked how useful it would be if legislation authorized a  contracting officer to waive final payment in a case where a contractor  has gone out of business and cannot be reached, DOD officials reported  that this situation occurs infrequently. Yet DOD officials at several  locations we reviewed said that they did not have data readily available  on how often they had encountered this situation. Further, some officials  noted that a contracting officer can use the authority in the FAR to  unilaterally close a contract for this purpose.guidebook outlines procedures that contracting officers use to close a  contract where the contractor has gone out of business."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Military Departments Generally Did Not Have Performance Metrics to Measure Progress in Closing Out Contracts", "paragraphs": ["Performance measures, which compare actual performance against  planned results, can be an important tool in demonstrating leadership  commitment and maintaining adequate internal controls. We found that  the Army recently communicated a goal to its commands for closing over- age contracts, but the Navy and Air Force did not have established  performance metrics for closing out contracts within their organization. In  November 2012, the Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army  (Procurement) sent an e-mail to its commands identifying a goal of  closing over 475,000 over-age contracts by September 2014. The office  requested that each command provide information on their over-age  contracts by the end of November 2012, including identifying contracts  that may be suitable to be grouped together and closed at the command  level, such as low dollar contracts, and identifying contracts that fit into  other priority categories, such as certain contracts with expiring funds.  Further, the office directed the commands to establish monthly closeout  goals and describe challenges that may impact the command\u2019s ability to  meet the Army\u2019s September 2014 goal. According to an Army official,  they have drafted an implementation plan for this effort, but the plan has  not yet been approved. Although the Navy did not have department-wide  performance metrics related to contract closeout, one Navy command  established a goal of decreasing the contract closeout backlog from  approximately 23,000 contracts to 13,000 contracts over fiscal year 2012,  and reported it had exceeded that goal before the end of the year. Within  the Air Force, headquarters officials told us in November 2012 that they  plan to begin regular collection of data on contract closeout statistics  starting in January 2013.", "In contrast, DCMA had established two agency-wide performance  measures related to contract closeout for contracts where they have been  delegated contract administration responsibilities. For example, one of  DCMA\u2019s closeout measures looks at the total number of over-age  contracts in the agency, with a target of reducing the total number of over- age contracts by 10 percent during a fiscal year. The measures are  reviewed at a number of levels within DCMA, including a briefing to the  DCMA Director approximately twice a year, and monthly reviews at each  of the contract management offices. When the targets for each measure  are not met, DCMA officials conduct a root cause analysis to identify the  reasons why, as well as to identify potential methods for addressing the  issues.", "While many DOD officials acknowledged that contract closeout is not a  priority compared to other mission critical activities, we found some  contracting offices were taking actions locally to address their contract  closeout backlogs. For example, one Army contracting office made its  contract closeout process more centralized, added two new staff, and  tracked the number of contracts they closed. Officials at this office  reported that they closed over 14,000 of a reported 20,000 low dollar firm- fixed-price contracts in its backlog over the past year. Further, we found  four contracting offices established a contract closeout team whose work  is focused on contract closeout activities. Officials from three of these  offices noted that their office prioritizes closing out contracts when funds  are close to canceling to preserve funds for other uses.", "Further, DOD has established a contract with the AbilityOne program for  contract closeout support services to help address some of the contract  closeout backlog. According to DOD officials, this contract is limited to  closing firm-fixed-price contracts across the department, whether over- age or not. AbilityOne representatives reported that the contractor has  already provided contract closeout support services for over 50,000  contracts across DOD. DOD stated that using AbilityOne allows  contracting officers to focus on other duties and mission-critical work such  as awarding contracts; however, some DOD officials noted limitations,  including the administrative burden on the contracting officer to locate all  appropriate documentation to forward to the AbilityOne contractor, and  ensuring AbilityOne staff have the proper clearance and access for the  contractors. While AbilityOne\u2019s efforts are currently limited to firm-fixed- price contracts, senior DOD officials told us they are looking into the  feasibility of contracting with AbilityOne for contract closeout services on  flexibly priced contracts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Organizations Made Limited Use of Quick Closeout Procedures", "paragraphs": ["Our work found that DCMA and the contracting offices we reviewed made  only limited use of quick closeout procedures. For example, even though  DCMA has a policy, based on a FAR deviation, that allows for broader  use of quick closeout procedures than what is allowed under the FAR,  and DCMA\u2019s guidance recommends that contracting officers use quick  closeout where applicable, the two DCMA contract management offices  we reviewed made little or no use of quick closeout procedures.at DCMA headquarters and one contract management office said they  were unsure why quick closeout is not used more often. Officials at the  other DCMA contract management office we spoke with told us one  reason they had not made more use of DCMA\u2019s policy related to quick   Officials  closeout procedures is that DCMA did not define what can be considered  a compelling reason to waive an audit until December 2011. Further,  once they started to assess eligibility, this office encountered challenges  in identifying contractors that they considered to be eligible for the quick  closeout procedure. Specifically, the office initially identified 1,489  contracts with 32 contractors that may be eligible for quick closeout  procedures. However, after further analysis, officials reported that 463  contracts with 7 contractors were deemed potentially eligible. Contractors  were excluded from eligibility due to issues such as contractor billing  problems, DCAA concerns about the contractor, or contractor delays in  submitting an incurred cost proposal.", "Similarly, none of the nine military department contracting offices reported  using quick closeout procedures currently, although three reported  minimal use in the past. For example, one contracting office estimated  using quick closeout procedures for about 40 to 50 contracts in fiscal  years 2010 and 2011. Officials at two other contracting offices reporting  use of quick closeout on a handful of contracts in the past, but are not  making use of it now. With regard to the efficacy of the May 2011 change  to the FAR that was intended, in part, to increase the use of quick  closeout, officials at the two contracting offices that previously used quick  closeout procedures reported that the May 2011 change reduced the  number of eligible contracts by including direct costs in the eligibility  criteria. Officials from one of these contracting offices explained that the  previous language allowed the contracting officer to waive the dollar  threshold based on a risk determination. Since the current language  removed the waiver, officials explained that the contracting officer is no  longer able to make a business decision for contracts above the dollar  threshold to determine an acceptable level of risk.", "DCMA and contracting officials we interviewed also noted that other  challenges to the use of quick closeout procedures included a lack of  audit history by which to determine what a contractor\u2019s rates should be.  DOD officials told us there was sometimes a reluctance to use quick  closeout procedures because they are uncertain of the risk they are  taking on and concerned that their decisions may be questioned later by  others.", "During our interviews with DOD officials, we asked about the advisability  and feasibility of authorizing a contracting officer, in consultation with  DCAA, to waive the requirement for an audit in the case of a low risk, low  cost contract to assist in closing out contracts\u2014one of the options we  were asked to consider in our review. Officials throughout DOD\u2014at  DCMA, military commands, military department contracting offices, and  others\u2014told us they believed this option was similar to quick closeout  procedures, a tool already available to them."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["DOD has fallen far behind in closing out its contracts, in part due to the  large backlog of incurred cost audits that must be performed by DCAA.  DCAA has recognized that completing the volume of these audits, as well  as other high-priority audits, using its traditional approach exceeds the  capacity of its resources. In response, DCAA launched a risk-based  approach to focus its resources on audits that are considered to be high  risk or high dollar value. Such an approach appears prudent and shows  promise, but its success will depend upon reducing the audit backlog in a  way that protects the taxpayers\u2019 interests. DCAA, however, has not  developed a plan with measures to assess progress toward achieving  these goals. DCAA must ensure that the key changes to its criteria and  procedures\u2014such as increasing thresholds for audit, revising its risk  determination criteria, and decreasing sampling percentages for low risk  proposals\u2014adequately direct resources to audits that will provide the  greatest benefit to the taxpayer. Without a plan that includes appropriate  measures, DCAA will not be well-positioned to assess whether the  initiative is achieving its goals.", "Reducing the incurred cost audit backlog should enable more flexibly  priced contracts to be closed out, but the extent to which it will do so is  uncertain. As there is not a one-to-one relationship between an incurred  cost audit and a specific contract, and there are additional steps that need  to be taken to close a contract, there is likely to be a lag in closing out  contracts even if DCAA is successful in its efforts. Within the military  departments, limited data on the extent of the backlog or the reasons why  contracts are in the backlog hinders their ability to develop targeted  approaches, with goals and performance metrics, to address over-age  contracts. The Army is just starting to collect the information necessary to  determine if it can realistically meet its goal of closing over-age contracts  and has not issued an implementation plan. The Navy and the Air Force,  while facing similar data issues, have no department-wide performance  metrics. Even DCMA, which does have performance measures in place  as well as some information on where the contract is in the closeout  process, has incomplete information on who has responsibility for moving  the contract forward in the closeout process. One technique\u2014the use of  quick closeout procedures\u2014has been available for a number of years, but  we found little evidence that any organization has made significant effort  to use it, either before or after the May 2011 change in federal  regulations.

DCAA stated  that this plan will include time frames and measures to determine whether  its current criteria and procedures will require future modification. Further,  DCAA identified several factors that this plan will include, such as an  analysis of high risk determinations and audit results to determine if some  criteria are better indicators of risk than others and an analysis of DCAA\u2019s  return on investment to determine if revisions to the sampling variables  are needed.", "Each of the military departments identified actions that they would take to  increase visibility and management attention on closing out contracts  within their departments.

The Air Force stated that it plans to  place additional emphasis on aging contracts at a joint forum focused on  high priority issues between DCMA, DCAA, and the departments.

The three options we were asked to consider were (1) restoring  the authority of the head of an agency to close out a contract that is  administratively complete, was entered into 10 or more years ago, and  has an unreconciled balance of less than $100,000; (2) authorizing the  contracting officer, in consultation with DCAA, to waive the requirement  for an incurred cost audit in the case of a low risk, low-cost contract; and  (3) authorizing the contracting officer to waive final payment in a case  where the contractor has gone out of business and cannot be reached.
