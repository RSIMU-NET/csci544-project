The largest increases were in measures of adverse health consequences such as emergency department visits, substance abuse treatment admissions, and unintentional overdose deaths, though increases were not consistent across all measures. Federal officials suggested that increasing availability of prescription pain relievers and high-risk behaviors by those who abuse or misuse the drugs, such as combining prescription pain relievers with other drugs or alcohol, likely contributed to the rise in adverse health consequences, though data about the reasons for the increases are limited.", "The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) use a variety of strategies to educate prescribers about issues related to prescription pain reliever abuse and misuse, but officials told us that more education is needed. The strategies used include developing continuing medical education programs, requiring training and certification in order to prescribe certain drugs, and developing curriculum resources for future prescribers. The Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) is working to develop a legislative proposal to require education for prescribers registering with the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to prescribe controlled substances. Officials from some agencies said such a requirement would ensure all prescribers were starting from the same baseline of knowledge.", "In their efforts to educate the public about prescription pain reliever abuse and misuse, DEA, FDA, NIH, ONDCP, and SAMHSA used almost all of the key practices for developing their consumer education efforts. Agencies varied in how they used the key practices when developing these efforts, which varied in size, scope, and duration. All agencies established metrics to monitor the implementation and functional elements of their educational efforts, but only two agencies have established or are planning to establish metrics to assess the impact of their efforts on audiences\u0092 knowledge, attitudes, and behavior. Without outcome evaluations, federal agencies have limited knowledge of how effective their efforts are in achieving their goals\u0097in this case, reducing prescription pain reliever abuse and misuse.", "Among federal initiatives to educate prescribers and the public about prescription pain reliever abuse and misuse, GAO found several instances of agencies engaging in similar efforts, directed at similar target audiences and using similar mediums. Officials said that these similarities in public education efforts are beneficial in addressing prescription drug abuse and misuse because having multiple, reinforcing messages about the same subject is valuable in public health communications and because federal agencies provide slightly different perspectives on the issues surrounding prescription drug abuse and misuse. Likewise, the prescriber education programs GAO identified, though similar, are different in content and focus. Though these similar programs have the potential to be duplicative if not effectively coordinated, federal agencies have recently begun to coordinate their educational efforts. Nevertheless, federal agencies have missed opportunities to share lessons learned and pool resources among similar education efforts."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the Director of ONDCP establish outcome metrics and implement a plan to evaluate proposed educational efforts, and ensure that agencies share lessons learned among similar efforts.

Further, according to CDC,  recent increases in prescription drug overdose deaths overall are largely  driven by deaths associated with prescription pain relievers, which include  such drugs as OxyContin or Vicodin, among others. In 2009, an  estimated 12.4 million Americans reported using a prescription pain  reliever in the past year without a prescription of their own or simply for  the experience or feeling the drug caused, according to the National  Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH). Seventy percent of these  people reported that they got the drug from a friend or family member,  while another 19 percent got the drug from a doctor. Although specific  regions of the country have been severely affected by this problem,  recent media reports from across the United States suggest it is now a  national issue.", "Multiple federal agencies have responsibility for addressing the abuse  and misuse of prescription pain relievers through prevention, treatment,  and enforcement activities. The Office of National Drug Control Policy  (ONDCP) assists in setting national drug control priorities and helps to  coordinate federal drug control efforts. One prevention activity ONDCP  has identified as a focus area is raising awareness of the problem of  prescription drug abuse and misuse through the education of parents,  youth, patients, and health care providers.

A  recent study on pain education in medical schools found that such  education is limited, variable, and often fragmentary. Further, given the  recent introduction of new pain relievers to the U.S. market and advances  in pain management, prescribers who completed their medical training in  prior years may not have received training in prescribing certain types of  pain relievers, such as extended-release or long-acting formulations.  While continuing education of current prescribers could help address this  issue, according to an American Medical Association publication, as of  September 2011 medical boards in only nine states had a continuing  medical education (CME) requirement related to education on controlled  substance prescribing or pain management for certain prescribers.

Our prior work outlines key practices that agencies should  engage in when developing public education efforts: define key goals and  objectives of the educational effort; analyze the situation, including  identifying competing voices or timing considerations; identify  stakeholders and clarify their roles; identify resources; research target  audiences, including identifying audience characteristics and motivators;  develop clear, consistent messages; identify credible messenger(s);  design a mix of media, including method and frequency of delivery; and  establish metrics to measure success (for further description of these key  practices, see app. III). Our review of initiatives to educate the general  public about prescription pain reliever abuse and misuse shows that all of  the agencies used almost all of these practices when developing their  initiatives (see fig. 2). For instance, FDA relied on seven of nine key  practices when developing outreach materials for its Opioid Public  Service Announcements. Other agencies used more key practices when  developing their education efforts; ONDCP relied on all nine key practices  for developing consumer education efforts when it developed the  prescription drug content for the National Youth Anti-Drug Media  Campaign.", "Agencies varied in how they used the key practices for developing public  education efforts.

FDA used a  different approach for the same key practice of developing consistent,  clear messages for its Opioid Public Service Announcements\u2014which  include information about appropriate use, storage, and disposal of  medications\u2014relying on internal discussions between staff in its Office of  Communications and the Office of New Drugs.", "Although all agencies used many of the same key practices to develop  their educational efforts, the resulting initiatives are different in terms of  size, scope, and duration, and agencies dedicated varying amounts of  resources to developing their efforts. For instance, NIH\u2019s Heads Up: Real  News About Drugs and Your Body provides classroom materials\u2014 including magazine articles, student worksheets, and lesson plans\u2014to  students and teachers about a range of topics related to drug abuse and  misuse, including but not limited to prescription drugs, and has done so  each school year since 2002. By contrast, DEA began collecting and  disposing of unused prescription drugs through its Take Back Initiative in  2010. The agency developed outreach materials to raise awareness of  the event and the materials\u2014including brochures and billboards\u2014are  specific to prescription drugs. There is also significant variation in terms of  the resources different agencies used for program development. For  instance, the budget for the National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign in  fiscal year 2011 was approximately $35 million, whereas Not Worth the  Risk; Even if it\u2019s Legal cost about $80,000 for the last phase of the  brochure series.for program development and dissemination in a fiscal year."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "All Agencies Followed the Key Practice of Establishing Process Metrics but Most Did Not Assess Program Outcomes", "paragraphs": ["While all agencies established metrics to monitor the implementation and  functional elements of their educational initiatives, only two agencies have  established or planned to establish metrics to assess the impact of their  initiatives on audiences\u2019 knowledge, attitudes, and behavior with regard to  prescription pain reliever abuse and misuse. The former, known as  process metrics, monitor the operational elements of educational efforts,  such as the quantity or volume of outreach efforts. The latter, known as  outcome metrics, are used to assess the impact of the initiative on the  desired health or behavior outcome. Our prior work and other guides for  developing consumer education efforts note that establishing both  process and outcome metrics are critical elements of program  development.", "All federal agencies followed the key practice of establishing process  metrics for the public education efforts we reviewed. For instance, DEA  tracks the amount of activity and use across the different features and  content pages on its websites, Just Think Twice and Get Smart About  Drugs, including the most popular search terms and amount of time spent  on the components of the websites. DEA also monitors the number of  visitors to its museum exhibit about prescription drug abuse and misuse,  Good Medicine, Bad Behavior, and records the number of group visits by  category (e.g., schools, universities, or senior citizens).", "ONDCP and NIH were the only agencies that followed the key practice of  establishing outcome metrics for their education efforts. ONDCP  measures outcomes from its National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign  (the Campaign) on a weekly basis through ongoing tracking studies.

NIH plans to  evaluate outcomes for its NIDA for Teens website by surveying students  and teachers about students\u2019 knowledge acquisition and attitude change  after exposure to NIDA for Teens, as well as teachers\u2019 opinions on the  utility of the website. Although officials from agencies that did not  establish outcome metrics told us that they recognize the importance of  evaluating public education efforts, they cited challenges measuring the  impact of such efforts and lack of financial resources as reasons for not  assessing program outcomes. For instance, one official explained that an  outcome evaluation for his agency\u2019s drug education program would cost  more than developing and implementing the program itself.", "However, ONDCP indicated that,  Beyond the key practices for developing public education efforts, our prior  work notes that using existing evidence to inform public health  communications, such as research on teen messaging or evaluations of  related efforts, can also be helpful in analyzing the effectiveness of  educational efforts in addition to establishing outcome metrics. developing their public education efforts, agencies incorporated evidence- based strategies when possible, but limited evidence exists about how to  successfully educate the public about prescription pain reliever abuse and  misuse. For instance, research shows that teens may mistakenly believe  that prescription pain relievers are safer than illicit drugs. As a result,  officials from several agencies told us that they seek to dispel this  misperception in their educational efforts. In addition, NSDUH data also  indicate that most people who abuse or misuse prescription pain relievers  get the drugs from a friend or family member. Thus, DEA officials told us  that they have sought to educate the public about proper drug storage  and disposal in order to limit the amount of drugs that are available to be  diverted from medicine cabinets for abuse and misuse.", "GAO, Program Evaluation: Strategies for Assessing How Information Dissemination  Contributes to Agency Goals, GAO-02-923 (Washington, D.C.: Sept. 30, 2002).", "However, officials from multiple agencies explained that because there  are distinct challenges when designing educational efforts about  prescription pain reliever abuse and misuse compared to other drug  prevention efforts, more research is needed in order to understand how to  craft effective messages, particularly for teens. Officials said that  education about prescription pain reliever abuse and misuse requires a  more nuanced approach because there are legitimate medical uses for  these products. In addition, officials from several agencies noted that  educational efforts should avoid inadvertently alerting people to the  possibility of using these drugs to get high. The motivations for abusing  and misusing prescription drugs can also be different than the motivations  for using illicit drugs, such as self-medicating for pain relief, and  understanding how to effectively target the variety of reasons people  abuse and misuse prescription drugs is another area that requires more  research, according to agency officials. The Surgeon General, with  support from other federal agencies, is currently developing a Call to  Action on youth prescription drug abuse that will discuss available  evidence to support prevention strategies, including educational efforts.  An official from the Office of the Surgeon General told us that the Call to  Action, which is anticipated for release in February 2012, will also identify  gaps in existing research related to youth prescription drug abuse  prevention strategies and call for further research to be conducted to fill  these gaps."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Federal Agencies Have Begun Coordinating Similar Public and Prescriber Education Efforts, but Have Missed Opportunities to Share Resources", "paragraphs": ["There are several similarities among agencies\u2019 efforts, target audiences,  and mediums across the nine public education initiatives and nine  prescriber education programs we identified.

Officials told us that it is beneficial to have similar education efforts about  prescription pain reliever abuse and misuse because of the complex  nature of this problem and the fact that agencies provide different but  reinforcing messages about the issue.", "For example, three initiatives\u2014Just Think Twice, NIDA for Teens, and the  National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign\u2014use the same medium to  target teens with similar messages about prescription drug abuse and  misuse. These efforts provide web-based information and interactive  features to educate teens about prescription drug abuse and misuse.  (See fig. 3 and fig. 4 for examples of web-based efforts to educate teens  about prescription drug abuse and misuse.) Officials working on these  efforts noted that they chose to focus on teens because drug abuse  typically starts during teen years. NIH officials told us that prescription  and over-the-counter medications account for most of the drugs  commonly abused by 12th graders as well, after alcohol, tobacco, and  marijuana. Teens are also more vulnerable to the negative effects of drug  use since their brains are still developing.", "There are also two initiatives\u2014DEA\u2019s Get Smart About Drugs and  ONDCP\u2019s National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign\u2014that use the same  medium to target parents with similar messages about prescription drug  abuse and misuse. For instance, both use websites that have interactive  features that show parents where teens commonly access prescription  drugs in the home. Both sites also include tips for parents about how to  talk to teens about drugs and about how to identify signs of abuse.", "Officials acknowledged these instances of similar goals and similar  strategies to reach the same audience among educational efforts.  However, officials said that these similarities are beneficial in addressing  prescription drug abuse and misuse. Officials from NIH, FDA, DEA, and  ONDCP noted that having multiple, reinforcing messages about the same  subject is valuable in public health communications, particularly about an  issue as complex as prescription drug abuse and misuse. The National  Council on Patient Information and Education also told us that repetition  and frequent delivery of information supports message reinforcement.  Second, federal agencies have their own constituencies and each  approaches prescription drug abuse and misuse from a slightly different  perspective. For instance, NIDA for Teens provides a science-based  perspective and includes information about how prescription drugs affect  the brain. Specifically, the \u201cMind Over Matter\u201d series on the NIDA for  Teens website explains how prescription drugs mimic neurotransmitters  to alter the brain\u2019s chemistry. DEA\u2019s Just Think Twice, on the other hand,  provides more information about the legal consequences of abusing  drugs, such as losing federal student loans, and the culture of drug  abuse, including images of drugs and true stories of youth overdose  deaths. NIH officials told us that both perspectives are important as some  members of the public may go to NIH\u2019s NIDA for information about these  issues, while others may go to DEA. Officials also said that they cross- reference each other\u2019s information when appropriate. For instance,  ONDCP links to publications from NIH\u2019s NIDA on one of the National  Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign websites.", "In addition to the similarities among the nine targeted educational efforts  we reviewed, agencies are engaged in additional efforts outside the  scope of our review which, taken together, may present areas of potential   These additional efforts include posting materials from  duplication.retired initiatives online, planning future efforts, and providing factual  information about prescription pain relievers. For instance, FDA and  SAMHSA have brochures and posters for teens and the elderly with  messages about prescription pain reliever abuse and misuse that are no  longer actively disseminated, but are still available on their websites.  HRSA and, contingent on available resources, DEA are also planning to  launch new or update existing educational initiatives in the next fiscal  year, targeted at the elderly and parents, respectively. ONDCP is also  planning to work with agencies and external stakeholders to develop and  implement national public education campaigns on prescription drug  abuse and misuse and drug storage and disposal, by April 2013. ONDCP  officials told us that, as of October 2011, they were still considering  various options and working to identify resources for these campaigns.  Finally, three federal agencies have prescription drug fact pages on their  main websites and FDA oversees the dissemination of drug information to  patients through tools such as medication guides that are provided with  some prescription drugs. Given the number of agencies involved in  educating the public about prescription pain reliever abuse and misuse  and the number of efforts currently under way, these additional efforts  represent areas where there may be the potential for duplicative  programming, if such efforts are not effectively coordinated.", "There are also similar target audiences and mediums among the nine  prescriber education programs we identified, although the content and  focus of these programs is different (see table 2). For example, two CME  courses, SAMHSA\u2019s Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain course and  FDA\u2019s requirement for prescriber education through its extended-release  and long-acting opioid REMS, are both targeted at current prescribers.  Though these courses have some similar content about patient selection  and monitoring, FDA officials noted that prescriber education through  REMS will focus on extended-release and long-acting products, whereas  the SAMHSA course includes information on both extended-release and  immediate-release pain relievers. They also noted that the SAMHSA  course is more focused on addiction and treatment than the REMS  materials will be. As a result, prescribers are being educated about the  full range of issues related to prescription pain reliever abuse and misuse,  including treating pain, appropriate prescribing, and recognizing  substance abuse in their patients.", "Federal agencies use three main mechanisms\u2014two mechanisms that are  overseen by ONDCP, the National Drug Control Strategy and the  Prescription Drug Abuse Prevention Plan, and one mechanism within  HHS, the HHS Behavioral Health Coordinating Committee\u2019s  Subcommittee on Prescription Drug Abuse\u2014to coordinate their  educational efforts. The agencies have also begun using key practices for  coordination that we have identified in prior work on practices that help  enhance and sustain collaboration. ONDCP releases the National Drug  Control Strategy (the Strategy) on an annual basis and it outlines the  administration\u2019s goals and priorities for reducing the rate of drug abuse  and misuse and the associated consequences. The Strategy, which  outlines drug control policies and programs for illicit and prescription  drugs, serves as a coordination mechanism for drug control agencies and  incorporates several key practices for interagency collaboration. For  instance, the Strategy defines and articulates a common outcome by  establishing the administration\u2019s goals for reducing drug abuse and  misuse. The Strategy also provides a means for agencies to agree on  roles and responsibilities by listing specific actions for agencies to take,  including identifying lead and partnering agencies for each action item.  For example, \u201cEnhance Healthcare Providers\u2019 Skills in Screening and  Brief Intervention\u201d is an action item in the 2010 Strategy and it specifies  that SAMHSA is the lead agency, with NIH\u2019s NIDA, HRSA, and the Indian  Health Service listed as partnering agencies. Finally, the Strategy  provides a means to monitor, evaluate, and report on results for  collaborative efforts. Agencies developed objectives and 1- and 2-year  milestones for the action items in the 2010 Strategy and they submit  regular progress reports to ONDCP.", "The Prescription Drug Abuse Prevention Plan (the Plan) was recently  released by ONDCP and complements the Strategy by outlining the  administration\u2019s approach to addressing prescription drug abuse and  misuse, in particular. As a result, it serves as a second interagency  coordination mechanism for agencies addressing prescription drug abuse  and also reflects the key practices for collaboration that we previously  identified. The Plan establishes mutually reinforcing or joint strategies by  identifying four priority areas for federal efforts to reduce prescription drug  abuse and misuse\u2014education, monitoring, proper disposal, and  enforcement\u2014and it aligns agencies\u2019 activities around these four areas.  For instance, the Plan calls for federal agencies and private stakeholders  to work together to develop evidence-based public education campaigns  about appropriate use, secure storage, disposal, and abuse of  prescription drugs. Like the Strategy, the Plan also provides a means to  monitor, evaluate, and report on results. ONDCP asked agencies to  submit implementation plans with objectives and 1- and 2-year milestones  and to provide progress reports on a quarterly basis. The Plan also calls  for the establishment of a Federal Council on Prescription Drug Abuse to  coordinate implementation of the Plan.", "Finally, the HHS Behavioral Health Coordinating Committee\u2019s  Subcommittee on Prescription Drug Abuse provides a third coordination  mechanism for HHS agencies and demonstrates use of the key practices  for collaboration as well. For instance, the Subcommittee defines a  common outcome for HHS agencies by identifying five goals related to  prescription drug abuse and organizing its activities around these goals.The Subcommittee also provides a means to monitor and report on  progress to HHS leadership. Agency officials report on their activities  related to prescription drug abuse and misuse to the Subcommittee   co-chairs, who then provide updates to HHS leadership.", "Agencies have begun using these coordination mechanisms, or  augmenting existing coordination efforts, within recent years. Beginning in  2009, ONDCP began using a more collaborative process for developing  the Strategy, convening a Demand Reduction Interagency Working  Group. The working group brought together subject experts from drug  control agencies to provide input on the development of the Strategy and  DEA, FDA, HRSA, NIH, and SAMHSA all participated. Officials from  multiple agencies indicated that this process was more interactive than in  years past. The 2010 Strategy also utilized a new approach by outlining  specific action items and developing a system to monitor agency progress  toward objectives. ONDCP also released the Plan in April 2011 and  agency officials described the process for developing the Plan as  collaborative. One official described the amount of brainstorming between  ONDCP and agencies in order to develop the Plan as \u201cunprecedented.\u201d  Finally, the Subcommittee on Prescription Drug Abuse was formed in the  summer of 2010. Officials explained that the Subcommittee provides a  more regular and formal means of coordination, whereas prior efforts to  coordinate within HHS were more irregular and informal. For instance, the  Subcommittee helped institutionalize relationships among officials who  work on prescription drug abuse and misuse across HHS. Officials noted  that although they were previously aware of subject experts at other  agencies, they now work together on related tasks through the  Subcommittee and therefore have formal working relationships which  they can draw on to work through issues. Subcommittee members added  that they use their meetings to share programming information. For  instance, prior to convening the Subcommittee, NIH officials told us that  they were not fully aware of all of the prescriber education efforts across  HHS agencies. Now, officials have created a group through the  Subcommittee to catalogue related prescriber education programs.", "While officials from each agency we spoke with said that these  coordination mechanisms were working well, ONDCP and other agency  officials indicated that they were aware of the potential for creating too  many coordinating bodies. Though the Strategy\u2019s Demand Reduction  Interagency Working Group, the Plan\u2019s new Federal Council on  Prescription Drug Abuse, and the HHS Subcommittee on Prescription  Drug Abuse may have membership from many of the same agencies,  officials said that they felt that they had not reached the point of too much  coordination, noting that current coordination efforts were effective in  terms of facilitating information sharing and avoiding overlapping  programming among agencies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Agencies Have Missed Opportunities to Leverage Resources among Efforts with Similar Goals", "paragraphs": ["Although agencies have increased their coordination efforts in recent  years, they have missed opportunities to leverage resources\u2014a key  practice for effective coordination\u2014among similar education efforts  targeting teens, which may have resulted in lost opportunities to obtain  additional benefits through coordination.

For instance, NIH formed a Teen Advisory  Group to pretest their messages and also seeks input from local high  school students, including groups such as Students Against Destructive  Decisions. These focus groups revealed information that could be useful  to other teen education efforts, addressing topics such as web and  materials design, video content, language and terminology, and  messaging. For instance, one focus group revealed that trying to imitate  the layout of social networking sites (e.g., MySpace or Facebook) did not  make sites more appealing to teen users.", "DEA, ONDCP, and SAMHSA also get feedback on their teen education  efforts. DEA gets feedback from the Drug Abuse Resistance Education\u2014 D.A.R.E.\u2014Youth Advisory Board on content for Just Think Twice and  also gets feedback from DEA field staff who give presentations to teens  about drug abuse. DEA officials told us that the feedback on the website  that they received from field staff often varies depending on the part of the  country in which the field staff give presentations in schools, with field  staff in San Diego reporting different successful approaches than those in  Miami. ONDCP also pretests content and features with teens. One lesson  derived from ONDCP\u2019s pretesting efforts is that teens liked the option to  view content posted by their peers on the website, such as photos or  stories. Finally, SAMHSA gets input from professional and student groups  through its Project Advisory Team for Not Worth the Risk; Even if it\u2019s  Legal. For instance, the Project Advisory Team advised SAMHSA on a  number of issues related to addressing prescription drug abuse and  misuse among teens, including the importance of acknowledging and  validating common stressors teens face in order to establish credibility  and to create an opportunity to address alternative coping skills.", "While each of these agencies obtained feedback on the messages for  and features of similar initiatives, agencies did not share the results of  their feedback sessions or pretesting efforts with officials from other  agencies who work on similar programs. Officials said they did not share  the feedback they received for two reasons. First, NIH, DEA, and  SAMHSA officials said that they were never asked to do so by other  agencies with similar education efforts. Second, ONDCP officials said that  they felt that the results of their pretesting would not be useful for other  educational efforts. Nonetheless, one official acknowledged that sharing  findings from pretesting efforts and other feedback sessions could have  been useful when developing the content and messages for their  educational effort.", "NIH officials said that there are two coordination mechanisms through  which they could share information among agencies involved with  educational efforts in the future.

The  agencies agree that education about prescription drug abuse and misuse  requires a different approach than other drug prevention efforts, but there  is a lack of proven strategies and messages on which agencies can  model their own educational efforts to ensure that such efforts will have  the desired outcome. In the absence of a strong evidence base,  establishing outcome metrics is an especially important key practice to  incorporate into the development of educational efforts because outcome  metrics provide feedback on the effectiveness of agencies\u2019 efforts at  preventing prescription pain reliever abuse and misuse. However, seven  of the nine public education efforts that we reviewed did not assess  program outcomes. This leaves federal agencies with limited knowledge  as to whether such efforts are effective.", "Given these challenges, there is much to be gained from continued and  robust coordination among similar education efforts about prescription  pain reliever abuse and misuse.

First, there are technical  challenges in developing formulations of prescription pain relievers that  deter abuse, but still have the intended effect of providing pain relief. For  example, it took Purdue Pharma L.P. approximately 9 years to develop a  reformulated version of OxyContin that both effectively provided pain  relief and displayed abuse-deterrent properties. Another challenge for  manufacturers relates to the extent to which they will be allowed to  market their new products as reducing or deterring abuse. FDA officials  told us that until postmarketing studies demonstrate a product\u2019s  effectiveness in reducing abuse in the general population, manufacturers  cannot market their products accordingly, but they are allowed to make  marketing claims based on the product\u2019s abuse-deterrent features as  demonstrated in clinical trials. For example, Embeda\u2019s label includes  information on the results of clinical trails testing its abuse-deterrent  features, but also states that the abuse-deterrent characteristics of the  product \u201chave not been shown to reduce the abuse liability of Embeda.\u201d", "Finally, a manufacturer indicated that insurers may be reluctant to provide  coverage for abuse-deterrent formulations of drugs when less expensive,  nondeterrent alternatives are available and that this could minimize their  usage and ultimately, their impact on abuse in the general population.", "FDA faces a number of challenges related to approving and assessing  the safety and effectiveness of abuse-deterrent formulations of  prescription pain relievers. According to FDA officials, one of these  challenges is balancing the abuse-deterrent properties of a drug with its  safety in the general patient population. Another challenge for FDA is  developing standards and methods for determining if the products are, in  fact, abuse deterrent. FDA officials told us that the agency is currently  developing guidance for manufacturers on the development of abuse- deterrent formulations and on the postmarket assessment of their  performance. However, officials told us that standard guidance is difficult  to develop because potential types of abuse-deterrent formulations are so  varied that the criteria used to evaluate one drug may not be applicable  for another. FDA indicated that it requires manufacturers of prescription  pain relievers that want to make abuse-deterrent claims about their  products to conduct postmarket epidemiological studies to assess the  effectiveness of their drugs in deterring abuse in the general population.  However, in developing methods for assessing the effectiveness of a  particular drug on deterring abuse, FDA officials told us that they, like  manufacturers, are challenged by limitations in available data. FDA  officials said that consistent and clear definitions of abuse across data  sources are lacking and that most data sources with information on  prescription pain reliever abuse do not distinguish between products from  different manufacturers, which can make it difficult to assess the  effectiveness of a specific drug in deterring abuse. For example, data  sources that measure abuse and its consequences may not distinguish  between OxyContin and other drugs that contain oxycodone. Further,  FDA is challenged in determining what degree of decrease in some  measurable outcomes of abuse would be sufficient to label a drug as  being able to reduce actual abuse.", "Finally, there are inherent challenges related to abuse-deterrent  formulations of prescription pain relievers and their overall impact on  abuse. First, a drug that deters one type of abuse might not necessarily  deter another type of abuse. For example, the new formulation of  OxyContin is designed to deter abuse via injection or snorting (see  sidebar), but is not a deterrent for those who abuse the product via oral  ingestion of whole tablets. A related challenge is that while technology  may deter the abuse of one particular prescription pain reliever, an  abuser may instead seek another prescription pain reliever (either a  different formulation of the same pain reliever or a different pain reliever  altogether) that is not designed to be abuse deterrent. An abuser may  even seek out another opioid, such as heroin."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: DEA Quotas for Controlled Substances", "paragraphs": ["As part of its responsibilities related to enforcing the Controlled  Substances Act, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) sets limits,  called quotas, on the quantity of schedule I and II controlled substances  that may be produced in the United States in any given calendar year.", "Quotas are a component of the closed system of distribution that exists  under the Controlled Substances Act. In this appendix, we present an  overview of the closed system, as well as information on the three types  of quotas: aggregate production quotas (APQ), bulk manufacturing  quotas, and procurement quotas. The information in this appendix is  based on our review of DEA documents and interviews with DEA officials."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Closed Distribution System", "paragraphs": ["Under the Controlled Substances Act, DEA maintains a closed system  requiring any person who manufactures, dispenses, imports, exports, or  conducts research with controlled substances to register with DEA  (unless exempt), periodically inventory all stocks of controlled  substances, provide effective security controls, and maintain records to  account for all controlled substances manufactured, imported, exported,  received, distributed, or otherwise disposed of. DEA officials said that the  closed system, including quotas, is designed to reduce the amount of  pharmaceuticals that are diverted for illicit purposes, while also ensuring  an adequate and uninterrupted supply of controlled substances for  legitimate medical needs. They said that both legitimate and illegitimate  users of prescription pain relievers often acquire the drugs from the same  source\u2014from doctors or other practitioners who prescribe or dispense  them. For example, diversion of prescription pain relievers may occur  through methods such as doctor shopping, thefts from medicine cabinets,  improper prescribing, and forged prescriptions.", "According to DEA, quotas are a tool used at the beginning of the closed  system to manage and prevent diversion of controlled substances, such  as the substances used to make prescription pain relievers, during their  legitimate scientific, medical, and industrial applications. While DEA is  authorized to control the overall amount of controlled substances  available, according to DEA officials, it is ultimately for practitioners and  their regulating bodies to ensure that these substances are prescribed  appropriately. While officials said that they do seek to account for known  diversion when setting APQs, they said that establishing quotas based on  known diversion for the purpose of reducing the availability of prescribed  drugs will not appreciably affect diversion at the retail level and may  prevent legitimate patients from having access to medication for  legitimate medical needs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Aggregate Production Quotas", "paragraphs": ["DEA officials said that the APQ is the first type of quota that DEA sets for   The APQ specifies the maximum amount of each basic class  each year.of controlled substance listed in schedule I or II that can be produced for  specified needs in the United States in a given year, thus limiting the  amount of bulk raw materials available for use in the manufacture of  prescription pain relievers. For example, methadone is a controlled  substance that is used in the manufacture of drugs for addiction treatment  as well as in the manufacture of the prescription pain relievers Dolophine  and Methadose, and multiple generic equivalents. In 2010, DEA set the  final APQ for methadone at 20,000,000 grams. Therefore, this is the  maximum amount of methadone that could be available for manufacturing  addiction treatment drugs and prescription pain relievers that use this  substance, as well as for other authorized uses, in the United States in  2010.", "DEA officials said that they consider data from many sources when  determining the APQ, including estimates of the legitimate medical need  for each substance from FDA, estimates of retail consumption based on  prescriptions dispensed from IMS Health, companies\u2019 production history  and forecasts, data from DEA\u2019s own internal system for tracking  controlled substances transactions, and past quota histories for each  substance.professional expertise and experience when considering all available data  to recommend the appropriate APQ for a substance. DEA then publishes  the proposed APQ for each substance for the following calendar year in  the Federal Register, and, after receiving and reviewing comments, DEA  publishes a final order determining the APQ for that year. DEA can revise  the APQ midyear if legitimate changes in U.S. manufacturing  requirements, such as increased sales or exports, new manufacturers  entering the market, new product development, or product recalls,  warrant a change. For example, in 2010, DEA revised the APQ for  methadone, decreasing it from an initial APQ of 25,000,000 grams to the  revised APQ of 20,000,000 grams.", "DEA officials said that DEA scientists draw on their  Officials said that when determining the APQ they also consider losses of  controlled substances that occur through diversion activities by  considering known and reported thefts and losses, case seizures, and  information from national databases of drug evidence, such as analysis  from DEA and other forensic laboratories and law enforcement entities.  DEA can reduce the APQ based on the quantity of seized or diverted  material. The APQ may also be decreased because of DEA enforcement  actions that impact sales data, such as by shutting down rogue pain  clinics, thus reducing the amount of controlled substances purchased by  such entities. DEA officials said that because sales data are one factor  considered in determining APQ, these actions may ultimately lead to a  reduction in the APQ. DEA said that in rare instances the APQ may also  be increased as a result of diversion activities. For example, if a large  quantity of a controlled substance is stolen from a manufacturer, the APQ  may need to be raised to ensure that sufficient quantities of that  substance will be available to meet the nation\u2019s ongoing legitimate  medical needs. When determining the following year\u2019s APQ, DEA  considers such circumstances to ensure that the APQ remains at an  appropriate level to meet legitimate need and may reduce the APQ in  relation to the previous year\u2019s to account for the known diversion."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Bulk Manufacturing Quotas and Procurement Quotas", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the APQ, DEA sets two types of quotas for individual  companies: bulk manufacturing quotas and procurement quotas. Bulk  manufacturing quotas limit the amount of a basic class of schedule I or II  controlled substance that an individual company can extract or synthesize  from plant material or other controlled substances. According to DEA  officials, once the initial APQ for a substance for a calendar year is set by  DEA, individual companies apply to DEA for bulk manufacturing quotas  for specific controlled substances to produce the bulk raw materials that  are used in prescription pain relievers for that same year. Officials said  that separate quotas are issued for each DEA-registered facility that  manufactures a controlled substance, even if the same company  operates multiple manufacturing facilities. In 2010, five facilities received  bulk manufacturing quotas for methadone. The quota levels ranged  between 4 grams at the low end and 12,000,000 grams at the highest  levels. The sum of the bulk manufacturing quotas for all companies for a  particular controlled substance cannot exceed the APQ for that substance  in a given year.", "DEA officials said that they use a variety of data sources\u2014including  internal DEA data, IMS Health data, and data provided by the company\u2014 to determine the bulk manufacturing quota for a company. DEA\u2019s Office of  Diversion Control also reviews the company for any pending  administrative, civil, or criminal action. DEA officials said that DEA  scientists draw on their professional expertise and experience when  considering all available data to recommend an appropriate bulk  manufacturing quota, which is then issued to the company by letter. Bulk  manufacturing quotas can be revised through a process similar to that  used in setting the initial quotas, in that a company submits an application  to revise its quota and must include supporting documentation. DEA  officials said that DEA does not generally initiate changes to bulk  manufacturing quotas on its own.", "DEA also establishes procurement quotas, which limit the amount of a  basic class of schedule I or II controlled substance that an individual  company can procure from a manufacturer of bulk raw materials in order  to manufacture individual dosage units of a medicine, such as a  prescription pain reliever. Individual companies must apply to DEA for  procurement quotas for each specific basic class of controlled substance,  and DEA officials told us that separate quotas are issued for each facility  that procures a controlled substance. For example, according to DEA  data, 52 facilities received procurement quotas for methadone in 2010.  The quota levels ranged between 1 gram at the low end and 9,000,000  grams at the highest levels. Sometimes an individual company may be  engaged in both bulk manufacturing and procurement activities for the  same controlled substance. In this case, the company will apply for both a  bulk manufacturing quota and a procurement quota. DEA officials said  they use the same process and data sources, as described above, to  determine appropriate levels for procurement quotas as for bulk  manufacturing quotas.", "Officials said that DEA does not always set a company\u2019s bulk  manufacturing quota or procurement quota at the level the company  requested. For example, if a registrant is suspected of unlawfully diverting  controlled substances, DEA will take this factor into consideration when  determining whether to grant or deny the quota request. In addition, DEA  may set the quota lower than requested if a company has set its quota  request based on projected sales figures, which can inflate the quantity of  quota requested, rather than on actual sales figures. DEA officials said  that the agency uses actual sales and inventory figures in their evaluation  of bulk manufacturing or procurement quota applications, and they grant  quotas in line with legitimate medical need. In the past, we have reported  that DEA cited difficulties in determining an appropriate level for quotas to  ensure that adequate quantities are available for legitimate medical need,  as there are not direct measures available to establish legitimate medical  need. DEA officials said that, based on the available prescription and  sales data, there is no method to calculate which prescriptions are issued  for a legitimate medical purpose by a practitioner acting in the usual  course of professional practice and which are not. They noted that if DEA  were to reduce a quota level by some percentage to account for  estimated illegitimate prescriptions or to otherwise reduce a quota by an  amount estimating how much of the substance is abused and misused,  the action would only reduce the total amount of substance available for  dispensing, and would not affect to whom or in what quantities the drugs  are prescribed or dispensed. Therefore, DEA officials said that a  reduction in the supply of a drug based upon estimated illegitimate  prescriptions or abuse and misuse could result in a shortage of the  substance for legitimate purposes, while not affecting illicit demand for the  substance at all.

For each sample  hospital, a trained DAWN reporter conducts a retrospective review of a  random sample of emergency department medical records to identify  emergency department visits that involved recent drug use. The number  of visits may not directly represent the number of individuals who have  visited emergency departments in a given year, since some patients may  have more than one visit in a year. Emergency department medical  records may vary in specificity and detail. For example, prescription pain  reliever abuse and misuse may be overreported if the medical record is  unclear about whether an individual was abusing or misusing a  prescription pain reliever, or taking it as prescribed while abusing or  misusing another drug. Conversely, prescription pain reliever abuse and  misuse may be underreported if the abuse or misuse of a regularly  prescribed prescription pain reliever is not recognized or documented by  the clinician.

NVSS data on overdoses includes  both the mechanism of injury leading to death (such as poisoning by  certain substances) and the manner or intent, including unintentional,  suicide, homicide, undetermined, and legal intervention or war. Although  CDC sometimes reports on all manners of overdose deaths combined,  we focused only on unintentional deaths because it matches most closely  with our definition of abuse and misuse. CDC officials said that some  jurisdictions may undercount unintentional overdose deaths involving  prescription pain relievers because of inconsistent use of toxicological lab  tests, which may result in listing a death as a drug overdose death with no  drugs specified on the death certificate, and other inconsistencies among  jurisdictions, such as how they determine whether deaths are  unintentional.inclusion in this report.", "NVSS data for 2009 were not published in time for  TEDS, compiled by SAMHSA, gathers data on admissions to substance  abuse treatment facilities nationwide, including data about the substances  being abused by the person being admitted to treatment, such as  prescription pain relievers.

In general, facilities reporting TEDS data are those that receive  state alcohol or drug agency funds (including federal block grant funds)  for the provision of alcohol or drug treatment services. Data about  admissions are initially gathered by the facilities themselves and then  collected by states and transmitted to a national data center. The number  of admissions does not directly represent the number of individuals who  have been admitted to treatment in a given year, because an individual  admitted to treatment twice within a calendar year would be counted as  two admissions. While treatment facilities included in TEDS account for a  significant portion of treatment admissions nationwide, SAMHSA officials  told us that no nationwide estimates are available of admissions to  private, for-profit facilities or on the number of individuals being treated for  substance abuse by physicians who have been approved to  independently treat opioid addiction in an office-based setting. Therefore,  SAMHSA officials told us that TEDS data underreport the number of  individuals seeking treatment for prescription pain reliever abuse and  misuse in the United States, especially among populations that have the  resources to seek treatment from private facilities or physicians.

These national estimates are produced from  data NSDUH collects through a national household survey, which  involves in-person interviews with sampled respondents.
