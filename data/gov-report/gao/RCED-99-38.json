In October 1997, minority farmers filed a class action lawsuit that charged USDA with discrimination in lending and other departmental farm programs between 1983 and 1997 and failure to investigate discrimination complaints. In addition, recent legislation would enable past complainants either to bring suit or to obtain a departmental hearing on the record. This legislation waives the statute of limitations for suits alleging discrimination between 1981 and 1996 that were filed with the Department before July 1, 1997.", "Concerned about allegations of discrimination, the Secretary of Agriculture, in December 1996, appointed the Civil Rights Action Team to review civil rights issues and develop recommendations to address institutional problems.

The report made 92 recommendations to address four major problem areas: (1) the organizational structure of civil rights, (2) the lack of management commitment to civil rights, (3) program delivery and outreach, and (4) workforce diversity and employment practices. Shortly after the report was issued, the Secretary established a Civil Rights Implementation Team to implement the report\u2019s recommendations.

In addition, most USDA agencies had their own civil rights offices that performed some complaint-processing functions. According to the report, this fragmentation of responsibilities left employees and customers (such as farmers) confused about where to go for help.", "In March 1997, USDA consolidated its departmental civil rights functions under a new Office of Civil Rights (OCR).

Furthermore, USDA has not used ADR in addressing program complaints, even though its use is called for in OCR\u2019s operations manual.", "ADR uses a variety of dispute resolution techniques that usually involve intervention or facilitation by a neutral third party. These techniques range from more formal approaches\u2014such as management review boards and arbitration, when a neutral party typically rules on the merits of the disputants\u2019 positions and imposes a solution\u2014to less formal techniques\u2014such as mediation, when a neutral third party helps craft a solution to the dispute. When used early in a dispute, before positions solidify, mediation can resolve workplace disputes before they become formal complaints, thus helping to reduce complaint-processing workloads. For example, a 1996 EEOC study concluded that a sizable number of federal employment discrimination complaints may not involve discrimination issues at all but basic communication problems for which mediation may be appropriate.", "Recent laws and regulations have supported the use of ADR in resolving federal workplace disputes. For example, the Administrative Dispute Resolution Act of 1990 gave federal agencies the authority to use ADR to supplement existing methods of resolving disputes. The act required federal agencies to develop policies for using ADR while providing maximum agency flexibility on whether and how ADR should be used. The act\u2019s coverage was broadened with the passage of the 1996 Alternative Dispute Resolution Act. In 1992, EEOC added provisions to its employment complaint regulations encouraging the use of ADR in all stages of the complaint process. And, in February 1998, EEOC issued a proposed rule, which has not been made final, that will require all agencies to make ADR available to employees at the informal complaint stage. This rule is intended to reduce the number of workplace disputes entering into the formal employment complaint process.", "USDA has used several forms of ADR, primarily in the formal stages of the employment complaint process. In 1994, the Department established dispute resolution boards to address the growing volume of employment complaints. The boards, which were discontinued in April 1997, conducted hearings on about 12 to 15 percent of all employment cases, assessed the cases, and tried to formally resolve them. A USDA evaluation found that while the boards helped settle formal complaints, they were flawed. The evaluation noted that the boards were labor-intensive, were expensive, and did not address disputes early enough or deal with the underlying issues of the complaints. Moreover, supervisors said that the boards undermined their authority and that a \u201csettle-at-all-costs\u201d policy encouraged employees to file complaints.", "Several USDA agencies have also used mediation to help settle formal employment complaints. From October 1997 through January 1998, the Forest Service, in conjunction with the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Administration, used outside professional mediation to address its backlog of unresolved employment complaints. About two-thirds of the backlog was resolved through settlements with complainants. However, the Forest Service\u2019s report on the initiative noted that many of the complaints could have been resolved much earlier (or may not have been filed at all) if managers had done a better job of managing conflict at the outset. During 1998, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service and FSA also used mediation to settle employment cases.", "Recognizing that USDA needed to address workplace disputes before they escalated into formal complaints, the Secretary issued a memorandum in May 1996 directing each USDA agency or mission area to develop an ADR-based conflict resolution program outside of the formal employment complaint process by November 30, 1996. However, as of October 1, 1998, USDA had only five ADR programs. These programs cover (1) all employees in 6 of USDA\u2019s 17 agencies, (2) employees in two regions of one agency, and (3) some employees in one Department-level office. The Assistant Secretary for Administration issued a guide to conflict resolution programs in October 1996. However, several agencies were waiting for an official USDA policy statement before they developed their own ADR programs. On December 21, 1998, the Secretary of Agriculture issued a conflict management policy. Detailed guidance to agency heads regarding implementation of the policy is expected to be issued by early February 1999.", "In another effort to expand the use of conflict resolution programs, USDA established a Conflict Prevention and Resolution Center in March 1998. The center\u2019s mission is to coordinate USDA\u2019s ADR and conflict prevention efforts, thereby providing a forum for addressing workplace conflict that may or may not involve discrimination. The center, however, has not been fully funded or staffed; current staffing is limited to a director and a secretary. According to the Director, as of November 25, 1998, he had received authority to hire one conflict management specialist. In addition, up to three additional specialists may be hired, depending on funding availability in fiscal year 1999. The Conflict Prevention and Resolution Center is responsible for leading the Department\u2019s conflict management program.", "In addition to using ADR for employment complaints, some federal agencies use ADR programs to resolve disputes relating to agency programs or activities. As previously discussed, OCR\u2019s operations manual for program complaints calls for complainants to be offered mediation early in the complaint process. However, USDA officials said that mediation is not being offered as part of the new program complaint process and that it would be necessary to conduct a mediation pilot before implementing a full-scale mediation program. Although USDA officials acknowledge that mediation can potentially reduce the number of program-related complaints, little progress has been made in developing a mediation pilot program.

As a result, USDA continues to exceed the EEOC time frames for processing employment complaints and to miss important interim time frames in its program complaint process. Clearly, USDA\u2019s civil rights program has a long way to go before it will achieve the Secretary\u2019s goal of making USDA the civil rights leader in the federal government.", "The additional expertise brought to the program complaint process, the plans of OCR\u2019s Director to improve training for civil rights employees, and the actions under way to replace 36 OCR employees who lack adequate civil rights expertise should, if effectively implemented, help enhance staff expertise and strengthen OCR\u2019s complaint-processing capabilities. At the same time, however, USDA must make a concerted effort to address the remaining long-standing problems that have contributed to the processing delays. For example, while USDA may not be able to eliminate management turnover, the impact of this turnover can be ameliorated by having clear, up-to-date guidance and procedures. Such guidance and procedures would promote departmentwide compliance with, and standardization and effective enforcement of, civil rights statutes and EEOC regulations.", "Similarly, we believe that improved working relationships between OCR and other USDA organizations can be facilitated by implementing processes to ensure appropriate consultation at key points in the development of new policies and processes. Unless OCR officials make a conscientious effort to effectively communicate with these organizations, their roles and responsibilities will not be clearly understood and their compliance will remain problematical.", "An ADR program can help reduce the number of employment complaints. This program would relieve OCR of some of the burdens imposed by its large caseload and enable it to focus on streamlining its employment complaint process to make it more timely. For this to happen, however, USDA will need to ensure that ADR is effectively implemented departmentwide as a means of informally resolving workplace disputes. In addition, ADR offers the potential for early resolution of program cases\u2014an area in which ADR is not being used.", "Finally, it is important for OCR managers and staff to keep in mind the importance of their mission.
