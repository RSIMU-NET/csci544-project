The exact number of homeless is unknown, but on any given night an estimated 500,000 to 600,000 homeless people live on the streets or in shelters. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) reports that approximately one-third of the adult homeless population are veterans, and these homeless veterans suffer with about the same relatively high rates of psychiatric and substance abuse disorders as the general homeless population. Over the past decade or so, VA established programs to address the needs of homeless veterans and, in fiscal year 1997, obligated approximately $84 million on targeted homeless programs. Other federal departments and agencies have also developed programs aimed at assisting the homeless. In fiscal year 1997, the Departments of Education, Health and Human Services (HHS), Housing and Urban Development (HUD), Labor, and VA, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency obligated approximately $1.2 billion on targeted homeless assistance.", "Despite these programs, homelessness remains a persistent problem, prompting questions about the effectiveness of efforts to assist the homeless. For this reason, you asked us to (1) describe VA\u2019s homeless programs, (2) determine what VA knows about the effectiveness of its homeless programs, and (3) examine promising approaches aimed at different groups of homeless veterans.", "To develop this information, we conducted work at VA headquarters and VA\u2019s Northeast Program Evaluation Center (NEPEC) in West Haven, Conn. We also reviewed reports from federally funded research and visited VA and community-based homeless programs that illustrate approaches to dealing with different homeless populations in Little Rock, Ark.; Denver, Colo.; Washington, D.C.; West Los Angeles and San Diego, Calif.; and New York, N.Y. We performed our work between April 1998 and January 1999 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. (App. I contains a more detailed discussion of our scope and methodology, and app. VI contains detailed descriptions of programs we visited that were designed for different homeless groups.)"], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["In July 1987, the Congress responded to the problems of homelessness by enacting several laws addressing different aspects of the problem. The most comprehensive of these was the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act (P.L. 100-77). Combined, the more than 20 McKinney Act grant programs funded activities that provided homeless men, women, and children with supportive services such as emergency food and shelter, surplus goods and property, transitional housing, primary health care services, and mental health care. The remaining McKinney Act grant programs and authorities are administered by five different departments\u2014Education, HHS, HUD, Labor, and VA\u2014and one agency, the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Since fiscal year 1987, federal funding for targeted homeless assistance has increased dramatically, from $490 million to more than $1.2 billion in fiscal year 1997.", "Veterans constitute about one-third of the homeless adult population in the United States on any given day. They form a heterogeneous group and are likely to have multiple needs. For example, VA estimates that approximately one-half of homeless veterans have a substance abuse problem, approximately one-third have a serious mental illness (of those, about half also have a substance abuse problem), and many have other medical problems. Some homeless veterans need assistance in obtaining benefits, managing their finances, resolving legal matters, developing work skills, or obtaining employment. Many require some form of transitional housing before a more permanent housing arrangement can be achieved. For some homeless veterans, independent housing and economic self-support are reasonable goals. But for others, including many seriously mentally ill homeless persons, neither full-time work nor independent housing may be feasible. Instead, for these individuals, relative stability in a supportive environment such as a group home may be the most reasonable outcome. Thus, efforts to assist the homeless require a range of housing options (including emergency shelter as well as transitional and permanent housing); treatment for medical, mental health, and substance abuse problems; and supportive services such as transportation and case management. This spectrum of options is referred to as the continuum of care.", "Homeless veterans are eligible for health care through the VA by virtue of their status as veterans, but in addition, VA has established programs specifically for homeless veterans. Two major VA homeless programs, Health Care for Homeless Veterans (HCHV) and Domiciliary Care for Homeless Veterans (DCHV), were created as a result of legislative actions taken during 1987 to address the needs of homeless veterans. The goal of these programs is to outreach and identify homeless veterans, assess their needs, and link them with VA or community-based programs for services, as appropriate.", "The HCHV and DCHV programs are both managed by the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) but under the auspices of different health care groups within VHA. HCHV programs are under the jurisdiction of VHA\u2019s Strategic Health Care Group for Mental Health Services; the DCHV program is directed by VHA\u2019s Geriatrics and Extended Care Strategic Health Care Group. VA\u2019s annual obligations for its targeted homeless programs increased from $10 million in fiscal year 1987 to approximately $84 million in fiscal year 1997. During this period, VA has obligated over $640 million for its targeted homeless programs. Since the inception of VA\u2019s homeless programs, VA has served over 250,000 veterans.", "VA\u2019s NEPEC monitors and evaluates VA\u2019s homeless programs using data it collects and analyzes from program sites. NEPEC generally issues annual reports for VA\u2019s homeless programs that include some outcome measures such as whether a veteran is housed or employed upon leaving a program.", "With the reorganization of VHA into networks in 1995, headquarters oversight has been decentralized, and control of oversight and funding of the homeless programs has shifted to the local level. Specifically, VA organized its health care system to give greater authority and control to 22 Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN) and medical center managers. Headquarters program officials have now assumed a largely consultative role. Currently, all 22 VISNs participate in a Council of Network Homeless Coordinators to advise VA headquarters and VISN directors on issues related to the delivery and evaluation of homeless services to veterans.", "In its fiscal year 2000 budget request, VA revised its strategic planning and performance measurement processes under the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 by adding performance measures related to outcomes for veterans served by its homeless programs. These outcome measures, which are already monitored by NEPEC, address the percentage of veterans who have independent living arrangements and employment upon their discharge from VA or from community-based contract residential care programs. Beyond these outcome measures, VA has three process goals: to increase (1) the number of community-based beds for homeless veterans, (2) VA facilities\u2019 efforts to coordinate with other providers of homeless services, and (3) the number of homeless veterans treated in VA\u2019s health care system."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VA Provides Key Services, Builds Capacity Through Partnerships", "paragraphs": ["VA provides services to homeless veterans through targeted homeless programs across the United States.

VA initially funded 43 HCHV program sites to contract with community-based providers for residential treatment and rehabilitation of mentally ill (including substance abusing) veterans. VA currently operates 73 HCHV program sites, 62 of which offer residential treatment for the homeless chronically mentally ill (HCMI), generally for less than 6 months. HCHV staff conduct outreach at community-based homeless service providers such as shelters, soup kitchens, and other places frequented by the homeless.", "HCHV staff also serve as case managers for homeless veterans. Case management services are provided to maintain continuity of care and assist veterans in obtaining needed services by referring them to VA and non-VA sources that can address their needs for medical and psychiatric treatment, social and work rehabilitation, income support, housing, and other services. In addition, HCHV staff are responsible for monitoring the services provided each veteran participating in the residential treatment component of the program. During fiscal year 1997, the 73 HCHV program sites served 35,059 homeless veterans.", "The HCMI program is the core homeless program under the HCHV umbrella. The service delivery arrangements and treatment received by veterans participating in the HCMI program vary across sites. VA headquarters allows each site some flexibility in operating its program. Arrangements for using community-based residential treatment facilities for care and rehabilitation vary, in part, as a function of the availability of VA and community resources. Accordingly, the HCMI per diem rates paid by VA vary across community-based providers, depending on the type of services and the geographic location. In fiscal year 1997, veterans received treatment for an average of 73 days; the HCMI per diems ranged from approximately $15 to over $70, and the average daily rate was $38.58.", "Unlike the HCMI program, which was designed to rely on community-based residential treatment facilities, the DCHV program is primarily housed on the grounds of VA medical centers. Most DCHV program sites are located in existing VA domiciliaries. DCHV is a hospital-based program that uses interdisciplinary treatment to provide services to homeless veterans with varying medical, substance abuse, and mental health problems. The number of DCHV sites has increased from 20 to 35 in the 12 years since the program\u2019s inception in 1987.", "The DCHV program focuses on rehabilitation. Basic services provided by the DCHV program include (1) outreach at some sites to identify underserved homeless veterans, (2) time-limited residential treatment that offers medical and psychiatric services, and job counseling and placement services, and (3) postdischarge community support and aftercare. In fiscal year 1997, the DCHV program discharged 4,619 homeless veterans from treatment in its 1,587 beds nationwide. Veterans received treatment for an average of about 116 days at a cost to VA of approximately $70 per day. The locations of the HCMI and DCHV sites are shown in figure 1. (See app. II for a summary of HCHV and DCHV program locations.)", "Over time, VA has developed new programs and approaches to complement the HCMI and DCHV programs and provide services that are more integrated, longer term, and more intensive (see table 1). For example, homeless veterans participating in VA\u2019s Supported Housing program are provided on-going case management services by HCHV staff for an extended period. Moreover, these efforts involve partnerships with other federal agencies to assist homeless veterans in obtaining housing and other benefits.

Although VA does not know the extent to which its annual health care appropriations are spent on medical care and other treatment services for homeless veterans, recent estimates suggest that the amount spent on these health care services far exceeds the approximately $84 million VA used for its targeted homeless programs. NEPEC estimated that in fiscal year 1995 VA spent $404 million on inpatient general psychiatry and substance abuse services for homeless veterans, representing approximately 26 percent of all inpatient VA mental health expenditures. Cost estimates are unavailable for other health care expenditures, but NEPEC estimated that homeless veterans occupied 5 percent of the inpatient medical and surgical beds during fiscal year 1996. Moreover, these estimates do not account for primary care and other outpatient medical services rendered to homeless veterans at VA\u2019s 173 hospitals and over 400 outpatient clinics nationwide."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VA Homeless Programs Exist at Selected Locations With Limited Capacity", "paragraphs": ["Although VA has developed a number of programs to assist homeless veterans, VA acknowledges that it alone cannot meet all their needs. These programs are not available in all locations and, where available, capacity for residential treatment is limited.", "VA\u2019s homeless programs are available at selected locations. HCMI and DCHV homeless program sites were established on a voluntary basis; interested medical centers submitted proposals and those ranked highest by VA headquarters were initially funded. VA\u2019s homeless programs vary dramatically in terms of the number of sites available to treat homeless veterans. For example, VISN 3 is the only network to have at least one site for each of VA\u2019s homeless programs. As shown in table 2, the number of sites provided by each of VA\u2019s programs ranges from 4 to 62.", "In those locations that have an HCMI or DCHV program, residential capacity is limited. For example, the HCHV site in Washington, D.C.\u2014a city with a homeless veteran population ranging from an estimated 3,300 to 6,700\u2014served 963 homeless veterans during fiscal year 1997, of whom 31 were treated in the HCMI residential component. Of the 30,857 homeless veterans contacted nationwide at the 62 HCHV sites with an HCMI residential treatment program, only 4,317 were placed in VA contracted residential treatment during fiscal year 1997\u2014an average of 70 homeless veterans per site.", "Similarly, the DCHV program has limited inpatient capacity. For example, VISN 14, which covers parts of five states, including most of Iowa and Nebraska, has one homeless program: a homeless domiciliary at the Des Moines VA hospital with 20 beds that served 56 veterans during fiscal year 1997. In another instance, VISN 11, which includes urban cities such as Detroit, Mich., and Indianapolis, Ind., has no DCHV beds. In sum, the 35 DCHV program sites operated 1,587 beds and discharged 4,619 veterans from treatment in fiscal year 1997.

This commitment to community-based providers is reflected in VA\u2019s long-range strategic planning. One such goal under the Results Act is to maximize participation in Community Homelessness Assessment, Local Education and Networking Groups (CHALENG) by increasing VA medical facility participation to 100 percent by fiscal year 2001. In response to the requirement to encourage coordination in Veterans\u2019 Medical Programs Amendments of 1992 (P.L. 102-405), VA homeless staff began holding annual CHALENG meetings to better coordinate with other homeless providers and organizations. For example, in 1997, nearly 2,000 service providers attended CHALENG meetings nationwide and completed surveys about the extent to which specific needs were being met. Once local needs are prioritized, VA collaborates with community providers to resolve any community resource problems. This collaborative effort provides a forum for VA to work with its non-VA partners to assess, plan for, and address the needs of homeless veterans. Since the inception of the CHALENG initiative in fiscal year 1994, most medical centers have participated in the process. In fiscal year 1998, VA reported that 88 percent of its medical facilities conducted their annual CHALENG meetings.", "Also, the Congress authorized VA to establish alternative housing programs for homeless veterans through partnerships with nonprofit or local government agencies. As a result, VA created the Homeless Providers Grant and per Diem (GPD) program to award grants and per diem payments to public and nonprofit organizations that establish and operate new supportive housing and services for homeless veterans. Between fiscal years 1994 and 1998, 127 grants were awarded to 103 nonprofit and state or local government agencies, providing in excess of $26 million. Grant moneys have been awarded to recipients in 39 states and the District of Columbia; all 22 VISNs have at least one GPD recipient in their jurisdiction. Once grants awarded during the first 5 years become fully operational, VA estimates that over 2,700 new community-based transitional housing beds will be available for homeless veterans.", "Finally, in the Veterans Programs Enhancement Act of 1998, VA received authority to make $100 million in guaranteed loans over a 3-year period to qualified organizations.

To account for homeless veterans who are particularly difficult to treat, data regarding status at discharge are adjusted for patient characteristics that influence treatment results, such as age or number of medical problems.

From these data, 32 indicators have been selected as \u201ccritical monitors\u201d of site performance. These measures reflect four different categories of information about sites: (1) program structure (for example, the average number of days veterans spend in residential treatment and the average number of unique veterans served by each clinical staff member); (2) patient characteristics (for example, the percentage of veterans served who were not literally homeless at the time of intake and the percentage of veterans served who were diagnosed with a serious mental illness or substance abuse disorder); (3) program process measures which indicate how the program operates (for example, percentage of veterans served who were contacted by outreach and the percentage of veterans inappropriately placed in residential treatment); and (4) status at discharge (for example, percentages of veterans who report being housed and employed at discharge). Appendix IV contains a complete list of the 32 HCHV critical monitors.", "In fiscal year 1997, 35,059 veterans were served through HCHV programs. Of the 3,883 veterans discharged from residential treatment facilities in fiscal year 1997, 52 percent were considered to have successfully completed the program (that is, the veteran and clinician agreed that program goals had been met); 39 percent reported having their own apartment, room, or house at discharge; 43 percent reported having full- or part-time employment at discharge; 73 percent were rated as showing improvement in drug problems; and 74 percent were rated as showing improvement in mental health problems. Under most circumstances, NEPEC data regarding status at discharge are obtained from veterans who have completed residential treatment. In some cases, however, HCMI pays for only part of a veteran\u2019s residential treatment program, and the veteran remains in treatment after discharge from the HCMI program. In these instances, the veteran\u2019s status upon completion of residential treatment (which may occur some time later) is not captured in the NEPEC data.", "NEPEC also monitors the performance of the 35 DCHV sites using data gathered when veterans are admitted to the program and their status at the time of discharge.

Moreover, NEPEC has only limited information about what aspects of its programs are most beneficial for certain veterans. Finally, NEPEC has little information about whether its programs are more beneficial than other strategies for helping the homeless. Evaluation research (including follow-up) is difficult and expensive to conduct on this hard-to-serve population. However, VA\u2019s fiscal year 2000 budget request contains an additional $50 million to expand VA\u2019s homeless programs and monitoring and evaluation efforts.", "VA has acknowledged the need for program evaluation and now includes a plan for program evaluation in its strategic plan. However, NEPEC officials told us that their primary emphasis is to monitor the performance of program sites, rather than to evaluate the effectiveness of treatments or programs. These monitoring activities provide information about program operations. As a result, NEPEC does not typically examine outcomes in a way that clarifies what aspects of treatment are associated with positive results for different clinical groups (for example, those with serious mental illnesses or those with a substance abuse disorder). NEPEC officials periodically supplement their data files with additional information (for example, about treatment approaches) and then conduct analyses that distinguish clinical subgroups. These findings are often published in academic journals. For example, one study looked at outcomes for dually diagnosed veterans (that is, those with both a serious psychiatric disorder and a substance abuse problem), comparing those in programs that specialize in substance abuse treatment with those treated in integrated programs that simultaneously address both psychiatric and substance abuse problems. Although differences between the two types of programs were modest, results suggested that those in integrated treatment programs were more likely than those in the substance abuse programs to be discharged to housing in the community rather than to an institutional setting.", "Currently, NEPEC does not conduct follow-up of veterans who have left the DCHV or HCMI programs. Follow-up is needed to determine whether veterans are still employed, housed, or successfully dealing with substance abuse or mental health problems after program completion and thereby to estimate the duration of any positive effects. Other research efforts involving the homeless that have included follow-up data suggest that positive outcomes observed at discharge are not necessarily sustained.", "Between 1987 and 1990, in order to evaluate the benefits associated with program participation, NEPEC conducted pilot follow-up projects at nine HCMI and three DCHV sites. NEPEC reported that veterans were substantially better off 3 months after discharge from DCHV treatment than when they were admitted to the program. Improvements were noted in housing, income, employment, substance abuse, and psychiatric functioning. Similarly, veterans who participated in the HCMI study exhibited improvements on follow-up (assessed from 1 month to 2 years after intake, with an average of 8.3 months) compared with intake in housing, employment, psychiatric problems, and substance abuse. For example, 73 percent of the veterans reported that they had spent no days homeless during the 90 days prior to their interview. The HCMI study stated that veterans derived substantial benefit from their participation in this program.", "While these follow-up studies were a major undertaking, NEPEC reports on these studies cite two major shortcomings. First, interview data were not collected from a fully representative sample. Of veterans who agreed to participate in these studies, follow-up interviews were conducted with 67 percent in the DCHV study and 72 percent in the HCMI study. Although the status of those veterans who were not reinterviewed is not known, it cannot be ruled out that the veterans who were doing the poorest were also the least likely to be reinterviewed. As a result, the data from those who were reinterviewed could suggest more positive outcomes than is true for the program as a whole. Second, no control or comparison groups were studied. Data from such groups would allow an estimate of the degree of improvement attributable to the DCHV or HCMI programs. In other words, it is possible that some of the improvements noted among those veterans who were reinterviewed would have occurred in the absence of DCHV or HCMI treatment. Research suggests that some improvement over time is likely among the homeless even in the absence of intensive treatment. Without data from an appropriate comparison group of veterans who were not served through VA\u2019s homeless programs, VA cannot determine how much additional benefit the veterans derived from those programs.", "NEPEC officials stated that they have not conducted additional follow-up studies on the HCMI and DCHV programs because such information is difficult and expensive to obtain on this hard-to-serve population. A NEPEC official estimated that if they were to conduct another follow-up study for the HCMI program, the cost would be about $60,000 per site with an approximate annual total cost of $600,000."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Limited Data but Some Approaches for Different Groups Appear Promising", "paragraphs": ["Approaches to homelessness vary with the needs (for example, medical, mental health, substance abuse, or other problems) of the subgroup being served. Although many questions about how to help the homeless remain unanswered, a series of research initiatives launched in 1982 and funded primarily by HHS have begun to shed light on the issues; and initial findings from a few projects are promising. These efforts suggest that effective interventions for the homeless involve comprehensive, integrated treatments. These initiatives also suggest that a range of housing, treatment, and supportive-service options need to be included within a continuum of care for the homeless.", "As early as 1982, but particularly in response to the McKinney Act in 1987, HHS funded several major research initiatives to learn more about homelessness in general and about treatments for the mentally ill or substance abusing homeless in particular. These efforts involved epidemiological studies to identify the homeless and their needs, demonstration projects to explore promising strategies for helping the homeless, and outcome evaluations to assess the effectiveness of selected programs. Cross-site analyses addressed overarching questions; and procedures for sharing information, such as conferences and an information clearinghouse, were established. Many questions remain unanswered, but several broad themes have emerged from these efforts. In addition, these research programs indicate that although it can be difficult to study homeless populations, such research can be done and can include follow-ups.", "This body of research indicates that effective treatment for the homeless requires comprehensive, integrated services. Although meeting the most basic needs of a homeless person for food, clothing, and shelter is a first step, it is rarely sufficient to enable a person to exit homelessness. Instead, progress in achieving housing stability requires comprehensive attention to the full range of a homeless person\u2019s needs, addressing basic needs (such as shelter, food, and clothing), medical and mental health needs (including dental and eye care), and supportive services (such as transportation, assistance in obtaining benefits, and child care if necessary). Thus, as examples, untreated mental illness may interfere with a person\u2019s ability to retain housing, and lack of transportation may limit access to medical appointments or job interviews.", "Moreover, research suggests that positive outcomes are promoted by integration of services. Attempts to address the needs of a homeless person one by one, or in parallel but without coordination, seem less effective than strategies that involve integrated efforts to address multiple needs. For example, homeless persons who have both a mental illness and a substance abuse problem seem to benefit more from integrated treatment programs than from programs that approach these problems separately. Similarly, the effectiveness of employment and training programs for the homeless is enhanced by linkage to housing assistance and supportive services. The importance of integration is attributable in part to fragmentation of the homeless service-delivery system, so that addressing a homeless person\u2019s needs often requires multiple organizations. Case managers may facilitate integration by helping the homeless obtain services in ways that complement rather than conflict with one another. In addition, organizations that serve the homeless may collaborate to promote integrated, comprehensive service provision.", "At least one-third of homeless veterans have a serious mental illness. These disorders are more common among the homeless, and particularly among the episodically and chronically homeless, than among those who are domiciled. Disorders such as schizophrenia or severe depression can have markedly disabling effects on multiple aspects of a person\u2019s life, including employment, housing stability, interpersonal relationships, and physical health. Specific psychiatric symptoms vary across disorders, but these illnesses often involve impairments in judgment, motivation, and cognitive and social skills, difficulties that not only contribute to housing instability but also limit the person\u2019s ability to obtain treatment. Because of their impairments, the seriously mentally ill homeless may find it particularly difficult to negotiate the complexities of a fragmented service delivery system. Several researchers have focused on outreach and case management strategies for this homeless subgroup, finding that the seriously mentally ill homeless can be helped through such strategies.", "Some seriously mentally ill persons are able to function well, typically with the aid of psychiatric medication, but others face recurrent or persisting difficulties even with medication. Neither independent housing nor full-time work may be reasonable goals for some of these persons. Instead, a successful outcome might involve increased housing stability (perhaps in a group home), fewer and shorter psychiatric hospitalizations, and improved daily living skills. Thus, homeless services are often targeted to helping the homeless maximize self-sufficiency, which may or may not mean achieving economic or housing independence.", "About half of homeless veterans have a substance abuse problem, whether a cause or consequence of homelessness, which makes intervention more complicated. Several studies have suggested that housing and employment stability are impeded by ongoing substance use, and many housing options for the homeless require abstinence. On the other hand, many homeless substance abusers are initially unwilling to accept the goal of sobriety, although they may be willing to accept substance abuse treatment once some of their other needs are met. Thus, low-demand alternatives to the street (such as safe havens) have been advocated as a necessary part of a full continuum of care for the homeless.", "Although research has not yet determined what specific strategies are most effective with homeless substance abusers, initial findings suggest that drop-out rates are often high and the gains made by those who complete treatment programs are not necessarily maintained. Thus, ongoing contact may be necessary for long-term improvement. Too new to have been clearly evaluated, New Directions, associated with the West Los Angeles VA Medical Center, offers substance abuse treatment and job training/job placement services to medically stable substance abusers who do not have serious mental illnesses.", "Among the most difficult to treat homeless are those with both a serious mental illness and a substance abuse problem. About one-half of veterans with serious mental illness also have a substance abuse problem. Compared with other homeless persons, these dually diagnosed persons tend to have longer and more frequent episodes of homelessness, are harder to engage and retain in treatment, and require more services.", "Nonetheless, early research has indicated some promising approaches for the dually diagnosed homeless. For example, results of a randomized clinical trial of one case management strategy, Critical Time Intervention (CTI), suggested that homelessness was reduced among a group of seriously mentally ill men, many of whom were substance abusers.Compared with a control group of similar homeless men who received services as usual (for example, referrals), CTI was associated with a greater reduction in homelessness throughout a period that included a 9-month intervention phase and a 9-month follow-up phase. As another example, empirical evaluation of a program established by Vietnam Veterans of San Diego for substance abusing veterans, many of whom also suffered from PTSD or depression, yielded positive housing, employment, and substance abuse outcomes at a 6-month follow-up. Some veterans are referred to this program through the San Diego VA Medical Center. Long-term follow-up research with the dually diagnosed homeless suggests that set-backs are not uncommon, but that increases in residential and psychological stability are possible.", "Medical problems are also common among the homeless, with rates of illness and injury estimated at two to six times higher than among those who are housed. Typical conditions of homelessness\u2014poor nutrition and hygiene; fatigue; and exposure to the elements, violence, and communicable diseases\u2014contribute to poor health and make recovery from illnesses more difficult. Physical illnesses commonly reported among the homeless include respiratory infections, trauma (for example, lacerations, fractures, and burns), hypertension, skin disorders, gastrointestinal diseases, peripheral vascular disease, musculoskeletal problems, and dental and visual problems. Rates of tuberculosis and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are higher among the homeless than among the housed. It has been reported that the homeless end up using expensive health care alternatives, including emergency and inpatient services, and mortality rates among the homeless have been estimated to be three to four times higher than in the general population.", "Lack of adequate housing can exacerbate illnesses among the homeless. To illustrate this issue, persons with homes can typically deal with acute respiratory infections or chronic disorders such as hypertension or diabetes through a combination of medications, diet, and rest. Those living on the street or in shelters, however, may lack access to appropriate meals, safe storage facilities for medications and medical supplies, or the opportunity for adequate rest. As a result, health may deteriorate, and resultant long-term medical complications may further interfere with the person\u2019s ability to exit homelessness. Convalescent care facilities, such as Christ House, a residential treatment facility with which the Washington, D.C., VA Medical Center contracts for services, provide medical care for homeless persons who do not warrant (and are not being considered for) inpatient medical treatment, but whose medical conditions are likely to worsen without proper attention in a stable environment. Haven II, affiliated with the West Los Angeles VA Medical Center, provides short-term housing for veterans who have been discharged from an inpatient medical unit but are still recuperating. Once medically stabilized, homeless persons served by these facilities can be referred to other housing options.", "For those homeless individuals who are able to work, research on job training suggests some promising strategies. Services have been provided through the Department of Labor\u2019s Job Training for the Homeless Demonstration Program to over 45,000 homeless persons since 1988. More than a third obtained jobs, and half of those were employed 13 weeks later. Results suggest that ongoing case management, work readiness training, assistance in locating work, and postplacement support are among the elements that contribute to obtaining and maintaining employment. The Welfare-to-Work program at L.A. Vets, associated with the West Los Angeles VA Medical Center, incorporates many of these components.", "Experts agree that the continuum of care for the homeless must include a range of housing and treatment options, and that flexibility is needed to match homeless persons to appropriate services. Housing options should include emergency shelter, transitional housing, and permanent housing, all linked to supportive services. Housing and residential treatment programs should include options suitable for mentally ill, substance abusing, dually diagnosed, and convalescent persons. Although relatively few programs for the homeless have been empirically evaluated, the available research includes some promising approaches. Experts also note that attention to the individual\u2019s preferences is important, and that failure to acknowledge those choices may reduce the effectiveness of intervention. Because the homeless have diverse needs and local resources vary, flexibility is needed in serving individuals and in arranging partnerships among organizations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["As VA facilities attempt to develop a continuum of care for homeless veterans, variations in local needs and resources will result in different patterns of involvement for VA and its partners. Because homeless veterans differ from one another in their needs, no single treatment program can serve all veterans with equal effectiveness. Recent federally funded research projects suggest there are beneficial long-term effects attributable to certain strategies for serving mentally ill and substance abusing homeless persons, which VA could replicate. Local programs designed to serve these groups are likely to be important components of any continuum of care for the homeless.", "To maximize the effectiveness of its homeless dollars, VA should direct its resources to those programs and partnerships that show the greatest potential for increasing housing stability and reducing the risk of reentry into homelessness. Research on program effectiveness can provide the information needed to make decisions about how to direct these resources. To better understand the effects of VA\u2019s homeless programs and ways to improve or enhance its programs, a series of program evaluation studies should be conducted to address long-term effects, processes associated with positive outcomes, and program impact. Thus, VA could design follow-up studies to examine the stability of housing and employment in the year or 2 after program discharge. VA could also undertake outcome evaluations designed to assess program processes to better understand how desirable outcomes are produced. Such studies could identify aspects of treatment that are associated with positive outcomes for veterans with different conditions. Finally, VA could estimate how program outcomes differ from outcomes that would be likely in the absence of the program. For example, results observed for a sample of homeless veterans who received a particular kind of treatment could be compared to a comparable group who did not receive that treatment.", "In its fiscal year 2000 budget, VA requested an additional $50 million for its homeless programs and indicated its desire to invest some of those funds in evaluating its homeless programs.

Half were randomly assigned to receive CTI for 9 months, to be followed by 9 months of only usual services; half were randomly assigned to 18 months of usual services. Data were obtained from 94 of the 96 participants at the 18-month point. Results indicated that those provided with only usual services spent more nights homeless (91 on average) throughout the 18-month assessment interval than did those provided with CTI (30 on average). Moreover, the difference between these groups in the likelihood of spending a night homeless tended to become greater over time. (Research on homeless veterans has more typically indicated that treatment and comparison groups begin to converge rather than diverge after a program ends.) Similarly, fewer of those who had received CTI experienced prolonged periods of homelessness during the 18 months than those who received only usual services.", "These results are based on a single study, but suggest promising outcomes for seriously mentally ill homeless persons, a particularly hard-to-serve subgroup. To date, CTI has been used most extensively with some of the hardest-to-serve homeless in the New York City shelter system: seriously mentally ill (for example, schizophrenic) persons, many of whom have multiple psychiatric diagnoses, chronic and heavy substance abuse problems, serious medical problems, and long histories of homelessness. NEPEC estimates that about 45 percent of the homeless veterans served by the HCHV program have serious psychiatric problems. Moreover, CTI clinicians believe that their procedures should be appropriate for use with homeless persons with less severe disorders as well. VA is not currently using CTI, although VA officials have indicated their intention to begin a pilot CTI project. Materials are available for training in CTI."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comments From the Department of Veterans Affairs", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to those named above, the following individuals made important contributions to this report: Jean Harker reviewed NEPEC\u2019s reporting, monitoring, and evaluation systems for VA\u2019s homeless programs; Kristen Anderson assisted with the NEPEC review and conducted a literature review of homeless issues focused on interventions for the homeless; Deborah Edwards assisted with designing the job and methodological approaches used to perform the work and acted as an adviser throughout the assignment; Ann McDermott provided technical support; and Robert DeRoy assisted with the reliability testing of NEPEC\u2019s data.", "The first copy of each GAO report and testimony is free.
