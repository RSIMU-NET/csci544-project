DCOE consists of six directorates and five component centers that carry out a range of PH- and TBI-related functions. GAO was asked to report on (1) DCOE's budget formulation process; and (2) availability of information to Congress on DCOE. GAO reviewed budget guidance, budget requests and performance data.

For fiscal year 2012, DCOE's role in budget formulation was limited to consolidating component center budget requests and providing budget requests to the TRICARE Management Activity (TMA). Further, the budget requests DCOE provided to TMA did not have complete narrative justifications. Office of Management and Budget Circular A-11 specifies that the basic requirements for a justification include a description of the means and strategies used to achieve performance goals. At the time of GAO's review, prior-year funding and obligations data and funding received by component centers from sources external to DCOE were not readily available. The absence of these data indicates that TMA and DCOE did not have benefit of this data to inform budget formulation decisions. Also, quarterly reviews conducted by DCOE that collect data on performance and resources do not include component centers. Expansion of reviews and greater access to performance information could provide DCOE an opportunity to collect information that links component center performance with resources and better informs budget decision making. DCOE's mission and funding have not been clearly defined to Congress. At a congressional hearing, Members expressed differing visions of DCOE's mission and voiced concern about the amount of time needed to establish DCOE and achieve results. Moreover, in four congressional subcommittee testimonies, DCOE's first director and the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs characterized DCOE as DOD's \"open front door for all concerns related to PH and TBI.\" These statements suggest a divergent understanding of DCOE's role and bolster the importance of clear communication on DCOE's mission, funding, and activities. Because DCOE is a relatively small entity primarily funded through the larger Defense Health Program appropriation, it falls below the most detailed level that is presented in congressional budget presentation materials. In addition, at Congress's request DOD provides mandated and ad hoc reports on PH and TBI expenditures. While these reports present information on activities and accomplishments for PH and TBI, DOD does not--and is not required to--report separately on DCOE."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["To enhance visibility and improve accountability, GAO recommends that the Secretary of Defense direct the Director of TMA work with the Director of DCOE to develop and use additional narrative in budget justifications, to regularly collect and review data on funding and obligations, and expand its review and analysis process.

In fiscal year 2010 DOD  allotted $638 million in operations and maintenance funding for PH and  TBI activities; of these funds, the Defense Centers of Excellence for  Psychological Health and Traumatic Brain Injury (DCOE) and its  component centers received about $168 million.

This information could also  help DCOE justify and prioritize its budget requests. However, DOD  required more than 3 months to query numerous sources and provide us  with prior-year data on funding and obligations for DCOE and its  component centers.

For example,  Deployment Health Clinical Center received about $8.3 million in funding  from DCOE in fiscal year 2010, while it was awarded about $3.3 million  from external sources. Standards for internal control in the federal  government state that information should be recorded and communicated  to management and others within the entity who need it.

While DOD stated that DCOE is appropriately informed of budget  execution data through formal systems, as well as informal  coordination and managerial reporting, DOD was not readily able to  provide us with basic information on funding and obligations.  Furthermore, the data provided for fiscal year 2010 remain incomplete  and the information provided has not been sufficient to confirm its  accuracy and reliability. This raises questions about DCOE and TMA\u2019s  oversight and use of these data to inform budget formulation. Accurate  and reliable status of funding data should be used as the starting point  to inform, justify, and prioritize future budget requests. Although DOD  stated that funding data provided to us on February 15, 2011, should be  reported on, we continue to believe that these data do not reflect  specific psychological health and traumatic brain injury funding that  DCOE provided to component centers. Service-level data provided on  that date were not subsequently revised. However, data for DCOE and  its component centers were revised multiple times after receiving  initial data on February 15, 2011. We continued to work with DCOE  and TMA to address inconsistencies, incorporate new data, and  establish a common understanding of budget terminology, such as  allotments and obligations. Moreover, DOD provided numerous  revisions to data provided after February 15, 2011, and continued to do  so even in comments to the draft of this report. While DOD believes  that the data provided are reliable, DOD was unable to describe the  process used to identify and resolve errors in source data from  multiple financial systems, and TMA stated that it could not confirm  the accuracy of data from financial systems it does not administrate."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the individual listed above, Carol M.
