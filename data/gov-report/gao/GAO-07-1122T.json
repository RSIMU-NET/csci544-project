MCC states that the Vanuatu compact will have a transformational effect on the country's economy, increasing per capita income and GDP and benefiting 65,000 poor, rural people. This testimony summarizes a July 2007 report (GAO-07-909) examining (1) MCC's methods of projecting economic benefits, (2) MCC's portrayal and analysis of the projected benefits, and (3) risks that may affect the compact's impact. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed MCC's analyses and met with officials and business owners in Vanuatu as well as with other donors. In its July 2007 report, GAO recommended that the Chief Executive Officer of MCC revise the public reporting of the Vanuatu compact's projected impact; assess whether similar reporting in other compacts accurately reflects underlying analyses; and improve its economic analyses by more fully accounting for risks to project benefits. MCC did not directly address GAO's recommendations but commented that it had not intended to make misleading statements and that its portrayal of projected results was factual and consistent with underlying data."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["MCC projects that the Vanuatu compact's transportation infrastructure projects will provide direct benefits such as reduced transportation costs and induced benefits from growth in tourism and agriculture. MCC estimated the costs and benefits over 20 years, with benefits beginning in full in 2008 or 2009 and growing each year, and it counted poor, rural beneficiaries by defining the area where benefits were likely to accrue. Using projected benefits and costs, MCC calculated the compact's economic rate of return (ERR) and its effects on Vanuatu's gross domestic product (GDP) and per capita income. MCC's portrayal of the projected impact does not reflect its underlying data. MCC states that per capita income will increase by approximately $200, or 15 percent, by 2010 and by $488, or 37 percent, by 2015. However, MCC's underlying data show that these figures represent the sum of individual years' gains in per capita income relative to 2005 and that actual gains will be $51, or 3.9 percent, in 2010 and $61, or 4.6 percent, in 2015. MCC also states that GDP will increase by an additional 3 percent a year, but its data show that after GDP growth of 6 percent in 2007, the economy's growth will continue at about 3 percent, as it would without the compact. MCC states that the compact will benefit approximately 65,000 poor, rural inhabitants, but this statement does not identify the financial benefits that accrue to the rural poor or reflect its own analysis that 57 percent of benefits go to others.We identified five key risks that could affect the compact's projected impacts. (1) Cost estimate contingencies may not be sufficient to cover project overruns. (2) Compact benefits will likely accrue more slowly than MCC projected. (3) Benefit estimates assume continued maintenance, but MCC's ability to ensure maintenance will end in 2011, and Vanuatu's maintenance record is poor. (4) Induced benefits depend on businesses' and residents' response to new opportunities. (5) Efficiency gains, such as time saved in transit, may not increase per capita income. Our analysis of these areas of risk illustrates the extent that MCC's projections are dependent on assumptions of immediate realization of benefits, long-term maintenance, realization of induced benefits, and benefits from efficiency gains."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for the opportunity to discuss our recent work regarding the  Millennium Challenge Corporation\u2019s (MCC) compact with Vanuatu.", "In January 2004, Congress established MCC to administer the Millennium  Challenge Account for foreign assistance.

In the compact and the congressional  notification, MCC states that the transportation infrastructure project is  expected to increase \u201caverage income per capita (in real terms) by  approximately $200, or 15 percent of current income per capita, by 2010.\u201d  MCC\u2019s investment memo states that the compact will cause per capita  income to increase by $488, or 37 percent, by 2015. These statements  suggest that as a result of the program, average incomes in Vanuatu will be  15 percent higher in 2010 and 37 percent higher in 2015 than they would be  without the compact. However, MCC\u2019s underlying data show that these  percentages represent the sum of increases from per capita income in 2005  that MCC projects for each year. For example, according to MCC\u2019s data,  Vanuatu\u2019s per capita income in a given year between 2006 and 2010 will  range from about 2 percent to almost 4 percent higher than in 2005; in its  statements, MCC sums these percentages as 15 percent without stating  that this percentage is a cumulative increase from 2005. Our analysis of  MCC\u2019s data shows that actual gains in per capita income, relative to  income in 2005, would be $51, or 3.9 percent, in 2010 and $61, or 4.6  percent, in 2015 (see fig. 5).", "Figure 6 further illustrates MCC\u2019s methodology in projecting the compact\u2019s  impact on per capita income levels for 2010 and 2015.", "Impact on GDP. Like its portrayal of the projected impact on per capita  income, MCC\u2019s portrayal of the projected impact on GDP is not supported  by the underlying data. In the compact and the 2006 congressional  notification, MCC states that the compact will have a transformational  effect on Vanuatu\u2019s economy, causing GDP to \u201cincrease by an additional 3  percent a year.\u201d Given the GDP growth rate of about 3 percent that MCC  expects in Vanuatu without the compact, MCC\u2019s statement of a  transformational effect suggests that the GDP growth rate will rise to  about 6 percent. However, MCC\u2019s underlying data show that although  Vanuatu\u2019s GDP growth rate will rise to about 6 percent in 2007, in  subsequent years the GDP growth rate will revert to roughly the rate MCC  assumes would occur without the compact, approximately 3 percent (see  fig. 7). Although MCC\u2019s data show that the compact will result in a higher  level (i.e., dollar value) of GDP, the data do not show a transformational  increase to the GDP growth rate.", "Impact on poverty.

Accounting for these risks could reduce the overall  compact ERR.", "Construction costs. Although MCC considered the risk of construction  cost increases, the contingencies used in its calculations may not be  sufficient to cover actual construction costs. Cost estimate documentation  for 5 of MCC\u2019s 11 construction projects shows that these estimates include  design contingencies of 20 percent. However, cost overruns of more than  20 percent occur in many transportation projects, and as MCC\u2019s analysis  notes, the risk of excessive cost overruns is significant in a small country  such as Vanuatu. Any construction cost overrun must be made up within  the Vanuatu compact budget by reducing the scope, and therefore the  benefits, of the compact projects; reduced project benefits would in turn  reduce the compact\u2019s ERR and effects on per capita income and GDP.", "Timing of benefits. Although MCC\u2019s analysis assumes compact benefits  from 2008 or 2009\u2014shortly after the end of project construction\u2014we  found that benefits are likely to accrue more slowly. Our document review  and discussions with tourism services providers and agricultural and  timber producers suggest that these businesses will likely react gradually  to any increased market opportunities resulting from MCC\u2019s projects, in  part because of constraints to expanding economic activity. In addition,  MCC assumes that all construction spending will occur in the first year,  instead of phasing the benefits from this spending over the multiyear  construction schedule.", "Project maintenance. Uncertainty about the maintenance of completed  transportation infrastructure projects after 2011 may affect the compact\u2019s  projected benefits. Vanuatu\u2019s record of road maintenance is poor.  According to World Bank and Asian Development Bank officials,  continuing donor involvement is needed to ensure the maintenance and  sustainability of completed projects. However, although MCC has  budgeted $6.2 million for institutional strengthening of the Vanuatu PWD,  MCC has no means of ensuring the maintenance of completed projects  after the compact expires in 2011; the Millennium Challenge Act limits  compacts to 5 years. Poor maintenance performance will reduce the  benefits projected in the MCC compact.", "Induced benefits. The compact\u2019s induced benefits depend on the response  of Vanuatu tourism providers and agricultural producers. However,  constraints affecting these economic sectors may prevent the sector from  expanding as MCC projects. Limited response to the compact by tourism  providers and agricultural producers would have a significant impact on  compact benefits.", "Efficiency gains. MCC counts efficiency gains\u2014such as time saved  because of better roads\u2014as compact benefits. However, although  efficiency gains could improve social welfare, they may not lead to  changes in per capita income or GDP or be directly measurable as net  additions to the economy.", "Accounting for these risks could reduce the overall compact ERR from  24.2 percent, as projected by MCC, to between 5.5 percent and 16.5  percent (see table 1)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["MCC\u2019s public portrayal of the Vanuatu compact\u2019s projected benefits\u2014 particularly the effect on per capita income\u2014suggests a greater impact  than MCC\u2019s underlying data and analysis support and can be understood  only by reviewing source documents and spreadsheets that are not  publicly available. As a result, MCC\u2019s statements may foster unrealistic  expectations of the compact\u2019s impact in Vanuatu.

The gaps between MCC\u2019s  statements about, and underlying analysis of, the Vanuatu compact also  raise questions about other MCC compacts\u2019 projections of a  transformational impact on country economies or economic sectors.  Without accurate portrayals of its compacts\u2019 projected benefits, the extent  to which MCC\u2019s compacts are likely to further its goals of poverty  reduction and economic growth cannot be accurately evaluated.
