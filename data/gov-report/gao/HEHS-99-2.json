Almost 240,000 of these individuals are living with AIDS, the end stage of HIV and the leading cause of death among 25- to 44-year-olds. Since 1996, there have been major breakthroughs in the fight against HIV and AIDS. New drug therapies, such as combining protease inhibitors (which inhibit the replication of the virus) with other drugs, are effective in reducing the amount of virus in many people with HIV, thereby delaying the onset of AIDS. These therapies have also been effective in reducing some of the severe immune system suppression in people with AIDS.", "Increased use of combination drug therapies has potential implications for federal and state budgets, since many HIV and AIDS patients are entitled to prescription drug assistance under Medicaid or are served by other joint federal and state programs, such as those authorized under title II of the Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency (CARE) Act. Therefore, you asked us to describe (1) federal and state spending on HIV and AIDS drug treatment, by major programs, over the last several years; (2) the estimated number of people with AIDS and HIV on combination drug therapy who are covered by Medicaid or other publicly funded programs, and measures that have been taken to stretch the resources in the CARE Act programs; and (3) the potential impacts of new drug therapies on federal and state government outlays.", "To conduct our work, we interviewed officials at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), including those at the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) and the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA). We also analyzed budget information for fiscal years 1995, 1996, 1997, and 1998. We synthesized data and documents from a number of sources, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and associations that represent state and industry providers of HIV and AIDS drugs. We also interviewed officials from states\u2019 AIDS Drug Assistance Programs (ADAP) and consulted with HIV and AIDS researchers and with officials from pharmaceutical companies that manufacture HIV and AIDS drugs.", "Combination drug therapy is new; as a result, our findings are limited by the many unknown factors regarding the effects of these drugs. In addition, federal program eligibility requirements are subject to change. We conducted our evaluation between November 1996 and June 1998 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The results of research on the prevention and treatment of AIDS\u2014a disease first identified in the United States in 1981\u2014have only recently begun to accrue. Over the past 11 years, a number of therapies have been developed to fight both HIV and its associated infections and cancers. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved several dozen drugs for treating HIV infection or AIDS-related conditions, many of which have only been made available during the last 2 to 3 years.", "In December 1995, FDA approved the first protease inhibitor, saquinavir (Invirase). Following this, the agency approved three other protease inhibitors: ritonavir (Norvir), indinavir (Crixivan), and nelfinavir (Viracept). In November 1997, FDA approved a new formulation of saquinavir, Fortovase. Most recently, in September 1998, FDA approved efavirenz (Sustiva), a drug that requires less frequent dosing and has milder side effects than other drugs. Because HIV can develop a resistance to these and other AIDS treatment drugs, several drugs are often combined. Combination therapy is likely to include three to five drugs, including reverse transcriptase inhibitors combined with protease inhibitors. For many patients, combining protease inhibitors with other drugs greatly reduces the amount of HIV.", "Before it was possible to readily measure the amount of virus in patients, most drug therapies were targeted to patients whose infection had progressed, as evidenced by a decline in their immune system function or by the onset of clinical signs and symptoms of HIV. Of the 650,000 to 900,000 people with HIV infection in the United States, the CDC estimates that about 500,000 of those people know their HIV status; and for almost 240,000 of these individuals, HIV has progressed to AIDS. In June 1997, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) released standards of clinical care for HIV and AIDS combination drug therapy. The standards recommend that therapy be initiated as early as possible and that HIV and AIDS drugs be used in combination rather than individually. Under the treatment guidelines, all patients with HIV infection are considered to be candidates for the combination drug therapy, greatly expanding the group requiring treatment.", "New combination therapy standards also call for continuity of therapy and optimum dosages to suppress HIV replication. According to NIH, underdosing and lapses in a patient\u2019s therapy regimen greatly increases the risk of the patient\u2019s developing drug-resistant HIV variants. Optimum regimens and dosing are under study and continually changing. Combination therapies of as many as five drugs currently are prescribed. Aggressive regimens such as these must be coupled with, and are driven by, results of frequent blood testing to monitor immune system status and levels of HIV. This focus on early and aggressive treatment, coupled with NIH\u2019s call for frequent monitoring of HIV-positive individuals, is expected to result in greater numbers of people seeking combination drug therapy and possibly more complex and costly drug treatment regimens, and more treatment-associated costs such as laboratory testing.", "The cost of combination therapy\u2014taking into account all federal drug discount pricing\u2014is estimated to be about $10,000 per patient annually. While some people with HIV or AIDS are covered by private medical insurance, many others are either uninsured or have limited prescription drug coverage and must rely on one or a combination of federal and state programs and assistance programs offered by manufacturers of HIV and AIDS treatment drugs."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Federal, State, and Private Funding Sources for HIV and AIDS Drug Therapy", "paragraphs": ["The majority of federal assistance for AIDS patients is provided through Medicaid and programs funded under the CARE Act, which was enacted in 1990 to help alleviate the burdens placed on a public health system generally unprepared for the AIDS epidemic. In 1998, Medicaid is estimated to cover 55 percent of adult AIDS patients and about 90 percent of pediatric AIDS cases. Applying those percentages to the current number of AIDS cases, we estimate that at least 108,000 individuals with AIDS are covered by Medicaid in 1998. The CARE Act provides funding for states\u2019 ADAPs, which rely on federal, state, and local partnerships to provide drug therapy on an outpatient basis. ADAPs are designed to provide assistance to those HIV-positive individuals who have no, or limited, private third-party prescription drug coverage; cannot afford to pay for drugs themselves; and are ineligible for Medicaid or have limits on the prescription drug benefit offered by Medicaid. In calendar year 1996, ADAPs served a total of about 80,000 clients nationwide.", "Funding for HIV and AIDS drug therapy as well as other treatments is also provided by other federal sources, including the Departments of Defense (DOD) and Veterans Affairs (VA). DOD programs currently treat about 5,000 active duty service personnel with HIV or AIDS. In 1996, VA treated more than 12,000 eligible veterans. While the total number of individuals served in these programs is much smaller than the number served through Medicaid and programs funded under the CARE Act, VA is the nation\u2019s largest provider of direct care for people with HIV and AIDS. In addition, VA clients could be eligible for care from more than one program.", "The remainder (less than half) of the individuals with AIDS rely on sources other than ADAPs, VA, DOD, or Medicaid to finance their drug therapy. Some have private health insurance and others are uninsured and rely on personal resources and charitable organizations. Uninsured and underinsured individuals with AIDS tend to rely on a combination of public and private funding sources.

Medicaid provides health coverage for certain low-income families, the elderly, and disabled persons. States vary in their Medicaid eligibility requirements (see app. I). States have discretion regarding the quantities and duration of use for prescription drugs, although all FDA-approved drugs must be offered. Historically, program eligibility has been linked to receipt of cash assistance under a welfare program, such as Aid to Families With Dependent Children (AFDC) or the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program. In recent years, the program has been expanded to provide health coverage for low-income children and pregnant women with no ties to welfare. An individual with AIDS or HIV infection could qualify for Medicaid on the basis of eligibility for a cash assistance program or alternative eligibility criteria. Most adults with AIDS or HIV infection become eligible for Medicaid by meeting the disability criteria of the federal SSI program, usually not until they have developed AIDS and have become too disabled by their disease to work.", "Patients who do not qualify for Medicaid may seek assistance from ADAPs, which are primarily designed to fill gaps in prescription drug coverage. To qualify for ADAP benefits, they must have a medical need and an income below a certain amount, which is generally higher than that permitted for Medicaid. Unlike Medicaid, ADAPs do not require disability as a criterion for eligibility of HIV-positive adults and thus can cover those who have not developed AIDS.

Other programs also provide supportive services for low-income individuals with HIV or AIDS. For example, in fiscal year 1997, about $133 million was allocated by formula to 53 metropolitan areas and to 27 states for areas outside qualifying cities under the Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s (HUD) Housing Opportunities for People With AIDS program.", "In fiscal year 1997, total federal spending on medical care, including inpatient and outpatient services and prescription drugs, for individuals with AIDS or HIV was estimated at $4.8 billion.

Spending on drug therapies represented about one-fourth of federal and state Medicaid spending on HIV- and AIDS-related drugs and exceeded $950 million in calendar year 1997, up $449 million (or 90 percent) since 1995. Similarly, spending through ADAPs is estimated at $359 million for fiscal year 1997, up $254 million (or 242 percent) since 1995. (See table 1.)

Some of these title I programs make eligible metropolitan area (EMA) contributions to the state ADAP programs. Between 1995 and 1997, when direct federal funding for ADAPs under title II increased dramatically, title I contributions to ADAPs remained flat. EMA contributions totaled $20.8 million in fiscal year 1995, $25.9 million in fiscal year 1996, and $24.2 million in fiscal year 1997.

They estimated that of the total number of people in the United States with AIDS or who are HIV positive, 50 percent would be on combination therapy in 1997 and 60 to 65 percent in 1998. They assumed that about 20 percent of people who try combination therapy will not be able to tolerate the side effects and will therefore discontinue it.

This is because, in addition to AIDS patients, ADAPs\u2019 clients include people who are HIV positive but do not yet have AIDS. It is this latter group for whom limitations on data make it impossible to estimate the total candidate population for the therapy. In addition, states have varying financial and medical standards individuals must meet to qualify for ADAP services, so this subset of candidate patients cannot be computed. Furthermore, because these individuals finance their care through multiple funding sources, some individuals only qualify for ADAP benefits for part of the year.", "The only information that is available for predicting the likely future demand for ADAP coverage is the recent experience of the ADAP programs. Since 1992, the number of people seeking funding for AIDS therapies through ADAPs has increased rapidly. In calendar year 1996, ADAPs served a total of about 80,000 clients nationwide, compared with about 50,000 in 1994. Comparing states\u2019 ADAP caseloads for July 1996 and July 1997\u2014the most recent data available\u2014shows that per-month client use of ADAPs increased 39 percent overall, from about 31,000 to more than 43,000. A survey by the National Alliance of State and Territorial AIDS Directors shows the number of patients served by ADAPs increasing at a rate of 1,000 per month.

It projects that the rate of ADAP clients receiving combination drug therapy over the next 2 years will be 90 percent.

For example, New York updates the information weekly, while others do so monthly or less often. Most of these ADAPs are linked to the Medicaid files via computer for both initial screening and cross-checks. States also use other means to verify eligibility. For example, Virginia requires all ADAP clients to apply to Medicaid within 90 days of enrollment. In Puerto Rico, in lieu of computer linkages to Medicaid, case managers work with clients to check for Medicaid or ADAP coverage. (See table 3.)", "A recent study of all ADAPs similarly found that 39 states require their ADAPs to cross-check client eligibility for Medicaid, mostly through direct access to Medicaid data or through screening by case managers. The study points out that 19 of the 23 states with limited Medicaid coverage have restricted ADAP access. This suggests that the expansiveness of a state\u2019s Medicaid program may directly affect the demand for ADAP services. For example, the Medicaid programs in Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Texas are among 11 state programs that have placed limits on the number of prescriptions available each month; at the same time, the ADAPs in these states have not been able to meet the demand and have had to develop waiting lists. Figure 1 shows the restrictiveness of the Medicaid and ADAP programs in the various states.", "Most ADAPs have reduced their expenditures on HIV and AIDS drugs through several discount pricing methods. For example, under the Veterans\u2019 Health Care Act of 1992 (which enacted section 340B of the Public Health Service Act), ADAPs\u2014as well as state Medicaid programs\u2014can obtain drugs at a minimum 15.1-percent discount below the average manufacturer price. ADAPs that cannot obtain up-front drug discounts may negotiate voluntary manufacturer rebates of certain drugs. Some ADAPs seek discounts from retail pharmacies, receive third-party partial insurance reimbursements (when available), collect copayments for drugs from clients, or obtain reimbursement coverage from Medicaid if a client becomes eligible for that program.", "However, not all ADAPs have obtained the lowest prices available in purchasing drugs.

Many of the nonparticipating programs cited the list of administrative burdens as a disincentive. However, a recent HHS policy change will allow ADAPs to participate more readily in this program by the use of a rebate mechanism.

Patients whose conditions cannot be stabilized may also be removed from the therapy or they may continue to receive therapy because they still benefit from the drugs. Other patients may over time develop a resistance to drugs that initially succeeded in stabilizing or reducing their viral load. Some patients may not be able to tolerate the drugs because of side effects and would thus be removed from the therapy after a brief period.", "Standards of care will also likely influence the demand for combination drug therapy treatment and the associated costs.

For example, at the 4th Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections held in January 1997, state and hospital officials demonstrated reduced hospitalization rates, suggesting new HIV and AIDS drugs as a possible cause. A recent study by VA attributes a 37-percent decrease in the number of hospitalizations and a 41-percent decrease in the number of hospital days at 173 VA medical centers to the combination therapies. This study cites an $18 million net cost savings in 1997 in contrast with 1996.Public health officials in New York City also announced a 50-percent drop in AIDS deaths from the last quarter of 1995 to the same quarter in 1996, citing as a partial reason the new HIV and AIDS drugs. Researchers at Johns Hopkins University pointed out that if a person with AIDS avoided a single hospitalization\u2014which averages $7,000 per stay\u2014in 1 year, the costs associated with combination drug therapy for the same individual could be completely offset. However, if the drugs extended the life of a person with HIV or AIDS, it is possible that at some point the cost of the drugs would exceed the amount that would have been spent on hospitalizations and other treatments. Finally, hospitalization costs might simply be delayed.", "Another analysis by the Johns Hopkins University AIDS researchers sought to examine the cost-effectiveness of combination therapy. The model used in this study projected an incremental cost-effectiveness for triple therapy of $10,000 to $18,000 per life-year gained. They compared the cost per life-year saved of triple-drug therapy with the cost per life-year saved for accepted treatments for other medical conditions and found that it is within the range of other treatments for other diseases and conditions.

For Medicaid, reductions in hospitalizations could, in the short-term, offset the costs associated with HIV and AIDS combination drug therapy. However, in the longer term, program costs may not be offset if hospitalizations are merely delayed.", "For ADAPs, increases in the number of people who seek assistance for combination drug therapies would not be offset by fewer hospitalizations, because ADAPs only cover the cost of prescription drugs, not hospitalizations. However, delaying the onset of AIDS, its symptoms, and associated diseases and conditions could, in the short term, reduce the need for other services funded under the CARE Act. For example, under title I, the CARE Act provides 49 metropolitan areas disproportionately affected by the AIDS epidemic with funding for mental health treatment, case management, support services, and substance abuse programs for HIV and AIDS patients. Arguably, if the new HIV and AIDS drugs successfully delayed the onset of AIDS, the demand for a number of these services might be postponed, at least for the period of time the drugs are effective. On the other hand, the success of drug therapies might increase the amount of time that clients are enrolled and the use of related support and diagnostic services. Moreover, it is not clear that clients served under other titles of the CARE Act are the same as those served under ADAP.", "In light of NIH\u2019s recently published standards of care, people with HIV who are asymptomatic may seek combination therapies in greater numbers. The development of new drugs and therapies, such as quadruple therapy, would likely add to the prescription drug demand. Although insurance coverage for the estimated 410,000 to 660,000 individuals who are HIV positive but have not developed AIDS is unknown, ADAPs are the most likely to see increases in the number of individuals who are uninsured or underinsured and seeking funding for combination drug therapy in 1998. HHS officials anticipate that welfare reform efforts will likely cause ADAP enrollment to increase. As individuals transition from Medicaid and obtain employment, they will more likely become qualified for ADAP benefits. And if treatment fails, individuals will still need care provided through other services funded through CARE Act programs."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We obtained comments on a draft of this report from HHS and from two expert reviewers.

Medicaid covers all prescribed HIV and AIDS drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) consistent with the requirements of 1927(d) of the Social Security Act. The Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) surveyed state Medicaid programs and found that all states were covering protease inhibitors, as required. Because of prescription limits, however, combination therapy, with its dependence on multiple drugs, can rapidly exceed these limits (for example, 11 states limit the number of allowable drugs to as few as three per month). Thirty-one programs require nominal copayments for the drugs.", "Generally, state AIDS Drug Assistance Programs (ADAP) cover many FDA-approved HIV and AIDS drugs, but not all drugs are covered by each program. To assess financial eligibility for ADAP enrollment, most states use federal poverty guidelines; income limits are often expressed as a percentage of the federal poverty level (FPL). The financial requirements range from 100 percent of FPL in one state to 558 percent of FPL in another state. Some states list the requirement in terms of absolute income levels: for example, as long as liquid assets total less than $25,000, New York requires a household of one to earn no more than $44,000; a household of two, less than $59,200; and three or more, less than $74,400. Other states also use specific income levels unrelated to the federal poverty guidelines. Some programs consider out-of-pocket medical expenses when determining income. Ten of the programs restrict financial assets. (See table I.1.)", "States have both financial and medical requirements for ADAP enrollment. For example, a person must have an income or assets below a certain dollar amount or demonstrate financial hardship. At a minimum, a person must be diagnosed as having HIV infection. Almost half of the states have only these basic requirements. Other states also require that a client have CD4 counts less than a certain level (CD4 is a measure of the immune system level). For example, six states require a CD4 level of less than 500. Twelve states require a doctor\u2019s prescription for the HIV and AIDS drugs.
