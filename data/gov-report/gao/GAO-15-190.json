San Francisco used a DOT, Federal Transportation Administration grant  to provide peer escorts to accompany older adults with dementia."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The Three Localities Faced Similar Challenges in Meeting the Demand for HCBS and Supports", "paragraphs": ["According to AAA and CBO officials, the growing population of older  adults, in conjunction with constraints on federal, state, and local  government funding, made it difficult to meet older adults\u2019 needs for  affordable housing, in-home and nutrition services, and transportation. In  addition, the growing diversity of the older adult population\u2014differences  in language, culture, and customs\u2014compounded these challenges. Some  CBOs also indicated that as funding from public programs has remained  flat in recent years, they were finding it difficult to secure funds from other  sources to sustain the HCBS and supports they provide to older adults.", "In all three localities that we visited, we were told that there were lengthy  waiting lists\u2014one consequence of funding constraints\u2014for a number of  HCBS and supports. AAA officials in Atlanta and Montgomery County  reported that while Medicaid funding for HCBS has been increasing in  recent years, hundreds of older adults referred to Medicaid for in-home  services under state Medicaid waiver programs were ending up on  waiting lists because their state Medicaid agencies had not met their  funding match. In one locality, there was concern that the state Medicaid  program may have chosen to devote a higher percentage of state  Medicaid resources to nursing home care than to HCBS. In Montgomery  County, an AAA official said that of the 23,000 people, statewide, who  were on Maryland\u2019s waiting list for the state\u2019s Medicaid Community First  Choice option, about 10 to 12 percent were Montgomery County  residents. In Atlanta, the AAA director said that there were 800 people in  the region who were eligible for services under one of the state\u2019s  Medicaid 1915(c) waiver programs and on a waiting list because the  program was closed due to lack of state Medicaid matching funds.  According to the Atlanta AAA director, applicants would be assessed for  eligibility for Medicaid funded in-home services as soon as more state  funds became available. Only older adults who are low-income are  eligible for Medicaid-funded HCBS, and in Atlanta and Montgomery  County, AAA officials described a mix of Older Americans Act, state, and  local funds that they used to serve older adults who were not eligible for  Medicaid. In the Atlanta region and Montgomery County, officials reported  that there were also waiting lists for Older Americans Act-funded HCBS.", "CBO officials also reported waiting lists for affordable senior housing.  Among the Section 202 properties that reported information on waiting  lists, waiting periods ranged from 6 months to 10 years, indicating that the  existing supply of affordable units available to older adults under Section  202 and other programs was not meeting the demand. Further, Section  202 is no longer producing new units. Congress did not approve new  rental assistance contracts through the Section 202 demonstration funded  in fiscal year 2014 and there was no funding for new units in fiscal year  2015. Given the increasing size of the older adult population and  projections that many will need assistance with their housing costs, the  demand for affordable housing for older adults will likely continue to  exceed the supply.", "The demand for nutrition services has also grown in recent years. Two  CBO officials noted shortfalls in meeting the demand for nutrition services  in their communities. Senior Connections representatives, who provided  meals for older adults in several Georgia counties, told us that one county  had more than 200 individuals on its waiting list, mainly for meals and in- home care. In a previous study, we reported that officials told us that  requests for home-delivered meals were increasing as older adults were  remaining in their homes longer rather than moving into assisted living  facilities or nursing homes. Moreover, complicated application  requirements may be impeding their access to food assistance through  SNAP, which USDA and HHS officials told us may be used by the  participant as a voluntary contribution toward the cost of congregate and  home delivered meals for older adults, if the provider is authorized by  USDA to accept SNAP benefits for this purpose (e.g. is an authorized  SNAP retailer). Three USDA initiatives--the Combined Application  Project, Standard Medical Deduction, and the Elderly Simplified  Application Project--to allow states to simplify the application and  recertification requirements for older adults have been adopted by 17, 16,  and 6 states, respectively. According to a USDA official, all three  initiatives include evaluation and reporting requirements, due to their  status as demonstration projects, that can be viewed as burdensome by  state agencies. According to the official, those evaluation and reporting  requirements may deter states from applying to operate a project.", "CBOs in each locality also reported high demand for transportation  services for older adults, but one we visited, which assisted older adults  with different modes of transportation, had temporarily suspended its  transportation voucher program until new funding was made available  through a DOT grant. Further, local officials said that flexibility was critical  in providing older adults with the right type of transportation assistance to  address their needs. For example, a San Francisco mobility program  manager noted that an increasing number of baby boomers living at  home had dementia. She stated that there were day programs for older  adults available at senior centers, but these individuals needed  transportation to the centers. Some older adults who did not meet the  specific requirements for paratransit required assistance that was not  available through the fixed-route bus system even when subsidies made  trips more affordable to them. Further, those with dementia needed more  hands-on assistance in transit than was available through paratransit.  To respond to this need, local officials in San Francisco said that in July  2014 the city launched its peer escort transportation service. According to  the mobility manager, in this instance, the city was able to use FTA grant  funds to acquire vehicles for the peer escort service, but had to find  another grant to fund a small stipend for the escorts. Several  transportation service providers across the localities expressed a need to  reduce restrictions on the use of federal transportation grant funding. For  example, CBO and local government officials told us that they would like  to spend more transportation grant funds to transport older adults to  recreational events. They said that some programs allowed funding for  older adult transportation to hospital and other non-emergency medical  appointments, but not recreational transportation, even though this was  important to older adults\u2019 quality of life. This is consistent with our findings  in a previous report that when flexible transportation services exist and  are accessible, older adults can more comfortably age in place in their  homes and communities.", "In the three localities, a diverse older adult population has compounded  the task of meeting increasing demand for HCBS and supports, and  challenged CBOs to find ways to accommodate differences in language,  culture, and customs.  Representatives of a Montgomery County village told us that they served individuals who represented more than 57  countries of origin and shared a common characteristic\u2014many were first  generation Americans. One Section 202 property in the Atlanta region  relied on its collaboration with an Asian community center to meet the  social needs of its Korean residents, who represented 20 percent of all  residents. The property had also hired a part-time language interpreter to  facilitate communications with these residents.", "At the same time that Older Americans Act funding has been essentially  flat in recent years, some local CBOs reported finding it difficult to secure  from non-federal sources the funds they need to sustain the services they  provide to older adults. For example, the mobility manager at the CBO  which suspended its transportation voucher program told us that local  fundraising was challenging in the low-income community where the CBO  was located. Moreover, in addition to constraints on Older Americans Act  funding, our 2014 analysis of state and local budgets suggests that states  and local governments will continue to face fiscal challenges in the  coming years absent substantial policy changes. Further, HHS budget  documents note that states, tribes, and localities that depend on federal  funds for these services have limited options to offset losses of federal  funding.", "Developing the capacity to compete in new markets for HCBS and  opportunities may be a strategy for AAAs and CBOs to address these  challenges. For example, the San Francisco AAA is taking advantage of  the business acumen learning collaborative formed by ACL\u2019s Center for  Consumer Access and Self-Determination. As one of the sites selected to  participate in the learning collaborative in 2013, San Francisco\u2019s AAA  convened a network of 15 CBOs. The stated outcome for network  members is to build their organizational capacity to contract with  managed health care entities. The goal was that future contracts with  health plans and managed care providers would provide revenue to the  CBOs that were part of the AAA\u2019s network. ACL\u2019s business acumen  learning collaborative is in line with the Older Americans Act, which  requires AoA to provide technical assistance designed to assist state  units on aging (SUA), AAAs, and service providers in serving older  individuals with the greatest economic and social needs. The act also  requires the establishment, directly or through AoA grants or contracts, of  national technical assistance programs to fund technical assistance to  SUAs, AAAs, and CBOs funded under the act in implementing home and  community-based long-term care systems.federal funding is constrained, local entities may be best served by having  greater opportunities for technical assistance that could help them form  strategic networks and identify additional sources of non-federal financial  support. Local partnerships between service providers could in turn  facilitate the type of care coordination that would benefit older adults."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "AOA Has Collaborated with Other Agencies but Has Not Brought Them Together to Develop a Cross- Agency Federal Strategy for HCBS and Supports", "paragraphs": ["AoA, within HHS, is the principal agency designated to carry out the  provisions of the Older Americans Act.

However, only DOT\u2019s Coordinating Council on  Access and Mobility included all five agencies.", "While these projects represent steps toward interagency collaboration,  they do not allow all five agencies to consider jointly the broad  implications of their independent initiatives for older adults, their common  target population. For example, three CMS programs provide incentives  for state Medicaid Programs to reduce the use of institutionally-based  long-term services and supports in the community. At the same time,  Congress eliminated funding for capital advances under the Section 202  program. According to HUD officials, HUD is encouraging localities to  look to existing affordable housing resources in the community in the  absence of funding for housing construction under the Section 202  program. AoA is collaborating with HUD and CMS by helping to  determine how best to provide services to older adults in multifamily  housing in the community. However, as we previously discussed, while  attributable not only to changes in the Section 202 program, the demand  for older adult affordable housing will likely continue to exceed the supply.  One implication of these simultaneous developments is that, if there is no  housing available, older adults may be unable to receive services unless  they reside in an institutional setting. Collaboration to develop mutually  reinforcing or joint strategies could help ensure that federal resources for  HCBS and supports are used efficiently and effectively.", "Others also have pointed out the potential consequences of the lack of  collaboration among the agencies that administer programs for older  adults. For example, a 2014 report prepared for the Department of Health  and Human Services noted that the disconnects among Medicare,  Medicaid, acute and chronic health care providers, affordable housing  programs, aging programs, and home and community based services  may lead to lower-quality care, premature institutionalization, and higher  costs for public and private health and long term care.
