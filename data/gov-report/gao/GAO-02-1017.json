Joint (DOD and VA) venture sites with inpatient facilities provide services to shared inpatients in the same manner as they do for their own beneficiaries; that is, medications are ordered using the facility's guidelines and filled through the inpatient pharmacy at that facility. Gaps in safeguards result primarily from VA's and DOD's separate, uncoordinated information and formulary systems. Joint venture sites have tried to address some of these safety gaps.

To  focus our review on locations with large numbers of shared patients, we  examined VA and DOD\u2019s seven joint ventures, which have had experience  working together under sharing agreements. At your request, we  conducted an on-site review of pharmacy operations at the joint venture in  Hawaii, where there is an agreement between Tripler Army Medical Center  and the VA Medical and Regional Office Center. At this site, we observed  how medications are provided to shared patients and evaluated these  processes for gaps in medication safeguards. We also examined  medication error reports and interviewed VA and DOD providers,  pharmacists, patient safety personnel, and information systems personnel.  We spoke by telephone with personnel in similar positions at the six other  joint venture sites to identify procedures used to provide medications to  shared patients and evaluated these procedures for medication safety  gaps. We spoke with personnel at all joint venture sites about their  medication safety programs, but we were not able to identify errors  specific to shared patients because neither VA nor DOD tracks information  in this way.", "We also spoke with VA and DOD headquarters personnel knowledgeable  about pharmacy, patient safety, formulary, and information technology  issues.

The  number of veterans, including all military retirees, eligible for VA health  care was increased in fiscal year 1999 due to removal of statutory  restrictions. In addition, the number of military retirees eligible for DOD  health care increased in 2001 when full eligibility was extended to retirees  age 65 and over. Furthermore, a February 2002 increase in VA\u2019s  copayment for outpatient drugs\u2014from $2 per prescription to $7 per  prescription\u2014has given dual eligibles who receive health care from VA  more incentive to have their prescriptions filled at a DOD pharmacy."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Medication Errors Pose Significant Risk", "paragraphs": ["The Institute of Medicine (IOM) raised national awareness of the problem  of medication errors with its 2000 study, To Err is Human: Building a  Safer Health System.

Inpatient medications are ordered  using the host facility\u2019s formulary guidelines and filled through the  inpatient pharmacy. Initial supplies of discharge medications (usually 30  days or less) are also typically provided, although patients are expected to  return to their home agency pharmacy for longer-term supplies.", "In contrast, the process for providing medications to shared outpatients  differs across sites. At six of the joint venture sites, each agency maintains  a separate outpatient pharmacy. As a general rule, each agency expects its  beneficiaries to use its pharmacy for outpatient prescriptions, even when  providers from the other agency order the prescription. For instance, in  Hawaii, both the Tripler Army Medical Center and the VA outpatient clinic  next door maintain outpatient pharmacies. VA patients who are referred to  Tripler for outpatient specialty care are expected to return to the VA clinic  pharmacy to have their prescriptions filled.

Another exception is that all joint venture  inpatient facilities provide weekend and after-hours emergency room care  to patients of the other agency and, generally, medications are also  supplied if needed. In contrast to the general rule, at the DOD facility in El  Paso, referred VA patients are not expected to return to their home agency  for their initial prescriptions but rather are allowed to obtain an initial  supply of drugs from the DOD pharmacy.

Because information  systems are uncoordinated, checks for drug allergies and interactions for  shared patients are based on incomplete information. In addition, separate  formulary systems introduce complications for shared patients because  providers must either prescribe from the other agency\u2019s formulary, which  may contain drugs unfamiliar to providers, or prescribe a limited supply of  a drug, which may later be switched to comply with the formulary of the  patient\u2019s home agency.

VA and DOD providers and pharmacists have  ready access to health records of their own beneficiaries, largely through  CPRS and CHCS, respectively. However, when agencies refer patients for  care, the treating agency\u2019s providers and pharmacists have incomplete  access to patients\u2019 health and medication information.

Access for pharmacists and treating providers to  patient information in the referring agency\u2019s information system varies by  location. For example, at four joint venture sites, pharmacists filling  prescriptions for shared patients have no access to the other agency\u2019s  patient information system. At another site, pharmacy access is  restricted\u2014at Tripler Army Medical Center in Hawaii, access to VA\u2019s CPRS  is available in the inpatient pharmacy, but only one pharmacist has access.

With the exception of DOD providers in  Hawaii, none of the joint venture sites have the capability for providers to  electronically order medications through their own computer systems for  drugs that are to be dispensed by the other agency\u2019s pharmacy, nor do  they typically have access to the other agency\u2019s electronic ordering  systems to issue medication orders.

In Key West,  for example, where all drugs are dispensed from the DOD pharmacy, VA  providers have access to DOD\u2019s electronic ordering system, CHCS; but, for  the most part, they handwrite prescriptions. These providers record  patient care and medications in VA\u2019s CPRS, and if they were to  electronically order medications, it would necessitate entry into a second  system. They told us that using CHCS was slow and cumbersome, and  ordering the medications using it took too much time. A VA provider in  Hawaii told us that, for these same reasons, providers sometimes  handwrote prescriptions for dual eligibles to have filled at the DOD  pharmacy when only one or two medications were being ordered.", "Finally, although VA patients benefit when providers electronically order  medications in VA hospitals, they generally lose this benefit when referred  to DOD hospitals. Providers in VA hospitals have electronic ordering  capability for inpatient medications, but this capability is not generally  available in DOD hospitals. VA patients referred to DOD hospitals, like  DOD\u2019s own beneficiaries, usually have their prescriptions handwritten by  the provider, and then manually entered into CHCS by pharmacy  personnel.

When the medication is ordered, CPRS or  CHCS/PDTS will perform automatic checks for drug allergies and  interactions. However, if patients are taking medications obtained from  both agencies, neither agency\u2019s record of patient medications is complete  at any joint venture site. Thus, when interaction checks are done, they will  be incomplete for shared patients because the checks are restricted to the  information available within each system. Likewise, providers may be  unaware of drug allergies. For example, when a patient who routinely gets  health care at the VA clinic in El Paso is referred to the Army Medical  Center for outpatient specialty care, the DOD pharmacy will fill a  prescription for up to 30 days of medications. However, when the  pharmacy performs its automatic checks, drug allergies may not be  detected because information on drug allergies is likely to be in VA\u2019s CPRS  where the bulk of the patient\u2019s clinical information is stored, not in  CHCS/PDTS where the drug check will occur. In its interim report, the  President\u2019s Task Force to Improve Health Care Delivery for Our Nation\u2019s  Veterans stated that the instances of adverse drug events might be  substantially reduced for shared patients through use of a comprehensive  screening tool like PDTS and plans further analysis in this area for its final  report."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Uncoordinated Formulary Systems Also Introduce Risks", "paragraphs": ["Because VA and DOD each has its own formulary system, providers who  treat referred patients sometimes prescribe from the referring agency\u2019s  formulary and sometimes from their own facility\u2019s formulary, depending  on where the prescription will be filled. Unless the prescribed drug is  common to both formularies, each situation limits the medication safety  benefits of a formulary system, such as increased provider familiarity with  drugs prescribed and the added safety net provided by clinical decision  support. The President\u2019s Task Force to Improve Health Care Delivery for  Our Nation\u2019s Veterans noted that a joint VA/DOD formulary could combine  the clinical expertise of both VA and DOD and improve patient safety.", "Providers who use the other agency\u2019s formulary in prescribing for shared  patients and find that the drug they would normally prescribe is not listed  are disadvantaged in several ways. First, according to formulary system  principles endorsed by the American Medical Association, ASHP, and  others, one characteristic of a formulary system should be that the  pharmacy and therapeutics committee educates providers about drugs on  the formulary. A senior official from ISMP told us that provider drug  knowledge is also reinforced by a formulary system because formularies  limit the number of drugs providers need to be knowledgeable about.  Consequently, providers should be less likely to make mistakes in drug  selection or dosage when prescribing formulary drugs. Second, when  prescribing a drug that is not on their formulary, providers may lose the  clinical support capabilities that may be built into their agency\u2019s CPOE  system. For example, the medication error prevention committee at  Tripler in Hawaii evaluates Tripler\u2019s formulary drugs for safety problems  and designs safeguards into CHCS, such as distinctive lettering to alert  providers to drug names that look alike or sound alike. However, DOD  providers typically try to prescribe for VA outpatients using VA\u2019s  formulary. Consequently, this safeguard is lost to the shared patient.", "Providers usually prescribe from their own facility\u2019s formulary for a  referred patient if the prescription is to be filled at their facility\u2019s  pharmacy. For instance, at all joint venture sites, referred inpatients  receive short-term supplies of discharge medications at the host facility\u2019s  pharmacy. If patients need longer-term supplies of medications or refills,  they typically are expected to return to their home pharmacy. This  situation can also put patients at risk if the original medication is not on  the formulary at their home pharmacy. For instance, in Key West, VA  physicians write VA patients two different prescriptions: one for their  initial supply to be filled at the joint venture\u2019s DOD pharmacy and a  second for a longer-term supply that is mailed from the VA Medical Center  in Miami. One VA physician told us that when a VA formulary drug he  wants to prescribe is not on the DOD formulary, he prescribes an  equivalent drug carried by the DOD pharmacy for the short term and  orders the VA formulary drug from Miami to use on a long-term basis.  Experts agree that such interchanging of drugs in a therapeutic class may  sometimes cause problems because differences in individual physiology  make some people react differently to a very similar therapeutic agent.  Although such interchange is an accepted practice in formulary systems,  when physicians are able to avoid switching drugs, they reduce the risk  that an adverse reaction will occur."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Safety Gaps Remain Despite Efforts to Address Them", "paragraphs": ["Recognizing these risks for shared patients, joint venture facilities have  undertaken efforts intended to address these safety gaps. However, none  of these efforts fully solve the problems that exist, nor are they all used at  any site.", "All joint venture sites have taken steps to increase access to patient  information. For example, at Tripler in Hawaii, VA and DOD recently  added VA\u2019s CPRS to computers in the DOD hospital so that VA physicians  monitoring the care of VA inpatients would have electronic access to  patients\u2019 VA health records. However, at the time of our visit, most DOD  physicians were unaware that the capability to access CPRS existed, and  DOD officials at Tripler had no plans to promote its use or to provide  training. Similarly, some physicians at all other joint ventures have access  to both systems; but, as in Hawaii, this access is generally limited in the  number of computers that have this capability and the number of  providers who have been authorized to use it. For instance, access to both  systems is available at some locations in the Mike O\u2019Callaghan Federal  Hospital in Nevada, but VA pharmacy officials at the VA outpatient clinic  in this joint venture told us that the lack of such access in the clinic  presented a major problem. They told us that not having access to such  patient information as test results and physician notes made it difficult for  them to research questions about patients\u2019 medications. Only two sites  have pharmacies with access to the other agency\u2019s patient information  system; access is very limited at one of those sites\u2014at Tripler, only one  pharmacist has been authorized to use CPRS. Furthermore, medical  personnel who had access told us that its use is hindered by their lack of  familiarity with the other agency\u2019s system and by the difficulties of  accessing separate, dissimilar systems.", "Recognizing the increased risks associated with handwriting prescriptions  rather than using CPOE, two joint venture sites have devised ways to  minimize this risk for shared patients. In Hawaii, VA providers have  worked out an agreement with the DOD pharmacy that they will provide  dual beneficiaries a computer-printed copy of the electronic order, called  an \u201caction profile,\u201d which the pharmacy will accept in lieu of a  handwritten order. In Hawaii\u2014at the time of our visit\u2014and northern  California, a printer for DOD\u2019s CHCS had been installed in the VA  pharmacy so that medication orders from DOD providers could be printed  out in the VA pharmacy. VA pharmacy personnel then re-enter orders into  CPRS to dispense the medications. While these efforts remove the  potential for misreading handwritten prescriptions, they fall short of the  full benefits of electronic ordering and filling because re-entering  information into CPRS introduces the potential for transcription errors. In  August 2002, information technology personnel in Hawaii implemented an  electronic link that allows outpatient medication orders entered into  CHCS for VA patients to be transmitted directly into CPRS, eliminating the  need for manual re-entry in the VA pharmacy. Officials involved in the  Hawaii project told us that this link is working well and that this  technology was developed with the intent of transferring it to other sites.  They also told us that the project was developed with the ultimate intent  of two-way\u2014or bi-directional\u2014communications, so that with some  additional modification a link could be established allowing VA physicians  to send CPRS medication orders to CHCS at Tripler for processing and  filling.", "Three joint venture sites have taken steps to compensate for problems  associated with drug interaction checks for shared patients. For example,  VA physicians in Hawaii told us that when they provide prescriptions for  dual eligibles to be filled at DOD\u2019s pharmacy, they also enter them into  VA\u2019s CPRS and mark them \u201chold\u201d so that they will not be dispensed by the  VA pharmacy. Thus, checks for interactions with other drugs prescribed  by VA can be performed by CPRS, and the patients\u2019 medication  information will be updated to reflect the medication orders. In Texas, VA  adds information to CPRS about care and medications provided to  referred patients by DOD physicians. This information is recorded in a  special section of CPRS. When VA physicians subsequently access  patients\u2019 records, CPRS alerts them that new information has been added  to this section of the record, but the information is not included in  automatic drug checks. The VA clinic in Anchorage, Alaska, uses a  different approach to address the problem of incomplete medication  records. Officials there told us they have developed software to  supplement information in the CPRS record by capturing and displaying  information about drugs obtained from DOD and other non-VA sources,  including herbal supplements and over-the-counter drugs. Thus, providers  and pharmacists have additional information that might help them prevent  adverse drug interactions. However, information collected in this way may  not be accurate or complete because it depends on patient recall and is  entered manually. In addition, this information is not accessed by CPRS\u2019s  automatic drug checks because it is a supplement to, not a part of, the  CPRS record.", "Finally, five joint ventures have instituted practices to address safety  problems related to separate formularies. For example, the Mike  O\u2019Callaghan Federal Hospital at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada has a  combined P&T committee that includes both VA and DOD representatives  who select the medications that will be included on the hospital\u2019s inpatient  formulary. In addition, the committee approved nearly 50 VA formulary  medications to be stocked in the hospital pharmacy for use by VA  inpatients at this facility. All measures taken to improve medication safety,  such as entering reminders or alerts into CHCS to safeguard against  medication mistakes, also apply to VA drugs stocked in the pharmacy.  Other sites have undertaken less comprehensive measures to address  problems arising from separate formularies. For instance, pharmacies at  two sites stock drugs commonly prescribed for the other agency\u2019s  patients, but neither host agency\u2019s P&T committee has representatives  from both agencies. At two other sites, representatives from both agencies  are on the host agency\u2019s P&T committee. While these efforts are helpful in  overcoming difficulties associated with separate formularies, none is a  complete solution."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["As VA and DOD strive to improve efficiency and access to care through  greater collaboration and sharing of resources, it is likely that the number  of patients who receive care from both systems will increase.

While our findings are based on the joint venture sites, they may have  relevance wherever patient care is shared between VA and DOD.", "Some joint ventures have taken steps to address medication safety  problems for shared patients, but these steps are partial solutions and gaps  remain. For example, facilities have provided only limited access to the  other agency\u2019s patient medical information system and have not always  provided training in its use. Therefore, providers do not have adequate  access to patient medical information for shared patients, and lacking the  comprehensive capability afforded by a system like PDTS, they can  perform only incomplete checks for drug interactions and allergies. In  addition, when shared patients return to their home agency to have  prescriptions filled, providers give them handwritten or computer-printed  prescriptions, rather than electronically ordering medications, creating  risk for legibility or transcription errors. Furthermore, separate P&T  committees may be unable to effectively overcome problems that arise  from separate formularies. The measures already taken by some joint  ventures show that risks that shared patients face can be addressed. VA  and DOD could develop systemwide rather than local solutions to address  the needs of shared patients nationally as well as at the joint venture sites."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations For Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To better protect shared patients at the joint ventures, we recommend that  the Secretary of Veterans Affairs direct the Under Secretary for Health and  that the Secretary of Defense direct the Assistant Secretary of Defense for  Health Affairs to    develop the capability for VA and DOD providers to access patient medical  information relevant to medication decision making, regardless of whether  that information resides in VA\u2019s or DOD\u2019s information system and provide  training to physicians and pharmacists who need to use this access;    develop the capability to perform a comprehensive, automatic drug  interaction check that uses medication information from all VA and DOD  facilities and mail order operations and DOD\u2019s network pharmacies, and  evaluate the potential for DOD\u2019s PDTS to be used for this purpose;  require providers to use computerized order entry of medications for  shared patients where it is available and implement system modifications  that will enable providers to electronically order medications to be  dispensed at the other agency\u2019s pharmacies; and    establish a joint VA and DOD pharmacy and therapeutics committee, or  similar working group, at each joint venture site to determine how best to  safely meet the medication needs of VA and DOD shared patients and to  overcome obstacles associated with separate formularies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Defense  provided written comments on a draft of this report. These comments are  discussed below and reprinted in appendix I and appendix II, respectively.  VA concurred with all our recommendations, while DOD concurred with  two of our recommendations, partially concurred with one, and did not  concur with one.", "Both VA and DOD concurred with our recommendation to develop the  capability for VA and DOD providers to access patient medical information  in both CPRS and CHCS. In their comments, both agencies discussed  longer-term solutions, such as the joint VA-DOD Federal Health  Information Exchange (FHIE) initiative. While we support long-term  efforts that would lead toward a more seamless sharing of information  between VA and DOD, we believe that a number of joint venture sites have  demonstrated that interim steps, such as giving providers access to and  training on the other agency\u2019s system, are both warranted and feasible.", "Both agencies also concurred with our recommendation regarding the  development of comprehensive, automatic drug interaction checks,  including the evaluation of PDTS for this purpose. VA stated that this  capability would be accomplished with the second phase of the VA-DOD  joint plan, called HealthePeople (Federal), which VA expects to be  implemented in fiscal year 2005. Although agreeing to evaluate the cost  benefit of adopting PDTS, VA said that, based on VA and DOD workload  data, a relatively small number of veterans had been treated in both  systems in the period from October 2001 through May 2002 (240,716  unique patients, or 29.6 percent of all dual eligibles) and raised the issue of  whether the cost of PDTS was justified for so few cases. We believe this  almost quarter of a million patients represents a significant opportunity for  adverse drug events to occur, especially since, based on the prescription  patterns of a typical VA patient, this group received an estimated 4 million  prescriptions in this 8-month period. Furthermore, the number of patients  potentially at risk is larger than the dual eligible group. It includes an  unknown number of patients who receive care and medications from both  agencies under VA-DOD resource sharing agreements. While we agree that  cost is an important factor, we believe the large number of prescriptions  for these patients justifies an evaluation of PDTS that considers both cost  and patient safety.", "VA concurred and DOD partially concurred with our recommendation on  CPOE. VA said it has already planned for its providers to use computerized  order entry for all orders, including medications, by fiscal year 2004. It also  made reference to the Hawaii pilot project discussed earlier in this report  as a way of extending this capability for shared patients but said that a  more robust bi-directional capability would be included as a systems  requirement in the HealthePeople (Federal) effort. DOD also agreed to  require that providers use CPOE for shared patients where available;  however, it did not agree with system modifications as the approach for  extending this capability. Instead, DOD advocated the joint procurement  of a commercial off-the-shelf pharmacy information system. It said that  this approach would provide greater economic returns and system  interoperability since both agencies are pursuing plans to upgrade or  replace their pharmacy information system modules. We agree with this  approach as a longer-term solution. However, agency officials told us that  neither agency has plans to upgrade or replace its system until fiscal year  2005 at the earliest, leaving shared patients at continued risk for  medication errors until the new system is operational. System  modifications already accomplished in Hawaii indicate that interim steps  toward reducing these risks are possible.", "VA concurred with our recommendation on establishing a joint P&T  committee or similar working group at each joint venture site and said it  would pursue this recommendation via the VA/DOD Executive Committee,  a working group for VA/DOD collaboration issues. DOD did not concur  with establishing a joint P&T committee at each site; however, we  recommended the establishment of a joint VA-DOD group, either a P&T  committee or a similar working group, that would determine how best to  safely meet the medication needs of shared patients at each site. DOD  expressed support for the already-established working groups, but, as we  have noted, only three joint venture sites have such collaborative groups.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs,  the Secretary of Defense, and other interested parties.
