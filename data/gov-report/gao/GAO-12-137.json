The act requires the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to oversee and report to Congress on agency information security policies and practices, including agencies' compliance with FISMA. FISMA also requires that GAO periodically report to Congress on (1) the adequacy and effectiveness of agencies' information security policies and practices and (2) agencies' implementation of FISMA requirements. To do this, GAO analyzed information security-related reports and data from 24 major federal agencies, their inspectors general, OMB, and GAO."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Weaknesses in information security policies and practices at 24 major federal agencies continue to place the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive information and information systems at risk. Consistent with this risk, reports of security incidents from federal agencies are on the rise, increasing over 650 percent over the past 5 years. Each of the 24 agencies reviewed had weaknesses in information security controls. An underlying reason for these weaknesses is that agencies have not fully implemented their information security programs. As a result, they have limited assurance that controls are in place and operating as intended to protect their information resources, thereby leaving them vulnerable to attack or compromise. In reports for fiscal years 2010 and 2011, GAO and agency inspectors general have made hundreds of recommendations to agencies for actions necessary to resolve control deficiencies and information security program shortfalls. Agencies generally agreed with most of GAO's recommendations and indicated that they would implement them. OMB, agencies, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology took actions intended to improve the implementation of security requirements, but more work is necessary. Beginning in fiscal year 2009, OMB provided agencies with a new online tool to report their information security postures and, in fiscal year 2010, instituted the use of new and revised metrics. Nevertheless, OMB's guidance for those metrics did not always provide performance targets for measuring improvement. In addition, weaknesses were identified in the processes agencies used to implement requirements. Specifically, agencies did not always ensure (1) personnel with significant responsibilities received training; (2) security controls were monitored continuously; (3) weaknesses were remediated effectively; and (4) incidents were resolved in a timely manner, among other areas. Until hundreds of recommendations are implemented and program weaknesses are corrected, agencies will continue to face challenges in securing their information and information systems."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is recommending that the Director of OMB provide performance targets for metrics included in OMB's annual FISMA reporting instructions to agencies and inspectors general.

In addition, the Federal Deposit  Insurance Corporation did not have policies, procedures, and controls  in place to ensure the appropriate segregation of incompatible duties,  adequately manage the configuration of its financial information  systems, and update contingency plans. An underlying reason for  these weaknesses was that the corporation did not always fully  implement several information security program activities, such as  effectively developing, documenting, and implementing security  policies. As a result, it faced an elevated risk of the misuse of federal  assets, unauthorized modification or destruction of financial  information, inappropriate disclosure of other sensitive information,  and disruption of computer operations.

For example, in February 2011, OMB and DHS  set several targets for implementing various Homeland Security  Presidential Directive 12 requirements in their memorandum to federal  agencies. While targets may be provided in various memorandums and  guidance, agencies may still be unaware of the thresholds that are to be  met as part of their annual report requirements.

In addition, agencies are required to  provide appropriate information security training to personnel who have  significant security responsibilities. For fiscal year 2010, OMB required  agencies to report, among other things, (1) the number of agency users  with log-in privileges who had been given security awareness training  annually and (2) the number of agency users with significant security  responsibilities who had been given specialized, role-based, security  training annually.", "In fiscal year 2010, the 24 major agencies reported that 92 percent of  users with log-in privileges had been given annual security awareness  training, and that 88 percent of users with significant security  responsibilities had received specialized training.

Specifically, inspectors general for 17 of 24  major agencies cited weaknesses in their agency\u2019s training programs example, 5 inspectors general reported that less than 90 percent of  employees with log-in privileges had attended security awareness training in the last year. In addition, 11 inspectors general reported that less than  90 percent of employees, contractors, and other users with significant  security responsibilities had attended specialized training in the past yea Inspectors general for 11 agencies also reported that identification and  tracking of those with significant security responsibilities were not  adequate.
