In these  five locations, the percent of beneficiaries who reported that they had  problems finding a specialty care provider was at or above the 2012- 2015 beneficiary surveys\u2019 national average of 23 percent, and also  where the percent of specialty care providers who reported that they  were accepting new TRICARE patients was at or below the 2012- 2015 civilian provider surveys\u2019 national average of 78 percent.", "When we compared this analysis to our analysis of the 2008-2011  beneficiary and provider surveys, the \u201cDallas/Fort Worth, Texas\u201d HSA  was identified in both results. Using data from the prior survey, our  analysis identified it as being potentially problematic for primary care, but  using data from the more recent survey, we identified specialty care  access as being potentially problematic. DOD officials told us that their  past analysis of beneficiaries\u2019 complaints in this location centered on  appointment wait times exceeding beneficiaries\u2019 preferences and on drive  times to providers\u2019 offices. Officials explained that although there was a  wide range of network specialty care providers in this location, TRICARE  beneficiaries were a very small percentage of the overall population.  Furthermore, this location is home to a number of large corporations that  have health care plans that reimburse providers more than TRICARE.  DOD officials added that due to these factors, providers in this location do  not give preference to TRICARE beneficiaries, and drive times in this  location are often long due to the traffic patterns and overall congestion of  a large urban area."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["In reviewing a draft of this report, DOD concurred with our overall  findings.
