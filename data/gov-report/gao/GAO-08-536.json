In addition, the E-Government Act of 2002 requires federal agencies to conduct privacy impact assessments for systems or collections containing personal information. GAO was asked to determine whether laws and guidance consistently cover the federal government's collection and use of personal information and incorporate key privacy principles. GAO was also asked, in doing so, to identify options for addressing these issues. To achieve these objectives, GAO analyzed the laws and related guidance, obtained an operational perspective from federal agencies, and consulted an expert panel convened by the National Academy of Sciences."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Increasingly sophisticated ways of obtaining and using personally identifiable information have raised concerns about the adequacy of the legal framework for privacy protection. Although the Privacy Act, the E-Government Act, and related guidance from the Office of Management and Budget set minimum privacy requirements for agencies, they may not consistently protect personally identifiable information in all circumstances of its collection and use throughout the federal government and may not fully adhere to key privacy principles. Based on discussions with privacy experts, agency officials, and analysis of laws and related guidance, GAO identified issues in three major areas: Applying privacy protections consistently to all federal collection and use of personal information. The Privacy Act's definition of a \"system of records\" (any grouping of records containing personal information retrieved by individual identifier), which sets the scope of the act's protections, does not always apply whenever personal information is obtained and processed by federal agencies. One alternative to address this concern would be revising the system-of-records definition to cover all personally identifiable information collected, used, and maintained systematically by the federal government. Ensuring that collection and use of personally identifiable information is limited to a stated purpose. According to generally accepted privacy principles of purpose specification, collection limitation, and use limitation, the collection of personal information should be limited, and its use should be limited to a specified purpose. Yet, current laws and guidance impose only the modest requirements in these areas. While, in the post-9/11 environment, the federal government needs better analysis and sharing of certain personal information, there is general agreement that this need must be balanced with individual privacy rights. Alternatives to address this area of concern include requiring agencies to justify the collection and use of key elements of personally identifiable information and to establish agreements before sharing such information with other agencies. Establishing effective mechanisms for informing the public about privacy protections. Another key privacy principle, the principle of openness, suggests that the public should be informed about privacy policies and practices. Yet, Privacy Act notices may not effectively inform the public about government uses of personal information. For example, system-of-records notices published in the Federal Register (the government's official vehicle for issuing public notices) may be difficult for the general public to fully understand. Layered notices, which provide only the most important summary facts up front, have been used as a solution in the private sector. In addition, publishing such notices at a central location on the Web would help make them more accessible."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The increasingly sophisticated ways in which personally identifiable  information is obtained and used by the federal government has the  potential to assist in performing critical functions, such as preventing  terrorism, but also can pose challenges in ensuring the protection of  citizens\u2019 privacy.

The Privacy Act of  1974 serves as the major mechanism for controlling the collection, use,  and disclosure of personally identifiable information within the federal  government. The act provides safeguards for information in a system of  records (any grouping of records containing personal information  retrieved by individual identifier) maintained by a federal agency. The act  also allows citizens to learn how their personal information is collected,  maintained, used, and disseminated by the federal government. As a result  of the act\u2019s requirements, the public has benefited from privacy  protections applied to countless government systems of records.", "The E-Government Act of 2002 strives to enhance protection of personal  information in government information systems by requiring that agencies  conduct privacy impact assessments (PIA).

In  1975, OMB issued Privacy Act Implementation Guidelines. Since that time,  it has provided periodic supplemental guidance related to privacy on  specific subjects.", "The provisions of the Privacy Act are largely based on a set of principles  for protecting the privacy and security of personal information, known as  the Fair Information Practices, which were first proposed in 1973 by a U.S.  government advisory committee. These principles, now widely accepted,  include:    accountability.", "These principles, with some variation, are used by organizations to  address privacy considerations in their business practices and are also the  basis of privacy laws and related policies in many countries, including the  United States, Germany, Sweden, Australia, and New Zealand, as well as  the European Union.", "Since enactment of the Privacy Act nearly 35 years ago, both the  techniques employed by the federal government to obtain and process  personally identifiable information and the technology used to support its  collection, maintenance, dissemination, and use have changed  dramatically. Advances in information technology have enabled agencies  to more easily acquire, analyze, and share personally identifiable  information from a variety of sources in increasingly diverse ways and for  increasingly sophisticated purposes.", "Given the advances in technology used to process, store, share, and  manipulate personal information, you asked us to identify major issues  regarding whether the Privacy Act of 1974, the E-Government Act of 2002,  and related guidance consistently cover the federal government\u2019s  collection and use of personal information and incorporate key privacy  principles. Our objective was not focused on evaluating compliance with  these laws; rather, it was to identify major issues concerning their  sufficiency in light of current uses of personal information by the federal  government. You also asked us to identify options for addressing these  issues.", "To address our objective, we analyzed the Privacy Act of 1974, section 208  of the E-Government Act, and related guidance to identify any  inconsistencies or gaps in the coverage of these laws as they apply to uses  of personal information by federal agencies. We also compared these laws  and related guidance with the fair information practices to identify any  significant gaps, including assessing the role of the Paperwork Reduction  Act (PRA) in protecting privacy by limiting collection of information. We  obtained an operational perspective on the sufficiency of these laws from  six departments and agencies with large inventories of information  collections, prominent privacy issues, and varied missions: the  Departments of Health and Human Services (HHS), Homeland Security  (DHS), Justice (DOJ), and Transportation (DOT); the Internal Revenue  Service (IRS); and the Social Security Administration (SSA).

The committee\u2019s final report proposed a set  of principles for protecting the privacy and security of personal  information, known as the Fair Information Practices. These practices  were intended to address what the committee termed a poor level of  protection afforded to privacy under existing law, and they underlie the  major provisions of the Privacy Act, which was enacted the following year.  A revised version of the Fair Information Practices, developed by the  Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in  1980, has been widely adopted. This version of the principles was  reaffirmed by OECD ministers in a 1998 declaration and further endorsed  in a 2006 OECD report. The OECD version of the principles is shown  table 1.", "The Fair Information Practices are, with some variation, the basis of  privacy laws and related policies in many countries, including the United  States, Germany, Sweden, Australia, and New Zealand, as well as the  European Union. They are also reflected in a variety of federal agency  policy statements, beginning with an endorsement of the OECD principles  by the Department of Commerce in 1981, and including policy statements  from DHS, DOJ, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development.  In 2004, the Chief Information Officers Council issued a coordinating draft  of its Security and Privacy Profile for the Federal Enterprise Architecture  that links privacy protection with a set of acceptable privacy principles  corresponding to the OECD\u2019s version of the Fair Information Practices.", "In addition, in a 2007 report on \u201cEngaging Privacy and Information  Technology in a Digital Age,\u201d the National Research Council found that the  principles of fair information practice for the protection of personal  information are as relevant today as they were in 1973. Accordingly, the  committee recommended that the fair information practices should be  extended as far as reasonably feasible to apply to private-sector  organizations that collect and use personal information.", "The Fair Information Practices are not precise legal requirements. Rather,  they provide a framework of principles for balancing the need for privacy  with other public policy interests, such as national security, law  enforcement, and administrative efficiency. Striking that balance varies  among countries and among types of information (e.g., medical,  employment information)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Federal Laws and Guidance Govern Use of Personal Information in Federal Agencies", "paragraphs": ["There is no single federal law that governs all use or disclosure of personal  information. Instead, U.S. law includes a number of separate statutes that  provide privacy protections for information used for specific purposes or  maintained by specific entities. The major requirements for the protection  of personal privacy by federal agencies come from two laws, the Privacy  Act of 1974 and the privacy provisions of the E-Government Act of 2002.", "The Privacy Act places limitations on agencies\u2019 collection, disclosure, and  use of personal information maintained in systems of records. The act  describes a \u201crecord\u201d as any item, collection, or grouping of information  about an individual that is maintained by an agency and contains his or her  name or another personal identifier. It also defines \u201csystem of records\u201d as  a group of records under the control of any agency from which  information is retrieved by the name of the individual or by an individual  identifier. The Privacy Act requires that when agencies establish or make  changes to a system of records, they must notify the public through a  system-of-records notice in the Federal Register that identifies, among  other things, the categories of data collected, the categories of individuals  about whom information is collected, the intended \u201croutine\u201d uses of data,  and procedures that individuals can use to review and correct personally  identifiable information.", "The act\u2019s requirements also apply to government contractors when  agencies contract for the operation of a system of records to accomplish  an agency function. According to OMB guidance, in these situations the  contractual instrument between the agency and the contractor must  specify that such records are to be maintained in accordance with the act.  As explained by OMB, this requirement was not intended to cover private- sector record-keeping systems, but only those systems actually taking the  place of a federal system that, but for the contract, would have been  performed by an agency and covered by the Privacy Act.", "Several provisions of the act require agencies to define and limit collection  and use to predefined purposes. For example, the act requires that to the  greatest extent practicable, personal information should be collected  directly from the subject individual when it may affect an individual\u2019s  rights or benefits under a federal program. The act also requires that an  agency inform individuals whom it asks to supply information of (1) the  authority for soliciting the information and whether disclosure of such  information is mandatory or voluntary; (2) the principal purposes for  which the information is intended to be used; (3) the routine uses that may  be made of the information; and (4) the effects on the individual, if any, of  not providing the information. According to OMB, this requirement is  based on the assumption that individuals should be provided with  sufficient information about the request to make a decision about whether  to respond.", "In handling collected information, agencies are generally required by the  Privacy Act to, among other things, allow individuals to (1) review their  records (meaning any information pertaining to them that is contained in  the system of records), (2) request a copy of their record or information  from the system of records, and (3) request corrections to their  information.", "Agencies are allowed to claim exemptions from some of the provisions of  the Privacy Act if the records are used for certain purposes. For example,  records compiled by criminal law enforcement agencies for criminal law  enforcement purposes can be exempt from a number of provisions,  including (1) the requirement to notify individuals of the purposes and  uses of the information at the time of collection and (2) the requirement to  ensure the accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and completeness of records. A  broader category of investigative records compiled for criminal or civil  law enforcement purposes can also be exempted from a somewhat smaller  number of Privacy Act provisions, including the requirement to provide  individuals with access to their records and to inform the public of the  categories of sources of records. In general, the exemptions for law  enforcement purposes are intended to prevent the disclosure of  information collected as part of an ongoing investigation that could impair  the investigation or allow those under investigation to change their  behavior or take other actions to escape prosecution. Statutory  exemptions under the Privacy Act are summarized in appendix III.", "In 1988, Congress passed the Computer Matching and Privacy Protection  Act as an amendment to the Privacy Act, to establish procedural  safeguards that affect agencies\u2019 use of Privacy Act records from benefit  programs in performing certain types of computerized matching programs.  For example, the 1988 act requires agencies to create written agreements  specifying the terms under which matches are to be done. \u2026information is handled: (i) to ensure handling conforms to applicable legal, regulatory,  and policy requirements regarding privacy; (ii) to determine the risks and effects of  collecting, maintaining, and disseminating information in identifiable form in an electronic  information system; and (iii) to examine and evaluate protections and alternative processes  for handling information to mitigate potential privacy risks.", "Agencies must conduct PIAs (1) before developing or procuring  information technology that collects, maintains, or disseminates  information that is in identifiable form or (2) before initiating any new  data collections of information in an identifiable form that will be  collected, maintained, or disseminated using information technology if the  same questions are asked of 10 or more people. OMB guidance also  requires agencies to conduct PIAs when a system change creates new  privacy risks, for example, changing the way in which personal  information is being used. According to OMB, no assessment is required  when the information relates to internal government operations, the  information has been previously assessed under an evaluation similar to a  PIA, or when privacy issues are unchanged.", "The PRA applies to federal information collections and was designed to  help ensure that when the government asks the public for information, the  burden of providing this information is as small as possible and the  information itself is used effectively. Such collections may have a range  of purposes, which may or may not involve the collection of personal  information, including applications for government benefits, program  evaluation, general purpose statistics, research and regulation or  compliance; all of these information collections may occur in a variety of  forms, including questionnaires and telephone surveys. To achieve the  goal of minimizing paperwork burden while maximizing the public benefit  and utility of the information collected, the act includes provisions that  establish standards and procedures for effective implementation and  oversight of information collections. Among these provisions is the  requirement that agencies not establish information collections without  having them approved by OMB, and that before submitting them for  approval, agencies\u2019 chief information officers certify that the collections  meet 10 specified standards, including that the collection is necessary for  the proper performance of agency functions and avoids unnecessary  duplication. The law also requires agencies both to publish notices in the  Federal Register and to otherwise consult with the public about their  planned collections.", "Privacy is also addressed in the legal framework for the emerging  information sharing environment. As directed by the Intelligence Reform  and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, the administration has taken steps,  beginning in 2005, to establish an information sharing environment to  facilitate the sharing of terrorism-related information with protections for  privacy and civil liberties. The move was driven by the recognition that  before the attacks of September 11, 2001, federal agencies had been  unable to effectively share information about suspected terrorists and  their activities. In addressing this problem, the National Commission on  Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States (9/11 Commission)  recommended that the sharing and uses of information be guided by a set  of practical policy guidelines that would simultaneously empower and  constrain officials, closely circumscribing what types of information they  would be permitted to share as well as the types of information they would  need to protect. Exchanging terrorism-related information continues to be  a significant challenge for federal, state, and local governments\u2014one that  we recognize is not easily addressed.

The PPSC found that if informational privacy  is to be protected, public policy must focus on certain systemic features  such as the proliferating use of information for a different purpose than  for what it was originally collected, and the greater use of third-party  reporting.", "The commission concluded that it would be beneficial to create a federal  body to oversee, regulate, and enforce compliance with the commission\u2019s  recommendations.

Specifically, ISPAB observed that \u201cwith the migration toward e- government services, greater demands will be placed on the government\u2019s  privacy policies and systems.\u201d ISPAB further observed that the public\u2019s  willingness to use such services will depend \u201cin large measure on their  confidence that the information that they disclose will be safeguarded.\u201d", "The ISPAB report further stated that, \u201cchanges in technology, the privacy  management challenges stemming from expanded e-government services,  the accelerated interaction of networked information systems within and  across critical infrastructure boundaries, and the extended, routine  exchange of data among Federal and non-Federal government and non- government systems - all mandate immediate and serious attention to  Federal government\u2019s data privacy policies and operational controls.\u201d  Among the issues identified was a need for a review of the sufficiency and  relevance of the Privacy Act to determine whether modifications were  required, given the numerous changes affecting privacy that had occurred  since the act was passed.", "Following up on its 2002 report, in 2005 ISPAB issued a \u201cPrivacy Act White  Paper\u201d raising the question of whether the existing legal and policy  framework governing the information practices of federal agencies was  sufficient to protect the privacy of individuals about whom the federal  government maintained or used personal information. The paper  postulated that \u201claws and policies have not kept pace with changes in  technology and information and handling processes and suggests the need  for an open dialogue on what changes in law and policy are needed and  how to best make those changes.\u201d Accordingly, in 2006 ISPAB initiated a  partnership with the DHS Data Privacy and Integrity Advisory Committee  to develop recommendations on a 21st century framework for revisions to  the Privacy Act and other federal privacy statutes. Work on this initiative  was ongoing at the time of our review.", "In 2007, the National Research Council issued a report entitled Engaging  Privacy and Information Technology in a Digital Age.

With regard to government use of personal  information, the committee found that the government has important roles  to play in protecting the privacy of individuals and groups and in ensuring  that decisions concerning privacy are made in an informed fashion.  However, the report characterized the U.S. legal and regulatory framework  as \u201ca patchwork that lacks consistent principles or unifying themes.\u201d The  committee concluded that a less decentralized and more integrated  approach to privacy policy in the United States could bring a greater  degree of coherence to the subject of privacy. The committee  recommended that the U.S. government undertake a broad systematic  review of national privacy laws and regulations.", "Further, with regard specifically to government use of personal  information, the committee found that \u201cbecause the benefits of privacy  often are less tangible and immediate than the perceived benefits of other  interests, such as public security and economic efficiency, privacy is at an  inherent disadvantage when decision makers weigh privacy against these  other interests.\u201d The committee concluded that, to reduce this inherent  disadvantage, governments at federal, state, and local levels should  establish mechanisms for the institutional advocacy of privacy within  government.

There are several different ways in which federal collection and  use of personally identifiable information could be outside of such a  construct and thus not receive the Privacy Act\u2019s protections:    Personally identifiable information held by the government is not  always retrieved by identifier. The Privacy Act defines a system of  records as \u201ca group of records under the control of any agency from  which information is retrieved by the name of the individual or by some  identifying number, symbol, or other identifying particular assigned to the  individual.\u201d If personally identifiable information (records) is not retrieved  by identifier but instead accessed through some other method or criteria\u2014 for example, by searching for all individuals who have a certain medical  condition or who applied for benefits on a certain date\u2014the system would  not meet the Privacy Act\u2019s system-of-records definition and therefore  would not be governed by the act\u2019s protections.

In its 1977 report, the PPSC pointed out  that retrieval by name or identifier reflected a manual rather than a  computer-based model of information processing and did not take into  account emerging computing technology. As the study explained, while  manual record-keeping systems are likely to store and retrieve information  by reference to a unique identifier, this is unnecessary in computer-based  systems that permit attribute searches. The PPSC noted that retrieval of  individually identifiable information by scanning (or searching) large  volumes of computer records was not only possible but an ever-increasing  agency practice.", "Our 2003 report concerning compliance with the Privacy Act found that  the PPSC\u2019s observations had been borne out across federal agencies.

Based on survey responses from 25 agencies in 2002, we  estimated that 70 percent of the agencies\u2019 systems of records contained  electronic records and that 11 percent of information systems in use at  those agencies contained personal information that was outside a Privacy  Act system of records. We also reported that among the agencies we  surveyed, the most frequently cited reason for systems not being  considered Privacy Act systems of records was that the agency did not use  a personal identifier to retrieve the personal information.", "Recent OMB guidance reflects an acknowledgement that, although  personally identifiable information does not always reside in Privacy Act  systems of records, it should nevertheless be protected. Following a  number of highly publicized data breaches at government agencies, OMB  issued guidance instructing agencies to take action to safeguard  \u201cpersonally identifiable information.\u201d Beginning in May 2006, OMB  required senior agency privacy officials to \u201cconduct a review of policies  and processes and take corrective action as appropriate to ensure  adequate safeguards to prevent the intentional or negligent misuse of, or  unauthorized access to personally identifiable information.\u201d Most recently,  in May 2007, OMB required agencies to review and reduce \u201call current  holding of personally identifiable information.\u201d This guidance is not  limited to information that is \u201cretrieved by identifier\u201d or contained within  systems of records.", "The Privacy Act\u2019s protections may not apply to contemporary data  processing technologies and applications. In today\u2019s highly  interconnected environment, information can be gathered from many  different sources, analyzed, and redistributed in very dynamic,  unstructured ways that may have little to do with the file-oriented concept  of a Privacy Act system of records. For example, data mining, a prevalent  technique used by federal agencies for extracting useful information from  large volumes of data, may escape the purview of the Privacy Act\u2019s  protections. Specifically, a data-mining system that performs analysis by  looking for patterns in personal information located in other systems of  records or that performs subject-based queries across multiple data  sources may not constitute a system of records under the act.", "In recent years, reports required by law on data mining have described  activities that had not been identified as systems of records covered by the  Privacy Act. In one example, DHS reported that all the data sources for the  planned Analysis Dissemination Visualization Insight and Semantic  Enhancement (ADVISE) data mining program were covered by existing  system-of-records notices; however, the system itself was not covered, and  no system of records notice was created specifically to document  protections under the Privacy Act governing the specific activities of the  system. ADVISE was a data-mining tool intended to allow an analyst to  search for patterns in data\u2014such as relationships among people,  organizations, and events\u2014and to produce visual representations of those  patterns.", "This was also the case with other data mining programs reported by DHS  and DOJ. For example, DHS reported on a data mining system known as  Intelligence and Information Fusion\u2014which provides intelligence analysts  with an ability to view, query, and analyze multiple data sources from  within the government\u2014that is not considered a Privacy Act system of  records. While DHS reported that the system was \u201ccovered\u201d by the system- of-records notice for the Homeland Security Operations Center Database,  that notice does not specifically describe the uses of the Intelligence and  Information Fusion system. Thus, while the underlying data sources are  subject to the protections of the act, the uses of the Intelligence and  Information Fusion system have not been specifically addressed.", "Likewise, DOJ reported that its Foreign Terrorist Tracking Task Force  was developing a data mining system, known as the System to Assess Risk,  to assist analysts in prioritizing persons of possible investigative interest in  support of a specified terrorist threat. DOJ reported that the system\u2019s data  sources were covered by the system-of-records notice for the Federal  Bureau of Investigation\u2019s (FBI) Central Records System. However, the  Central Records System notice does not specifically describe the uses of  the System to Assess Risk and thus provides no evidence that the Privacy  Act\u2019s protections are being applied to the system. The fact that these  notices do not specifically describe data-mining systems that they are said  to include reflects the limitations of the system-of-records construct as a  way to identify, assess, and report on the protections being applied to  these types of analytical uses. As a result, personally identifiable  information collected and processed by such systems may be less well  protected than if it were more specifically addressed by the Privacy Act.", "Use of personal information from third party sources is not consistently  covered by the Privacy Act. The Privacy Act requires agencies to collect  information to the greatest extent practicable directly from the subject  individual when the information may result in adverse determinations  about an individual\u2019s rights, benefits, and privileges under federal  programs. Yet agencies have increasingly turned to other sources to  collect personal information, particularly third-party sources such as  information resellers\u2014companies that amass and sell personal  information from many sources. Concerns were raised in our expert forum  that government agencies may be using such third-party sources as a way  to avoid the constraints of the Privacy Act.", "In our 2006 report on federal agency use of personal information from  information resellers, we noted that agency officials said they generally  did not prepare system-of-records notices for the use of information  resellers because they were not required to do so by the Privacy Act. The  Privacy Act makes its provisions applicable to third-party systems when  \u201can agency provides by a contract for the operation by or on behalf of the  agency a system of records to accomplish an agency function.\u201d According  to agency officials, information reseller databases were not considered  systems of records operated \u201cby or on behalf of a government agency\u201d  because resellers develop their databases for multiple customers, not the  federal government exclusively. Further, agency officials stated that  merely querying information reseller databases did not amount to  maintaining the information that was obtained, and thus the provisions of  the Privacy Act did not apply. In many cases, agency officials considered  their use of reseller data to be of this type\u2014essentially \u201cad hoc\u201d querying  or \u201cpinging\u201d of databases for personal information about specific  individuals, which they were not doing in connection with a designated  system of records. Thus, these sources, which agencies use for many  purposes, have not been considered subject to the provisions of the  Privacy Act. As a result, individuals may be limited in their ability to learn  that information is being collected about them, because the information is  being obtained from other sources and the activity is not publicly  described in a system-of-records notice. Further, the Privacy Act\u2019s  constraints on collection, use, and disclosure would not apply.", "In our 2006 report, we made recommendations to OMB to revise its  guidance to clarify the applicability of requirements for public notices and  privacy impact assessments with respect to agency use of personal  information from resellers. We also recommended that OMB direct  agencies to review their uses of such information to ensure it is explicitly  referenced in privacy notices and assessments. However, OMB has not  addressed our recommendations. OMB stated that following the  completion of work on the protection of personal information through the  Identity Theft Task Force, it would consider issuing appropriate guidance  concerning reseller data. OMB issued guidance based on the work of the  Identity Theft Task Force in May 2007; however, it did not include  clarifying guidance concerning reseller data. Without clarifying guidance,  agencies may continue to consider use of reseller data as not covered by  the Privacy Act and thus may not apply the Privacy Act\u2019s protections to  this use."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The E-Government Act Applies More Broadly Than the Privacy Act but Lacks Explicit Constraints on Agency Actions", "paragraphs": ["The E-Government Act\u2019s requirements for the conduct of PIAs apply to a  broader range of government activities than are currently covered by the  Privacy Act\u2019s definition of a system of records.

Senior agency privacy officials at several agencies reported that their PIA  processes are incorporated into key stages in systems development. For  example, senior agency privacy officials at the IRS reported that PIAs are  required at every stage of the systems development life cycle for new  systems or systems undergoing major modifications. In addition, five of  the six agencies we interviewed reported that they use a privacy threshold  analysis, a brief assessment that requires system owners to answer basic  questions on the nature of their systems and whether the systems contain  personally identifiable information, to identify systems that require a PIA;  this approach enables agencies to ensure that systems undergo the PIA  process at the earliest stages of development.", "Privacy experts and senior agency privacy officials we interviewed also  noted that the E-Government Act provides a mechanism to address certain  uses of personal information that might not have been covered by the  Privacy Act. According to OMB guidance, PIAs are required to be  performed and updated whenever a system change creates new privacy  risks. Among the types of changes identified in OMB guidance that might  require conducting a PIA are when converting from paper to electronic  records, when applying new technologies that significantly change how  information in identifiable form is managed in the system, and when  merging databases to create one central source of information. Typically,  under the Privacy Act changes of this nature could result in limited  modifications to a system-of-records notice to reflect additional categories  of records and/or routine uses. It would not result in a reassessment of  privacy risks, as is required for a PIA.", "Because the E-Government Act\u2019s PIA requirement applies more broadly  than the Privacy Act, it may help in part to address concerns about the  narrow definition of terms in the Privacy Act. Specifically, a well-written  PIA can inform the public about such things as what information is being  collected, why it is being collected, and how it is to be used. However, the  E-Government Act does not include the specific constraints on how  information is to be collected, maintained, and shared that are included in  the Privacy Act\u2014such as restrictions on disclosure of personal  information and requirements to allow for access to and correction of  records by individuals, among other things. Further, the E-Government  Act only applies to information technology systems and therefore does not  address personal information contained in paper records.", "In addition, the E-Government Act may not be broad enough to cover all  cases in which the federal government makes determinations about what  personal information is to be collected and how it is to be protected. A  major function that is not covered is rulemaking that involves the  collection of personally identifiable information. Rulemaking is the  process by which federal agencies establish regulations that can govern  individual behavior as well as commercial and other activities. For  example, DHS is required by the Homeland Security Act to conduct PIAs  for all of its proposed rules, and, as a result, PIAs have been conducted  for major initiatives, including the REAL ID Act, which required DHS to  establish minimum standards for state-issued drivers\u2019 licenses and  identification cards that federal agencies would accept for official  purposes, and the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative, aimed at  strengthening border security and facilitating entry into the United States  for U.S. citizens and certain foreign visitors through a standardized  identification card. These PIAs have provided for the evaluation of privacy  considerations before final decisions are made concerning specific  technologies to be used in drivers\u2019 licenses and border-crossing  identification cards issued by state governments.

Like the Privacy Protection Study Commission, which  believed in 1977 that the act\u2019s definition of a system of records should be  revised, experts at our forum were in agreement that the system-of- records definition is outdated and flawed. The experts agreed that the act\u2019s  protections should be applied whenever agencies obtain, process, store, or  share personally identifiable information\u2014not just when records are  retrieved by personal identifier. Such an approach could address concerns  that certain activities, such as data mining or retrieving information from  commercial information resellers could avoid the protections of the act.", "As shown in table 3, several recent OMB memoranda providing direction  to federal agencies on privacy protection reflects this approach.", "The Privacy Act\u2019s narrowly scoped system-of-records definition does not  match OMB\u2019s broadened approach to protecting personally identifiable  information. Changing the system-of-records definition is an option that  could help ensure that the act\u2019s protections are consistently applied to all  personally identifiable information.", "Revise the E-Government Act\u2019s scope to cover federal rulemaking.

For example, the Privacy Act\u2019s  requirement that information be \u201crelevant and necessary\u201d gives broad  latitude to agencies in determining the amount of information to collect. In  addition, mechanisms to limit use to a specified purpose may be weak. For  example, the Privacy Act does not limit agency internal use of information,  as long as it is needed for an official purpose or include provisions  addressing external sharing with other entities to ensure that the  information\u2019s new custodians preserve the act\u2019s protections. Examples of  alternatives for addressing these issues include setting specific limits on  routine uses and use of information within agencies to include more  specific limits, requiring agencies to justify how collection has been  limited in privacy notices, and requiring agencies to establish formal  agreements with external governmental entities before sharing personally  identifiable information with them."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Fair Information Practices Call for Purpose Specification and Limitations on Collection and Use of Personal Information", "paragraphs": ["A key area of concern about personal information maintained by  government agencies is to ensure that limits are placed on what the  government acquires and how it uses the information\u2014thus giving  individuals a measure of control over their own personal information. Two  of the fair information practices relate specifically to limiting the way the  government collects and uses personal information: collection limitation  and use limitation. A third principle\u2014purpose specification\u2014is critical to  ensuring that the other two are applied effectively.", "The purpose specification principle states that the purpose for the  collection of personal information should be disclosed before the  collection is made and upon any change to that purpose, and its use  should be limited to that purpose and compatible purposes. Clearly  specifying the purpose of a given activity establishes the measure for  determining whether the collection of information has been sufficiently  limited to what is relevant for the purpose and whether the ways in which  the information is used have also been limited to what is appropriate for  the same purpose.", "The collection limitation principle states that the collection of personal  information should be limited, should be obtained by lawful and fair  means, and, where appropriate, with the knowledge or consent of the  individual. When the collection limitation principle is applied, individuals  can gain assurance that the information about them that is being collected  is only what is needed to perform a specific, predisclosed function. In the  government arena, this mitigates the risk that an over-collection of  personal information could facilitate the improper use of that information  to make adverse determinations. For example, the Transportation Security  Administration (TSA) received criticism about its now-cancelled  Computer-Assisted Passenger Pre-screening System II because it proposed  to collect information from third-party sources in addition to airline  passengers themselves. Concerns were raised that individuals could be  delayed or denied boarding their airline flights based on third-party  information that was potentially inaccurate. In developing a successor  project, called Secure Flight, TSA responded to privacy concerns by  planning to collect far less information and to focus on information  collected directly from individuals.", "A closely related principle\u2014the use limitation principle\u2014provides that  personal information, once collected, should not be disclosed or used for  other than a specified purpose without consent of the individual or legal  authority. The use limitation principle is arguably of heightened  importance in the government arena because the government has many  functions that affect numerous aspects of an individual\u2019s well-being.  Hence, it is important to ensure that information the government collects  for one function is not used indiscriminately for other unrelated functions.  By requiring the government to define a specific purpose for the collection  of personal information and limit its use to that specified purpose,  individuals gain assurance that their privacy will be protected and their  information will not be used in ways that could jeopardize their rights or  otherwise unfairly affect them."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Privacy Act Does Not Ensure That Purposes Are Always Stated and Are Specific", "paragraphs": ["The Privacy Act includes requirements that agencies (1) inform individuals  from whom information is being collected of the principal purpose or  purposes for which the information is intended to be used and (2) publish  a system-of-records notice in the Federal Register of the existence and  character of the system of records, including planned routine uses of the  records and the purpose of each of these routine uses. Concerns have  been raised that the act\u2019s requirements do not go far enough in ensuring  that the government\u2019s planned purposes are sufficiently specified:    Statements of overall purpose are not always required. The Privacy Act  requires agencies to inform individuals on forms used to collect  information from them of the principal purpose or purposes for which the  information is intended to be used. This is an important provision that  protects individuals when the government is collecting information  directly from them. However, in many cases, agencies obtain information  about individuals from other sources, such as commercial entities  (including information resellers) and other governmental entities. In those  cases, no overall declaration of purpose is required in the system-of- records notice. For each of the stated routine uses a description is  required of the potential purposes for which the records may be used;  however, there is no requirement for a declaration of the purpose or  purposes for the system of records as a whole. Given that individuals may  be especially concerned about how their information is collected from  different government and commercial entities, not having an overall  purpose associated with this information raises concerns.", "Purpose descriptions in public notices are not required to be specific. As  mentioned above, while there is no requirement for an overall statement of  purpose, Privacy Act notices may contain multiple descriptions of  purposes associated with routine uses, and agencies are not required to be  specific in formulating these purposes. OMB guidance on the act gives  agencies discretion to determine how to define the range of appropriate  uses and associated purposes that it intends for a given system of records.  For example, purpose statements for certain law enforcement and anti- terrorism systems might need to be phrased broadly enough so as not to  reveal investigative techniques or the details of ongoing cases. However,  overly broadly-defined purposes could allow for unnecessarily broad  collections of information and ranges of subsequent uses, thus calling into  question whether meaningful limitations had been imposed.  For example, in previous work on international passenger prescreening by  DHS\u2019s Customs and Border Protection (CBP), we reported that CBP\u2019s  public notices and reports regarding its international prescreening process  did not fully or accurately describe CBP\u2019s use of personal data throughout  the passenger prescreening process. In that case, CBP relied on a system- of-records notice for the Treasury Enforcement Communications  System\u2014one of several data sources used in the prescreening process\u2014to  notify the public about the purpose of the international prescreening  program. The notice, however, did not mention CBP\u2019s passenger  prescreening purpose but simply included a broad statement about its law  enforcement purpose, namely that \u201cevery possible type of information  from a variety of Federal, state and local sources, which contributes to  effective law enforcement may be maintained in this system of records.\u201d  Use of such a sweeping purpose statement obscured its use in  international passenger prescreening and did not establish a basis for  limiting use of the information in the system. Its use shows that the act  does not require the government to clearly state its purposes for collecting  and using personal information.", "Another example can be found in the system-of-records notice for the  FBI\u2019s Central Records System. The FBI relies on this notice to inform the  public about a broad range of files it maintains and uses for a variety of  different purposes. According to the notice, the Central Records System  contains investigative, personnel, applicant, administrative, and \u201cgeneral\u201d  files. In addition to information within 281 different categories of legal  violations over which the FBI has investigative jurisdiction, the files also  include information pertaining to personnel, applicant, and administrative  matters. As a result, it is unclear from the notice how any given record in  this system is to be used. While law enforcement agencies are often  concerned about revealing their methods to criminals, descriptions of the  specific purposes of FBI systems could be crafted to avoid revealing what  information had been collected about any specific individual or how it was  being used by the agency. DOJ officials acknowledged that there has been  frequent criticism of the broad scope of the Central Records System notice  but said the notice had been structured that way because all the records  covered by the notice are organized according to that same indexing  hierarchy. More significantly, the Privacy Act does not require that  systems of records be defined and described more specifically. Like the  CBP notice, the FBI notice demonstrates that the act does not require the  government to clearly state its purposes for collecting and using personal  information."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Laws and Guidance May Not Effectively Limit Collection of Personal Information", "paragraphs": ["Regarding collection limitation, the Privacy Act states that each agency  should maintain only such information about individuals in its systems of  records that is \u201crelevant and necessary\u201d to accomplish a purpose the  agency is required to accomplish by statute or executive order of the  President. The act further states that agencies generally cannot disclose  records about an individual without his or her consent, except under a  number of specific conditions.", "Collection limitation may also be addressed indirectly as part of agency  procedures under the E-Government Act for conducting PIAs. Based on  OMB guidance, PIAs are required to include explanations regarding what  information is being collected, why it is being collected, and what the  intended uses are. According to agency privacy officials, they often  question agency program officials about whether planned collections are  really necessary or could be reduced during the process of reviewing draft  PIAs.", "The Paperwork Reduction Act also addresses collection limitation when  information is to be collected individually from 10 or more people. It  requires agency chief information officers to determine whether the  information has practical utility and is necessary for the proper  performance of agency functions. Once a chief information officer has  certified that a planned information collection meets 10 standards set forth  in the act, the collection is submitted to OMB for review. The agency may  not collect the information without OMB\u2019s approval.", "Finally, OMB also has issued guidance instructing agencies to limit the  collection of personally identifiable information. In early 2007, OMB issued  Memorandum M-07-16, which required agencies to review and reduce the  volume of their holdings of personally identifiable information to the  minimum necessary for the proper performance of documented agency  functions. The memorandum noted that \u201cby collecting only the  information necessary and managing it properly, agencies can often  reduce the volume of information they possess, the risk to the information,  and the burden of safeguarding it.\u201d The memorandum also required  agencies to develop a plan to reduce their use of Social Security numbers  and to make public a schedule by which they would periodically update  the review of their overall holdings of personally identifiable information.", "Nothwithstanding these various provisions in law and guidance, the  government\u2019s collection of personal information may not be effectively  limited:    The Privacy Act\u2019s \u201crelevant and necessary\u201d provision gives broad  latitude to agencies in determining the amount of information to collect.

OMB\u2019s  implementation guidance advises agencies to identify the specific  provisions in law that authorize a collection before it is implemented and  provides questions that agencies should consider in determining what  information to collect but concludes that a final decision on what is  relevant and necessary is a matter of judgment. For certain functions, such  as homeland security, new and varied collections of personal information  may be relevant and necessary. However, several experts at our forum  expressed concern about what they view as an increasing trend in the  post-9/11 era for federal agencies to collect as much information as  possible in the event that such information might be needed at a future  date. Without establishing more specific requirements for justifying  information collections, it may be difficult to ensure that agencies collect  only relevant and necessary personal information.", "The Paperwork Reduction Act information collection review process has  not always been effective at limiting collection. In addition to provisions  in the Privacy Act, the PRA has the potential to serve as a useful control  for ensuring that agencies make reasoned judgments about what personal  information to collect. However, it has not always achieved this objective.  As we reported in 2005, the PRA\u2019s constraints on information collection  are not always completely followed. For our previous report, we  examined a sample of 12 approved information collections to assess the  effectiveness of the PRA review process. We found that while chief  information officers reviewed information collections regularly, support  for a particular collection was often partial. For example, of the 12  approved data collections we reviewed, 6 provided only partial support for  determining whether the collection was necessary for the proper  performance of agency functions and 8 had only partial support for  determining whether a collection provided the information it was intended  to provide. Despite these shortcomings, all 12 data collections were  certified by agency chief information officers, and all 12 were also  approved by OMB. The fact that agencies are able to have information  collections approved despite incomplete justification contributes to  concern that the PRA information collection review process may not be  effective at limiting collection of personally identifiable information by the  government. We recommended that OMB take steps to improve the review  process, and OMB responded that it was considering changing its  instructions to align them more closely with 10 standards specified in the  act. However, OMB has not yet addressed our recommendation.", "OMB guidance does not provide specific measures for limiting information  collections. Although agency privacy officials believe the PIA process  gives them the opportunity to address collection limitation, the  requirements of the E-Government Act do not specifically address  collection limitation, and OMB PIA guidance accordingly does not include  requirements for limiting information collection, and the process does not  include criteria for making determinations as to whether specific planned  data elements are necessary. The lack of specific control mechanisms  contributes to concerns by privacy experts that collection of personally  identifiable information is not being effectively limited. Similarly, OMB\u2019s  recent guidance to limit collection of personally identifiable information  did not include plans to monitor agency actions or take other proactive  steps to ensure that agencies are effectively limiting their collections of  personally identifiable information. OMB has not reported publicly on  agencies\u2019 progress in responding to its guidance, and thus it remains  unclear what steps agencies have taken. Finally, like previous guidance, M- 07-16 did not provide any criteria for making determinations about  whether specific data elements are needed.

Sharing is also allowed if it is for a  purpose that is \u201ccompatible\u201d with the purpose for which the information  was collected, referred to as a \u201croutine use.\u201d Agencies are required to  enumerate these routine uses in their system-of-records notices and  publish the notice in the Federal Register for public comment.

A number of concerns have been raised about the impact  on privacy of potentially unnecessary routine uses for agency systems of  records, particularly through the application of \u201cstandard\u201d routine uses  that are developed for general use on multiple systems of records. This  practice is not prohibited by the Privacy Act. All six agencies we reviewed  had lists of standard routine uses for application to their systems of  records. However, the language of these standard routine uses varies from  agency to agency. For example, as shown in table 4, several agencies have  a routine use allowing them to share information about individuals with  other governmental entities for purposes of decision-making about hiring  or retention of an individual, issuance of a security clearance, license,  contract, grant, or other benefit.", "As shown in the table, one agency (HHS) includes a provision that sharing  of this information will occur only after the requesting agency has  submitted a request supported by written consent of the affected  individual. In contrast, similar routine uses at other agencies (DHS, DOJ,  IRS, and DOT) have no requirement for the written consent of the  individual. Still another agency (SSA) has no comparable standard routine  use at all. Experts expressed concern that \u201cstandard\u201d routine uses such as  these vary so much from agency to agency, with no specific legal  requirement that they be formulated consistently.", "Further, agencies do not apply these uses consistently. DHS, for example,  has a \u201clibrary\u201d of routine uses that are applied selectively to systems of  records on a case-by-case basis. In contrast, DOT applies its list of general  routine uses to all of its systems of records, unless explicitly disavowed in  the system\u2019s public notice. Similarly, the FBI applies its \u201cblanket\u201d routine  uses to \u201cevery existing FBI Privacy Act system of records and to all FBI  systems of records created or modified in the future.\u201d As a result, use may  not always be limited as the Privacy Act intended.", "The Privacy Act sets only modest limits on the use of personal  information for multiple purposes within an agency. Recognizing the  need for agency personnel to access records to carry out their duties, the  Privacy Act permits disclosures from agency systems of records \u201cto those  officers and employees of the agency which maintains the record who  have a need for the record in the performance of their duties.\u201d However,  without additional limits, internal uses could go beyond uses that are  related to the purpose of the original collection. In our interviews with  senior agency privacy officials, we asked what, if any, limits were placed  on internal agency uses of information. Several agencies responded that,  consistent with the Privacy Act and OMB guidance, internal agency usage  of personal information was limited to those personnel with a \u201cneed to  know.\u201d Because the Privacy Act and related guidance do not require it,  none of these agencies took steps to determine whether internal uses were  consistent with the purposes originally stated for the collection of  information. Reliance on the \u201cneed to know\u201d criteria for sharing  information does not require a determination regarding compatibility with  the original collection.", "The potential that personal information could be used for multiple,  unspecified purposes is especially heightened in large agencies with  multiple components that may collect personal information in many  different ways for disparate purposes. For example, the establishment of  DHS in March 2003 brought 22 agencies with varied missions and 180,000  employees into a single agency. These agencies collect personal  information for a range of purposes, including administering citizenship,  enforcing immigration laws, protecting land and sea ports of entry, and  protecting against threats to aviation security. The Privacy Act does not  constrain DHS or other agencies from using information obtained for one  of these specific missions for another agency mission. As a result,  individuals do not have assurance that their information will be used only  for the purpose for which it was collected.", "The Privacy Act\u2019s provisions may not apply when data are shared for  use by another agency. In addition to concerns about limiting use to a  specified purpose within an agency, more extensive issues have been  raised when data are shared outside an agency, even when such sharing is  pursuant to a predefined \u201croutine\u201d use. Although the Privacy Act provides  assurance that the information in systems of records cannot be disclosed  unless it is pursuant to either a routine use or another statutorily allowed  condition, the act does not attach its protections to data after they have  been disclosed. Despite the lack of requirements, agencies we reviewed  reported taking measures to ensure the data are used appropriately by  recipients. For example, agencies reported using mechanisms such as  computer matching agreements under the matching provisions of the  Privacy Act or other types of data-sharing agreements to impose privacy  protections on recipients of shared data. However, absent these measures  taken by agencies, data shared outside federal agencies would not always  have sufficient protections.", "Data sharing among agencies is central to the emerging information  sharing environment intended to facilitate the sharing of terrorism  information. If the information sharing environment is to be effective, it  will require policies, procedures, and technologies that link people,  systems, and information among all appropriate federal, state, local, and  tribal entities and the private sector. In the recent development of  guidelines for the information-sharing environment, there has been general  agreement that privacy considerations must also be addressed alongside  measures for enhancing the exchange of information among agencies. The  Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 called for the  issuance of guidelines to protect privacy and civil liberties in the  development of the information sharing environment, and the President  reiterated that requirement in an October 2005 directive to federal  departments and agencies. Based on the President\u2019s directive, a committee  within the Office of the Director of National Intelligence was established  to develop such guidelines, and they were approved by the President in  November 2006. However, as we previously testified, the guidelines as  issued provide only a high-level framework for addressing privacy  protection and do not include all of the Fair Information Practices.", "More recently, in September 2007, the Program Manager for the  Information Sharing Environment released a Privacy and Civil Liberties  Implementation Guide for the Information Sharing Environment. The  guide describes the processes for information-sharing environment  participants to follow when integrating privacy and civil liberties  safeguards into their information sharing efforts, including an assessment  of whether current activities comply with the privacy guidelines. However,  as noted by our expert panel, these guidelines do not address the  application of protections to Privacy Act data as they are shared within the  information sharing environment, mentioning the act only in passing. In  the absence of the adoption of more specific implementation guidelines or  more explicit protections in the Privacy Act for data that are disclosed,  agency information-sharing activities may not ensure that the use of  personal information is sufficiently limited."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Alternatives for Better Ensuring That Purpose Is Specified and That Collection and Use of Personal Information Are Limited", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Purpose Specification", "paragraphs": ["Require agencies to state the principal purpose for each system of  records.

An effective notice can  also provide individuals with information they need to determine whether  to provide their personal information (if voluntary), or who to contact to  correct any errors that could result in an adverse determination about  them.", "In formal terms, the openness principle states that the public should be  informed about privacy policies and practices and that individuals should  have a ready means of learning about the use of personal information. The  openness principle underlies the public notice provisions of the Privacy  Act. Specifically, the Privacy Act requires agencies to publish in the  Federal Register, \u201cupon establishment or revision, a notice of the  existence and character of a system of records.\u201d This notice is to include,  among other things, the categories of records in the system as well as the  categories of sources of records. The notice is also required to explain  agency procedures whereby an individual can gain access to any record  pertaining to him or her contained in the system of records and contest its  content. Agencies are further required to publish notice of any new use or  intended use of the information in the system and provide an opportunity  for interested persons to submit written data, views, or arguments to the  agency.", "In addition, when collection of personal information is received directly  from the affected individual, agencies are required to notify the individual  of the primary purposes for the collection and the planned routine uses of  the information. The act encourages agencies, to the extent practicable, to  collect information directly from the subject individual when the  information may result in adverse determinations about the individual\u2019s  rights, benefits, and privileges under federal programs.", "It is critical that Privacy Act notices effectively communicate to the public  the nature of agency collection and use of personal information because  such notices are the fundamental mechanisms by which agencies are held  accountable for specifying purpose, limiting collection and use, and  providing a means to access and correct records. These notices can be  seen as agreements between agencies and the public to provide  protections for the data in the custody of the government.", "System-of-records notices are especially important in cases where  information is not obtained directly from individuals because there is no  opportunity for them to be informed directly. As experts noted, collection  from individuals may be less prevalent in an environment where agencies  are encouraged to participate in cross agency e-government initiatives that  promote a \u201ccollect once, use many\u201d approach. Experts also noted that  since the terrorist attacks on 9/11, agencies are charged with sharing  information more readily, one of the major goals of the information  sharing environment. In situations such as these, the system-of-records  notice may be one of the only ways for individuals to learn about the  collection of their personal information.", "However, experts at our forum as well as agency privacy officials  questioned the value of system-of-records notices as vehicles for providing  information to the general public. Specifically, concerns were raised that  the content of these notices and their publication in the Federal Register  may not fully inform the public about planned government uses of  personal information, for the following reasons:    System of record notices may be difficult to understand. As with other  legally-required privacy notices, such as the annual privacy notices  provided to consumers by banks and other financial institutions, system- of-records notices have been criticized as hard to read and understand.  For example, lay readers may have difficulty understanding the extent to  which lists of \u201croutine\u201d uses actually explain how the government intends  to collect and use personal information. Likewise, for an uninformed  reader, a list of exemptions claimed for the system\u2014cited only by the  corresponding paragraph number in the Privacy Act\u2014could raise more  questions than it answers. Agency senior privacy officials we interviewed  frequently cited legal compliance as the primary function of a system-of- records notice, thus leading to legalistic descriptions of the controls on  collection and use of personal information. These officials acknowledged  that these descriptions of privacy protections may not be very useful to the  general public. Privacy experts at our forum likewise viewed system-of- records notices as having limited value as a vehicle for public notification.", "System-of-records notices do not always contain complete and useful  information about privacy protections. As discussed earlier in this report,  system-of-records notices can be written to describe purposes and uses of  information in such broad terms that it becomes questionable whether  those purposes and uses have been significantly limited. Likewise, broad  purpose statements contained in system-of-records notices may not  contain enough information to usefully inform the public of the  government\u2019s intended purposes, and the citation of multiple routine uses  does little to aid individuals in learning about how the government is using  their personal information. The Privacy Act does not require agencies to  be specific in describing the purposes associated with routine uses.  Further, individuals are limited in their ability to know how extensively  their information may be used within an agency, since there are no  requirements to publish all expected internal agency uses of personal  information.", "Several agency privacy officials as well as experts at our forum noted that  privacy impact assessments, when properly prepared, can lead to more  meaningful discussions about privacy protections and may serve as a  better vehicle to convey purposes and uses of information to the public.  OMB guidance requires agency PIAs to identify what choices were made  regarding an IT system or information collection as a result of performing  a PIA, while a system-of-records notice contains no comparable  requirement. As a result, a well-crafted PIA may provide more meaningful  notice to the public not only about the planned purposes and uses of  personal information, but also about how an agency\u2019s assessment was  used to drive decisions about the system.", "Publication in the Federal Register May Reach Only a Limited Audience.", "Agency privacy officials questioned whether the required publication of  system-of-records notices in the Federal Register would be useful to a  broader audience than federal agency officials and public interest groups,  such as privacy advocacy groups. Notices published in the Federal  Register may not be very accessible and readable. The Federal Register  Web site does not provide a ready means of determining what system-of- records notices are current, when they were last updated, or which ones  apply to any specific governmental function. Officials agreed that it can be  difficult to locate a system-of-records notice on the Federal Register Web  site, even when the name of the relevant system of records is known in  advance. Privacy experts at our forum likewise agreed that the Federal  Register is probably not effective with the general public and that a more  effective technique for reaching a wide audience in today\u2019s environment is  via consolidated publication on a governmentwide Web site devoted to  privacy. Both agency officials and privacy experts also agreed, however,  that the Federal Register serves a separate but important role as the  official public record of federal agencies, and thus it would not be  advisable to cease publishing system-of-records notices in the Federal  Register. Notice in the Federal Register also serves an important role as  the official basis for soliciting comments from the public on proposed  systems of records."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Alternatives for Improving Notice to the Public", "paragraphs": ["Based on discussions with privacy experts, agency officials, and analysis  of laws and related guidance, a number of options exist for addressing the  issues associated with improving public notice regarding federal collection  and use of personal information. As with the alternatives previously  discussed, these could be addressed explicitly in law or a legal  requirement could be set for another agency, such as OMB, to develop  specific implementation guidelines for agencies. These alternatives are as  follows:    Require layered public notices in conjunction with system-of-records  notices. Given the difficulty that a lay audience may face in trying to  understand the content of notices, experts at our forum agreed that a new  approach ought to be taken to designing notices for the public about use  of personal information. Specifically, the use of layered notices, an  approach that is actively being pursued in the private sector for consumer  privacy notices, could also be effective for Privacy Act notices. Layering  involves providing only the most important summary facts up front\u2014often  in a graphically oriented format\u2014followed by one or more lengthier, more  narrative versions. By offering both types of notices, the benefits of each  can be realized: long notices have the advantage of being complete, but  may not be as easy to understand, while brief notices may be easier to  understand but may not capture all the detail that needs to be conveyed.  A recent interagency research project on the design of easy-to-understand  consumer financial privacy notices found, among other things, that  providing context to the notice (explaining to consumers why they are  receiving the notice and what to do with it) was key to comprehension,  and that comprehension was aided by incorporating key visual design  elements, such as use of a tabular format, large and legible fonts, and  appropriate use of white space and simple headings.", "The multilayered approach discussed and lessons learned could be applied  to government privacy notices. For example, a multilayered government  privacy notice could provide a brief description of the information  required, the primary purpose for the collection, and associated uses and  sharing of such data at one layer. The notice could also provide additional  details about the system or program\u2019s uses and the circumstances under  which data could be shared at a second layer. This would accomplish the  purpose of communicating the key details in a brief format, while still  providing complete information to those who require it. Aiming to improve  comprehension of notices by citizens through clearer descriptions could  better achieve the Privacy Act\u2019s objective of publishing a public notice of  the \u201cexistence and character\u201d of systems of records.", "Set requirements to ensure that purpose, collection limitations, and use  limitations are better addressed in the content of privacy notices.  Additional requirements could be established for the content and  preparation of system-of-records notices, to include a specific description  of the planned purpose of a system as well as what data needs to be  collected to serve that purpose and how its use will be limited to that  purpose, including descriptions of primary and secondary uses of  information. Agencies may be able to use material developed for PIAs to  help meet these requirements. Setting these requirements could spur  agencies to prepare notices that include more meaningful descriptions of  the intents and purposes of their systems of records.", "Make all notices available on a governmentwide privacy Web site.  Experts at our forum and agency officials also agreed that the most  effective and practical method for sharing information with the public is  through the Web. Relevant privacy notices could be published at a central  governmentwide location, such as www.privacy.gov, and at corresponding  standard locations on agency Web sites, such as www.agency.gov/privacy.

Statements in the 2005 report regarding the draft OMB Paperwork  Reduction Act guidance were accurate for that review and supported  by the evidence gathered. For that report, among other things, we  selected detailed case reviews of 12 OMB-approved collections and  compared the agencies\u2019 processes and practices in these case studies  with the (1) act\u2019s requirements, (2) OMB\u2019s regulation and draft  guidance to agencies, and (3) agencies\u2019 written directives and orders.  Nevertheless, in its written response to the 2005 report, OMB officials  stated that OMB's draft PRA guidance to agencies had become  outmoded. Further, in its response, OMB stated that the report had  convinced them that its draft PRA guidance did not serve its intended  purpose and that it would explore alternative approaches to advising  agencies on their PRA responsibilities. Accordingly, because the draft  guidance has not been in effect since the 2005 report was issued, we  have removed statements from our current draft regarding this  guidance.  2.  As we stated in our response to OMB\u2019s comments on our 2003 report,  we consider this report to be a comprehensive and accurate source of  information on agencies\u2019 implementation of the Privacy Act. Our  conclusions were based on the results of a comprehensive analysis of  agency compliance with a broad range of requirements.  3.  We agree that the responsibility for limiting the collection of  personally identifiable information to what is authorized and necessary  will require ongoing attention by agencies and oversight by OMB. We  also believe that Congress should consider alternatives, as identified in  our report, to improve controls on the collection and use of personally  identifiable information."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix VI: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact person named above, John de Ferrari (Assistant  Director), Shaun Byrnes, Susan Czachor, Barbara Collier, Tim Eagle, Matt  Grote, Rebecca LaPaze, David Plocher, Jamie Pressman, and Andrew  Stavisky made key contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Related GAO Products", "paragraphs": ["Aviation Security: Efforts to Strengthen International Passenger  Prescreening Are Under Way, but Planning and Implementation Issues  Remain.
