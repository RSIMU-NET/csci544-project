We chose to test for students of  this age because we did not expect large numbers of older students to be  receiving Pell Grants.  We identified 707 schools that had disbursed more  than 4,500 Pell Grants totaling about $7 million to students 70 years of age  and older during the period covered by our review.", "Based on the initial results of our test and because of the problems we had  identified in the past, we decided to expand our review of 7 of the 707  schools that had disproportionately high numbers of older students to  include recipients 50 years of age or older.  Our Office of Special  Investigations investigated 4 of these 7 schools and found that they  disbursed approximately $3.4 million in Pell Grants to ineligible students  during this period.  These students were ineligible because their primary  course of study was English as a second language (ESL), and they were not  seeking degrees or certificates.  Further, most of the students interviewed  during the investigation said that they were not working and were studying  English in order to improve their speaking abilities, not to obtain a degree  or certificate.  The investigation disclosed that 3 schools generated  fraudulent student admissions documents to create the appearance that  students who were not in fact seeking degrees were participating in degree  programs.  We investigated 2 of these 4 schools in 1993 and found similar  activities, including the falsification of student records.", "The remaining 3 schools disbursed approximately $450,000 in Pell Grants  and warranted additional review because they also had unusually high  concentrations of older students who were potentially ineligible.

Based on our review of the documentation we received,  we identified 19 additional schools that disbursed Pell Grants to large  numbers of students who were 70 years of age or older and whose course  of study was mainly ESL.  These 19 schools made disbursements totaling  about $573,000 to these students during the period of our review.  We also  identified 9 other schools, based solely on data from the Pell Grant system,  that had similar disbursement patterns to those making the payments to  ineligible students.  These 9 schools did not provide supporting  documentation for approximately $547,000 in Pell Grant disbursements.   We provided information on these 28 schools to Education for follow-up.", "Education staff and officials told us that they have performed ad hoc  reviews in the past to identify schools that disbursed Pell Grants to  ineligible students and have recovered some improper payments as a  result.  However, Education did not have a formal, systematic process in  place specifically designed to identify schools that may be improperly  disbursing Pell Grants.  In September 2001, we issued an interim report in  which we recommended that the Secretary of Education (1) establish  appropriate edit checks to identify unusual grant and loan disbursement  patterns and (2) design and implement a formal, routine process to  investigate unusual disbursement patterns identified by the edit checks.   This type of process would serve not only to detect fraudulent and  otherwise improper payments, but would also act as a deterrent to others  who may be inclined toward these types of activities.", "In response to our work, Education told us an edit was implemented in  January 2002 in CPS, the application processing system, that will identify  applications that indicate a student is 75 years of age or older.  If the  student\u2019s date of birth indicates that he or she is 75 years of age or older,  the system edit will reject the application and the school will not be  authorized to give the student federal education funds until the student  either submits a corrected date of birth or verifies that it is correct.   However, without also looking for unusual patterns and following up, the  edit may not be very effective, other than to correct data entry errors or  confirm older students applying for aid.", "Education is also in the process of implementing a new system called  Common Origination and Disbursement (COD) that is to be effective  beginning in April 2002.

The focus of  COD is to improve program and data integrity.  According to Education  officials, they will be able to use COD to identify schools with  characteristics like those we identified.

In addition to  Pell Grant payments to students 70 years of age and older, we identified  $28.8 million of other potentially improper grant and loan payments made  by more than 1,800 schools to students who (1) were much older or  younger than would be expected, (2) had social security numbers (SSN)  that were either not in SSA\u2019s database or were in SSA\u2019s death records, or  (3) received Pell Grants in excess of statutory limits.  Based on supporting  documentation provided to us by Education, we determined that  $20.3 million of these payments were proper.  Education did not, however,  provide adequate supporting documentation to enable us to determine the  validity of $8.5 million of these payments made by these schools.  In  addition, Education did not provide adequate supporting documentation  for us to determine the validity of $3.5 million of Pell Grants disbursed to  students 70 years of age and older, for a total of $12 million of grant and  loan payments for which we could not determine the validity.  Table 2  shows the amounts of potentially improper grant and loan payments we  initially identified and the disposition of those amounts after we reviewed  supporting documentation.

We agree that Education  should weigh the costs of resources required to follow up on potential  improper payments with the benefits that could be obtained when making  such decisions.  However, 20 of the schools that did not provide support or  provided inadequate support had from 20 to 138 instances of these  potential improper payments totaling $1.5 million.  Without following up  with the schools that exhibit such patterns, Education is missing an  opportunity to identify problem schools, including those that may be  improperly disbursing Pell Grant funds.  Because of this, we reaffirm our  previous recommendation that Education design and implement a formal,  routine process to investigate unusual disbursement patterns identified by  the edit checks.", "During our investigation of potentially improper transactions, we did find  that direct loans and Pell Grants provided to two students were obtained  fraudulently.  The students, two brothers, submitted counterfeit Social  Security cards and fraudulent birth certificates along with their  applications for federal education aid.

LOS processes all loan  origination data received from schools and contains information on each  loan and borrower.  We reviewed data for more than 1,600 loans and  determined that for almost 500 of these loans, the borrowers\u2019 SSNs or dates  of birth were incorrect in LOS.  It is likely that many of these errors  occurred during the loan origination process.", "As described earlier, when students apply for federal Education grants and  loans, the information from their applications goes into the application  processing system, CPS, which matches the student data against several  databases at other agencies, including SSA.  If the SSA match results  indicate that the student\u2019s SSN or date of birth is incorrect, the student is  notified and asked to provide corrected data, which is input in CPS.   However, these corrections are not made to data in LOS.  Because  Education\u2019s loan collection system relies on data from LOS, Education\u2019s  ability to locate borrowers who have defaulted on their loans is negatively  affected.  The new COD system discussed earlier may alleviate this  situation because it will replace separate systems, including LOS, and will  interface with CPS.

In testing the third party draft process,  we found that (1) Education employees circumvented a key computer  system application control and (2) some individuals could control the  entire payment process because accounting duties were not properly  segregated.  Because of these weaknesses, we tested third party draft  transactions and identified potential improper payments, many of which  remain unresolved because Education was unable to provide us with  adequate supporting documentation.  Education has since canceled its  third party draft program.", "The circumvented computer system application control, which was  designed to avoid duplicate payments, was an edit in Education\u2019s system  indicating that an invoice number had already been entered into the  system.  Internal control standards require agencies to have adequate  application controls such as automated edits that help ensure that  transactions completed through computerized applications are valid,  properly authorized, and completely and accurately processed and  reported.  Our review of one of Education\u2019s procedures manuals disclosed  that the department had created a procedure that allowed employees to  circumvent this control.  The manual instructed Education employees to  add a suffix to the invoice or voucher number when the system indicated  that a number had already been used.  For example, if invoice number 123  had already been entered into the system, an employee could add the letter  \u201ca\u201d to this invoice number and issue another third party draft or other  payment mechanism related to the invoice.  Education officials told us this  procedure was implemented as a way to allow users to issue replacement  drafts in the event the draft had to be reissued.  However, it also  significantly increased Education\u2019s exposure to duplicate payments.", "We also found that it was common practice for Education employees to use  multiple third party drafts to pay for purchases in excess of the $10,000  limit imprinted on the blank drafts.  Education officials told us that they  used multiple third party drafts to pay invoices greater than $10,000  primarily as a matter of convenience.  For example, when it was necessary  to research a transaction, Education officials told us that it was more  convenient to have their own check numbers and copies of the checks on  hand rather than having to review records of payments from Treasury.  This  process of using multiple third party drafts negated the control of limiting  third party drafts to $10,000 and further exacerbated Education\u2019s  vulnerability to making improper payments.", "Another weakness in the third party draft process was inadequate  segregation of duties; that is, some individuals could control the entire  payment process.  Segregation of duties is one of the most fundamental  internal control concepts.  To reduce the risk of fraud and other improper  payments, key duties and responsibilities associated with the payment  process need to be divided or segregated among different people.  This  should include separating the responsibilities for authorizing transactions,  processing and recording them, reviewing the transactions, and handling  the related funds.  We found that some individuals at Education could  control the entire payment process for third party drafts.  Forty-nine  Education employees could request blank checks.  Further, 21 of these 49  individuals could also access the system, generate a payment without prior  obligation, print and sign the check, and submit it to the payee.  Education  officials told us this control was lacking because, as the department moved  toward decentralization and flexibility, the responsibility for monitoring  and enforcing the use of the third party drafts became inconsistent from  one organization to another.  Because these individuals had the capacity to  control the entire payment process, the department was vulnerable to the  possibility that third party drafts could be used to pay for personal  expenses or other improper purchases.", "One of the primary risks Education was exposed to because of these  internal control weaknesses was the risk of overpaying invoices.  Based on  our tests of third party draft transactions, we identified 268 instances,  totaling approximately $8.9 million, in which multiple third party drafts  were issued to the same payee with the same invoice number or on the  same day.  We reviewed the available supporting documents provided by  Education for $7.2 million of these transactions and found no instances of  overpayments.  However, Education officials could not provide us with  adequate supporting documentation to enable us to assess the validity of  the remaining $1.7 million of these third party drafts.

This lack of detailed and timely  policies and procedures, as well as the lack of training for all cardholders  and approving officials, resulted in a lax control environment for this  inherently risky program.", "Internal control standards state that transactions should be authorized and  executed only by persons acting within the scope of their authority to  ensure that only valid transactions are entered into.  For purchase cards,  specific procedures should include (1) authorizing purchases,  (2) monitoring monthly reports of card usage, (3) blocking certain  Merchant Category Codes (MCC) for vendors whose business is unrelated  to Education\u2019s mission, and (4) reviewing and approving monthly purchase  card statements.  We found serious deficiencies in each of these four areas  that made the department vulnerable to improper purchases.", "Only 4 out of 14 offices within Education required cardholders to obtain  authorization prior to making some or all purchases, although Education\u2019s  policy required that all requests to purchase items over $1,000 be made in  writing to the applicable department Executive Officer.  We also found that  approving officials did not use monitoring reports that were available from  Bank of America to identify unusual or unauthorized purchases.  For  instance, if a cardholder used a government purchase card to obtain a cash  advance, which is prohibited by Education\u2019s policies, the MCC for this type  of vendor (a financial institution) would appear on the report next to the  cardholder\u2019s name.  Additionally, Bank of America can block specific MCCs  to prohibit certain types of transactions that are clearly not business  related, such as purchases from snowmobile or boat dealers.  However,  prior to November 2001, Education only blocked four MCCs related to  gambling and obtaining cash advances.  As discussed later in this section,  the department recently took action to block certain other MCCs.   Education officials told us that they had not used this control extensively  because the department relied on the approving official\u2019s review of the  cardholder\u2019s monthly purchase card statements to ensure that all  purchases made by employees were proper.", "In order to test the effectiveness of the approving officials\u2019 review of  purchase card statements, we selected 5 months of cardholder statements  to review for certain attributes, including the approving official\u2019s signature.   We reviewed all 903 monthly statements that were issued during these  months, totaling about $4 million, and found that 338, or 37 percent, which  totaled about $1.8 million, were not approved by the appropriate  authorizing official.  The approval process was also less effective because  some approving officials were not in a good position to know which  purchases were appropriate.  For example, we identified an employee who,  in addition to regular job duties, had responsibility for reviewing the  monthly purchases of 96 cardholders located throughout the country.  In  these situations, the approving official may not have had sufficient contact  with cardholders to understand their duties and the types of purchases they  would routinely make.  Combined, the inconsistent review of purchases  and the ineffective review process created an environment where improper  purchases could be made with little risk of detection."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some Education Employees Made Fraudulent, Improper, and Questionable Purchases", "paragraphs": ["Because of the extensive internal control weaknesses related to the  department\u2019s purchase card program, we requested supporting  documentation for the 338 monthly statements totaling $1.8 million we  reviewed that were not properly approved, as well as for other transactions  that appeared unusual.  However, Education was unable to provide  adequate supporting documentation to enable us to determine the validity  of purchases totaling over $218,000.  In our review of the available  documentation, we identified some fraudulent, improper, and questionable  purchases.", "We considered fraudulent purchases to be those that were unauthorized  and intended for personal use.  Improper purchases included those for  government use that were not, or did not appear to be, for a purpose  permitted by law or regulation.  We also identified as improper purchases  those made on the same day from the same vendor that appeared to  circumvent cardholder single purchase limits.  We defined questionable  transactions as those that, while authorized, were for items purchased at an  excessive cost, for a questionable government need, or both, as well as  transactions for which Education could not provide adequate supporting  documentation to enable us to determine whether the purchases were  valid.", "We found one instance in which a cardholder made several fraudulent  purchases from two Internet sites for pornographic services.   Notwithstanding the relatively small amount of money involved, the name  of at least one of the pornographic sites\u2014Slave Labor Productions.com\u2014 should have caused suspicion when it appeared on the employee\u2019s monthly  credit card statement.  To determine whether these purchases were  approved, we obtained the monthly statements containing these charges.   The statements contained handwritten notes next to the pornography  charges indicating that these were charges for transparencies and other  nondescript items.  According to the approving official, he was not aware  of the cardholder\u2019s day-to-day responsibilities and did not feel that he was  in a position to review the monthly statements properly.  The approving  official stated that the primary focus of his review was to ensure there was  enough money available in that particular appropriation to pay the bill.  As  a result of investigations related to these pornography purchases,  Education management issued a termination letter, prompting the  employee to resign.", "We also identified purchases totaling $4,427 from a restaurant in San Juan,  Puerto Rico, that we determined to be improper.  These restaurant  charges were incurred during a Year 2000 (Y2K) focus group meeting, and  included breakfasts and lunches for federal employees and nonfederal  guests.  The Statement of Work for the focus group notes that the travel  expenses fell \u201cunder the invitational travel statute (5 U.S.C. 5703).\u201d   Appropriated funds may not be used to pay the costs of nonfederal  individuals to attend meetings unless otherwise specifically authorized by  law.  Such authority exists in 5 U.S.C. 5703, which allows an agency to use  invitational travel to pay the costs of nonfederal individuals to attend  meetings if the attendees are providing direct services to the government.   Education, however, could not provide us with any evidence that the  nonfederal attendees provided direct services to the government.  In fact,  the Statement of Work for the focus group states that the purpose of the  meeting was for attendees to \u201cshare their experiences with the Y2K issue  and to assure that the education community\u2019s computers are compliant.\u201d   Thus, rather than providing a direct service to the federal government, it  appears that the attendees were receiving a benefit from the meeting.   According to an Education official, there were eight additional Y2K focus  group meetings, similar to the San Juan meeting, held in various cities  throughout the United States.  This official estimated that the agency paid  approximately $45,000 in expenses for nonfederal individuals to attend the  nine meetings.  We have referred this matter to Education\u2019s OIG.", "We also found 28 improper purchases totaling $123,985 where Education  employees made multiple purchases from a vendor on the same day.  These  purchases appear to violate the Federal Acquisition Regulation that  prohibits splitting purchases into more than one segment to circumvent  single purchase limits.  For example, one cardholder purchased two  computers from the same vendor at essentially the same time.  Because the  total cost of these computers exceeded the cardholder\u2019s $2,500 single  purchase limit, the total of $4,184.90 was split into two purchases of  $2,092.45 each.  In some instances, Education officials sent memos to the  offending cardholders reminding them of the prohibition against split  purchases.", "We identified five additional instances, totaling about $17,000, in which  multiple purchases were made from a single vendor on the same day.   Although we were unable to determine whether these purchases were  improper, based on the available supporting documentation, these  transactions share similar characteristics with the 28 split purchases.  For  example, one cardholder purchased two printers, costing $1,711 each, from  the same vendor on the same day.  The combined cost of these purchases,  $3,422, exceeded the cardholder\u2019s $2,500 single purchase limit.  Education  provided us with no explanation for why these two items were purchased  separately.", "We identified questionable purchases totaling $286,894 where Education  employees paid for new office furniture and construction costs to renovate  office space that they were planning to vacate.  Only a small amount of  furniture, including chairs for employees with special needs, were moved  to the new building when department employees relocated.", "Other purchases we questioned included numerous charges, totaling  $35,760 over several years, made by an Education employee for herself and  a coworker to attend college.  Some of the classes the employees took were  apparently prerequisites to obtain a liberal arts degree, but were unrelated  to Education's mission.  The classes included biology, music, and theology,  and represent $11,700 of the $35,760.  Because the Government Employees  Training Act, 5 U.S.C. 4103 and 4107, requires that training be related to an  employee\u2019s job and prohibits expenditures to obtain a college degree unless  necessitated by retention or recruitment needs, which was not the case  here, we consider these purchases improper.  Moreover, most of the  monthly charge statements were not reviewed by anyone but the employee  who made the charges and received more than half of the financial benefit.   After we questioned the charges for these tuition expenses, Education  determined that the classes costing $11,700 were improperly charged.  As  of December 2001, one of the employees had received a bachelor's degree  and left the department; no funds had been recovered from either  employee.", "In addition, we identified as questionable purchases totaling more than  $218,000 for which Education provided us with no support or inadequate  support to assess the validity of these purchases.  These inadequately  supported or unsupported purchases included charges to various hotels for  more than $3,000, purchases of computer equipment and software totaling  more than $22,000, and charges for various college and other training  courses totaling about $51,000.  Numerous other purchases were made  from home electronics and appliance stores as well as toy, book, and  furniture stores.  Education could not provide any support for more than  $152,000 of these purchases, nor does the department know specifically  what was purchased, why it was purchased, or whether these purchases  were appropriate.  For the remaining $66,000, Education was able to  provide only limited supporting documentation.  As a result, we were  unable to assess the validity of these payments, and we consider these  purchases to be potentially improper."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recent Changes to Purchase Card Program Have Helped Improve the Overall Control Environment, but Vulnerabilities Remain", "paragraphs": ["Our interim report, issued in September 2001, described the poor internal  controls over Education\u2019s cash disbursement processes, including  purchase cards.  In that report, we recommended that the department  reiterate to all employees established policies regarding the appropriate  use of government purchase cards;  strengthen the process of reviewing and approving purchase card  transactions, focusing on identifying split purchases and other  inappropriate transactions; and  expand the use of MCCs to block transactions with certain vendors.", "Recently, Education has made some changes in the way it administers its  purchase card program in an effort to address these three  recommendations.  For example, in December 2001, the department issued  new policies and procedures that, among other things, (1) establish  detailed responsibilities for the cardholder and the approving official,  (2) prohibit personal use of the card and split purchases to circumvent the  cardholder\u2019s single purchase limits, (3) require approving officials to  review the appropriateness of each individual purchase, (4) establish  mandatory training prior to receiving the card and refresher training every  2 years, and (5) establish a quarterly quality review of a sample of purchase  card transactions to ensure compliance with key aspects of the  department\u2019s policy.  If appropriately implemented, these new policies and  procedures are a good step toward reducing Education\u2019s vulnerability to  future improper purchases.", "Further, in July 2001, the department implemented a new process to  approve purchase card purchases.  Instead of the approving official signing  a monthly statement indicating that all transactions are proper, the  approval is now done electronically for each individual transaction.   According to Education officials, most approving officials and cardholders  received training on this new process.  In order to assess the effectiveness  of this new approval process, we reviewed a statistical sample of the  monthly statements of cardholders for July, August, and September 2001.   Purchases during these months totaled $1,881,220.  While we found  evidence in the department\u2019s system that all of the 87 statistically sampled  monthly statements had been reviewed by the cardholder\u2019s approving  official, 20 of the statements had inadequate or no support for items  purchased, totaling $23,151.  Based on our work, we estimate the most  likely amount of unsupported or inadequately supported purchases during  these 3 months is $65,817.  The effectiveness of the department\u2019s new  approval process has been minimized because approving officials are not  ensuring that adequate supporting documentation exists for all purchases.   In addition, these procedures do not address the problem of an authorizing  official who does not have personal knowledge of the cardholder\u2019s daily  activities and therefore is not in a position to know what types of purchases  are appropriate.", "In response to our recommendation regarding the use of MCCs to block  transactions from certain vendors, in November 2001, the department  implemented blocks on purchases from a wide variety of merchants that  provide goods and services totally unrelated to the department\u2019s mission,  including veterinary services, boat and snowmobile dealers, and cruise  lines.  In total, Education blocked more than 300 MCCs.  By blocking these  codes, Education has made use of a key preventive control to help reduce  its exposure to future improper purchases.", "Earlier in 2001, Education took action to improve internal controls related  to the use of government purchase cards by lowering the maximum  monthly spending limit to $30,000, lowering other cardholders\u2019 single  purchase and total monthly purchase limits, and revoking some purchase  cards.  This action was in response to a letter from the Subcommittee on  Select Education dated April 19, 2001, which highlighted our April 2001  testimony, in which we stated that some individual cardholders had  monthly purchase limits as high as $300,000.  These and the other steps  described above have helped reduce Education\u2019s exposure to improper  purchase card activities.  However, more needs to be done to improve the  approval function, which is key to adequate control of these activities."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Poor Controls Contributed to Loss of Computer Equipment", "paragraphs": ["As part of following up on computer purchases made with third party drafts  and purchase cards, we assessed the controls over these portable assets.   We found that Education lacked adequate physical controls over its  computers, which contributed to 241 missing personal computers and  computer-related equipment with an acquisition cost of about $261,500.   After we completed our work in this area, we again visited the office where  most of the computer equipment was missing because Education officials  told us they had located some of the missing inventory.  Although  Education officials stated they had located 73 pieces of equipment, we  were able to locate only 62 pieces of the equipment with an acquisition  value of about $49,800.  Education officials have been unable to locate the  remaining 179 pieces of missing computer equipment with an acquisition  value of about $211,700.  This matter is currently under investigation by  Education\u2019s OIG.", "From May 1998 through September 2000, the period covered by our audit,  Education made purchases totaling more than $2.9 million from personal  computer and other computer-related equipment vendors using purchase  cards and third party drafts\u2014a violation of Education\u2019s policy, which  prohibited the use of purchase cards for this purpose.  These purchases  included personal computers, scanners, color printers, software, and other  computer accessories.", "According to Education, during this period, the department\u2019s computer  purchases were decentralized so that individual principal offices were able  to purchase the types of equipment from any vendors they chose.  This  provided considerable flexibility and rapid acquisition of equipment, but  had several drawbacks.  For example, unnecessary, duplicate orders were  placed even within the same offices.  Further, equipment that could not be  supported by Education\u2019s networked environment was ordered.  Other  equipment was ordered and then left in closets only to be found sometimes  a year later, when it was no longer needed.  As a result of this decentralized  ordering, virtually no volume discounts could be used because of the small  amounts of equipment being purchased at any given time.  According to the  Education Inspector General, the department had not taken a  comprehensive physical inventory for at least 2 years prior to October  2000, thus compounding the lack of accountability over this equipment.", "Education staff members who were involved with ordering and receiving  this equipment described a process that included significant breakdowns in  basic internal controls.  Internal control standards state that key duties and  responsibilities need to be divided or segregated among different people to  reduce the risk of error or fraud.  In the office where most of the missing  equipment was purchased, two individuals had interchangeable  responsibility for receiving more than $120,000 of computer equipment  purchased by a single cardholder, from one particular vendor.  In addition,  these two individuals also had responsibility for bar coding the equipment,  securing the equipment in a temporary storage area, and delivering the  computers to the users.  Furthermore, one of these two individuals was  responsible for providing information on computer purchases to the person  who entered the data into the department\u2019s asset management system.   According to the cardholder who purchased the equipment, they did not  routinely compare the purchase request with the receiving documents from  the shipping company to ensure that all items purchased were received.  In  addition, our review of records obtained from the computer vendor from  which Education made the largest number of purchase card and third party  draft purchases showed that less than half of the $614,725 worth of  computers had been properly entered in the department\u2019s property records.   Combined, these weaknesses created an environment in which computer  equipment could be easily lost or stolen without detection.", "In order to identify computers that were purchased with purchase cards  and third party drafts that were not included in the department\u2019s asset  management system, we obtained the serial numbers of all pieces of  computer equipment purchased from the largest computer vendor the  department used.  We compared these serial numbers to those in the  department\u2019s asset management system and found that 384 pieces of  equipment, totaling $399,900, appeared to be missing, including desktop  computers, scanners, and printers.  We conducted an unannounced  inventory to determine whether these computers were actually missing or  were inadvertently omitted from the property records.  We located 143  pieces of equipment that were not on the property records, valued at  about $138,400, and determined that 241 pieces, valued at about $261,500,  were missing.  Education\u2019s Inspector General is in the process of  investigating the disappearance of these vulnerable assets.", "After we completed our work in this area, we again visited the office where  most of the computer equipment was missing because Education officials  told us they had located some of the missing inventory.  Officials in this  office told us they hired a contractor to keep track of their computers when  moving to their new space.  According to the officials, as part of its work,  the contractor recorded the serial numbers of all computers moved and  identified 86 of the 241 pieces of computer equipment that we were unable  to locate during our unannounced inventory in September 2001.  However,  when Education staff and officials tried to locate this equipment, they were  only able to find 73 of the 86 pieces of equipment.  When we visited the  department, we located only 62 pieces of equipment with an acquisition  value of about $49,800.  Education officials have been unable to locate the  remaining 179 pieces of missing computer equipment with an acquisition  value of about $211,700. They surmised that some of these items may have  been surplused; however, there is no paperwork to determine whether this  assertion is valid.", "According to Education officials, new policies have been implemented that  do not allow individual offices to purchase computer equipment without  the consent of the OCIO.  However, during our previously mentioned  review of a statistical sample of purchase card transactions made from July  2001 through September 2001, we found three transactions totaling $2,231  for the purchase of computer equipment without any supporting  documentation from the OCIO.  Based on these results, the new policies  are not being effectively implemented.  This is another indication that the  new purchase card approval function is not operating as an effective  deterrent to improper purchases.", "Further, we found mixed results in a walk-through of the new computer  ordering and receiving processes in the office where most of the missing  equipment was purchased.  These new policies are designed to maintain  control over the procurement of computers and related equipment and  include  purchasing computers from preferred vendors that apply the  department\u2019s inventory bar code label and record the serial number of  each computer on a computer disk that is sent directly to the Education  official in charge of the property records;  loading the computer disk containing the bar code, serial number, and  description of the computer into the property records; and  having an employee verify that the computers received from the vendor  match the serial numbers and bar codes on the shipping documents and  the approved purchase order.", "However, a continued lack of adequate physical control negates the  effectiveness of these new procedures.  For example, the doors to the two  rooms used to store computer equipment waiting to be installed were both  unlocked and unattended.  The receptionist at the mail counter next to the  first storage room we visited told us that he had the door open to regulate  the room temperature.  The Education official responsible for this process  stated that he did not know that mailroom personnel had access to this  room.  Furthermore, he stated that he does not have a key to either storage  room.  Also, during our second search for this equipment, we visited four  rooms where some of the computers were stored and found them all to be  unsecured.  This lack of physical security was pointed out to the  department nearly 7 weeks earlier when we first found some of its  temporary computer storage rooms unsecured.   The department\u2019s new  written procedures state that security guards in the Washington, D.C.,  facilities should inspect all bags, cases, and boxes leaving the buildings to  determine if they contain computer equipment, and require property passes  for all equipment removed from the building.  However, Education officials  acknowledged that the primary focus of the building security is people and  packages entering the building.  Education officials told us that individuals  could likely leave the building with equipment without being questioned by  security.  Without enhanced physical security, Education will continue to  be at risk to further computer equipment losses."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The problems we found in grant and loan payments, purchase card use, and  physical controls over computer equipment leave Education vulnerable to  fraudulent or otherwise improper payments, questionable purchases, and  loss or theft of assets.

He pointed out that the  $3.4 million in Pell Grants we identified that was disbursed by four schools  to ineligible students was less than five thousandths of a percent of the  total disbursements we reviewed.  We agree that the fraudulent and  improper grant and loan payments we identified are a very small  percentage of the total grants and loans disbursed every year.  However, as  we stated in our report, these improper payments represent an identified  control risk that could easily be exploited to a greater extent.  Although the  Deputy Secretary stated that Education\u2019s controls were strong, he  presented steps that the department is taking to strengthen the integrity of  these payment processes.  For example, he stated that, as an interim  process, the department analyzed student data to identify high  concentrations of students over 65 and eligible noncitizens at a single  institution to determine if problems exist in the ESL programs that warrant  further review.  Also, he stated that, before we started our review,  Education had already begun a matching process with SSA\u2019s death records.   Further, as a result of our review, the Deputy Secretary stated that  Education will implement an edit to identify all applicants whose dates of  birth indicate they are 75 years of age or older beginning with the upcoming  school year.  He stated that the department is analyzing its data more  systematically to establish baselines and indicators to focus its resources  more effectively, and as we noted, the new COD system will assist  Education in identifying unusual activity.  We are encouraged by these  actions, which, if properly implemented, should help improve internal  controls over these vulnerable payments.", "With regards to our findings related to third party drafts, the Deputy  Secretary stated that the department will refer the third party draft  payments, for which we were unable to determine the validity, to the OIG  for further investigation.", "In the purchase card area, the Deputy Secretary stated that Education  issued an updated directive in January 2002, which strengthens the  department\u2019s policies and practices regarding appropriate use of the  purchase card and has trained cardholders and approving officials on these  policies and procedures.  According to the Deputy Secretary, the directive  provides detailed instructions on cardholder and approving official  responsibilities for reviewing and approving purchase card transactions.   He stated the department will also provide monthly management reports  containing information on purchase card transactions to each principal  office for review and that the OCFO will conduct quarterly internal control  reviews and quality reviews of random sample purchase card transactions.   This is an important action to determine whether cardholders and  approving officials are following the directive and whether this training has  effectively reduced unauthorized and improper purchases.  The Deputy  Secretary also stated that the department has blocked more than 300  MCCs, including those for wire transfer money orders, airline and car  rentals, and banks.  Regarding the improper charges for college tuition that  we identified, the Deputy Secretary stated the department will follow  established debt collection procedures to recover the questioned costs.", "To help it better account for its computer equipment, the Deputy Secretary  stated that Education is developing a single comprehensive system that  covers accountable assets from purchase to disposition.  The Deputy  Secretary also stated that the department hired contractors to perform an  independent physical inventory, and upon completion, was able to locate  93 percent of the items sampled.  The Deputy Secretary pointed out  Education is in the process of documenting detailed property management  procedures and centralizing the property management responsibility with  its Office of Management.  He also stated that, while the department has  taken steps to enhance physical security over allocation, storage, and  transit of equipment, and to ensure that only authorized individuals have  access to storage areas, it will continue to work to improve in this area.  We  are encouraged by the department\u2019s efforts to account for and secure its  computers.  At the same time, based on our most recent search for missing  computers, significant vulnerabilities remain unresolved.  We urge the  department to immediately focus on providing adequate physical security  over these vulnerable assets.", "Overall, the actions the department has taken and plans to take to improve  its controls over grant and loan payments, purchase card transactions, and  computer and related equipment are encouraging and represent a positive  tone at the top of the organization to improve internal control.

Further, at the subcommittee\u2019s request, we assessed the  effectiveness of recent changes to Education\u2019s process for purchase card  purchases, which took effect in July 2001 following our testimony before  the subcommittee.", "To obtain an understanding of the payment processes, identify related  controls, and assess the effectiveness of their design, we interviewed staff  members and officials in Education\u2019s OCFO and program offices;  performed walk-throughs of the payment processes; reviewed Education\u2019s  policies and procedures; reviewed previous reports we prepared, as well as  reports issued by Education\u2019s OIG and independent auditors; and identified  vulnerabilities in the payment processes.  To identify potential improper  payments, we requested and obtained disbursement and related data from  Education and various external sources, including SSA, Rocky Mountain  Bank, and Bank of America.", "Education provided us with computer-generated records on more than 19  million disbursements totaling over $181 billion, made from May 1998  through September 2000 from the following systems:   Grant Administration and Payment System (GAPS),  Pell Grant Recipient Financial Management System (RFMS), Loan Origination System (LOS),  National Student Loan Data System,  Impact Aid system,  Campus-based program system,  Postsecondary Education Participants System, and  Financial Management System Software (FMSS).", "Because of the large volume of data involved (millions of records), and the  fact that we initially received some data in an unusable format, our testing  extended to only selected portions of the data for certain systems.  The  majority of our tests were focused on data received from the GAPS, RFMS,  LOS, and FMSS systems.", "In order to identify unusual grant and loan transactions that may have been  improper payments, we searched databases, compared files, identified  unusual transactions and patterns, and performed other detailed analyses  to identify  SSNs of grant and loan recipients that were either invalid or in SSA\u2019s   grant and loan recipients who were much older or younger than would   individual SSNs associated with more than one name or date of birth,  grants disbursed to individuals in excess of statutory limits,  loan disbursements with no recorded loan number in the system,  payments for grants and loans to schools that were either closed or  ineligible for federal education funds,  payment transactions that were returned by the Federal Reserve Bank   payment transactions that did not have FRB confirmation schedule   transactions that were posted on weekends,  grantees with invalid grantee ID numbers or multiple ID numbers,  Education employees who may have received grant funds, and  disbursement records that did not contain required information such as  a grant award number.", "To assist in our analysis and identification of improper payments, we  contracted with forensic and information risk management experts.", "For those grant and loan payments that our tests indicated were potentially  improper, we requested from Education documentation supporting their  validity.  After analyzing the documentation we received, we did the  following.", "For those recipients identified as being older or younger than expected,  we looked for proof of age generated by a source other than the school  or the department, such as a birth certificate, driver\u2019s license, or some  other government-issued identification showing the recipient\u2019s name  and date of birth.  For Pell Grants, if the support confirmed that the  recipient was older or younger than would be expected, we looked for  proof of enrollment in an eligible program.", "For those recipients we identified whose SSN was either invalid or in  SSA\u2019s death records, we looked for proof of the recipient\u2019s SSN, such as  a birth certificate, driver\u2019s license, social security card, or other  government-issued ID that showed the recipient\u2019s name and SSN.  If the  support confirmed the accuracy of the recipient\u2019s SSN, we reviewed  transcripts, if available, to show the recipient\u2019s dates of enrollment or  additional support that was not generated by the school indicating the  recipient\u2019s date of death for those students who died while they were  receiving aid.", "For those recipients who received grants in excess of the statutory limit,  we looked for financial aid disbursement information from each  institution the student attended during the award year showing the  amounts disbursed and the dates on which the money was disbursed.   We also looked for documentation showing repayment information, if  applicable, or documentation demonstrating why repayment was not  required for the recipient.", "For direct loan recipients, we reviewed information on loan payment  status.", "For the schools that Education\u2019s system showed to be either closed or  ineligible to receive federal student financial aid, we reviewed  documentation such as audit reports and disbursement information for  these schools.", "Separately, for the four schools we investigated that we identified as  disbursing Pell Grants to disproportionately high numbers of older  students, we (1) interviewed Pell Grant recipients, school officials, and  Education officials and (2) reviewed documents from the recipients, the  schools, and Education.", "For third party drafts, we requested and obtained data from the third party  draft systems administrator consisting of drafts that had been reconciled  with downloaded information from Gelco and matched with data in  FMSS.  We used these data to test for third party drafts that had been used  to pay for split purchases greater than $10,000.  We also reviewed data  provided by the third party draft systems administrator to identify unusual  payees.  Upon identifying payees that we thought would not normally be  engaged in business with Education, we requested supporting  documentation, such as purchase orders, invoices, and receipts, to  determine the propriety of the purchases.", "For government purchase cards, we requested data on transactions from  November 1998 through September 2000.  Based on these data, we  performed tests to identify the following types of potential improper  purchase card transactions:  unauthorized statements, such as purchases that were not properly  reviewed by an approving official;  split purchases for which Education employees either split transactions  or made multiple transactions to the same vendor on the same day to  circumvent their single purchase limit;  purchases from questionable vendors; and  purchases by Education employees on weekends or holidays.", "To assess Education\u2019s controls over computer equipment, we obtained  (1) invoices from the computer vendor with the largest volume of purchase  card purchases and (2) information from Education\u2019s asset management  system.  Using information on the invoices, including the serial numbers of  the computer equipment purchased, we identified computer equipment  that was purchased but not included in the asset management system.  We  then conducted an unannounced physical inventory of the computer  equipment purchases that were not found in Education\u2019s asset management  system.", "To assess the effectiveness of recent changes to Education\u2019s process for  purchase card purchases, we requested monthly statements and invoices  for purchases made during July, August, and September 2001.  We reviewed  a statistical sample of the monthly statements to determine whether  approvals were done in accordance with the new policy.  In addition, to  identify any computer equipment that may have been purchased without  the involvement of the OCIO and to determine whether purchases were  sufficiently supported, we reviewed supporting documentation for each  transaction in the statistical sample of monthly statements.", "While we identified some fraudulent and improper payments, our work was  not designed to identify all fraudulent or otherwise improper payments.   We performed our work from August 2000 through February 2002 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards, as  well as with investigative standards established by the President\u2019s Council  on Intergrity and Efficiency.  We requested comments on a draft of this  report from the Secretary of Education or his designee.
