Information collection is one way that agencies carry out their  missions.  For example, IRS needs to collect information from taxpayers  and their employers to know the correct amount of taxes owed.  The  Bureau of the Census collects information that was used to reapportion  congressional representation and is being used for a myriad of other  purposes.  The events of September 11, 2001, have demonstrated the  importance of accurate, timely information.  On several occasions, we have  recommended that agencies collect certain data to improve operations and  evaluate their effectiveness.", "However, under the PRA, federal agencies are required to minimize the  paperwork burden they impose.  The original PRA of 1980 established the  Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) within OMB to provide  central agency leadership and oversight of governmentwide efforts to  reduce unnecessary paperwork and improve the management of  information resources.  Currently, the act requires OIRA to develop and  maintain a governmentwide strategic information resources management  (IRM) plan.  In February 2002, we reported that OMB had not fully  developed and implemented a strategic IRM plan that articulated a  comprehensive federal vision and plan for all aspects of government  information, including reducing information burdens, and we  recommended that the agency develop such a plan.  During the past year  OMB has taken a number of actions that demonstrate progress in fulfilling  the PRA\u2019s requirement of providing a unifying IRM vision with a focus on  burden reduction.  For example, OMB\u2019s E-Government Strategy outlines  the federal government\u2019s action plan for electronic government.  One focus  of that strategy is implementing initiatives that will reduce burden on  businesses by reducing redundant data collection and providing one-stop  streamlined support.  In addition, the Federal Enterprise Architecture  Business Reference Model provides an integrated view of the federal  government\u2019s activities, thereby allowing agencies to look at federal  business operations and understand the gaps, overlaps, and opportunities  for consolidation.  Although OMB\u2019s strategies and models are promising,  their ability to reduce paperwork burden and accomplish other objectives  depends on how OMB implements them.", "OIRA also has overall responsibility for determining whether agencies\u2019  proposals for collecting information comply with the PRA.  Agencies must  receive OIRA approval for each information collection request before it is  implemented.  Section 3514(a) of the PRA requires OIRA to keep Congress  \u201cfully and currently informed\u201d of the major activities under the act, and to  submit a report to Congress at least annually on those activities.  The  report must include, among other things, a list of all PRA violations and a  list of any increases in burden.  To satisfy this reporting requirement, OIRA  develops an Information Collection Budget (ICB) by gathering data from  executive branch agencies.  In November 2002, the OMB director sent a  bulletin to the heads of executive departments and agencies requesting  information to be used in preparation for the fiscal year 2003 ICB  (reporting on actions during fiscal year 2002).", "OIRA published its ICB for fiscal year 2002 (showing changes in agencies\u2019  burden-hour estimates during fiscal year 2001) in April 2002.  OIRA officials  told us that they did not expect to publish the ICB for fiscal year 2003 until  today\u2019s hearing.  Therefore, we obtained unpublished data from OIRA to  identify changes in governmentwide and agency-specific \u201cburden-hour\u201d  estimates and PRA violations during fiscal year 2002.  We then compared  the data to agencies\u2019 burden-hour estimates and violations in previous ICBs  to determine changes in the data over time.   \u201cBurden hours\u201d has been the principal unit of measure of paperwork  burden for more than 50 years and has been accepted by agencies and the  public because it is a clear, easy-to-understand concept.  However, it is  important to recognize that these estimates have limitations.  Estimating  the amount of time it will take for an individual to collect and provide  information or how many individuals an information collection will affect  is not a simple matter.  Therefore, the degree to which agency burden-hour  estimates reflect real burden is unclear.  Nevertheless, these are the best  indicators of paperwork burden available, and we believe they can be  useful as long as their limitations are kept in mind."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Governmentwide Paperwork Burden Estimate Has Increased", "paragraphs": ["At the end of fiscal year 1995\u2014just before the PRA of 1995 took effect\u2014 federal agencies estimated that their information collections imposed  about 7 billion burden hours on the public.  The amendment and  recodification of the PRA that year made several changes in federal  paperwork reduction requirements.  One such change required OIRA to set  a goal of at least a 10-percent reduction in the governmentwide burden- hour estimate for each of fiscal years 1996 and 1997, a 5 percent  governmentwide burden reduction goal in each of the next 4 fiscal years,  and annual agency goals that reduce burden to the \u201cmaximum practicable  opportunity.\u201d  Therefore, if federal agencies had been able to meet each of  these goals, the 7-billion burden-hour estimate in 1995 would have  decreased about 35 percent to about 4.6 billion hours by September 30,  2001.", "However, as figure 1 shows, this anticipated reduction in paperwork  burden did not occur.  In fact, the data we obtained from OIRA show that  the governmentwide burden-hour estimate stood at more than 8.2 billion  hours as of September 30, 2002\u2014about a 1.2 billion hour (17 percent)  increase since the PRA of 1995 took effect.  Nearly half of that increase  (about 570 million hours) occurred during fiscal year 2002 alone, and about  70 percent (about 860 million hours) occurred during the last 2 fiscal years.", "It is also important to understand how the most recent estimate of federal  paperwork is allocated by the purpose of the collections.  As figure 2  shows, data that we obtained from the Regulatory Information Service  Center (RISC) indicate that almost 95 percent of the 8.2 billion hours of  estimated paperwork burden in place governmentwide as of September 30,  2002, was being collected primarily for the purpose of regulatory  compliance.  Less than 5 percent was being collected as part of  applications for benefits, and about 1 percent was collected for other  purposes.", "Figure 3 shows that more than 60 percent of the governmentwide burden  estimate was primarily directed toward businesses or other for-profit  organizations.  About one-third of the burden was primarily on individuals  or households, and less than 3 percent was on state, local, or tribal  governments.", "As of September 20, 2002, IRS accounted for about 99 percent of the  Department of the Treasury\u2019s burden-hour estimate\u2014nearly 6.7 billion  burden hours.  In fact, as figure 4 shows, IRS accounted for about 81  percent of the governmentwide burden-hour estimate (up from about 75  percent in September 1995).  Other agencies with burden-hour estimates of  100 million hours or more as of that date were the departments of Health  and Human Services (HHS) and Labor (DOL), DOT, the Environmental  Protection Agency (EPA), and the Securities and Exchange Commission  (SEC). Because IRS constitutes such a significant portion of the  governmentwide burden-hour estimate, changes in IRS\u2019 estimate can have  a significant\u2014and even determinative\u2014effect on the governmentwide  estimate."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Changes in Individual Agencies\u2019 Estimates During Fiscal Year 2002", "paragraphs": ["As table 1 shows, only a few agencies\u2019 paperwork burden estimates  decreased during fiscal year 2002, most notably the Federal  Communications Commission (FCC)\u2014from more than 40 million hours to  less than 27 million hours.  Other agencies, most notably the Department of  the Treasury (including IRS), DOT, HHS, and SEC, significantly increased  their burden hour estimates.   Still other agencies with relatively small  burden-hour totals experienced large percentage increases in their  estimates\u2014most notably the Department of Housing and Urban  Development (HUD) (an 81 percent increase) and the Department of State  (a 76 percent increase).", "However, changes in agencies\u2019 bottom-line burden-hour estimates do not  tell the whole story and can be misleading.  It is also important to  understand how the agencies accomplished these results.  OIRA classifies  modifications in agencies\u2019 burden-hour estimates as either \u201cprogram  changes\u201d or \u201cadjustments.\u201d", "Program changes are the result of deliberate federal government action  (e.g., the addition or deletion of questions on a form) and can occur as a  result of new statutory requirements, agency-initiated actions, or  through the expiration or reinstatement of OIRA-approved collections.", "Adjustments are not the result of deliberate federal government action,  but rather are caused by factors such as changes in the population  responding to a requirement or agency reestimates of the burden  associated with a collection of information.  For example, if the  economy declines and more people complete applications for food  stamps, the resultant increase in the Department of Agriculture\u2019s  (USDA) paperwork estimate is considered an adjustment because it is  not the result of deliberate federal action.", "The agencies\u2019 ICB submissions identified what drove the changes in  agencies\u2019 bottom-line burden-hour estimates during fiscal year 2002.  For  example, more than 80 percent of the 13 million hour decline in the FCC  estimate was due to the adjustment of one information collection.   However, OMB does not require agencies to explain the causes of  significant adjustments in agencies\u2019 burden-hour estimates.  Therefore, it is  not clear whether the FCC adjustment reflected a real reduction in the  burden felt by the public (e.g., a change in the population responding to the  collection), or was simply a reestimation of the burden that already existed.   In any event, it appears that most of the FCC decrease was not the result of  agency burden-reduction initiatives.", "In contrast, HHS indicated that the 37 million burden-hour increase in its  paperwork estimate during fiscal year 2002 was almost entirely driven by a  statutory program change in a single collection related to the enactment of  the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996.  In its ICB  submission, HHS said the purpose of this statutory change was \u201cto  establish standards for electronic transactions and for code sets to be used  in those transactions.\u201d  HUD indicated that the 87 percent increase in its  burden estimate was entirely driven by program changes\u2014specifically the  reinstatement of two information collections that had been in violation of  the PRA (i.e., HUD continued to collect the information without OMB  approval).  Therefore, although the department\u2019s burden estimate  increased, the actual burden imposed on the public by the collection did  not change.", "In some cases, we found the agencies\u2019 explanations in their ICB  submissions for the changes in their burden estimates somewhat  misleading and/or inconsistent.  For example, DOT indicated in its  summary table that virtually all of the department\u2019s 165 million burden- hour increase in its estimate was driven by program changes\u2014specifically,  an \u201cagency action.\u201d  However, the narrative that the department submitted  to OMB indicated that almost all of this change was driven by the  reinstatement of a collection that had been in violation (\u201cDriver\u2019s Records  of Duty Status\u201d) and an adjustment to the collection\u2019s burden estimate.   DOT\u2019s estimate of the burden associated with this collection declined about  42 million burden hours when the violation occurred during fiscal year  2001, so the adjustment was about 120 million hours.  Documentation that  we obtained from DOT\u2019s Office of the Chief Information Officer indicated  that the adjustment was caused by significant increases in the department\u2019s  estimates of the time needed for drivers and motor carriers to perform  certain tasks.  Therefore, the actual burden associated with this  information collection did not change.  The same information was being  collected when the authorization had lapsed during fiscal year 2001 and  when it was reinstated during fiscal year 2002.  The rest of the increase was  caused by the department\u2019s reestimation of the burden, not a change in the  burden itself."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reasons for Changes in IRS Burden Estimate", "paragraphs": ["The increase in the IRS burden-hour estimate during fiscal year 2002 (about  330 million burden hours) was more than the increase in the rest of the  government combined.  Therefore, although all agencies must ensure that  their information collections impose the least amount of burden possible, it  is clear that the key to controlling federal paperwork governmentwide lies  in understanding and controlling the increases at IRS.", "The Department of the Treasury\u2019s ICB submission indicated that more than  80 percent of the increase in the department\u2019s estimate during fiscal year  2002 (about 280 million burden hours) was caused by adjustments.  An IRS  official told us that this adjustment was largely driven by an increase in the  number of taxpayers using Form 1040.", "IRS identified a number of burden-hour increases that it said were caused  by the underlying statutes.  For example, IRS said that it added more than  18 million burden hours to its estimate because of changes to Form 1040  and its associated schedules and instructions that were precipitated by the  Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001.  Also, IRS  said it added nearly 17 million hours to the burden associated with Form  4562 (\u201cDepreciation and Amortization\u201d) because of changes made by the  Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act of 2002.", "However, IRS said that other increases in its burden-hour estimate were  made at the agency\u2019s initiative\u2014not because of new statutes.  For example,  the agency said that an increase of more than 22 million hours in its  estimate for Form 941 and related forms were due to changes \u201crequested by  IRS.\u201d", "The Department of the Treasury also indicated in its ICB submission that it  had taken a number of initiatives to reduce paperwork burden.  For  example, beginning with the 2002 tax year, Treasury said that IRS had  eliminated the requirement on small corporate filers (i.e., those with total  receipts and assets of less than $250,000) to file certain schedules with  their returns, resulting in a reduction of about 26 million burden hours.   Treasury also said it had decided to increase the threshold for taxpayers  having to file Schedule B (Form 1040) from $400 to $1,500.  As a result, the  department said that more than 10 million fewer taxpayers would have to  file the schedule\u2014about one-third of those who previously had to file.   However, Treasury did not estimate how many burden hours would be  reduced as a result of that action."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Focusing on IRS to Control Paperwork", "paragraphs": ["In summary, the agencies\u2019 information collection estimates for the ICB  being released today indicate that federal paperwork continues to increase  at a record pace, and that IRS continues to account for most of the  increases in estimated burden.  Because IRS constitutes such a significant  portion of the annual increases and the governmentwide burden-hour  estimate, one strategy to address increases in federal paperwork could be  to focus more of OIRA\u2019s burden-reduction efforts on that agency.  Just as  increases in IRS\u2019s estimates have had a determinative effect on the  governmentwide estimates, reduction in the IRS estimates can have an  equally determinative effect.  For example, just one IRS information  collection (related to Form 1040) is estimated to impose more paperwork  burden than all of the non-Treasury collections combined.  Just five IRS  information collections represent about half of the 8.2 billion hour  paperwork estimate governmentwide.  A small reduction in the burden  associated with those five collections could have a major effect on the  governmentwide effort to reduce paperwork burden.", "However, significant reduction of the burden hours associated with these  and other IRS information collections may ultimately depend upon  congressional action.  IRS officials maintain that the agency\u2019s paperwork  burden totals reflect the information that is needed to administer the tax  laws.  Therefore, they suggest that significant reductions in IRS\u2019s  paperwork burden would require changes to the tax laws.  Within the  current tax laws, however, IRS has some discretion that can affect  paperwork burden.  For example, in January 2001 IRS altered the threshold  over which businesses must pay employment taxes on a quarterly rather  than a more frequent basis.  In general, when considering reductions in the  amount or frequency of data collection, IRS must also balance the potential  for decreasing its ability to ensure that taxpayers fulfill their tax obligations  with the amount of burden imposed."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agencies Identified Fewer PRA Violations", "paragraphs": ["I would now like to turn to the other main topic that you asked us to  address\u2014PRA violations.

The act also requires agencies to  establish a process to ensure that each information collection is in  compliance with these clearance requirements.

For example, OIRA  could notify the budget side of OMB that an agency is collecting  information in violation of the PRA and encourage the appropriate  resource management office to use its influence to bring the agency into  compliance.  OIRA could also encourage the use of \u201cbest practices\u201d learned  from agencies with a good record of PRA compliance.  Agencies that have  recently eliminated their violations altogether (e.g., the Department of the  Treasury, DOT, and DOL) may have much to teach agencies that continue to  violate the act."], "subsections": []}]}]}], "fastfact": []}
