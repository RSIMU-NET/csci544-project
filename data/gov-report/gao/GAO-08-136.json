Based on its review of available leveraging data and interviews with HUD and Treasury officials, GAO found that the leverage measures the agencies reported for the selected programs were based on incomplete data and thus did not capture the actual extent of leveraging in the programs. GAO also found that while the agencies generally reported measures that described the ratio of all other funds (federal, state, local, and private funds) to program funds, alternative measures that described the total federal investment or total private investment in a program provided considerably different results--also potentially of value to decision makers--about the extent of leveraging in a program. GAO regularly has reported that clearly communicating data limitations and their potential impact may foster appropriate use of data; however, no agency-specific or governmentwide guidance directs what agencies should disclose about the leverage measures they report for the selected programs. Consequently, absent specific information on how these measures were calculated and their limitations, decision makers would not have sufficient information to understand their meaning and determine how they could and should be used in performance assessment, budgeting, and other contexts. Leverage measures can provide basic information about the programs GAO reviewed; however, their relevance in assessing the performance of these programs varies considerably. For all of the programs GAO reviewed, leverage measures can describe inputs, or the resources used to support program activities, and may be useful for conveying basic financial information. To the extent that leveraging is a goal or expected activity of a program (as in the three Treasury programs), leverage measures generally can describe program outputs, or the products or services delivered (such as total leveraged funds), and may be used along with other performance indicators to assess the efficiency and effectiveness of a program in meeting its goals. In cases where leveraging is not clearly and appropriately linked to program goals and activities (as in the three HUD programs), use of such measures to describe program outputs could be misleading and result in adverse consequences. Although leveraging had limited relevance to the goals and activities of the selected HUD programs, GAO found that the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the agency often cited leverage measures for the programs in performance- and budget-related reviews and documents.

Leveraging also  can occur at the institutional or project level\u2014at the institutional level, an  entity pools funds from multiple sources, which later are used to finance a  portfolio of projects; at the project level, an entity leverages funds as  necessary for discrete projects.

The alternate leverage  measures presented in scenarios B and C provide additional information  that could be more useful to policymakers and investors than measures  that describe the ratio of all other funds to program funds. For example, to  help inform decisions made as part of the annual appropriations process,  policymakers may be interested in determining the extent of total federal  contributions made to projects funded under a particular program  (scenario B). Alternatively, to assess the potential risk of investing in a  federally sponsored development project in a low-income community, a  private investor might be interested in knowing the proportion of private  investment to public investment in the program (scenario C). Some private  investors might perceive a relatively low ratio as an indication that the  program carried a high level of investment risk and thus a higher potential  for losses. Further, more detailed information on all the different sources  of funding could be useful in describing the extent to which one federal  program is leveraging funds from another federal program (that is, the  extent to which federal programs cross-subsidize one another) and could  be particularly relevant to policymakers during annual budget  deliberations.", "In addition, for the CDFI and New Markets Tax Credit programs (which  leverage at both the institutional and the project levels), disclosing  information on institutional and project-level leveraging could be more  useful to policymakers and investors than a total program leverage  measure.

The match requirement is intended to increase the sustainability of CDFIs  (by increasing private-sector investment in them) as well as their ability to  make investments serving low-income individuals and communities.  Although not required to do so, CDFIs use program and match funds to  leverage debt and further increase their lending resources. Funding  recipients (for example, small businesses) also may use their grants or  loans from CDFIs to leverage additional funds to help finance their  projects.

Further, the application processes for both  programs were designed to encourage additional leveraging. Under the  Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program, in order to limit the federal  share of housing development project costs, states are to provide no more  tax credits to projects than necessary for their financial viability. Under  the New Markets Tax Credit program, Treasury considers CDEs\u2019 potential  to leverage other sources of funds (in addition to the qualified low-income  community investment they plan to make using the tax credit equity) for  the projects they sponsor as a factor in scoring the tax credit allocation  applications.", "In cases where leverage measures are not clearly and appropriately linked  to program goals and core activities, use of such measures to describe  program outputs could result in adverse consequences; for example, by  encouraging agencies to place more importance on leveraging than on  meeting their stated goals. This trade-off is directly apparent in the use of  leverage measures as outputs for the CDBG and HOME programs. While  leveraging may be a strategy some funding recipients employ (either by  choice or out of necessity) to meet these programs\u2019 goals, none of these  programs originally was designed to leverage (meaning, leveraging  generally is not a goal or core activity in these programs). Thus, using  leveraging to assess the success or impact of these programs in meeting  their goals may result in agencies and funding recipients serving fewer  lower-income communities or households (as originally intended by these  programs) and more moderate-income communities and households  (those that are better able to attract additional funds because they pose  relatively less risk to investors).", "HUD set a leveraging goal for the HOPE VI program in the agency\u2019s most  recent strategic plan and its fiscal year 2007 annual performance plan and  fiscal year 2008 budget justification. According to HUD officials, while  leveraging has long been a rating factor in the program\u2019s application  process, its relative importance in financing HOPE VI developments has  increased over time as program appropriations have declined. While  leveraging may help HUD meet the HOPE VI program goal to create  mixed-income communities, its use may involve trade-offs, as it may  conflict with another program goal\u2014providing housing for extremely-low,  very-low, and low-income households. For example, increased reliance  on leveraged funds from other programs or sources that may have  different requirements (such as higher income limits) potentially could  affect the demographic composition of HOPE VI developments.", "Previously, we have reported several limitations to the usefulness of  leverage measures in providing detailed information about federal  programs and the projects they fund (regardless of whether or not those  programs were designed to leverage). Although leveraging can be a useful  tool and public- and private-sector officials regard it favorably, according  to many of the officials we contacted, if considered independently of other  information, leverage measures can provide misleading information about  the success or impact of a program or project. For example, many said  that factors such as the local economy or availability of investors within a  certain geographic area could have a positive or negative impact on a  project\u2019s ability to leverage additional funds, and thus its leverage ratio.  That is, projects in vibrant communities likely may have higher leverage  ratios than those in distressed communities. As a result, leverage measures  are not sufficient to make judgments about the relative success of projects  or programs without other descriptive information. Leverage measures  also do not account for the level of substitution of federal funds for  otherwise available private funds that might occur in programs or projects.  Although difficult to measure, information on substitution might be useful  in assessing how effectively federal funds were utilized in a program or  project. Officials we contacted noted that having information on the risk  position of different contributions to a project might be useful in assessing  the extent of substitution that occurred. For instance, the level of  substitution in a project in which the federal government assumed more  risk (by taking a subordinate position) than nonfederal investors could be  lower than the level of substitution in a project in which the federal  government assumed less risk (by taking a senior position)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OMB and the Agencies Did Not Always Link Leveraging to Program Goals and Core Activities in Performance-related Reviews and Reports", "paragraphs": ["When OMB and the agencies cited leverage measures in performance- and  budget-related reviews and documents, they did not always link leveraging  to program goals and core activities\u2014in some cases, OMB and the  agencies used leveraging to assess the performance of the selected  programs despite its limited relevance to program goals and core  activities. According to OMB officials, the agency considers leveraging to  be an output measure for each of the selected HUD programs. Consistent  with this view, OMB used leveraging as an output measure in its PART  reviews of these programs, although leveraging generally was not linked to  the goals and core activities of the programs. For example, in its 2003  PART review of the CDBG program, OMB recommended that HUD  implement a new performance measurement system that included  information on the amount of money leveraged from other sources. The  agency developed steps to address this recommendation in the program  improvement plan it developed with OMB in 2006 (in response to the  PART assessment\u2019s finding that the program lacked specific annual  performance measures that demonstrated progress on achieving long-term  goals). We have noted that federal programs, in particular federal block  grant programs, have faced difficulties but could benefit from defining  program goals and performance measures that go beyond describing  program activities to describe outcomes or results. However, because  leveraging is not a required activity or explicit goal of the CDBG program  (as discussed previously), its value in evaluating the performance of the  program is limited. Further, in its PART review of the HOME program,  OMB used leverage measures to compare the performance of the HOME  program with that of the CDBG program. Such a comparison does not  facilitate evaluations of these programs in the context of their intended  goals (neither of which is to leverage).", "While using leveraging as an output measure for the CDFI and New  Markets Tax Credit programs is consistent with the programs\u2019 goals and  core activities as discussed above, OMB identified leveraging as an  outcome measure for the CDFI program in its 2004 PART review despite  the fact that, as discussed previously, leveraging cannot be used to  measure the impact of the program. Further, the agency equated  leveraging with program effectiveness in its 2004 PART review of the New  Markets Tax Credit program. (As described in fig. 2, outcome measures  are used to assess the effectiveness of programs in achieving desired  results. As we have discussed throughout this report, outcome measures  should be designed to assess the benefits or consequences of a program\u2014 leverage measures by themselves cannot provide information on the  impact these programs have had on their targeted populations and  communities.)", "As we observed in our 2004 review of OMB\u2019s PART process, the goals and  measures OMB defines in its PART reviews are designed to meet the needs  of executive decision makers during the budget formulation process, and  thus may be inconsistent with the goals and measures federal agencies  have developed in response to GPRA, which may be developed at a higher,  strategic level and less relevant to OMB\u2019s budget decision-making  process. As a result of OMB\u2019s focus on the budget process, we found that  its judgment about appropriate goals and measures for a program may be  substituted for agency judgments. These findings generally are consistent  with our observations on OMB\u2019s use of leverage measures in the PART  reviews of the selected programs we reviewed for this report. We observed  that the agencies identified leveraging as a performance measure in their  performance- and budget-related reports for some of the selected  programs despite its sometimes limited relevance to program goals and  core activities.", "Table 2 describes HUD\u2019s use of leverage measures for the HOME and  HOPE VI programs in its strategic planning and other performance- and  budget-related documents or contexts. In the case of the HOME program,  although leveraging was not linked to the program\u2019s goals and core  activities, HUD equated more leveraging with better performance by  ranking states and localities on their ability to leverage other sources of  funds. For the HOPE VI program, HUD primarily used leveraging as a  measure for its goal of providing decent, affordable housing through the  improvement of the physical quality of public housing. However, HUD  generally did not discuss how leveraging would help the agency in  achieving this goal. HUD also linked leveraging to the HOPE VI goal of  creating mixed-income housing. Although increased leveraging in a  program designed to provide affordable housing could result in trade-offs,  HUD\u2019s performance- and budget-related documents did not discuss the  impact of (or the potential unintended consequences of) leveraging on the  ability of the program to meet this goal.", "Finally, as described in table 3, Treasury generally linked leveraging with  the goals and core activities of the CDFI and New Markets Tax Credit  programs. For example, Treasury noted that leveraging in the CDFI  program helps build CDFIs\u2019 capacity to make loans and other investments  in low-income communities. Because Treasury to date has not reported  publicly the extent of leveraging in the New Markets Tax Credit program,  the agency\u2019s performance- and budget-related documents only discuss the  extent of institutional leverage in the program. As with the CDFI program,  Treasury linked institutional leveraging to the program\u2019s goal of attracting  private-sector capital to low-income communities."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["With the increased focus of federal agencies on performance management,  budgeting, and financial reporting, leveraging has come to be seen as an  effective and efficient means of delivering more impact per dollar of  federal investment, particularly in a period of increasingly tight budgets  and competing funding priorities. While agencies have collected and  presented leveraging information in strategic planning, performance, and  budget reports, and on their Web sites, agencies disclose little or no  information on methods of data collection or how leverage measures were  calculated, in part because there is no agency-specific or governmentwide  guidance on how to calculate, describe, and use leverage measures in a  manner that is consistent with the programs\u2019 design. Information on  methodology is important in the leveraging context because of the  limitations of leveraging measures and data collection issues. For  example, in the case of the CDBG and HOME programs, leveraging may be  underestimated because HUD\u2019s database does not distinguish between  zero responses (for example, where no leveraging occurred) and blank  responses (for example, where leveraging data may be incomplete).  Moreover, measures such as ratios may not disclose the details necessary  to understand which component funding sources were being compared,  and as demonstrated, the ratios can vary considerably depending on what  information an agency is trying to convey about a program (for example,  the extent of public or private investment in a program). Further, data  collection and completeness are issues because not all the programs are  required to report leveraging, and in many cases agencies are unable to  capture data on all leveraging that may be occurring in a program (for  example, project leveraging). Absent specific information on how leverage  measures were calculated and their potential limitations, decision makers  do not have sufficient information to understand their meaning and how  they can and should be used in performance assessment, budgeting, and  other contexts.", "Moreover, the relevance of leveraging to performance measurement is  dependent on the context of the program being analyzed. Because  leveraging is not an intended activity carried out to achieve program goals  or a goal unto itself for some of the selected housing and community and  economic development programs in our review, measures such as ratios  are not indicative of program or project performance (outcomes and  impact). Rather, such measures are indicative only of resource utilization.  Nevertheless, even in cases where they were not reflective of program  performance, agencies presented leverage measures in strategic plans,  annual performance plans, performance and accountability reports, and  budget justifications. The use of leverage measures in such contexts could  lead decision makers to presuppose that the information was indicative of  program impacts in cases where leveraging actually might say very little  about the success of a program, such as the ability of a program to  improve the living conditions of the urban poor.", "Despite the issues surrounding the utility of leverage measures, we note  the valid and useful purposes for which the measures may be used,  particularly in instances where leveraging is an intended activity or goal.  For instance, decision makers and practitioners in the area of affordable  housing and community and economic development may utilize leverage  measures to report basic information on how federal funds were  combined with other funds for a program or project. Such information  could be instructive in ascertaining trends in the involvement of private- sector investors or local governments in federally sponsored initiatives, or  identifying demographic trends that could adversely or positively affect  the ability of program funds to attract other funds. Additionally, the  measures may aid management and Congress in their oversight of  programs and strategic planning for future budgets. Further, when directly  linked to program goals and activities and considered with other  performance measures, leverage measures also could provide insight into  the success of a program, including its impact on targeted populations and  communities.", "The valid and useful purposes to which leverage measures may be put  underline the importance of transparency for federal agencies in  communicating the limitations of such measures and how they are  calculated. The agencies administering the housing and community and  economic development programs we reviewed could improve the  transparency of the leverage measures they use by including information  about the completeness and accuracy of the data and methods used to  compute the measures. Further, the agencies could discuss the relevance  of leveraging to a program\u2019s stated goals and activities. The publication of  such information in conjunction with the measures themselves would  increase the accuracy of the information being conveyed and provide  perspectives that would allow various users to assess the potential of the  measures to serve as relevant and accurate indicators of program or  project outputs and, in some cases, outcomes or impact. However, the  opportunities to better describe, assess, and report the role of leveraging  in housing and community and economic development programs do not  rest solely with the agencies administering those programs. OMB, because  it plays a key role in assessing the performance of federal agencies and  developing and tracking compliance with performance goals, has an  opportunity to refine its understanding and use of leverage measures in  future PART and other performance reviews by carefully considering the  role of leveraging in carrying out program goals and activities. Specifically,  in its performance assessments of the selected programs, OMB could  provide information on how leveraging may support or conflict with a  program\u2019s intended purpose. This is particularly important because the  accuracy of measures and the relationship of leveraging to program goals  and thus performance can vary considerably across the housing and  community and economic development programs we reviewed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To ensure that leverage measures provide accurate, useful, and relevant  information to Congress and others, we recommend that the Secretaries of  HUD and the Treasury consider disclosing the following when they  publish such measures for the programs included in our review:    Presentation of leverage measures should be accompanied by information  about the completeness and accuracy of the data and the method(s) used  to calculate the measures (for example, with leverage ratios, information  on what sources of funds were compared, such as private funds to public  funds or nonfederal funds to federal funds).", "Presentation of leverage measures should be accompanied by a discussion  of the relevance of the measure in assessing the program\u2019s performance.

Specifically, HUD expressed concern that the draft report (1) did not  sufficiently emphasize that the CDBG and HOME programs do not have  statutory or regulatory leveraging requirements; (2) did not sufficiently  emphasize that the agency currently does not publish a leverage measure  for the CDBG program; (3) incorrectly stated that the agency did not  disclose limitations to the data or methods used to calculate leverage  measures for the HOME program, which are reported on HUD\u2019s Web site;  and (4) contends that leveraging affects the funding decisions HUD makes  for CDBG and HOME (HUD noted that all funding decisions are made at  the state or local level and are not approved by the agency).", "With respect to HUD\u2019s first two concerns, we incorporated additional  language into the report to further emphasize that the CDBG and HOME  programs do not have leveraging requirements and that the agency does  not publish a leverage measure for the CDBG program. In its letter, HUD  agreed to work to improve the quality of leveraging data CDBG grantees  report to the agency, which would address, in part, our recommendation  that the agencies disclose information about the completeness and  accuracy of the data and the method(s) used to calculate leverage  measures.", "Concerning HUD\u2019s comment that the draft report incorrectly stated that  the agency did not disclose limitations to the data or methods used to  calculate leverage measures for the HOME program, which are reported  on HUD\u2019s Web site, we acknowledge that HUD\u2019s Web site included  information on the method used to calculate leverage measures for the  HOME program (that is, the ratio of other funds to program funds).  However, HUD has not provided information on the limitations to the data  used to calculate those measures. Specifically, the database HUD used to  collect leveraging data for the program did not distinguish between  nonresponses, which default to zero, and actual entries of zero; assuming  that some grantees failed to enter funding information, the total amount of  leveraging that occurred in the program (or in a specific state or locality)  potentially would be underestimated. Accordingly, we did not change the  report.", "Finally, with respect to HUD\u2019s concern that the draft report contends that  leveraging affects the funding decisions HUD makes for CDBG and HOME,  our report did not state that HUD or grantees make funding decisions  based on leveraging; rather, the report noted the potential consequences  of using leveraging as a performance indicator for programs that were not  designed to leverage. Specifically, we found that leveraging may be a  strategy some funding recipients employ, either by choice or out of  necessity, to meet the goals of the CDBG and HOME programs. Thus,  using a leverage measure to assess the impact or success in meeting goals  may create adverse or conflicting incentives for the agency and its  grantees as well as Congress and other decision makers; for example, by  giving funding priority to projects that leverage more over those that  leverage less, but which may fill a greater or more immediate need within  a community. In response to this comment, we added language to the  report to emphasize that HUD has not identified leveraging as a  performance measure for either program.", "In a letter from the Director of the Community Development Financial  Institutions Fund, Treasury expressed appreciation for our finding that  each of the agency\u2019s programs included in our review was designed to  leverage. Although Treasury did not specifically comment on our  recommendations, it provided several detailed comments primarily related  to the agency\u2019s calculation of leverage measures for the CDFI and New  Markets Tax Credit programs (see app. VI). Specifically, Treasury  commented on our findings that (1) the leverage measures Treasury  reported for its programs lacked transparency because the agency did not  disclose the limitations of the data or the methods used to calculate them;  (2) the leverage measures did not reflect the actual extent of leveraging in  the CDFI program due to incomplete data; (3) missing project-level data  for the New Markets Tax Credit program potentially led to misestimations  of leveraging in the program; and (4) the leverage measure Treasury  calculated for the New Markets Tax program was a multiplier ratio, not a  leverage ratio.", "With respect to its first comment on our findings, Treasury stated that on  multiple occasions the agency has publicly disclosed its calculation  method for the CDFI program. In the report, we listed two publications in  which Treasury disclosed its calculation methodologies and limitations to  the data it used to compute a leverage ratio for the CDFI program. To this  list, we added the additional report Treasury cited in its letter. However,  we continue to believe that disclosure of the methodologies and  limitations of the data used to calculate the leverage measures is  important, particularly in key budget and performance documents, which  policymakers often rely on to make funding and management decisions.  As discussed in the report, Treasury did not disclose such information  about its leverage calculation for the CDFI program in these key  documents. For example, in the fiscal year 2006 Performance and  Accountability Report and Justification for Appropriations and  Performance Plans, Treasury reported leverage ratios for the CDFI  program and emphasized its importance in achieving program goals, but  did not include any discussions of the measures\u2019 data limitations or  calculation methods. Accordingly, we did not change our finding that  Treasury\u2019s reporting of such information was inconsistent and that it  should further disclose its data limitations and calculation methods in key  budget and performance documents.", "Concerning Treasury\u2019s comment on our finding that the leverage measure  the agency calculated for the CDFI program did not reflect the actual  extent of leveraging due to incomplete data, Treasury stated that although  it was aware that the match leverage\u2014that is, the ratio of nonfederal  match funds to program funds\u2014may actually exceed the statutory  requirement of a 1 to 1 ratio, it is not appropriate or necessary to include  excess matching funds that exceed the requirement. We continue to  believe that excluding excess matching funds from the leverage  calculation (which typically includes all other sources of funds)  understates the actual extent of leveraging that occurs in the program.  Accordingly, we did not change the report in this regard. If Treasury  chooses to continue to exclude such amounts from future, published  leverage calculations for the program, we believe that it should disclose  this and its potential impact on the leverage measure, consistent with the  recommendations included in this report.", "Concerning Treasury\u2019s comment on our finding that missing project-level  data for the New Markets Tax Credit program potentially led to  misestimations of leveraging in the program, Treasury stated in its letter  that the leverage measure for the program would not substantially be  different if complete data were available and that the calculated measures  provided a reasonable approximation of the leveraging that occurs in the  program. We reported that (1) leverage data were not available for 26  percent of New Markets Tax Credit projects and (2) Treasury assumed  that CDEs contribute 100 percent of tax credit equity to qualified low- income community investments, even though CDEs are permitted to retain  up to 15 percent of such equity for administrative and other purposes. We  noted that the former case could lead to an underestimation of the extent  of leveraging and the latter an overestimation of the extent of leveraging  that occurred in the program. As discussed above with respect to the CDFI  program, these data limitations potentially could have an impact on the  leverage measure Treasury calculated for the program. In its letter,  Treasury agreed with our description of these limitations, but did not  provide any specific evidence of the impact of missing project-level data  on these measures. Treasury also acknowledged the importance of  disclosing such information, stating it would make every effort to include  a discussion of these and other data limitations, as well as its calculation  methodologies, when and if it publishes leverage measure for the  program. In response to these comments, we did not change the report.", "Finally, with respect to our finding that the leverage measure Treasury  calculated for the New Markets Tax Credit program for purposes of this  report was a multiplier ratio, Treasury stated that the measure was a  leverage ratio, calculated consistent with GAO guidance outlined in the  report. However, we reported the measure Treasury reported for the New  Markets Tax Credit program was not a leverage ratio, but rather a money  multiplier or multiplier ratio. A multiplier ratio measures the total amount  of investment $1 in tax credits potentially can generate in low-income  communities, whereas a leverage ratio measures the additional amount of  investment relative to a source of funds (such as program funds).  According to Treasury officials with whom we spoke, the agency included  the cost of the credit ($0.25) on \u201cboth sides of the ratio,\u201d consistent with  the calculation of a multiplier ratio, but overstating the extent of  leveraging that occurred in the program. Our purpose in making a  distinction between leverage ratios and multiplier ratios was to highlight  the need for adequate disclosure of calculation methods and data  limitations so that decision makers understand how to interpret these  measures and how these measures compare with those reported by other  programs. Without such information, it would not be possible for decision  makers to assess the reliability of the measures or the comparability of the  measures reported by other programs. If Treasury publishes the measure it  calculated for the New Markets Tax Credit program, we believe it is  incumbent upon the agency to provide a discussion as to how the measure  was calculated in an attempt to provide complete information to decision  makers (see app. III). Further, Treasury acknowledged in its letter it would  do so, stating it would \u201cmake every effort to include a discussion of data  methodologies and limitations\u201d when it publishes leverage measure for the  program.

Based on this information, we requested  from HUD and Treasury data they use to measure the extent of leveraging  (for example, data on the sources and amounts of funds, or other financial  data, commonly referred to as \u201cleveraging data\u201d) in the CDBG, HOME, and  HOPE VI programs and the CDFI and New Markets Tax Credit programs,  respectively. We did not request Low-Income Housing Tax Credit data  from HUD or Treasury because neither maintains a database with detailed  information on leveraging.", "For both the CDBG and HOME programs, we requested leveraging data on  completed program activities that were aggregated at the local level from  HUD\u2019s Integrated Disbursement and Information System (IDIS), which  contains information on activities funded by a number of grant programs  (including the CDBG and HOME programs). The CDBG data were from  December 1, 2005, and May 1, 2007, and the HOME data were from  October 1, 2005, and September 30, 2006. To assess the reliability of the  data for both programs we (1) performed basic electronic testing of data  elements associated with the financing used by state and local agencies  that administer the programs\u2014for example, we checked for missing data;  (2) reviewed existing information about the data and IDIS; (3) replicated  the leverage measure that HUD reported for each program; and (4)  interviewed agency officials knowledgeable about the data. As a result of  these tests, we found several limitations with these data, specifically that  they were largely self-reported by program administrators and were not  validated. In addition, IDIS does not distinguish between nonresponses,  which default to zero, and actual zero (that is, $0) responses; as such, the  data may underreport the total amount of leveraging that occurred in the  programs. Further, the data may be incomplete because HUD does not  require state and local agencies to report leveraging data because  leveraging is not a required activity in either the CDBG or the HOME  program, and HUD only started collecting leveraging data for the CDBG  program in December 2005 (only about half of all program administrators  have reported relevant data to the agency). Due to these limitations, we  were unable to determine the reliability of the precise dollar amounts that  were used in combination with the CDBG and HOME funds. We use the  leverage measures that HUD derived from the data to illustrate how  leverage measures can be calculated in different ways, but the values  should not be used to represent actual dollars leveraged.", "To assess the reliability of HUD\u2019s HOPE VI program leveraging data on the  55 HOPE VI projects completed (that is, projects in which all phases of  construction were fully completed and actual funding amounts were  reported) as of March 2006, we (1) performed basic electronic testing of  data elements associated with the financing used by the public housing  agencies that administer the program; (2) reviewed existing information  about the data and HUD\u2019s HOPE VI Internet-based Grant Management  Reporting System Prototype (HOPE VI database); and (3) interviewed  HUD officials knowledgeable about the data. In addition, we interviewed  officials from five randomly selected public housing agencies (PHA) that  received a HOPE VI grant to determine the accuracy and completeness of  the data in the HOPE VI database as it pertained to the PHAs\u2019 specific  HOPE VI project. We determined that the data were sufficiently reliable  for the purpose of this report.", "For the CDFI program, we discussed with agency officials the calculation  method used to compute the program\u2019s leverage measure, including any  assumptions made, the completeness and accuracy of the data used in the  calculation, and any other known limitations to the measure or the data  used to calculate it. Unlike the CDBG, HOME, and HOPE VI programs, we  did not request project-level data Treasury uses to calculate a leverage  measure for the program. Rather, Treasury provided us with a  spreadsheet containing the calculation method and nationally aggregated  data used to calculate leverage measures for each of the last 6 reporting  years. We determined that Treasury\u2019s calculation method was appropriate  and supporting data were sufficiently reliable for the purpose of  calculating an approximation of the funds being leveraged in the program.  However, based on our conversations with agency officials, we also noted  several limitations in Treasury\u2019s calculation method and the supporting  data. Specifically (1) the data were largely self-reported by CDFIs and  were not validated and (2) Treasury assumed that matching contributions  do not exceed $1 for every $1 in program funds, which likely understates  the extent of institutional-level leveraging in the program (because many  of the CDFIs exceed the match requirement, according to Treasury  officials).", "To assess the reliability of the data Treasury provided on project-level  leveraging in the New Markets Tax Credit program, we (1) performed  basic electronic tests of the data elements associated with the financing  used by Community Development Entities (CDE), (2) reviewed existing  information about the data, (3) replicated the project-level leverage  measure Treasury calculated for the program, and (4) interviewed agency  officials knowledgeable about the data. We determined that the project- level data were sufficiently reliable for purposes of calculating a project- level leverage measure for the program.

Our pretested survey achieved a 79 percent response rate. On the basis of  45 responses to the following questions\u2014(1) Does your agency have data  in its database on the specific types of financing sources that are used in  each Low-Income Housing Tax Credit project? and (2) Does your agency  have the dollar amounts contributed by each financing source used in the  project in the database?\u2014we found that 25 allocating agencies collect the  dollar amounts contributed by specific financing sources and keep that  data electronically. Because not all allocating agencies collected  leveraging data and those that did used different software applications to  maintain their data, we determined that it would be difficult to collect  aggregate data to report a national leverage measure for the program.", "To examine the relevance of leverage measures in assessing the  performance of the selected programs, we reviewed our reports and those  of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) on performance  measurement; agency strategic plans and annual performance plans,  budget justifications and performance and accountability reports; and  industry, and other literature such as agency press releases and Web sites.

Specifically, we conducted site visits in Chicago, Illinois; Laredo and San  Antonio, Texas; Chester and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Portland and  Salem, Oregon; and Seattle and Tokeland, Washington. We selected these  areas to obtain perspectives from a variety of regions with attributes such  as difficult-to-develop areas, rural and urban classifications, and lower-  and higher-cost areas that affect the extent of leveraging. We used a  nongeneralizable, illustrative sampling approach to select a range of  housing and community and economic development projects or initiatives  to tour. More specifically, our criteria were (1) projects were substantially  completed in the last 5 years, (2) funds of each of the programs in our  review were utilized in at least one of the projects selected, and (3)  projects had two or more funding sources. In the cases where program  officials maintained comprehensive lists of projects, we used such lists to  randomly select projects; otherwise, we used available project information  (for example, from program administrator Web sites) in conjunction with  information from program administrators to select projects that generally  met our criteria. In selecting the projects we illustrate in this report, we  further considered several factors including the availability and  completeness of leveraging data, the creativity in the projects\u2019 financing  and design, the type of development or initiative, whether the project was  located in a rural area, and the general geographic location of the project.
