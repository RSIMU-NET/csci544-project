In general, state and local governments' revenues increase during economic expansions and decline during national recessions (relative to long-run trends). State and local revenue declines have varied during each recession, and the declines have been more severe during recent recessions. Additionally, revenue fluctuations vary substantially across states, due in part to states' differing tax structures, economic conditions, and industrial bases. State and local government spending also tends to increase during economic expansions, but spending on safety net programs, such as health and hospitals and public welfare, appears to decrease during economic expansions and increase during national recessions, relative to long-run trends. These trends can exacerbate the fiscal conditions of state and local governments given that demand for health and other safety net programs increases during recessions, and these programs now consume larger shares of state budgets relative to prior decades. This implies that, during recessions, state and local governments may have difficulties providing services. To mitigate the effect on services from declining revenues, state and local governments take actions including raising taxes and fees, tapping reserves, and using other budget measures to maintain balanced budgets. Although every recession reflects varied economic circumstances at the national level and among the states, knowledge of prior federal responses to national recessions provides guideposts for policymakers to consider as they design strategies to respond to future recessions. Considerations include (1) Timing assistance so that the aid begins to flow as the economy is contracting, although assistance that continues for some period beyond the recession's end may help these governments avoid actions that slow economic recovery; (2) Targeting assistance based on the magnitude of the recession's effects on individual states' economic distress; and (3) Temporarily increasing federal funding (by specifying the conditions for ending or halting the state and local assistance when states' economic conditions sufficiently improve). Policymakers also balance their decision to provide state and local assistance with other federal policy considerations such as competing demands for federal resources. Policymakers can select indicators to identify when the federal government should start and stop providing aid, as well as how much aid should be allocated. Timely indicators are capable of distinguishing states' economic downturns from economic expansions. Indicators selected for targeting assistance are capable of identifying states' individual circumstances in a recession. In general, timely indicators capable of targeting assistance to states can be found primarily in labor market data. Indicators such as employment, unemployment, hourly earnings, and wages and salaries also offer the advantage of providing information on economic conditions rather than reflecting states' policy choices (a limitation of data on state revenue trends). In some cases, it may be appropriate for policymakers to select multiple indicators or select indicators to reflect their policy goals specific to a particular recession. States have been affected differently during each of these recessions. For example, unemployment rates, entry into, and exit out of economic downturns have varied across states during past recessions. Federal responses to prior recessions have included various forms of federal fiscal assistance to these governments as well as decisions not to provide direct fiscal assistance to these governments."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The federal government provided fiscal assistance to state and local  governments in response to three of the six national recessions since  1974.

The  unemployment rate in individual states increased between 1.4 and 6.8  percentage points, with a median change of 4 percentage points (figure 1).  In contrast, a smaller national unemployment rate increase of 1.3  percentage points during the 1990-1991 recession reflected unemployment  rate changes in individual states ranging from -0.2 to 3.4 percentage points.", "Recent economic research suggests that while economic downturns  within states generally occur around the same time as national recessions,  their timing\u2014or entrance into and exit out of the economic downturn\u2014 and duration varies. Some states may enter or exit an economic  downturn before or after a national recession. Other states\u2019 economies  may expand while the country as a whole is in recession. States can also  experience an economic downturn not associated with a national  recession. States\u2019 differing characteristics, such as industrial structure,  contribute to these differences in economic activity.

For  example, in response to the recession beginning in December 2007, the  federal government and the Federal Reserve together acted to moderate  the downturn and restore economic growth when confronted with  unprecedented weakness in the financial sector and the overall economy.  The Federal Reserve used monetary policy to respond to the recession by  pursuing one of the most significant interest rate reductions in U.S.  history. In concert with the Department of the Treasury, it went on to  bolster the supply of credit in the economy through measures that provide  Federal Reserve backing for a wide variety of loan types, from mortgages  to automobile loans to small business loans.", "The federal government also used fiscal policy to confront the effects of  the recession. Existing fiscal stabilizers, such as unemployment insurance  and progressive aspects of the tax code, kicked in automatically in order  to ease the pressure on household income as economic conditions  deteriorated. In addition, Congress enacted legislation providing  temporary tax cuts for businesses and a tax rebate for individuals in the  first half of 2008 to buoy incomes and spending and created the Troubled  Asset Relief Program in the second half of 2008 to give Treasury  authority to act to restore financial market functioning.", "The federal government\u2019s largest response to the recession to date came in  early 2009 with the passage of the Recovery Act, the broad purpose of  which is to stimulate the economy\u2019s overall demand for goods and  services, or aggregate demand. Fiscal stimulus programs are intended to  increase aggregate demand\u2014the spending of consumers, business firms,  and governments\u2014and may be either automatic or discretionary.  Unemployment insurance, the progressive aspects of the tax code, and  other fiscal stabilizers provide stimulus automatically by easing pressure  on household incomes as economic conditions deteriorate. Discretionary  fiscal stimulus, such as that provided by the Recovery Act, can take the  form of tax cuts for households and businesses, transfers to individuals,  grants-in-aid to state and local governments, or direct federal spending. In  response, households, businesses, and governments may purchase more  goods and services than they would have otherwise, and governments and  businesses may refrain from planned workforce cuts or even hire  additional workers. Thus, fiscal stimulus may lead to an overall, net  increase in national employment and output.", "The federal government may have an interest in providing fiscal assistance  to state and local governments during recessions because doing so could  reduce actions taken by these governments that could exacerbate the  effects of the recession. Output, income, and employment all tend to fall  during recessions, causing state and local governments to collect less  revenue at the same time that demand for the goods and services they  provide is increasing. Since state governments typically face balanced  budget requirements and other constraints, they adjust to this situation by  raising taxes, cutting programs and services, or drawing down reserve  funds, all but the last of which amplify short-term recessionary pressure  on households and businesses. Local governments may make similar  adjustments unless they can borrow to make up for reduced revenue. By  providing assistance to state and local governments, the federal  government may be able to forestall, or at least moderate, state and local  governments\u2019 program and service cuts, tax increases, and liquidation of  reserves. The federal government has provided varied forms of assistance  directly to state and local governments in response to three of the past six  recessions (figure 2). States have been affected differently during each of  these recessions. For example, unemployment rates, entry into, and exit  out of economic downturns have varied across states during past  recessions. See appendix III for a description of each piece of legislation.", "Congressional decisions about whether to provide fiscal assistance to  state and local governments ultimately depend on what role policymakers  believe the federal government should take during future national  recessions. Perspectives on whether and the extent to which the federal  government should provide fiscal assistance to state and local  governments are far-ranging\u2014some advocate for not creating an  expectation that federal fiscal assistance will be provided, while others  argue for a greater federal role in providing fiscal assistance to state and  local governments in response to national recessions.", "Some policy analysts warn against creating an expectation that federal  assistance will be available to state and local governments. These  analysts contend that federal fiscal assistance can distort state and local  fiscal choices and induce greater spending of scarce state funds. For  example, the matching requirements of federal grants can induce state  governments to dedicate more resources than they otherwise would to  areas where these resources are not necessarily required. According to  these analysts, federal fiscal assistance to state and local governments  reduces government accountability and erodes state control by imposing  federal solutions on state problems. Those who hold this perspective see  little justification for insulating state governments from the same fiscal  discipline that other sectors of the economy follow during a recession.", "In contrast, other policy analysts favor a federal role in promoting the  fiscal health of state and local governments during economic downturns.  Proponents of this view contend that during economic downturns, state  and local governments face the dilemma that demand for social welfare  benefits increases at the same time that state and local governments\u2019  ability to meet these demands is constrained as a result of decreasing tax  revenues."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "State and Local Governments\u2019 Revenue and Expenditure Patterns during National Recessions Reflect Variations in Economic Circumstances and Policy Choices", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "State and Local Government Revenue Declines in National Recessions Vary in Magnitude, over Time, and across States", "paragraphs": ["General revenues collected by state and local governments over the past  three decades are procyclical\u2014typically increasing when the national  economy is expanding and decreasing during national recessions, relative  to their long-run trend. Own-source revenues, which made up about 80  percent of state and local general revenues in 2008, and total tax revenues,  which made up about 68 percent of state and local own-source revenues in  2008, display similar cyclical behavior. In addition, state and local revenue  growth lagged the resumption of national economic growth after the 2001  and 2007-2009 recessions, but preceded it during the 1981-1982 and 1990- 1991 recessions.", "State and local governments\u2019 current tax receipts have declined in each of  the six national recessions since 1973. However, both the severity of these  revenue declines and the time it has taken for revenues to recover has  varied (figure 3). During the most recent recession, state and local  governments experienced more severe and long-lasting declines in  revenue than in past recessions. For example, over the course of the 2007- 2009 recession, current tax receipts declined 9.2 percent\u2014from $1.4  trillion in the fourth quarter of 2007 to $1.2 trillion in the second quarter of  2009\u2014and had not yet returned to the peak level 5 quarters after the end  of the recession. In contrast, the recessions beginning in 1980, 1981, and  1990 were less severe. For example, over the course of the 1990-1991  recession, current tax receipts declined less than 1 percent\u2014from $789  billion in the third quarter of 1990 to about $785 billion in the first quarter  of 1991\u2014and recovered as the recession ended in the first quarter of 1991.", "Larger revenue declines during the two most recent recessions have  coincided with increased volatility in state and local government revenues  during the past two decades. This increased volatility can be attributed to  the fact that since 1973, states have become increasingly reliant on  individual income taxes, which are usually more volatile than other  revenues. Income tax receipts rose from 15 percent of current tax  receipts in 1973 to 20 percent in 2009. Analysts have attributed the  increase in income tax as a portion of state revenues to state policy  changes favoring income taxes and changes in the ways workers are  compensated. Over time, state and local government revenues have  become more volatile due to an increased reliance on income tax and a  decreased reliance on sales tax. Several factors have contributed to these  shifts, including sales tax exemptions for certain items, such as food and  medicine; an increase in the share of consumption represented by  services, as services are often excluded from sales tax; and increased  Internet sales, which can reduce opportunities for state tax collections.", "Revenue fluctuations during national recessions vary substantially across  states. Analysts have reported that this is due in part to states\u2019 differing tax  structures, economic conditions, and industrial bases. The aggregate  revenue levels described earlier mask varying trends among individual  state and local governments, as some state and local governments  experience minimal or no revenue declines during national recessions,  while others face severe reductions in tax revenues. For example, the  median decline in state tax collections from the first quarter of 2008 to the  first quarter of 2009 was 11 percent. While variations ranged from a 72  percent decline to a 15 percent increase during this period, most individual  state tax collections declined between 16 percent and 6 percent.", "To better understand the extent to which an individual state\u2019s government  tax revenues decline during national recessions, we estimated how  responsive state government tax revenues are to changes in total wages, a  proxy for the amount of economic activity. We found that, on average,  state tax revenues decrease by 1 percent when wages decrease by about 1  percent. However, this effect varies substantially across individual states,  with state tax revenues falling by anywhere from about 0.2 percent to  about 1.8 percent in response to a 1 percent decline in wages. This means  that given the same reduction in wages, one state\u2019s tax revenues may fall  at up to nine times the rate of another state."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "State and Local Government Spending Increases during Economic Expansions and Decreases during National Recessions Relative to Long-Run Trends While Spending on Safety Net Programs Displays the Opposite Pattern", "paragraphs": ["General expenditures by state and local governments are procyclical  (table 2). General expenditures also tend to lag the national business  cycle by one to two years, so they tend to decline relative to trend later  than GDP and also to increase relative to trend later than GDP. However,  general expenditures by state and local governments grew at an average  annual rate of about 4 percent during the period from 1977 to 2008, so  declines in general expenditures relative to trend do not necessarily  correspond to absolute declines in the level of general expenditures.", "Both of the main components of general expenditures\u2014capital outlays  and current expenditures\u2014are procyclical. Capital outlays, which made  up about 13 percent of general expenditures in 2008, are expenditures on  the purchase of buildings, land, and equipment, among other things.  Current expenditures, which made up the remaining 87 percent of general  expenditures in 2008, include all non-investment spending, such as  supplies, materials, and contractual services for current operations; wages  and salaries for employees; and cash assistance to needy individuals.  Capital outlays show a stronger procyclical relationship than current  expenditures, and therefore typically fall relative to trend more than  current expenditures during national recessions. Trends in capital outlays  and current expenditures tend to lag the national business cycle by 1 to 2  years. However, like general expenditures, both capital outlays and  current expenditures by state and local government grew by  approximately 4 percent per year between 1977 and 2008, so declines  below their long-run trends do not imply that the levels of either capital  outlays or current expenditures declined.", "Spending associated with social safety net programs appears to behave  differently over the business cycle than other types of spending. For  example, current expenditures on health and hospitals and on public  welfare\u2013expenditures associated with social safety net programs such as  Medicaid and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)\u2014 typically increase relative to trend during national recessions (i.e., these  expenditures are countercyclical). In contrast, current expenditures on  elementary and secondary education, higher education, highways, and  police and corrections typically decrease relative to trend during  economic downturns (i.e., these expenditures are procyclical). Current  expenditures on health and hospitals and on public welfare may be  countercyclical because the number of people living in poverty is one of  the main drivers of both types of expenditures, and the number of people  living in poverty tends to increase during national recessions and to  decrease during national expansions.", "In addition, current expenditures on some functions seem to lag the  business cycle more than others. For example, current expenditures on  elementary and secondary education and higher education seem to lag the  business cycle by 1 to 2 years, while current expenditures on other  functions do not seem to lag the business cycle. Thus, while state and local  governments tend to reduce total current expenditures relative to trend  during national recessions, they do not do so for every service.  Furthermore, current expenditures on some services, such as education,  take longer to recover than others after the recession is over. However,  current expenditures on all the services we analyzed grew every year on  average during the period of 1977 to 2008, so declines relative to trend  were not necessarily absolute declines in spending on these services.", "If state and local government expenditures are typically procyclical, then  state and local governments may have difficulties providing services  during recessions. Reduced expenditures relative to trend during  recessions may be reflecting reduced revenues relative to trend rather  than reduced desire for services. For example, current expenditures on  elementary and secondary education tend to fall relative to trend during  recessions, but the population of elementary and secondary school-age  children is unlikely to vary much as a result of the business cycle. Current  expenditures on higher education also tend to fall relative to trend during  recessions even though enrollment in colleges and universities may  increase during recessions. Furthermore, the finding that current  expenditures on health and hospitals and on public welfare tend to  increase relative to trend during recessions does not definitively indicate  the extent to which these increases are meeting increased demand during  recessions. For example, we have previously reported that economic  downturns in states result in rising unemployment, which can lead to  increases in the number of individuals who are eligible for Medicaid  coverage, and in declining tax revenues, which can lead to less available  revenue with which to fund coverage of additional enrollees. Between  2001 and 2002, Medicaid enrollment rose 8.6 percent, which was largely  attributed to states\u2019 increases in unemployment. During this same period,  state tax revenues fell 7.5 percent. The extent to which state  governments maintained the capacity to fund their Medicaid programs  differed during past recessions. These differences reflect variations in  state unemployment rate increases and varied increases in Medicaid  enrollment during recession periods."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "State Governments Raise Taxes and Fees, Tap Reserves, and Use Other Budget Measures to Address Revenue Declines during National Recessions", "paragraphs": ["As revenues decline and demand increases for programs such as Medicaid  and unemployment insurance during national recessions, state  governments make fiscal choices within the constraints of their available  resources.

Prior to the recessions beginning in 2000 and 2007, state governments built  large balance levels, in the aggregate.

By state fiscal year 2003, states\u2019 total balances dropped to 3.2  percent of expenditures, and in fiscal year 2010 they had fallen to 6.4  percent. These total balance levels appear inflated, however, because  individual state governments\u2019 reserves can vary substantially.

While the state and local government sector increased its  borrowing substantially during recent recessions, the sector did not  increase net investments to the same extent. For example, net borrowing  increased from 0.2 percent of GDP in the first quarter of 2006 to 1.15  percent of GDP in the third quarter of 2008 for all state and local  governments in the aggregate. In contrast, state and local government  investment ranged from 1.1 percent to 1.2 percent of GDP during the same  period.", "The level of total state and local government debt per capita varies  substantially across states.

As a percentage of gross  state product (GSP), total state and local government debt averaged 16.9  percent and ranged from 6.6 percent to 25.4 percent in fiscal year 2008.  State and local government total debt levels appear to correlate with GSP,  suggesting that state and local governments within states with more fiscal  resources tend to hold more debt.", "State budget officials have used other short-term budget measures to  address revenue declines while avoiding broad-based tax increases. Some  of these strategies include:  shifting revenues or expenditures across fiscal years,  securitizing revenue streams,  reducing payments or revenue sharing to local governments,  deferring infrastructure maintenance,  borrowing from or transferring funds from outside the general fund  to address revenue shortfalls, and  reducing funding levels for pensions.", "In addition, a number of state governments have redesigned government  programs to improve efficiency and reduce expenditures. According to the  National Governor\u2019s Association Center for Best Practices (NGA Center), a  recession provides state fiscal managers with an opportunity for cutting  back inefficient operations. The NGA Center tracked state governments\u2019  efforts to restructure government, and in fiscal years 2009 and 2010, a  broad range of budget cuts and programmatic changes were enacted in  areas such as corrections, K-12 education, higher education, and employee  costs (salaries and benefits). While some of these changes were  temporary, the NGA Center contends these changes reflect a \u201cnew normal\u201d  for state government in the long term. The NGA Center found that at least  15 state governments conducted governmentwide reviews to improve  efficiency and reduce costs; at least 18 state governments reorganized  agencies; and more than 20 state governments altered employee  compensation, including enacting pension reforms."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Strategies to Respond to National Recessions Require Decisions on Whether, When, and How to Provide Federal Fiscal Assistance to State and Local Governments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO and Other Evaluations of Prior Federal Fiscal Assistance Strategies Identify Design Considerations Including Effective Timing and Targeting of Aid", "paragraphs": ["Evaluations of prior federal fiscal assistance strategies have identified  considerations to guide policymakers as they consider the design of future  legislative responses to national recessions. To ensure that federal fiscal  assistance is effective, we and others have said that policymakers can  benefit from considering the following when developing a policy strategy.", "Timing/triggering mechanisms\u2014Fiscal assistance that begins to flow  to state and local governments when the national economy is  contracting is more likely to help state and local governments avoid  actions that exacerbate the economic contraction, such as increasing  taxes or cutting expenditures. Since it takes time for state and local  government revenues and service demands to return to pre-recession  levels, fiscal assistance that continues beyond the end of a recession  may help state and local governments avoid similar actions that slow  the economic recovery. Federal policy strategies specifically intended  to stabilize state and local governments\u2019 budgets may have to be timed  differently than those designed to stimulate the national economy,  because state budget difficulties often persist beyond the end of a  recession.", "Securing legislative approval of fiscal assistance through Congress can  result in a time lag before such assistance is available. For example,  the Recovery Act was passed in February 2009, nearly five quarters  after the national recession began in December 2007. There can also be  a second lag that results from the time it takes for the federal  government to distribute fiscal assistance to the states. Further, state  governments often have to set up mechanisms for channeling the  funds into the necessary programs. All of this slows the process of  spending the money during a recession. In the case of the Jobs and  Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 (JGTRRA), for example,  we found that the first federal funds were distributed 19 months after  the end of the national recession. A trigger could automatically provide  federal assistance, or it could prompt policymakers to take action.  Economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago have described  the ideal countercyclical assistance program as one having an  automatically activated, pre-arranged triggering mechanism that could  remove some of the political considerations from the program\u2019s design  and eliminate delays inherent to the legislative process. Such a trigger  could also specify criteria for ending assistance.", "Targeting\u2014If federal fiscal assistance to state and local governments is  targeted based on the magnitude of the recession\u2019s effect on each  state\u2019s economy, this approach can facilitate economic recovery and  moderate fiscal distress at the state and local level. Targeting requires  careful consideration of the differences in individual states\u2019 downturns  while also striking a balance with other policy objectives. As discussed  below, effective targeting of federal fiscal assistance is dependent  upon the selection of indicators that correspond to the specific  purpose(s) of the particular policy strategy.", "Temporary\u2014As a general principle, federal fiscal assistance provided  in response to national recessions is temporary. While a federal fiscal  stimulus strategy can increase economic growth in the short run, such  efforts can contribute to the federal budget deficit if allowed to run too  long after entering a period of strong recovery. The program can be  designed so that the assistance ends or is phased out without causing a  major disruption in state government budget planning. If federal  assistance is poorly timed, badly targeted, or permanently increases  the budget deficit, the short-term benefits of the assistance package  may not offset the long-term cost.", "Consistency with other policy objectives\u2014The design of federal fiscal  assistance occurs in tandem with consideration of the impact these  strategies could have on decision makers\u2019 other policy objectives. Such  considerations include competing demands for federal resources and  an assessment of states\u2019 ability to cope with their economic conditions  without further federal assistance. As the Peterson-Pew Commission  on Budget Reform recently noted in its report, current budget  practices recognize the costs of economic emergencies only when  these events occur. Although we do not know when recessions will  occur or how severe future recessions will be, the current practice of  waiting to act until these economic events occur can result in greater  public costs than if policy objectives of advance preparation (such as  reduced consumption and increased savings during economic  upswings) were incorporated into federal fiscal assistance strategies.  A standby federal fiscal assistance policy could induce moral hazard  by encouraging state or local governments to expect similar federal  actions in future crises, thereby weakening their incentives to properly  manage risks. For example, states could have less incentive to build,  maintain, and grow their rainy day or other reserve funds if they  believe they may receive assistance from the federal government  during future recessions. Another consideration is the policy objective  of maintaining accountability while promoting flexibility in state  spending. Past studies have shown that unrestricted federal funds are  fungible and can be substituted for state funds, and the uses of such  funds can be difficult or impossible to track."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Overall Design Considerations and Policy Goals Influence Selection of Indicators to Time and Target Federal Fiscal Assistance", "paragraphs": ["When policymakers select indicators to time and target federal fiscal  assistance in response to a national recession, their selection depends on  the specific purposes of the proposed assistance program. For example,  during a recession, policymakers may choose to provide general fiscal  assistance or assistance for specific purposes such as supporting states\u2019  Medicaid or education programs. The indicators chosen to time and target  general fiscal assistance could differ from those chosen for the purpose of  supporting Medicaid or education. Indicators chosen for Medicaid could  also differ from those chosen to provide assistance for education. In  addition, different indicators may be needed to determine the timing  (triggering on), the targeting (allocating), and the halting (triggering off) of  federal fiscal assistance. For example, policymakers could use a national  labor market indicator to begin assistance and a state-level indicator to  halt assistance. We previously reported on a policy strategy intended to  support state Medicaid programs during economic downturns. This  strategy used state unemployment rates to trigger the flow of aid on and  off. This strategy used state unemployment rates along with an additional  indicator\u2014relative state Medicaid costs\u2014to determine the amount of aid  each state receives.", "Policymakers could select indicators with the intent of responding to the  effects of a particular recession. For example, if policymakers want to  begin providing fiscal assistance to state and local governments as states  enter an economic downturn, they are challenged by the fact that different  states may enter into economic downturns at different times.  Policymakers would need to select an indicator that provides information  on the overall amount of economic activity in individual states, that is  frequent enough to distinguish between different phases of the business  cycle, and is available with relatively little lag time.", "Timely, state-level, publicly available indicators can be found primarily in  labor market data, but are also found in housing market and personal  income data. The indicators in table 3 are all commonly used measures of  national macroeconomic activity that are also available at the state level.  At the national level, indicators such as employment, weekly hours, and  housing units authorized by building permits are procyclical, while other  indicators, such as unemployment, are countercyclical. The indicators in  table 3 are published either monthly or quarterly, and thus cover periods  shorter than the length of the typical national recession. These indicators  are available with less than a 6-month publication lag, as indicators with  publication lags greater than 6 months may not reveal the downturn until  it is already over and the recovery has begun.", "The illustrative indicators shown in the table above exclude indicators of  fiscal stress (such as declines in tax receipts or budget gaps) because they  are dependent on state governments\u2019 policy choices and because state  definitions and measurement techniques vary for calculations such as  budget gaps. For example, the list does not include state governments\u2019  quarterly tax receipts because this measure reflects policy decisions  within each state. Data sources detailing state-level participation in  intergovernmental benefit programs are also excluded because program  enrollment data can understate the number of individuals eligible for the  program. For example, we did not include unemployment insurance claim  data from the Employment and Training Administration because BLS has  reported that unemployment insurance information cannot be used as a  source for complete information on the number of unemployed. We  excluded this indicator because claims data may underestimate the  number of unemployed because some people are still jobless when their  benefits run out, some are not eligible, and some never apply for benefits.", "Recent research suggests that some indicators may be better able to  trigger assistance on and off than other indicators, depending on the  specific purpose of the assistance. Economists from the Federal Reserve  Bank of Chicago found that a trigger based on the national aggregate of  the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\u2019s State Coincident Indexes\u2014 which are comprised of nonfarm payroll employment, average hours  worked in manufacturing, the unemployment rate, and wage and salary  disbursements\u2014would turn assistance on close to the beginning of a  national recession and would turn assistance off close to the end of a  national recession. They found that a trigger based on the national  unemployment rate also triggered the flow of assistance on close to the  beginning of a national recession, but did not trigger the assistance off  until well after the national economic recovery was under way, reflecting  the lag in employment recovery after recessions. If the goal of aid is to  maintain state and local government spending only during the recession,  then the State Coincident Indexes may be an appropriate indicator.  However, if the goal of aid is to maintain state and local government  spending until an individual state\u2019s economy fully recovers, the  unemployment rate may be an appropriate indicator."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Future Approaches to Federal Fiscal Assistance Can Benefit from Knowledge of Results, Challenges, and Unintended Consequences of Previous Federal Responses", "paragraphs": ["Knowledge of the results, challenges, and unintended consequences of  past policy actions can inform deliberations as policymakers determine  whether and how to provide federal fiscal assistance in response to future  national recessions. Federal responses to prior recessions have included  providing various forms of federal fiscal assistance directly to state and  local governments as well as decisions not to provide fiscal assistance in  response to national recessions. When the federal government has  provided fiscal assistance, such assistance has fallen into two general  categories: (1) unrestricted or general purpose fiscal assistance, which  can include general revenue sharing programs; and (2) federal fiscal  assistance through grants for specific purposes. This second category of  assistance has included funding for existing grant programs (including  both categorical and formula grants) as well as funding for new grant  programs to state and local governments.", "Unrestricted or general purpose grants to states and localities maximize  spending discretion for state and local governments. This approach has  included antirecession payments and general revenue sharing funds to  increase state and local expenditures or forestall potential tax increases.  Because there are minimal restrictions on the use of these funds, they  offer the advantage of not interfering with state spending priorities as well  as the opportunity to use the funds quickly. However, our past evaluations,  as well as work by others, have noted that this approach also presents  challenges and unintended consequences. Due to the nature of such  assistance, state and local governments may use unrestricted federal funds  for activities that would have otherwise been funded using non-federal  sources. Also, in an example from the 1970s, federal antirecession  payments were provided through the Antirecession Fiscal Assistance  (ARFA) program, which distributed more than $3 billion between July  1976 and September 1978 to state and local governments. State and local  governments could use the ARFA funds for the maintenance of basic  services customarily provided by these governments, such as public  welfare, education and police protection. The ARFA funds were intended  to facilitate state spending. However, because the funds were subject to  states\u2019 standard appropriations procedures, this slowed states\u2019 spending of  the funds. In its study of ARFA, the Department of the Treasury reported  that states appropriated ARFA funds on average 7 months later than the  states appropriated their own revenues, thereby delaying entry of the  funds into the states\u2019 spending stream.", "More recently, we found similar issues in our 2004 review of the  component of the JGTRRA that provided $10 billion in unrestricted,  temporary fiscal relief payments to states that were allocated on a per  capita basis. We found that these fiscal relief funds were not targeted to  individual states based on the impact of the recession and found it  doubtful that these payments were ideally timed to achieve their greatest  possible economic stimulus. JGTRRA fiscal relief payments were first  distributed to the states in June 2003, about 19 months after the end of the  2001 recession and after the beginning of the economic expansion.  However, because employment levels continued to decline even after the  economy entered an expansion period, we found that the JGTTRA fiscal  relief payments likely helped resolve ongoing state budgetary problems.", "Some prior federal fiscal assistance strategies have included use of  existing grant programs to deliver assistance to states. This approach has  the advantage of targeting funding to reflect federal policy priorities while  avoiding the delays involved in establishing and implementing entirely new  programs. For example, an amendment to the Comprehensive  Employment and Training Act of 1973 (CETA) created Title VI, Emergency  Jobs Programs (Title VI), which provided federal fiscal assistance in  response to the recession that began in 1973. Title VI adapted the existing  CETA federal jobs program to mitigate cyclical unemployment by  providing funding to temporarily hire employees in federal, state, and local  governments. While policy analysts found that Title VI provided visible and  useful services to communities and fiscal relief to some localities, they  also found that there were unintended consequences resulting from  implementation of the program. According to our prior work, and the  work of others, these consequences included the practice by some state  governments of laying off current employees and later rehiring the same  employees using Title VI funds, instead of using their existing state  government funds.", "The federal government\u2019s responses to the recessions beginning in March  2001 and December 2007 provide recent examples of the use of existing  grant structures to expedite the implementation of fiscal assistance. The  federal response to both recessions included temporarily increasing the  rate at which states are reimbursed for Medicaid expenditures through an  increase to the existing Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP)  formula. Both JGTRRA and the Recovery Act distributed increased FMAP  funds to states through the existing Medicaid payment management  system. We have reported that increased FMAP funds provided by the  Recovery Act were better timed and targeted for state Medicaid needs  than funds provided following the 2001 national recession. Overall, the  timing of the initial provision of Recovery Act funds responded to state  Medicaid needs because assistance began during the 2007 national  recession while nearly all states were experiencing Medicaid enrollment  increases and revenue decreases. However, state budget officials also  referred to the temporary nature of the funds and the fiscal challenges  expected to extend beyond the timing of funds provided by the Recovery  Act. Officials discussed a desire to avoid what they referred to as the \u201ccliff  effect\u201d associated with the dates when the funding ends. The increased  FMAP funds provided by the Recovery Act were well targeted for state  Medicaid enrollment growth based on changes in state unemployment  rates. However, the Recovery Act did not allocate assistance based on  state variation in the ability to generate revenue. As a result, the increased  FMAP funding did not reflect varying degrees of decreased revenue that  states had for maintaining Medicaid service. The increased FMAP funds  provided to states following the 2001 recession were provided well after  the recession ended and not targeted based on need.", "The Recovery Act also increased funding for other existing grant programs  to provide fiscal assistance to state and local governments. For example,  the Recovery Act provided an additional $2 billion in funds for the Edward  Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) Program. Consistent with  the pre-existing program, states and localities could use their Recovery  Act JAG grant funds over a period of 4 years to support a range of  activities in seven broad statutorily established program areas including  law enforcement, crime prevention, and corrections. In a recent report, we  found that of the states we reviewed, all reported using Recovery Act JAG  funds to prevent cuts in staff, programs, or essential services. Recipients  of Recovery Act JAG funding received their money in one of two ways\u2014 either as a direct payment from the Bureau of Justice Assistance or as a  pass-through from a state administering agency (SAA)\u2014and they reported  using their funds primarily for law enforcement and corrections. Localities  and SAAs that received funds directly from the Department of Justice  expended their awards at varying rates, and the expenditure of Recovery  Act JAG funds generally lagged behind the funds awarded by the SAAs.", "Federal fiscal assistance using existing grant programs can also result in  the unintended consequence of hindering the countercyclical intent of the  particular assistance program. This can occur because funds flow to states  through existing funding formulas typically established for purposes other  than providing federal fiscal assistance in response to a national recession.  For example, in the case of Medicaid, the regular (base) FMAP formula is  based on a 3-year average of a state\u2019s per capita income (PCI) relative to  U.S. per capita income. PCI does not account for current economic  conditions in states, as lags in computing PCI and implementing regular  (base) FMAP rates mean that the FMAP rates reflect economic conditions  that existed several years earlier. In the case of Recovery Act JAG  funding, the Bureau of Justice Assistance allocated Recovery Act JAG  funds the same way it allocated non-Recovery Act JAG funds by  combining a statutory formula determined by states\u2019 populations and  violent crime statistics with the statutory minimum allocation to ensure  that each state and eligible territory received some funding. This approach  offers expedience by relying on the existing formula. However, the  purpose of the formula does not take into account states\u2019 fiscal  circumstances during national recessions.", "Prior federal fiscal assistance provided for specific purposes has also  included funding for new grant programs. For example, the Recovery Act  created a new program, the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund (SFSF), in part  to help state and local governments stabilize their budgets by minimizing  budgetary cuts in education and other essential government services, such  as public safety. SFSF funds for education distributed under the Recovery  Act had to first be used to alleviate shortfalls in state support for  education to local education agencies and public institutions of higher  education. States had to use 81.8 percent of their SFSF formula grant  funds to support education and use the remaining 18.2 percent to fund a  variety of educational or noneducational entities including state police  forces, fire departments, corrections departments, and health care  facilities and hospitals. In our prior work, we found budget debates at the  state level delayed the initial allocation of education-related funds in some  states.", "In contrast to these approaches to providing fiscal assistance, in three of  the six recessions since 1974, the federal government did not provide fiscal  assistance directly to state and local governments (Jan. to July 1980, July  1981 to Nov. 1982, and July 1990 to March 1991). Our prior report has  noted that by providing state and local governments with fiscal assistance  during downturns, the federal government may risk discouraging states  from taking the actions necessary to prepare themselves for the fiscal  pressures associated with future recessions. Other analysts have  suggested that a recession provides state and local officials with an  opportunity for cutting back inefficient operations. If the federal  government immediately steps in with fiscal assistance, such an  opportunity may be lost. Consequently, policymakers could respond to a  future recession by deciding that the federal government should  encourage state and local government accountability for their own fiscal  circumstances by not providing federal fiscal assistance.", "As a possible alternative to direct federal fiscal assistance to state  governments, policy analysts have also considered the concept of a  federally sponsored tool to help states prepare for future recessions. We  previously discussed proposals for other new programs that would help  states respond to recessions but may not provide direct federal fiscal  assistance. Examples of these proposed strategies include a national rainy  day fund and an intergovernmental loan program that would help states  cope with economic downturns by having greater autonomy over their  receipt of federal assistance. None of these options have been included in  federal fiscal assistance legislation to date.", "A national rainy day fund would require individual state governments to  pay into a fund that would assist states during economic downturns, while  a quasigovernmental agency would administer the fund. The concept of a  national rainy day fund is based on establishing a national risk pool to  provide countercyclical assistance to states during economic downturns.  The national rainy day fund could be modeled on the private  unemployment compensation trust fund in that states would be given  experience ratings that would require larger contributions based on their  individual experience using their own rainy day funds. Proponents of the  national rainy day fund argue that it could reduce state governments\u2019 fiscal  uncertainty by allowing states to use national rainy day funds instead of  raising taxes or modifying or cutting programs. An intergovernmental loan  program could be an alternative to a national rainy day fund program. The  funding for such a loan program could come from either the federal  government or from the private capital market, and it could be subsidized  and possibly guaranteed by the federal government.", "These alternative strategies to direct federal fiscal assistance to state  governments face several design and implementation challenges.  Convincing each state to fully fund its required contribution would be an  initial challenge to the viability of a national rainy day program. With  regard to an intergovernmental loan program, such a program could also  delay state governments\u2019 budget decisions, as states may need to dedicate  portions of future budgets to pay for interest on loans. Determining the  appropriate amount of money each state should pay into a national rainy  day fund and controlling the risk and cost of any direct intergovernmental  loan program would present additional challenges. In addition,  representatives from the state organizations and think tanks we spoke  with told us they did not see proposals for a national rainy day fund or  intergovernmental loan programs as politically feasible. The skepticism  regarding these programs included concerns such as accountability issues  with a national rainy day program, as well as issues with states\u2019 ability to  pay back loan interest in a program patterned after the unemployment  insurance trust fund.", "We are sending copies of this report to interested congressional  committees.

We  considered indicators\u2019 availability at the state level and timeliness (in  terms of frequency and publication lag time) to identify indicators  policymakers could potentially use to target and time countercyclical  federal assistance during downturns. We used several decision rules to  assess indicators\u2019 availability and timeliness. In terms of availability,  indicators created by private sources were excluded because they may be  available only for a fee, may not produce the data in the future, or th methodology may be proprietary, making analysis of the data\u2019s reliability  difficult. In terms of timeliness, we selected indicators that were publish at least quarterly and with less than a 6-month publication lag. Quarterly  publication ensures the indicator covers time periods that are shorter th the length of the typical economic downturn, as indicators that cover mor than 3 months may not be able to differentiate between phases of the  business cycle. We selected indicators with a relatively short publication  lag because indicators with publication lags greater than 6 months may not reveal the downturn until it is already over and the recovery has begun.  For example, we did not include Treasury\u2019s total taxable resources\u2014a  measure of states\u2019 relative fiscal capacity\u2014as a potential indicator  because it is available on an annual basis with a 3-year lag.  s\u2019  We also excluded indicators that may be influenced by state government policy choices.

We excluded state governments\u2019 tax receipts from the tbecause this measure is heavily dependent on and reflects policy decisions within each state.
