CMS, however, exceeded its authority when it allowed 29 of the 33 plans in the second demonstration, the Medicare PPO Demonstration, to cover certain services, such as skilled nursing, home health, and routine physical examinations, only if beneficiaries obtained them from the plans' network providers. In general, beneficiaries in Medicare PPO Demonstration plans who received care from non-network providers for these services were liable for the full cost of their care. The demonstration PPOs attracted relatively few enrollees and did little to expand Medicare beneficiaries' access to private health plans. About 98,000, or less than 1 percent, of the 10.1 million eligible Medicare beneficiaries living in counties where demonstration PPOs operated had enrolled in the demonstration PPOs by October 2003. Further, although one of the goals of the Medicare PPO Demonstration was to attract beneficiaries from traditional FFS Medicare and Medigap plans, only 26 percent of enrollees in its plans came from FFS Medicare, with all others coming from M+C plans. About 9.9 million, or 98 percent, of the 10.1 million eligible Medicare beneficiaries also had M+C plans available in their counties. Virtually no enrollment occurred in counties where only demonstration PPOs operated. According to CMS's 2003 estimates, on average demonstration PPO enrollees could have expected to incur total out-of-pocket costs--expenses for premiums, cost sharing and noncovered items and services--that were the same or higher than those they would have incurred with nearly all other types of Medicare coverage. However, relative costs by type of coverage varied somewhat depending on beneficiary health status. For certain services and items, such as prescription drugs and inpatient hospitalization, demonstration plans provided better benefits relative to some other types of Medicare coverage. Although it is too early to determine the actual program costs of the two demonstrations, CMS originally projected that the first demonstration would increase Medicare spending by $750 per enrollee per year and the second demonstration would increase Medicare spending by $652 per enrollee per year. Based on the agency's original enrollment projections, which exceed 2003 actual enrollment, CMS estimated the demonstration PPOs would increase program spending by $100 million for 2002 and 2003 combined."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In recent years, concerns have been raised that Medicare beneficiaries  lack access to the type of health plan that is most prevalent in the private  health insurance market, the preferred provider organization (PPO). In  2003, only six PPOs\u2014plans that allow enrollees to obtain care from any  provider, but charge enrollees less if they obtain care from the plans\u2019  networks of preferred providers\u2014participated in Medicare\u2019s program for  private health plans, known as Medicare+Choice (M+C). About 3,000 of  Medicare\u2019s 41 million beneficiaries were enrolled in the six M+C PPOs. In  contrast, 4.6 million Medicare beneficiaries were enrolled in 142 M+C  health maintenance organization (HMO) plans, which generally require  enrollees to obtain all covered services from the plans\u2019 networks of  providers. The vast majority of Medicare beneficiaries, about 35.6 million,  were not enrolled in private health plans participating in Medicare, but  rather were enrolled in the traditional fee-for-service (FFS) program, in  which they could obtain care from any Medicare provider. The percentage  of Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in traditional FFS Medicare has  increased in recent years, rising from 83 percent in 1998 to 87 percent in  2003\u2014as the total number of private plans participating in M+C declined,  and their benefit packages grew less generous.", "The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the agency that  administers Medicare, has authority under section 402(a) of the Social  Security Amendments of 1967 to conduct demonstration programs to test  methods of payment that have the potential to increase the efficiency and  economy of Medicare. CMS is authorized to waive Medicare payment  rules under the demonstrations, which may result in increased Medicare  spending. CMS used this statutory authority to initiate two demonstration  programs that included health plans designed to operate under the PPO  model. In January 2002, CMS began the M+C Alternative Payment  Demonstration, which was intended to encourage certain M+C plans to  remain in the Medicare program. One PPO, Independence Blue Cross,  participated in 2003. In January 2003, CMS began a second demonstration,  known as the Medicare PPO Demonstration, that included 33 plans. The  goals of this demonstration were to encourage plans to participate in the  Medicare program under the PPO model, extend beneficiary access to  private health plans, and provide a health plan option that would attract  beneficiaries from FFS Medicare and Medigap plans. Subsequent to the  start of these two demonstrations, Congress passed the Medicare  Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA),  which revised Medicare\u2019s program for private plans and provided for a  new PPO component to begin in 2006.", "Because the experience gained through the two demonstrations may help  guide future efforts to incorporate private plans into Medicare, you asked  us to study the demonstrations\u2019 implementation and outcomes as they  pertain to PPOs. Specifically, we (1) described how CMS used its statutory  authority to conduct the two demonstrations; (2) assessed the extent to  which demonstration PPOs expanded access to Medicare health plans and  attracted enrollees in 2003; (3) compared CMS\u2019s estimates of the out-of- pocket costs beneficiaries incurred in demonstration PPOs with those of  other types of coverage, including FFS Medicare, M+C plans, and Medigap  policies in 2003; and (4) determined the effects of demonstration PPOs on  Medicare spending prior to the passage of MMA.", "To describe CMS\u2019s statutory authority to conduct demonstrations, we  reviewed applicable federal law and regulations.

Appendix I contains our legal analysis on the Medicare PPO  Demonstration plans\u2019 restriction of enrollees\u2019 choice of providers. To  assess health plan participation and enrollment, we used CMS\u2019s monthly  reports on Medicare\u2019s private health plans, as well as historical enrollment  data for demonstration PPO enrollees provided by CMS\u2019s Office of  Research, Development, and Information (ORDI), which oversees the  demonstrations. To compare beneficiary out-of-pocket costs between  demonstration PPOs, M+C plans, Medigap policies, and FFS Medicare in  2003, we used estimates generated for CMS by Fu Associates, Ltd. (Fu), a  private firm. CMS includes these estimates on the Medicare Web site,  www.Medicare.gov, as a tool to help beneficiaries evaluate their coverage  options. We conducted these comparisons for beneficiaries aged 65  through 69, the age group most likely to join M+C plans, in the 41 counties  with approximately 90 percent of the enrollment in demonstration PPOs.  We analyzed the reliability of CMS\u2019s enrollment data and estimates by  conducting interviews with CMS\u2019s Office of the Actuary (OACT), ORDI,  and Fu and determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for our  purposes. To determine the effects of demonstration PPOs on Medicare  spending, we used projections developed by OACT and conducted  interviews with OACT staff. For all four objectives, we interviewed ORDI  and OACT staff and reviewed relevant CMS materials. Appendix II  contains a complete description of our methodology.

From 1998 through 2003, M+C,  Medicare\u2019s private health plan program, allowed participation by a variety  of plan types, including HMOs, PPOs, and PFFS plans, as long as these  plans met certain organizational and operational requirements.

For example, Medicare requires beneficiaries to pay a deductible  for each hospital benefit period, which was $840 in 2003, and covers a  maximum of 90 days per benefit period.  Medicare part B helps pay for  selected physician, outpatient hospital, laboratory, and other services.  Enrollment in part B is voluntary and requires a beneficiary to pay a  monthly premium and an annual deductible for most types of part B  services \u2014 $58.70 and $100, respectively, in 2003 \u2013 and may require  coinsurance of up to 50 percent for some services.

Although many employers do  not offer supplemental health insurance to their retirees, Medigap policies  are available nationwide. In most states, Medigap policies are organized  into 10 standardized plans offering varying levels of supplemental  coverage. Medigap plan F is the plan most widely selected by  beneficiaries, although it does not offer prescription drug coverage;  Medigap plan I offers similar coverage but includes some coverage for  prescription drugs. Beneficiaries with Medigap policies receive coverage  for services from any provider who is legally authorized to provide  Medicare services.", "Most beneficiaries may also obtain more comprehensive coverage by  choosing to receive Medicare benefits through private health plans that  participate in Medicare instead of through FFS Medicare. While private  Medicare health plans are not available nationwide, about 80 percent of  beneficiaries in 2003 had access to at least one plan within the counties  where they lived. Beneficiaries who enroll in a private plan may pay a  monthly premium, in addition to the Medicare part B premium, and agree  to receive their Medicare-covered benefits, except hospice, through the  plan. In return, beneficiaries may receive additional non-Medicare benefits  and may be subject to reduced cost sharing for Medicare-covered  benefits.

Previously, private plan participation in Medicare had  been largely limited to HMOs. The M+C program provided the opportunity  for PPOs and PFFS plans to serve beneficiaries as well. Generally, M+C  plan types differed by the extent to which they used provider networks.  M+C HMOs were required to maintain networks of providers, and they  generally covered services furnished only by providers in their networks,  except in limited circumstances such as urgent or emergency situations.  (See table 1.) M+C PPOs were also required to maintain provider  networks. Unlike M+C HMOs, M+C PPOs were required to pay for covered  services obtained from non-network providers, although they could charge  beneficiaries additional cost sharing for these services. A third type of  M+C plan, the PFFS plan, was not required to maintain provider networks.  Rather, M+C PFFS plans were required to pay for all covered services  obtained from any provider authorized to furnish Medicare-covered  services who accepted the plan\u2019s terms and conditions of payment.", "While many M+C requirements were uniform across the different types of  plans, two categories of requirements varied by the type of plan: those that  were intended to ensure that enrollees had sufficient and timely access to  covered services, known as access-to-services requirements, and those  that were intended to ensure that services furnished were of sufficient  quality, known as quality assurance requirements. (See table 2.) In general,  plans that restricted enrollees to provider networks were subject to more  extensive access-to-services and quality assurance requirements than  those that did not. Accordingly, M+C HMO plans were subject to more  extensive quality assurance and access-to-services requirements than M+C  PFFS plans. M+C PPOs were subject to the more extensive access-to- services requirements of M+C HMOs, but the less extensive quality  assurance requirements of PFFS plans. For example, in order to  demonstrate that they provided sufficient access to services, M+C HMOs  and M+C PPOs were required to monitor and document the timeliness of  the care their enrollees received from providers, while M+C PFFS plans  were not required to monitor care in this way. With regard to quality  assurance, M+C HMOs each year had to initiate a multi-year quality  improvement project, such as a provider or enrollee education program,  while M+C PPOs and M+C PFFS plans were not subject to this  requirement.", "M+C HMOs, M+C PPOs, and M+C PFFS plans all were paid a monthly  payment per enrollee according to a statutory formula. The M+C payment  rate varied by county and could be higher or lower than FFS Medicare\u2019s  per capita spending in a county. An M+C plan was at full risk for the costs  of covered services for its enrollees.

A plan\u2019s ability to receive the higher of the M+C rate or FFS-based rate  could substantially increase its payment rates, depending on the counties  it served. In 44 of the 214 counties where the plans in the Medicare PPO  Demonstration were available in 2003, the FFS-based rate ranged from  approximately 0.3 percent to 15.1 percent higher than the M+C payment  rate. For example, in Clark County, Nevada, the FFS-based rate was  $635.79, or 5.6 percent higher than the M+C payment rate of $599.95.", "CMS also used its waiver authority to allow Independence Blue Cross and  the plans in the Medicare PPO Demonstration to reduce their financial risk  through risk-sharing agreements. Risk-sharing agreements were not  available to non-demonstration M+C plans, which were required to accept  full financial risk for the cost of providing covered services to their  enrollees. For contract year 2003, CMS signed risk-sharing agreements  with 13 organizations offering a total of 29 plans. The terms of the  agreements varied. Each agreement specified an expected \u201cmedical loss  ratio\u201d (MLR), the percentage of a plan\u2019s annual revenue (comprised of  monthly payments from CMS and any enrollee premiums) that would be  spent on medical expenses. Generally, plans could designate the remaining  percentage of revenue for administrative expenses, profit, and other  contingencies. For the 12 organizations in the Medicare PPO  Demonstration that had risk-sharing agreements with CMS, medical  expenses represented a median 87 percent of plan revenue. CMS agreed to  share a designated percentage, negotiated separately with each plan, of  any difference between the plan\u2019s actual MLR and the expected MLR that  fell outside a range around the expected MLR, known as a risk corridor.  For each plan, the designated percentage with which it would share risk  with CMS was identical whether the actual MLR was greater or lower than  the expected MLR.", "For example, a plan\u2019s contract might have specified an MLR of 87 percent,  a percentage of shared risk of 50 percent, and a risk corridor of 2 percent  above and below the expected MLR (See fig. 1.) If that plan\u2019s actual  medical expenses exceeded 89 percent of its revenue, CMS would pay the  plan 50 percent of the amount by which the actual MLR exceeded 89  percent. If the plan\u2019s actual MLR was lower than 85 percent of its revenue,  the plan would pay CMS 50 percent of the amount that the actual MLR fell  below 85 percent.", "In order to allow organizations with HMO licenses to offer PPO-model  health plans without having to meet the more stringent quality assurance  requirements of M+C HMOs, CMS had organizations sign PFFS contracts  and also waived certain M+C payment requirements. Of the 33 plans in the  Medicare PPO Demonstration, 13 were offered by organizations with HMO  licenses. Under M+C requirements, a PPO offered by an organization  licensed as an HMO would have to adhere to the more stringent quality  assurance standards applicable to HMOs. CMS indicated that it could  permit licensed HMOs to establish PPO-type networks without being  subject to the more stringent quality assurance requirements applicable to  HMOs by structuring their plans as PFFS plans. CMS contracted with all  plans participating in the Medicare PPO Demonstration as M+C PFFS  plans because M+C did not prohibit organizations licensed as HMOs from  offering PFFS plans. Although M+C requires PFFS plans to pay each class  of provider uniformly, CMS waived this payment-related requirement,  thereby enabling these plans to establish provider networks by paying  providers differently depending on whether they belonged to their  networks.", "CMS also waived the M+C limits on beneficiary cost sharing. An M+C plan  may set beneficiary cost-sharing requirements that differ from those in  FFS Medicare, but these requirements are subject to statutory limits that  vary by plan type. For example, under M+C rules for PFFS plans, the  actuarial value, or estimated dollar value, of the cost-sharing requirements  for benefits that CMS requires the plans to cover could not exceed the  actuarial value of cost-sharing requirements in FFS Medicare, which was  about $1,200 annually per beneficiary in 2003.

CMS also allowed  plans in the Medicare PPO Demonstration to require, as a condition of  coverage for certain services, that enrollees obtain care for those services  only from network providers.

CMS also expressed general concern about the tone of the  report and said that beneficiaries benefit from increased access to PPOs.  The agency stated that lessons learned from the Medicare PPO  Demonstration will help the agency implement the new Medicare  Advantage regional PPO plan option in 2006. CMS\u2019s specific comments  largely fell into four areas: the report\u2019s focus on initial demonstration  outcomes, the inclusion of the PPO plan in the M+C Alternative Payment  Demonstration in the analysis, the methodology and data we used to  illustrate potential out-of-pocket costs for the options available to  beneficiaries, and the discussion of our conclusion that CMS exceeded its  statutory authority with respect to the Medicare PPO Demonstration. A  summary of CMS\u2019s specific comments and our evaluation is provided  below. The full text of CMS\u2019s written comments is reprinted in appendix  III. The agency also provided technical comments, which we incorporated  as appropriate.", "First, CMS stated that the report, by focusing on the Medicare PPO  Demonstration\u2019s initial outcomes, did not adequately present the context  and value of the demonstration. CMS said that the demonstration is an  experiment designed to increase availability of the PPO model in the  Medicare setting, and that it will provide valuable lessons for nationwide  implementation of the new Medicare Advantage regional PPO component  in 2006. Because the demonstration was not intended to be a fully  developed program, CMS felt that our characterization of enrollment as  \u201clow\u201d was unwarranted. CMS also stated that the financial arrangements  developed for this demonstration, such as the risk-sharing agreements,  were intended to encourage plans to participate, and they provide an  example of how Medicare can encourage PPOs to enter and remain in the  new Medicare Advantage program.", "We were asked to evaluate the initial experience of demonstration plans  operating under the PPO model because this experience could help inform  future efforts to incorporate private plans into Medicare. We state in the  report that our findings apply only to 2003, the first year of the Medicare  PPO Demonstration and the second year of the M+C Alternative Payment  Demonstration. We based our evaluation on enrollment in demonstration  PPOs, the out-of-pocket costs Medicare beneficiaries could expect in  demonstration PPOs relative to other types of coverage, and the effect of  demonstration PPOs on Medicare spending. Overall, we found that less  than 1 percent of the beneficiaries living in counties where demonstration  PPOs operated had enrolled in demonstration PPOs, that most of the  enrollees came from M+C plans, and that demonstration PPOs did not  offer lower estimated out-of-pocket costs than most other types of  Medicare coverage, even if beneficiaries obtained services only from  network providers. PPO plans in the demonstrations could receive higher  payment rates and be subject to less financial risk, relative to M+C plans.  We acknowledge that the demonstrations are continuing and that CMS has  contracted for independent evaluations of the demonstrations.", "Second, CMS stated that the inclusion of the Independence Blue Cross  PPO from the M+C Alternative Payment Demonstration, along with the  plans from the Medicare PPO Demonstration, was potentially confusing  and did not adequately distinguish the different objectives of the two  separate demonstrations. According to CMS, the purpose of the M+C  Alternative Payment Demonstration was simply to prevent health plans  from leaving the M+C program by offering alternative payment  arrangements. Furthermore, CMS stated that the demonstration was not  designed to encourage alternative delivery systems in general or the PPO  model specifically, and that Independence Blue Cross\u2019s status as a PPO  was irrelevant.", "We thought it appropriate to evaluate the Independence Blue Cross plan  and the Medicare PPO Demonstration plans together because the plan  types were similar and because the demonstrations were conducted under  the same statutory authority. Independence Blue Cross and the Medicare  PPO Demonstration plans all operate under the PPO model, and in that  sense the plans in the two demonstrations are indistinguishable to  beneficiaries. While the purposes of the M+C Alternative Payment  Demonstration and the Medicare PPO Demonstration differed, as our  report states, CMS used the same statutory authority to conduct both  demonstrations. This authority permits demonstrations that are designed  to identify whether changes in methods of payment or reimbursement in  Medicare would increase the efficiency and economy of the program  without adversely affecting the quality of services. CMS\u2019s characterization  in its comments of the purpose of the M+C Alternative Payment  Demonstration appears to be inconsistent with the statutory authority.", "Third, CMS expressed concerns with the methodology and data we used to  compare the out-of-pocket costs beneficiaries could expect to incur in  demonstration PPOs with those they could expect to incur with other  types of Medicare coverage. In CMS\u2019s opinion, our comparison was  hypothetical because it was based on estimates of enrollees\u2019 utilization of  services, not actual utilization of services, and potentially unreliable  because it may not account for regional variation in health care costs. CMS  also stated that our findings for Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 to 69 may  not be applicable for older beneficiaries. Finally, CMS stated that including  Horizon Healthcare of New Jersey in our analysis may have skewed our  calculations because it had the largest in-network deductible for inpatient  hospital services of all demonstration PPOs.", "Our out-of-pocket cost comparisons used the same estimates that CMS  makes available on the Medicare Web site through the Medicare Personal  Plan Finder (MPPF), which is intended to help beneficiaries compare their  health coverage options. These estimates, developed by Fu for CMS,  enabled us to compare out-of-pocket costs among various types of  coverage for beneficiaries of various ages and health statuses, which  actual utilization data would not have enabled us to do. Fu developed  these estimates by applying utilization and spending data from the  Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS), a national sample of  beneficiaries, to the 2003 benefit packages and premiums offered locally  by various types of Medicare coverage. Therefore, the estimates for all  types of coverage were derived consistently. If utilization and spending in  our sample were higher than the national average, then actual out-of- pocket costs would have been higher than those we estimated; however,  the relative differences between the types of coverage\u2014which form the  basis for our finding\u2014would be expected to be similar. In conducting our  comparisons, we sought to capture the typical plan options available to all  eligible Medicare beneficiaries\u2014not only PPO enrollees\u2014residing in areas  with demonstration PPOs. To capture the typical plan option in these  areas, we chose a sample of 41 counties containing 90 percent of  enrollment in demonstration PPOs and weighted our calculations by the  number of eligible beneficiaries residing in each county. Horizon  Healthcare of New Jersey remained in our analysis because Horizon\u2019s  demonstration PPO plan was available to 32 percent of all eligible  beneficiaries in these 41 counties in December of 2003. We presented  results for beneficiaries aged 65 to 69, the largest of the six Medicare age  groups for which Fu calculated out-of-pocket cost estimates. We also  conducted our comparison on a substantially older age group\u2014 beneficiaries aged 80 to 84\u2014and found similar results.", "Fourth, CMS stated that our legal finding\u2014that the agency exceeded its  authority by allowing plans in the Medicare PPO Demonstration to cover  certain services only if beneficiaries obtained them from the plans\u2019  network providers\u2014should be discussed in the context of the  demonstration\u2019s objectives. The agency agreed with our recommendation  that Medicare PPO Demonstration plan participants be instructed to  remove impermissible restrictions on enrollees\u2019 access to providers for all  covered plan benefits, and not just those covered under parts A and B, but  did not provide a date by which the recommendation would be fully  effectuated. CMS stated, however, that the legal finding needed to be  viewed in the context of the policies the agency intended to advance  through the Medicare PPO Demonstration. CMS reiterated many of the  factors that it believes discouraged the offering of PPO plans in the M+C  program, and said that the agency wanted to provide flexibility in the  demonstration in order to facilitate participation by plans. CMS indicated  that it had taken sufficient measures during the Medicare PPO  Demonstration qualification process to ensure that all demonstration plans  provided enrollees with adequate access to network providers for all  covered services, and all plans were required to offer some out-of-network  coverage. In addition, the agency indicated that all PPO plans were  required to provide full disclosure to enrollees concerning the costs for in- network and out-of-network services.", "CMS had already identified for us many of the reasons that led it to  implement the Medicare PPO Demonstration in the manner in which it did,  and we included them in this report. The context within which CMS  believes the legal finding must be placed is not relevant to the issue of  whether CMS exceeded its authority. The waiver authority at issue is  limited, and its use must conform to those limits. CMS\u2019s reiteration of the  policy objectives the demonstration was intended to achieve, its  explanations for why some plans did not cover all plan services out of  network, and its discussion of the measures that it took to ensure  adequate access to services and enrollee education are not relevant  considerations and do not make CMS\u2019s actions any less unlawful.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Administrator of CMS and  appropriate congressional committees.

In general, M+C organizations must provide  coverage for all services that are covered under parts A and B of  Medicare. M+C organizations also may include coverage for other health  care services that are not covered under parts A and B of Medicare. They  may satisfy their coverage obligations by furnishing services themselves,  arranging for enrollees to receive services through contracts with  providers, or by reimbursing providers who furnish services to enrollees.", "Section 1851(a)(2) of the act authorizes several types of M+C plans, two of  which are relevant to the Medicare PPO Demonstration: \u201ccoordinated care  plans\u201d and \u201cprivate fee-for-service plans.\u201d M+C coordinated care plans  include health maintenance organization (HMO) plans, with or without  point of service options, and PPO plans. As defined by CMS, coordinated  care plans have a CMS-approved network of providers under contract or  arrangement with the M+C organization to deliver health care to  enrollees. M+C organizations offering coordinated care plans may specify  the network of providers from whom enrollees may receive services if  they demonstrate that all covered services are available and accessible  under the plan. Unlike most other coordinated care plans, PPO plans must  provide coverage for all covered benefits out of network. Generally, PPO  plans require enrollees to pay additional costs for services furnished by  providers outside the network.", "Section 1859(b)(2) of the Social Security Act defines the term \u201cprivate fee- for-service plan\u201d for purposes of the M+C program. As defined, private fee- for-service plans are required to reimburse hospitals and other providers  on a fee-for-service basis without placing the providers at financial risk.  These plans may not vary the amounts paid based on the number or  volume of services they provide. Moreover, in contrast to coordinated  care plans, private fee-for-service plans are not required to have networks  of providers; instead they must allow enrollees to obtain covered services  from any provider who is lawfully authorized to provide them and who  agrees to the terms and conditions of payment, regardless of whether the  provider has a written contract with the plan to furnish services to  enrollees.", "While many of the statutory and regulatory requirements governing M+C  plans are similar, others vary by plan type. M+C organizations generally  must be licensed as \u201crisk-bearing entities\u201d by the states where they offer  M+C plans. HMO plans and most other coordinated care plans, however,  are subject to more stringent quality assurance requirements than PPO and  private fee-for-service plans. For example, HMO plans are required by  statute to implement programs to improve quality and assess the  effectiveness of such programs through systemic follow-up and to make  information on quality and outcomes measures available to beneficiaries  to facilitate comparisons among health care options. These requirements  do not apply to private fee-for-service and PPO plans. HMO plans, as well  as other coordinated care plans, are also held to more extensive access  requirements than private fee-for-service plans to ensure timely access to  care. Finally, although M+C PPO plans generally are held to less stringent  quality assurance standards than other coordinated care plans, M+C  organizations licensed as HMOs that offer M+C PPO plans may not avail  themselves of the less stringent quality assurance standards applicable to  M+C PPOs.

Section 402(b) authorizes CMS to waive requirements related to payment  or reimbursement for providers, services, and other items for purposes of  demonstration projects, but does not authorize the agency to waive  requirements unrelated to payment or reimbursement. Section 402(b)  also authorizes CMS to pay costs in excess of those that would ordinarily  be payable or reimbursable, to the extent that the waiver applies to these  excess costs.", "According to CMS, the agency initiated the 3-year Medicare PPO  Demonstration in January 2003 to make the PPO health care option, which  had been found to be successful in non-Medicare markets, more widely  available to Medicare beneficiaries. Its objective was to introduce more  variety into the M+C program so that Medicare beneficiaries would have  more options available to them. In addition, CMS believed that the PPO  demonstration plans would introduce incentives that would result in more  efficient and cost-effective use of medical services.", "CMS entered into contracts with all demonstration participants. To  facilitate HMO participation in the Medicare PPO Demonstration, CMS  permitted licensed HMOs, as well as all other demonstration participants,  to offer private fee-for-service plans. Exercising its authority under  section 402(b), CMS waived statutory and regulatory payment  requirements applicable to private fee-for-service plans, allowing the  participating organizations to vary the amount of payments among  providers, among other things, so that the plans offered would more  closely resemble PPO plans. As a result, M+C organizations with HMO  licenses were able to establish PPO-type plans and were not subject to the  more stringent quality assurance standards applicable to HMOs and most  other coordinated care plans. The private fee-for-service plan model  contract provided that requirements that were not expressly waived by  CMS would remain in effect during the term of the contract.

That section also provides that the  access standards may not be used to restrict the persons from whom  enrollees may obtain covered services, thus suggesting that private fee-for- service plans are not authorized to limit their enrollees\u2019 selection of  providers, for example, to those within an established \u201cnetwork.\u201d The  definition of the term \u201cprivate fee-for-service plan\u201d at section 1859(b)(2)  echoes this provision, stating that such plans do not restrict the selection  of providers from among those who may lawfully provide covered services  and agree to accept the terms and conditions of payment.", "In 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 422.114(b), we specify that the plan must permit the enrollees to receive  services from any provider that is authorized to provide the service under original  Medicare. This implements that part of section 1852(d)(4) that says that the access  requirements cannot be construed as restricting the persons from whom enrollees of the  M+C private fee-for-service plan may obtain covered services.", "In light of the statutory language and CMS\u2019s interpretation, we conclude  that Medicare PPO Demonstration plan provisions limiting enrollees to  \u201cnetwork\u201d providers are inconsistent with sections 1852(d)(4) and  1859(b)(2) of the act. Because these sections are unrelated to payment,  CMS was not authorized to waive them in connection with the Medicare  PPO Demonstration.", "Further, the plans\u2019 exclusions of coverage for services furnished by \u201cnon- network\u201d providers are incompatible with statutory requirements designed  to ensure quality of care to enrollees in M+C plans. As discussed earlier,  private fee-for-service and PPO plans participating in the M+C program are  held to less stringent quality assurance standards than HMOs and certain  other coordinated care plans. The applicability of less stringent quality  assurance standards is due, in part, to the increased choices enrollees in  private fee-for-service and PPO plans have in comparison to enrollees in  most other types of plans. CMS has expressly recognized this rationale for  the distinction among various types of plans. In connection with an M+C  rulemaking on the matter, CMS responded to a concern that private fee- for-service plan quality assurance requirements were inadequate to protect  enrollees by explaining that quality assurance standards may not be as  important in the case of private fee-for-service plans \u201cin which the enrollee  has complete freedom of choice to use any provider in the country, and is  not limited to a defined network of providers.\u201d CMS\u2019s approval of  restrictions on enrollee choice and simultaneous failure to apply the more  stringent quality standards applicable to HMO and most other coordinated  care plans were inconsistent with the statutory framework under which  M+C plans are required to operate.", "Moreover, while CMS stated that the demonstration was intended to offer  beneficiaries greater choice by encouraging the availability of PPO-type  plans, regulatory provisions applicable to M+C PPO plans would have  precluded demonstration participants from requiring enrollees to obtain  services only from \u201cnetwork\u201d providers as a condition of coverage. CMS  has defined a PPO plan, in part, as a plan that \u201cprovides for reimbursement  for all covered benefits regardless of whether the benefits are provided  within the network of providers.\u201d (Emphasis added). Since this  regulatory provision is not related to payment or reimbursement, section  402(b) of the Social Security Amendments of 1967 would not have  authorized CMS to waive it in connection with the Medicare PPO  Demonstration.", "In its written response to our inquiry about the demonstration, CMS  indicated that the demonstration plans\u2019 conditioning coverage of  \u201cMedicare-covered services\u201d (those services covered under parts A & B of  Medicare) on their being furnished by \u201cnetwork\u201d providers violates  statutory access requirements applicable to private fee-for-service plans.  CMS explained, however, that while it had reviewed all plans to ensure  that services covered by parts A and B of the Medicare program were  covered \u201cin network,\u201d some organizations had indicated that they were  unable to cover certain services \u201cout of network\u201d because of the  complexities associated with determining payment for \u201cout-of-network\u201d  providers. CMS, nevertheless, believed that \u201cthe basic principle of out-of- network access was satisfied\u201d because \u201cthe demonstration products offer  access to most Medicare-covered services.\u201d CMS also denied that it had  waived applicable access requirements, stating that it did not have the  authority to do so.", "CMS indicated that it will instruct demonstration participants that they  must provide out-of-network coverage for all \u201cMedicare-covered services\u201d  in 2005, the third year of the Medicare PPO Demonstration, if they wish to  continue to avail themselves of the quality assurance standards applicable  to private fee-for-service plans. CMS also indicated, however, that it will  not require plans to provide out-of-network coverage for other covered  benefits for which the demonstration plans provide only in-network  coverage. CMS did not provide a legal basis for distinguishing between  Medicare-covered services and other plan services with respect to a  demonstration plan\u2019s obligation to provide \u201cout-of-network\u201d coverage.", "We disagree with CMS\u2019s assertion that it did not waive the statutory  requirements at issue. CMS knowingly permitted organizations  participating in the demonstration to operate in a manner that was  inconsistent with sections 1852(d)(4) and 1859(b)(2) of the Social Security  Act. The agency\u2019s decision to do so achieved a result for demonstration  participants that CMS acknowledges it did not have the authority to  provide. Therefore, we view CMS\u2019s action as tantamount to a waiver.", "We also conclude that all benefits covered under a PPO demonstration  plan, not just services covered under parts A and B, must be covered \u201cout  of network\u201d by demonstration plans. The Social Security Act defines a  private-fee-for service plan, in part, as a \u201cMedicare+Choice plan\u201d that  \u201cdoes not restrict the selection of providers among those who are lawfully  authorized to provide the covered services.\u201d A \u201cMedicare+Choice plan,\u201d  for purposes of the definition of a private fee-for-service plan, is defined,  in part, as \u201chealth benefits coverage offered under a policy, contract, or  plan by a Medicare+Choice organization.\u201d Furthermore, CMS guidance  also provides that enrollees in M+C private fee-for-service plans can obtain  \u201cplan covered health care services from any entity that is authorized to  provide services under parts A and B and who is willing to accept the  plan\u2019s terms and conditions of payment.\u201d The act, therefore, does not  distinguish between Medicare covered services and other covered services  in specifying the private fee-for-service plan\u2019s obligations to cover plan  benefits.", "Section 402(b) of the Social Security Amendments of 1967 provides CMS  with waiver authority, but also limits that authority by providing that the  agency may only waive requirements related to payment or  reimbursement. In connection with the Medicare PPO Demonstration,  CMS overrode the limitation contained in section 402(b), tacitly waiving  statutory provisions unrelated to payment. As a general matter, agencies  may not override statutory limitations on their activities by administrative  action. Therefore, we conclude that CMS\u2019s decision to allow  demonstration participants to restrict enrollees\u2019 access to providers for  any services covered by the plans exceeds its authority and is, therefore,  unlawful."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["This appendix provides additional information on the key aspects of our  analysis.
