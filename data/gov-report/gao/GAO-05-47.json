According to VBA officials, productivity improvements, workload changes, and employee attrition were considered in developing its fiscal year 2005 budget request. While some of these factors were identified in VBA's budget justification, they were not linked to the requested full-time equivalent (FTE) employment levels. Also, VBA's justification did not specifically address its claims processing productivity or how much VBA planned to improve productivity. Finally, VBA does not explain the impacts of VBA budgetary decisions on long-term productivity. VBA officials identified information technology improvements and training programs that could help improve productivity but have been delayed because VBA shifted funding from these initiatives to support higher staffing levels. This was done to help meet VBA's shorter-term goal to improve claims decision timeliness, in particular the Secretary of Veterans Affairs' goal to reduce decision time for rating-related claims to an average of 100 days. More transparent budget justifications would better inform congressional oversight of VBA by making it easier to evaluate whether the agency's budget requests reflect the resources, particularly staffing, needed to achieve expected performance. V BA estimated the number of claims it expects to receive (receipts) in fiscal year 2005 based on historical workload trends, with adjustments for factors that could affect future receipts, notably the impact of legislation allowing some military retirees to concurrently receive Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) disability compensation and military retirement pay. The accuracy of VBA's projections of rating-related receipts for fiscal years 2000 through 2004 was mixed, varying from underprojecting by about 11 percent to overprojecting by about 19 percent. Actual receipts in fiscal year 2004 exceeded VBA's projections. Meanwhile, VBA did not project claims complexity in its fiscal year 2005 budget justification and did not explain how it expected claims complexity to affect its productivity and requested staffing levels. A claim's complexity can be affected by many factors, such as the number and types of disabilities claimed. VBA's budget justification could be improved if the agency explained how changes in complexity affect workload and staffing requirements."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal years 1998 through 2003, the Veterans Benefits Administration  (VBA) added significant numbers of employees to process veterans\u2019  disability compensation and pension benefit claims.

Also, according to VBA, these employees\u2019 increased  proficiency, due to experience and training, will lessen the impact of  attrition of its most experienced employees. In its fiscal year 2004 and  2005 budget justifications, VBA requested funding to support lower  staffing levels than in fiscal year 2003 while maintaining ambitious  performance goals, in particular the Secretary of Veterans Affairs\u2019 goal to  complete rating-related decisions within an average of 100 days.", "At your request, we reviewed the basis for the agency\u2019s estimation of its  disability compensation and pension claims processing staffing needs and  workload levels.

To review  VBA\u2019s estimation of the number of claims it expects to receive (receipts)  in fiscal year 2005, we interviewed VBA officials and reviewed records of  how they developed the receipts estimates for its fiscal year 2005 budget  justification. To assess the accuracy of VBA\u2019s estimates, we compared  original estimates with actual rating-related receipts for fiscal years 2000  through 2004. We also interviewed VBA and Institute for Defense Analyses  (IDA) officials and reviewed documentation on the IDA receipt projection  model.

The claim then goes to a Rating Team, where a Rating Veterans  Service Representative (also known as a Rating Specialist) makes a  decision on the claim, based on the available evidence and VBA\u2019s criteria  for benefit entitlement. VSRs also perform a number of other duties,  including establishing claims files, authorizing payments to beneficiaries  and generating notification letters to claimants, conducting in-person and  telephone contacts with veterans and other claimants, and assisting in the  processing of appeals of claims decisions.", "VBA\u2019s administrative costs, including personnel costs, are funded through  VA\u2019s General Operating Expenses account. VBA, as part of VA\u2019s annual  budget justification, asks for specific amounts for each of its programs,  including compensation and pension programs. Funding is requested to  support an estimated full-time equivalent (FTE) employment level. In  fiscal year 2003, VBA spent about $878 million to administer its  compensation and pension programs. This funding included support for  about 9,350 FTEs.", "From fiscal year 1998 through 2003, staffing levels for VBA\u2019s compensation  and pension programs increased significantly, particularly for staff who  process compensation and pension claims at VBA\u2019s 57 regional offices, as  shown in figure 1 below. In fiscal year 1998, VBA had 6,770 compensation  and pension FTEs; by fiscal year 2003, employment had increased by  about 38 percent to 9,352 FTEs. Compensation and pension FTE levels  rose by about 900 in fiscal years 2001 and 2002. Staffing levels increased  because VBA hired hundreds of new rating specialists and VSRs in  anticipation of a large number of future retirements. Also, these additional  staff helped VBA respond to a sharp drop in the production of rating- related claims decisions in fiscal year 2001. In fiscal year 2002, these  decisions rose from about 481,000 to about 797,000, and to about 827,000  in fiscal year 2003.", "In fiscal year 2003, VBA\u2019s 57 regional offices received about 735,000 rating- related claims from veterans and their families for disability benefits.

In addition, about 90,000 original and reopened claims were filed for  pensions for wartime veterans who have low incomes and are  permanently and totally disabled for reasons not service-connected and  for their survivors.

However, VBA\u2019s budget  justification did not clearly explain how these factors affected its request.  Early in this process, the Compensation and Pension Service makes a  budget request that is reviewed by VBA\u2019s Office of Resource Management,  under the direction of VBA\u2019s Chief Financial Officer and becomes part of  VBA\u2019s total request. VBA\u2019s request eventually becomes part of VA\u2019s overall  budget request, which is submitted to the Office of Management and  Budget (OMB) for review.", "VBA\u2019s fiscal year 2005 budget justification identified a number of  initiatives and projections that could affect its staffing levels. For example,  implementing specialized claims processing teams in VBA\u2019s regional  offices and consolidating pension maintenance work at three regional  offices could affect staffing levels. Also, VBA projected it would receive  more disability compensation claims than in previous years, based on such  factors as the enactment of concurrent receipt legislation in 2003.  Specifically, the fiscal year 2005 budget justification stated that VBA  expected to receive about 65,000 claims because of the enactment of  legislation that allows military retirees with service-connected disabilities  rated at 50 percent or higher to receive both VA disability compensation  and military retirement pay. VBA officials said that this estimate was  included in their negotiations with OMB. Further, VBA noted that it  expects many experienced claims processing staff to leave VBA over the  next several years.", "Despite identifying these factors in its 2005 budget justification, VBA does  not specify how such initiatives and projections will affect the number of  employees it needs to meet its claims processing performance goals. For  example, VBA projected that in fiscal year 2005, the number of original  and reopened compensation claims receipts would increase by about 15  and 10 percent respectively from its fiscal year 2004 estimates, and that  original and reopened pension receipts would decrease by about  2 percent. However, VBA did not specifically identify how these  anticipated workload trends had affected its requested staffing levels or its  expected improvements in productivity. VBA\u2019s reduced staffing request  was consistent with OMB guidance to agencies to assume increased  productivity in their budget requests\u2014for example, to do the same amount  of work with fewer employees. However, the budget justification does not  describe how its FTE staffing requirements are linked to the specific  initiatives and projections that could affect these needs.", "Also, VBA\u2019s fiscal 2005 budget justification provides no specific  information on its compensation and pension claims processing  productivity or on its planned improvements in productivity. VBA  expressed confidence that it can improve productivity enough to meet its  claims processing goals for fiscal year 2005 with fewer employees, despite  a projected increase in the workload of compensation claims. To achieve  expected improvements in timeliness and accuracy with fewer employees,  while receiving more claims for disability compensation, VBA\u2019s claims  processing operations will need to become more productive. However, the  budget justification included no measurement of productivity, nor did it  identify how it planned to achieve the needed productivity improvements.", "Finally, VBA\u2019s fiscal year 2005 budget justification does not explicitly show  the impact of budget decisions to shift funding away from initiatives that  could improve productivity; such decisions were based on VBA\u2019s emphasis  on meeting the Secretary\u2019s 100-day timeliness goal for deciding rating- related claims. According to VBA officials, in fiscal years 2002 and 2003,  nonpayroll funds were shifted to help fund increased FTE employment  levels in VBA regional office Veterans Service Centers, which are  responsible for processing compensation and pension claims. This was  done to increase the number of rating-related claims being decided and to  meet the Secretary\u2019s fiscal year 2003 goals for improving timeliness and  reducing the backlog of undecided claims. For example, VBA used  nonpayroll funds to help support about 300 more FTEs than it had  originally requested for fiscal year 2002, and about 400 more FTEs than it  had originally requested for fiscal year 2003. Specifically, in fiscal year  2002, VBA requested funding for 7,351 compensation and pension FTEs  but reported that it actually used 7,663, and in fiscal year 2003, VBA  originally requested funding for 7,532 FTEs but reported that it actually  used 7,936. According to VBA officials, nonpayroll funds were shifted to  help pay increased payroll costs associated with this higher FTE level. In  addition, the fiscal year 2003 budget request assumed a 2003 pay raise of  2.6 percent, but the actual pay raise was 3.1 percent. VBA\u2019s fiscal year 2004  and 2005 budgets reflect continued efforts to support as many FTEs as  possible through reductions in nonpayroll funding to continue to support  improvements in claims processing timeliness.", "VBA officials identified training and information technology initiatives that  have been delayed because of these cuts in nonpayroll funds. These  include delays in developing new Training and Performance Support  Systems (TPSS) modules and in updating existing TPSS modules to reflect  changes in laws, regulations, and procedures. According to its fiscal year  2005 budget justification, VBA is relying on TPSS to improve productivity  by helping new claims processing employees develop needed proficiency  more quickly and by helping experienced employees maintain their  proficiency. Delays in the progress of TPSS implementation could affect  VBA\u2019s productivity, because existing modules may not be as useful as  revised modules could be, and advanced modules may continue to be  unavailable. VBA requested about $2.6 million for TPSS implementation in  fiscal year 2005, including funding to update some existing modules.  However, VBA did not explain the impact of delays in developing new  training modules and updating existing modules.", "Another delayed initiative that could improve productivity is Virtual VA.  This initiative involves the scanning of paper records into electronic  claims folders. VBA expects efficiency and timeliness to improve when  Virtual VA is fully implemented, in part because electronic claims folders  could be transferred among regional offices more quickly. VBA has  implemented Virtual VA at its three Pension Maintenance Centers.  However, VBA requested fiscal year 2005 funding only to maintain the  existing Virtual VA program and anticipates that funding will not be  available to expand the program beyond the Pension Maintenance  Centers. VBA\u2019s justification stated that full implementation of Virtual VA  would help improve claim processing and identified the need for  additional staff to convert existing paper claims files to electronic format,  such as for document preparation and scanning. However, VBA did not  request these additional staffing resources and did not explain why. The  budget justification stated that VBA expected no improvements in  performance because of implementation of Virtual VA at regional offices in  fiscal year 2005, but it did not identify how much productivity would be  forgone because of VBA\u2019s decision to delay Virtual VA implementation.", "The Congress relies on the budget justification as VBA\u2019s statement of how  it plans to spend the funds it requested. The House and Senate  Appropriations Committees have noted that VA\u2019s budget justification  represents the agency\u2019s budget plan. VA\u2019s authorizing committees also  rely on VBA\u2019s budget justification in conducting their oversight. In  February 2004, both the Senate and House Veterans\u2019 Affairs Committees  held hearings on VA\u2019s fiscal year 2005 budget request. Each committee  then recommended funding levels to its respective Budget Committee. The  Appropriations Committees also conduct oversight of VA through the  annual budget process.

VBA\u2019s revised projection underprojected  by only about 0.5 percent; actual fiscal year 2004 receipts averaged about  64,300 per month.", "VBA is working to improve its ability to project its rating claims workload  by more accurately estimating the number of such claims it will receive. In  June 2000, VBA received the first version of a model for forecasting  original and reopened compensation claims receipts, developed under  contract by the Institute for Defense Analyses. This model factored into its  projections the changing size and demographics of the veteran population.  Specifically, the model used historical claim submission data and  projections of the veteran population to project VBA\u2019s future workload.  Although the model was updated in June 2002, its usefulness is limited by  several factors. For example, it projects only original and reopened  compensation claims and relies on outdated veteran population data.  According to a VBA official, VBA\u2019s workload projections for its budget  justifications were not based on this model, but the results of the model  were used to check VBA\u2019s projections. An expanded model with more  recent information is scheduled to be delivered in December 2004. The  expanded model will project workload for more types of claims, including  all rating-related claims, and will be updated to reflect the 2000 Census.", "VBA did not project the complexity of its rating-related claims in its fiscal  year 2005 budget submission and did not explain the impact of complexity  on productivity and requested staffing levels. VBA has noted that disability  compensation claims have become more complex because veterans are  claiming more service-connected disabilities per claim, and VBA must  make a decision whether each disability is service-connected. Meanwhile,  the Congress and VA have established presumptions of compensation and  pension eligibility that can make some claims less complex. For example,  the Congress and VA have identified several types of disabilities (such as  type II diabetes) as service-connected based on the presumption that  veterans who served in Vietnam were exposed to Agent Orange. Claims  based on these disabilities can be simpler to decide because less evidence  is needed to prove service connection. VBA did not specifically explain the  impact of claims complexity on productivity and staff requirements.", "VBA provided some data on average number of disabilities for completed  compensation claims in its fiscal year 2005 budget justification. However,  these data were based on incomplete information. The average number of  disabilities per claim was based on calendar years 1998 through 2001 data  on completed claims from VBA\u2019s software application for preparing rating  decisions, Rating Board Automation (RBA). According to a VBA official,  the RBA data were incomplete because data on many rating decisions  were not transmitted to VBA\u2019s central database for analysis. For example,  according to a VBA official, employees who were working from home did  not always upload rating information from computer disks into RBA and  send the data to VBA\u2019s central database. Also, because making corrections  to a rating once it had been entered into the central database was  cumbersome, corrections were not always made to the incorrect  information that had been entered in the database. VBA began  implementing a new rating decision preparation package (RBA 2000) in  October 2000. While VBA officials stated that RBA 2000 provides more  complete data on rating decisions, it cannot provide data by the end  product code, which VBA uses to identify types of claims (for example,  original and reopened compensation claims). VBA officials suggested that,  in the future, it could measure issues per claim through its new claims  development software application, MAP-D.

At the same time, VBA expects the  volume of incoming rating-related claims to increase and to lose  experienced claims processing staff to attrition. Nonetheless, VBA  requested a reduction in claims processing staff in fiscal year 2005, on top  of a decrease in fiscal year 2004.
