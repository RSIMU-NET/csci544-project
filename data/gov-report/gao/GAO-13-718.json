As part of  this plan, OMB outlined actions to, among other things, strengthen  agencies\u2019 investment review boards and consolidate federal data  centers. The plan stated that OMB will work with Congress to  consolidate commodity IT spending (e.g., e-mail, data centers,  content management systems, and web infrastructure) to, among  other things, eliminate duplication, under agency Chief Information  Officers.

Accordingly, we recommended that the  agencies utilize existing transparency mechanisms, such as the IT  Dashboard, to report on the results of the department\u2019s efforts to identify  and eliminate, where appropriate, each potentially duplicative investment  we identified, as well as any other duplicative investments. We also  recommended that these agencies, among other things, report on the  progress of their efforts to identify and eliminate duplication.

However, CBP and ICE officials  agreed that the systems do capture common data elements that are  stored in a single, shared database. In addition, in 2007, CBP and ICE  planned to jointly develop the E3 project. Specifically, according to the E3  project charter (dated February 2007) and project plan (dated June 2007),  the goal of the investment was to jointly develop a system to replace the  then legacy booking management system being used at the time by both  agencies. Although ICE subsequently withdrew from the project citing  risks with the intended modernization approach and unique requirements  that would not be addressed by the new system, it was not able to  provide evidence corroborating its concerns with the modernization  approach or an analysis showing that its requirements could not be  satisfied by the new (E3) system. Further, as part of its development of  EAGLE, ICE did assess three alternatives to the legacy booking  management system, including E3 but concluded that adopting E3 also  had significant cost and schedule risks. Nevertheless, ICE was not able to  provide the costs associated with each of the alternatives other than  EAGLE and thus could not corroborate their assessment that EAGLE was  the most viable alternative.", "At DOD, the department had two potentially duplicative investments in  Health Care Tracking and two in Dental Management.
