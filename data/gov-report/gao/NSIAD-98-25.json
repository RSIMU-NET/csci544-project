Over the years, the directive has been revised and is now titled \u201cDepartment of Defense Management Headquarters and Headquarters Support Activities.\u201d", "The directive defines management as exercising oversight, direction, and control of subordinate organizations or units by (1) developing and issuing policies and providing policy guidance; (2) reviewing and evaluating program performance; (3) allocating and distributing resources; or (4) conducting mid- and long-range planning, programming, and budgeting. It defines headquarters support as professional, technical, administrative, or logistic support that is performed in, or provided directly to, a management headquarters. The definition includes both staff support and operating support (such as secretarial or computer support). It excludes specific products or technical and operating-type services that are provided on a DOD- or componentwide basis (such as payroll services) and base operating support functions provided by a host to all tenants.", "The directive includes a list of organizations that DOD classifies as management headquarters and headquarters support activities. This list includes the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD); the Joint Staff; defense agency headquarters; unified command headquarters; international military headquarters; and military department headquarters, including the headquarters of acquisition centers, major commands, and similar Navy organizations. In addition to the listed entities, the directive establishes criteria for DOD components to use in identifying other personnel and organizations that perform management headquarters and headquarters support functions. The directive, as implemented in DOD, requires that DOD annually report to Congress all military and civilian personnel and all budgeted funds for organizations identified under the directive. OSD and the military departments report this data to Congress on four separate budget documents, called PB-22 exhibits.", "Many DOD management headquarters listed in the directive have numerous subordinate noncombat organizations that perform a wide variety of functions, from direct staff support to their parent headquarters to operating military academies. In the Army and Air Force, these types of organizations are called field operating agencies/activities, staff support agencies, or direct reporting units. The Navy has no specific term for these noncombat support activities\u2014at the Department of the Navy level, they are a subset of \u201cEchelon 2\u201d organizations, a generic term for Navy organizations that report to the Secretary of the Navy or the Chief of Naval Operations (OPNAV).", "In the past, we reported that DOD had an incentive to respond to pressures to reduce its management headquarters by transferring personnel to nonmanagement headquarters organizations. We also reported that past efforts to reduce headquarters personnel in OSD and military department headquarters were achieved primarily through transfers of functions and personnel to other organizations.", "Concerned that DOD\u2019s efforts to reduce its infrastructure, including headquarters, have lagged behind the cuts made in operational forces, Congress has taken several actions to reduce headquarters personnel. For example, in 1990, Congress ordered DOD to reduce total personnel assigned to DOD management headquarters and headquarters support activities by 20 percent over 5 years in order to bring the size of headquarters \u201cinto line with\u201d legislated force structure and budgetary reductions.

However, DOD does not report personnel at most of its noncombat organizations that are directly subordinate to management headquarters. In our review of selected subordinate noncombat organizations, we found that almost three-fourths of the organizations were primarily performing management or management support functions and should have been reported to Congress by DOD, using the criteria in DOD Directive 5100.73. Some personnel in these subordinate organizations had been part of headquarters, but they were transferred out of headquarters, or reclassified as nonheadquarters, during periods when Congress mandated that DOD reduce its management headquarters personnel. For example, in 1992 the Air Force removed about 2,000 personnel in its numbered air forces headquarters from reporting under DOD\u2019s management headquarters program.

The Command\u2019s Logistics Directorate is discussing the transfer of this function from the 19th Air Force to the Command\u2019s headquarters, according to a 19th Air Force official."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["Our objectives were to determine (1) the accuracy and reliability of DOD\u2019s reported data on management headquarters and headquarters support personnel and costs, (2) reasons that data on personnel and costs could be inaccurate, and (3) DOD\u2019s plans to reduce the size of its management headquarters and headquarters support activities.", "To determine the accuracy and reliability of certain PB-22 cost data and the completeness of personnel data reported under DOD Directive 5100.73, we selected 10 headquarters to review. We chose organizations from the following categories: Defense-wide headquarters, military department headquarters, and unified command headquarters. Given congressional interest in headquarters in the Washington, D.C., area, we included four of these organizations in our review. To minimize travel costs, we also selected DOD organizations near our available GAO staff in Norfolk, Virginia, and Atlanta, Georgia. The headquarters we reviewed were", "Office of the Secretary of Defense, Pentagon, Arlington, Virginia;", "Army Secretariat and Army Staff, Pentagon, Arlington, Virginia;", "Navy Secretariat and OPNAV, Pentagon, Arlington, Virginia;", "Air Force Secretariat and Air Staff, Pentagon, Arlington, Virginia;", "U.S. Atlantic Command, Norfolk, Virginia;", "Navy\u2019s Commander in Chief, Atlantic Fleet, Norfolk, Virginia;", "U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command, Fort Monroe, Virginia;", "Air Combat Command, Langley Air Force Base, Virginia;", "U.S. Army Forces Command, Fort McPherson, Georgia; and", "Air Education and Training Command, Randolph Air Force Base, Texas In addition to these headquarters, we visited two numbered air forces because our review of DOD records indicated these organizations had been reported as management headquarters, and after a reorganization in the early 1990s, questions remained about the extent of management and headquarters support functions continuing at these organizations. We visited the 12th Air Force, Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Arizona, and the 19th Air Force, collocated with the Air Education and Training Command. As part of our FORSCOM review, we visited one of its subordinate commands, the Army Signal Command, Fort Huachuca, Arizona. This Command had been reported as a management headquarters when it was an independent major command, the Information Systems Command.", "At each of the 10 headquarters organizations we audited, we judgmentally selected subordinate noncombat organizations to review. We selected organizations based on a variety of factors, including the organizations\u2019 names, missions, and functions, and conditions that OSD/DA&M officials agreed may indicate that an organization is providing management support. These indicators, also called \u201cred flags\u201d by OSD/DA&M, are headquarters officials serving additional duty as senior officials in the subordinate organization (called \u201cdual hatting\u201d), transfer of personnel from headquarters to create or augment subordinate organizations, diverse functions that mirror headquarters functions, and collocation of the subordinate organization with its headquarters. Although the presence of one or more of these indicators is not conclusive, it led us to perform the analysis called for in DOD Directive 5100.73. In general, our analysis involved reviewing mission and functions documents, organizational manning documents, and organizational history. We also discussed the organization\u2019s activities, products, services, customers, and relationship with headquarters with cognizant officials in the subordinate organization and in its headquarters. The primary disadvantage to this approach is that our findings cannot be generalized to DOD as a whole or to entire types of DOD organizations because we did not randomly sample the organizations we reviewed. The primary advantage is that we obtained an in-depth understanding of each organization reviewed, which gave us adequate information to judge compliance with DOD Directive 5100.73.", "Both the FYDP and PB-22 exhibits contain errors that make them unreliable for assessing the resources expended by DOD for management headquarters and headquarters support activities. According to DOD Directive 5100.73, program elements (or line items) in the FYDP that end in \u201c98\u201d are reserved exclusively to account for personnel and costs of DOD\u2019s management headquarters and headquarters support activities. In the FYDP, we found costs in \u201c98\u201d program elements that were not related to management headquarters. An official in the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller), who performed her own analysis of these program elements, also found costs unrelated to management headquarters, particularly in Navy and Defense-wide program elements. For PB-22 cost data, we performed a limited check of the data\u2019s accuracy for one fiscal year by comparing the PB-22 data with financial records at the headquarters spending the money. As discussed previously, at many headquarters we found significant discrepancies between costs reported on the PB-22 exhibits and costs incurred by headquarters. With respect to PB-22 personnel data, OSD/DA&M acknowledged that these exhibits contain errors. For example, in the Defense-wide PB-22 exhibit prepared for the President\u2019s budget for fiscal year 1998, OSD did not report the headquarters of five defense agencies that it agrees should have been reported. For the personnel numbers that were reported on the PB-22 exhibits, we did not independently verify their accuracy.", "To determine past and projected trends in DOD\u2019s management headquarters personnel and costs, as reported by DOD, we used annual PB-22 exhibits prepared by OSD and the military departments and submitted to Congress. For management headquarters data beyond fiscal year 1999, we used DOD\u2019s 1998-2003 FYDP.", "To obtain information on plans to reduce the size of DOD\u2019s management headquarters, we interviewed officials in the 10 headquarters organizations we audited and OSD and military service officials who are involved with studies of management headquarters, such as the study called for by the Quadrennial Defense Review report.", "We performed our review from October 1996 to August 1997 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comments From the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Major Contributors to This Report", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "National Security and International Affairs Division, Washington, D.C.", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Atlanta Field Office", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Norfolk Field Office", "paragraphs": ["Joseph A.
