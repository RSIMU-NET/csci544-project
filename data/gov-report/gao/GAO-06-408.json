These weaknesses increase the risk that financial and sensitive information will be inadequately protected against disclosure, modification, or loss, possibly without detection, and place SEC operations at risk of disruption. A key reason for SEC's information security controls weaknesses is that the commission has not fully developed, implemented, or documented key elements of an information security program to ensure that effective controls are established and maintained.

To its credit, SEC set up a backup data  center in a separate contractor facility to replicate its operations center  functionality and has drafted contingency plans for many of its major  applications, so that recovery steps are documented in the event of a  disaster. SEC also conducted a partially successful test to validate the  sufficiency of the plans and assess SEC\u2019s ability to recover operations.  However, SEC successfully tested the recovery of only 12 of 20 of its major  applications.
