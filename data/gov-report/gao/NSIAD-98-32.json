However, certain foreign sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) measures may prohibit U.S. agricultural products from entering foreign markets and constrain the growth of U.S. agricultural exports. SPS measures are designed to protect human, animal, or plant life or health. For example, a government might require imported plant products to be inspected or treated to prevent the introduction of new pests into the country. Subject to certain conditions, SPS measures are allowed under international trade rules, but the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) believe that some foreign SPS measures may in reality be disguised barriers to trade. You expressed concern about U.S. government efforts to address foreign SPS measures that may unfairly restrict U.S. agricultural exports.", "New rules regarding the appropriate use of SPS measures in relation to trade, established under the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1995 and the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1994, present new challenges to the U.S. government. First, determining whether foreign SPS measures comply with WTO or NAFTA rules requires input from U.S. trade agencies as well as U.S. regulatory agencies with technical and scientific expertise on food-related issues. These regulatory agencies were set up to achieve domestic objectives but now are increasingly expected to be involved in addressing international trade issues. Moreover, U.S. efforts to address foreign SPS measures must take into account U.S. regulatory efforts to ensure the health and safety of domestically produced and imported food and agricultural products. (See Related GAO Products for reports dealing with agricultural trade and food safety issues.)", "In response to your request, this report provides information and analysis on (1) the extent to which foreign SPS measures may unfairly restrict U.S. agricultural exports and (2) the federal structure and approach for addressing such measures. As you requested, this report does not address U.S. efforts to ensure domestic food safety or other countries\u2019 concerns about U.S. SPS measures."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Sanitary and phytosanitary measures encompass many complex technical and scientific issues. Typically applied to both domestically produced and imported goods, SPS measures may be designed to protect human or animal life or health from food-borne risks, humans from animal- and plant-carried diseases, plants and animals from pests or diseases, and the territory of a country from the spread of a pest or disease.", "To minimize or avoid exposure to risk, SPS measures may address how goods are produced, processed, stored, and/or transported. They may require exporters to certify that their products meet importing-country requirements and may require imported products to be inspected or treated before entering the country. If a government believes that certain products present a high risk that cannot be reduced through risk-mitigation techniques, it may impose SPS measures to ban product entry altogether. Although SPS measures may result in trade restrictions, governments generally recognize that some of these restrictions are necessary and appropriate in order to protect human, animal, and plant life and health. However, governments may disagree about whether certain SPS measures are necessary and appropriate.", "SPS measures are not a new issue in global agricultural trade. The United States has long-standing concerns that some SPS measures, such as European Union (EU) measures on meat imports, Chinese measures on wheat imports, and Japanese measures on apple and tomato imports, are unnecessary and have unfairly restricted U.S. agricultural exports. At the same time, other countries have concerns about U.S. SPS measures that restrict agricultural products entering the United States.", "Because of its concerns, the United States played a lead role during negotiations to establish the WTO and NAFTA; these negotiations developed rules and principles to help minimize the adverse impact of SPS measures on trade. The WTO Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS agreement) and NAFTA\u2019s chapter 7 on Agriculture and Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures recognize that countries have a right to maintain SPS measures that protect the health and safety of their population and agricultural sector and to determine acceptable levels of risk. However, these agreements stipulate that the application of SPS measures and determination of risk levels should not be arbitrary or constitute disguised restrictions to trade. Therefore, they require SPS measures to be based on scientific principles, including an assessment of relevant risks. (These two agreements are similar, but not identical. App. I contains more information about the WTO SPS agreement.)", "In addition to these rules and principles, the WTO and NAFTA also provided dispute settlement procedures to help resolve disagreements between countries about their SPS measures. These procedures include consultations (discussions) and review by a dispute settlement panel.", "Before invoking dispute settlement procedures, countries generally try to resolve their disagreements through more informal means.", "Although the SPS agreement and NAFTA have established certain standards for the application of SPS measures, disagreements between countries about these measures often involve complex issues not specifically addressed by the texts of the agreements. First, the agreements require measures to be based on scientific principles, but scientific research on certain topics may not exist or existing research may be inconclusive. For example, the lack of sufficient research on certain poultry diseases affects U.S. exports of poultry meat to Australia. Second, the SPS agreement and NAFTA require measures to be based on an assessment of risk, but governments may have different risk tolerances or may disagree about how to ensure certain minimal levels of risk. Such a disagreement exists between the United States and China concerning wheat imports. Finally, because of domestic pressures or larger outstanding trade or political issues, governments may be unwilling or unable to change their SPS measures. An EU ban in place since the mid-1980s that prohibits importing meat treated with growth-promoting hormones appears to be linked, in part, to such issues.", "Moreover, in attempting to resolve such concerns, the U.S. government may not fully understand a foreign government\u2019s reasons for establishing a measure and therefore may have difficulty determining what strategy will be most effective to resolve the issue or assessing whether its efforts are having any impact. If additional research is required, such research can be time consuming to complete. Finally, the government must work closely with industry officials to determine whether they are willing to perform any risk-mitigation techniques that the foreign government may request. In some cases, although the government may not believe such techniques are necessary, industry officials may be willing to perform risk mitigation in order to gain access to a new market. Because of such issues, addressing and seeking resolution to foreign SPS measures can be a long and complex process that requires substantial negotiation between the United States and foreign governments.", "The United States has had long-standing concerns about several foreign SPS measures that the new WTO rules on SPS measures have helped resolve. For example, on June 30, 1997, a WTO dispute settlement panel requested by the United States found that the EU hormone ban does not conform with a number of provisions in the WTO SPS agreement. While this represents a significant achievement for the United States, the matter is not yet resolved because the EU has filed an appeal regarding the decision. Examples of other key SPS issues that were resolved in 1997 include a Japanese ban on U.S. tomato imports, EU acceptance of most U.S. meat inspection procedures, long-standing Chinese bans on U.S. grape and sweet cherry imports, Chilean measures on wheat and several types of fruit, and Mexican measures on sweet cherry imports. Examples of prominent measures that were resolved in 1996 and 1995, respectively, include Russian measures on poultry imports and Korean shelf-life standards. However, in spite of these successes, many other SPS measures remain unresolved, and new problems involving SPS measures continually surface.", "Federal efforts to resolve issues related to foreign SPS measures coincide with new expectations that the management of federal programs will increasingly focus on results. Specifically, the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (the Results Act) seeks to improve federal program management by requiring federal agencies to set goals for program performance and to measure the results of their efforts. The Results Act envisions that when multiple federal agencies share responsibility for addressing cross-cutting issues, as is true for SPS measures, programs should be closely coordinated to ensure that goals are consistent, and, as appropriate, mutually reinforcing."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Foreign SPS Measures Are Regarded as an Important Trade Issue, but the Problem Is Not Clearly Defined", "paragraphs": ["Agricultural trade associations and government agencies responsible for promoting agricultural trade regard foreign SPS measures as an important trade issue. Private sector and government officials are concerned that such measures may be used inappropriately to restrict the growth of U.S. agricultural exports. While the government does not know the full scope of the problem, available data indicate that foreign SPS measures affect a broad range of U.S. processed product, meat, poultry, fruit, vegetable, and grain exports. Such measures have disrupted ongoing trade or prevented U.S. products from entering new markets."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Agricultural Industry and U.S. Government Have Identified Foreign SPS Measures as a Prominent Agricultural Trade Issue", "paragraphs": ["Many agricultural trade association and U.S. government officials have identified foreign SPS measures as a prominent trade issue. Some U.S. and industry officials attributed this prominence to an increase in the number of SPS measures that appear to affect U.S. exports, while others attributed it to increased visibility of such measures following recent trade agreements. The WTO and NAFTA addressed certain types of policies that have traditionally restricted trade in agricultural products, such as high tariffs and quotas. However, several industry and government officials expressed concern that other countries may be increasing their use of SPS measures as a way to compensate for these required reductions in tariffs and quotas and to continue protecting their markets from imports.", "We discussed SPS issues with representatives from 19 agricultural trade associations that represent commodities such as meat, poultry, fruits, vegetables, and wheat. Most of the associations regarded foreign SPS measures as an important and growing issue for U.S. agricultural exports, and several representatives told us they consider such measures to be their association\u2019s primary trade concern. These officials provided examples of foreign SPS measures that they believe are inconsistent with WTO provisions and have disrupted their exports to certain markets or caused them to decrease, created additional costs for their producers, or prevented their exports from entering new markets.", "Some U.S. government agencies have also become concerned about the potentially negative impact of foreign SPS measures on U.S. exports. USTR and the Secretary of Agriculture have both identified foreign SPS measures that they believe are inconsistent with WTO rules as key barriers to exports of U.S. agricultural products. Several USDA officials estimated that the number of complaints and the percentage of time they or their staff spend addressing them have increased substantially over the last few years. For example, the Special Assistant for International Trade to the Secretary of Agriculture told us that while he is supposed to handle all agricultural trade issues, his agenda has been dominated by the proliferation of SPS issues. USTR and the Secretary of Agriculture have established the removal of such barriers as a primary objective of their trade agenda to increase U.S. agricultural exports. Total agricultural exports were just over $60 billion in 1996."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Defining the Problem Has Been Difficult", "paragraphs": ["Although USTR and USDA are concerned about foreign SPS measures, they have been unable to precisely define the problem that such measures present for U.S. exports, for several reasons. First, USTR and USDA do not know the number of foreign measures that currently affect U.S. exports, in part because the number changes frequently as new complaints surface and old complaints are resolved. Nevertheless, USTR and USDA have both developed information that indicates that foreign SPS measures that have an actual or apparent adverse affect on U.S. exports exist in many countries and apply to a broad range of U.S. agricultural commodities.", "USTR\u2019s 1996 annual report on foreign trade barriers contained information about SPS measures in 26 of the 46 countries or regions it reviewed. In early 1996, USDA attempted to develop a more comprehensive definition of the problem. It surveyed (1) Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) attach\u00e9s posted overseas that collectively covered 132 countries that accounted for 98 percent of the 1996 U.S. export market for agricultural, forestry, and fisheries products; and (2) representatives of agricultural producer groups. It asked the FAS attach\u00e9s and producer groups to identify foreign technical barriers to trade that, among other things, appeared to violate one or more provisions of recent trade agreements. As of June 1996, USDA had developed a list of 315 technical barriers to agricultural trade in  63 countries, over 90 percent of which were SPS measures. One USDA official observed that measures were frequently identified in countries that were among the top importers of U.S. agricultural products in 1996.", "While the USTR and USDA data provide some sense of the problem, they do not accurately measure its size. The USDA survey is the best available definition of the problem; it represents a \u201csnapshot\u201d of foreign SPS measures that had been identified as of June 1996 and, therefore, does not reflect information about measures that have been resolved or measures that have emerged after that time. An FAS official told us that, in mid-1997, responsible USDA agencies began to update the survey data on a quarterly basis by adding newly identified measures and deleting resolved measures. USDA officials said that, despite its limitations, the survey has helped them better understand the nature and extent of foreign SPS measures.", "The second reason that USTR and USDA have had difficulty defining the size of the problem that foreign SPS measures present is because they do not know, of the measures they have identified, how many may be inconsistent with WTO provisions regarding SPS measures. For example, USDA officials said some of the SPS measures identified in the 1996 survey could be legitimate, appropriate measures that the United States should not contest. USTR and USDA officials said that considerable scientific research, testing, and exchange of information is often necessary before the United States can make conclusive determinations about whether or not a foreign measure complies with the WTO SPS agreement. These officials said this process generally takes considerable time.", "Third, USTR and USDA do not know how the SPS measures they have identified impact the value of trade, in part because such estimates are inherently difficult to develop. USDA unofficially estimated that the  315 measures identified in the 1996 survey threatened, constrained, or blocked almost $5 billion of U.S. agricultural exports at the time the survey was conducted. However, some USDA officials told us they question the accuracy of the estimate for several reasons. For example, USDA officials said it is difficult to predict whether an SPS measure would affect all exports of a given commodity or only selected exports of the commodity. Also, in cases where a U.S. commodity does not yet have access to a market, estimates of the market\u2019s potential size were based on U.S. exports to a similar market, which may not be accurate. USDA officials also told us the estimates were not derived from empirical trade models and therefore should be regarded only as an order-of-magnitude indication of the significance of foreign SPS measures to U.S. exports.", "Without better data, particularly regarding the number of measures that affect U.S. exports and more reliable estimates of their impact on trade, USTR and USDA are unable to determine the size of the problem or whether the problem is growing. They are also unable to evaluate how their efforts have affected the size of the problem and the value of trade."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Foreign SPS Measures Appear to Have a Broad and Diverse Effect on Trade", "paragraphs": ["Foreign SPS measures appear to affect a wide range of agricultural products, involve various health and safety issues, and result in multiple trade effects or additional costs. According to USDA and industry officials, the foreign SPS measures they have identified affect numerous commodities, including processed products, grains, oilseeds, animal products, fruits, vegetables, cotton, seeds, nuts, fish, and forestry products. A large portion of the foreign SPS measures identified involve plant health issues, while others involve food safety or animal health issues.", "According to U.S. government and industry officials, the way in which foreign SPS measures affect U.S. exports also varies. These measures have threatened or constrained trade to existing markets or prevented U.S. exports from entering new markets. Some measures constrain trade by requiring products to be treated or inspected before entering markets, which may damage the quality and marketability of certain perishable products. Some commodities, such as fruits and vegetables, appear to face a large number of measures while others, such as wheat, appear to face a limited number of measures. USDA and industry officials have estimated that some measures affect several hundred million dollars of trade, while other measures affect $1 million or less.", "We reviewed six foreign SPS measures that have affected or continue to affect U.S. agricultural exports. These measures impacted various commodities, involved various issues, and were estimated to have a range of impacts on the value of trade (additional information about these measures and federal efforts to address them are contained in app. III). Of these six measures, one was determined to be inconsistent with WTO provisions regarding SPS measures by a WTO dispute settlement panel (the EU ban on growth-promoting hormones). USDA officials told us that four others may also be inconsistent with these provisions and stated their belief that the measures lacked a scientific basis.", "Since 1974, China has banned wheat shipped from U.S. states in the Pacific Northwest, an area where the TCK fungus is known to occur. China has continued to import wheat shipped from other U.S. ports, but if it detects TCK in these shipments, China requires the price to be discounted and, on a few occasions, has refused to accept such shipments. The impact of the ban on U.S. wheat exports has not been quantified. In anticipation of the 1989 implementation of the EU ban on growth-promoting hormones in livestock production, U.S. beef and veal exports to the EU dropped about 93 percent in 1 year, from about $117 million in 1988 to about $9 million in 1989, and have recovered little since then (see fig. 1). In June 1997, a WTO dispute settlement panel found the measure to be inconsistent with the SPS agreement. The EU has appealed this decision.", "Since as early as 1983, Japan blocked U.S. tomato exports over concerns that U.S. tomatoes might carry tobacco blue mold (TBM). After USDA conducted 4 years of research to demonstrate that tomatoes were not a host for TBM, Japan lifted the ban on 25 varieties of tomatoes in April 1997. An industry association estimates U.S. tomato exports to Japan could reach $50 million annually. In 1994, a sudden and unexpected change in Korean shelf-life standards blocked the entry of more than $1 million worth of perishable U.S. sausage products that had already arrived in Korean ports. According to USTR, had these and other Korean shelf-life measures not been revised following WTO consultations, they could have affected as much as $1 billion in annual U.S. exports by 1999.", "Since 1992, Mexico has required U.S. peach and nectarine exports to be treated and inspected before entering Mexico to protect that country from the Oriental fruit moth, a pest that is known to occur in the United States. USDA officials said the quantity of U.S. peach and nectarine exports to Mexico, measured in terms of metric tons, dropped by about 40 percent from 1991 to 1996. In 1996, Russia imposed a brief ban on U.S. poultry exports because of concerns about food safety and poultry disease issues. The ban was in effect for about 1 week before the United States and Russia resolved the issue. The ban did not actually cause U.S. exports to drop, but it appeared to threaten the poultry industry\u2019s largest export market, worth over $900 million in 1996.", "SPS measures can result in a variety of costs to the agricultural industry and to the government. In addition to the costs associated with a partial or complete loss of sales, industry officials told us that addressing apparently unfair SPS measures or reaching agreement with foreign officials to enable U.S. exports to begin or continue may result in other costs. In several of the six cases we reviewed, industry groups or private companies incurred additional costs for research, treatment, or inspection. For example, when Russian officials said they wanted to inspect the nearly 300 U.S. poultry processing facilities that export poultry to Russia, these processing facilities paid for Russian officials\u2019 travel expenses. Several of the six cases also resulted in additional costs to the U.S. government for such things as research, official travel, or translator services."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Evolving U.S. Approach for Addressing SPS Measures Is Not Integrated or Systematic", "paragraphs": ["WTO rules regarding SPS measures have been in place for less than 2 years, and the U.S. approach for addressing SPS measures that restrict U.S. exports is evolving.

The approach is based on a complex structure of multiple trade and regulatory entities, but no one entity leads overall federal efforts. In addition, some entities\u2019 roles and responsibilities are unclear, and their efforts have not been adequately coordinated. The process by which measures are addressed lacks comprehensive data and guidance for making key decisions, including what measures the United States should address and what steps it should take to address them.

USTR has statutory responsibility for developing and coordinating the implementation of U.S. international trade policy, monitoring the implementation of trade agreements reached with foreign governments, and enforcing U.S. rights under those agreements. It is also responsible for issuing and coordinating policy guidance to Departments and agencies on WTO-related matters.", "Eight USDA entities have collective responsibility for addressing issues related to foreign SPS measures. In addition, the Special Assistant for International Trade to the Secretary of Agriculture has been given a prominent role in addressing SPS measures and coordinating USDA\u2019s efforts in this area. As USDA\u2019s trade agency, FAS carries out USDA\u2019s statutory responsibility for identifying foreign SPS measures that adversely impact U.S. exports and providing relevant information about them to USTR. In addition, FAS participates in negotiations to address such measures and is expected to coordinate its efforts with other USDA agencies and work closely with USTR. USDA has several regulatory entities, including the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service; Food Safety and Inspection Service; and Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration, that have domestic food-related responsibilities and, therefore, are responsible for participating in negotiations to address the technical aspects of foreign SPS measures and evaluating how U.S. trade positions may affect U.S. SPS measures. In addition, USDA\u2019s Agricultural Marketing Service plays a limited technical role because it addresses certain product quality issues which, while not considered SPS issues, are nonetheless related. In addition, scientific and economic research is performed primarily by USDA\u2019s Agricultural Research Service and Economic Research Service. Finally, legal counsel and assistance is provided by USDA\u2019s Office of the General Counsel.", "In addition to USTR and USDA, other federal entities help address SPS measures. Federal regulatory authorities with domestic food-related responsibilities have the needed technical expertise for addressing foreign SPS measures and evaluating how U.S. trade positions affect U.S. SPS measures; these include the Department of Health and Human Service\u2019s Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The Department of State is responsible for facilitating communication with foreign government officials; it also participates in certain bilateral negotiations on SPS issues and contributes to the overall U.S. government policy-making process on SPS issues. Industry groups also play a major role in helping the U.S. government identify foreign SPS measures that affect their actual or potential exports, supporting research on technical issues and advising on strategies to address SPS measures.", "Overlapping or closely related areas of responsibility among these federal entities can make it difficult to determine which agency should lead federal efforts to address certain SPS measures. For example, USTR and FAS both perform SPS-related activities and have responsibility for monitoring and addressing agricultural trade issues. Overlap also exists within FAS, where some divisions address trade from a commodity perspective and others address trade from a geographic perspective. Food-related responsibilities among the regulatory entities are closely related (see  table 1).", "Because of their areas of responsibility, several federal entities may be involved in addressing a foreign SPS measure. For example, the EU ban on growth-promoting hormones has been addressed by USTR, USDA (FAS and the Food Safety and Inspection Service), and FDA. The ban involved technical issues, some of which were under FDA\u2019s jurisdiction (the use of drugs in animals) and others of which were under the Food Safety and Inspection Service\u2019s jurisdiction (the sale of meat from animals). As discussed later, we found that in certain instances the involvement of multiple entities has caused coordination and communication problems. However, officials from the various trade and regulatory entities stated that the participation of multiple entities is not inherently problematic because each entity brings its own expertise to an issue."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "No Entity Directs All Federal Efforts", "paragraphs": ["No single federal entity is currently directing and coordinating the entire scope of federal efforts undertaken to address SPS measures. During our review, several U.S. government and industry officials expressed concerns that the federal structure for addressing SPS measures lacked clear leadership and caused various undesirable effects, including independent and separate agendas among responsible entities, difficulty making decisions and tracking federal efforts, and uncoordinated activities. The Secretary of Agriculture\u2019s Special Assistant for International Trade was particularly concerned about the difficulty overcoming organizational boundaries among USDA agencies. Several industry representatives said the federal structure made it difficult to know which federal entity should be contacted to report a given problem, how the information the industry provided would be shared among federal entities, or what actions federal entities would take in response to the problem.", "Certain mechanisms exist at USTR and USDA through which portions of the federal response are directed and coordinated. However, none of the mechanisms is comprehensive enough to include all responsible federal entities and manage all federal efforts to address SPS measures. As a result, substantial coordination among these mechanisms and responsible federal entities is still necessary.", "One coordination mechanism is led by USTR. USTR created the position of Director for SPS Affairs within its Office of WTO and Multilateral Affairs in the fall of 1996 to work closely with other federal entities responsible for addressing SPS measures. At that time, the Director for SPS Affairs began to more actively use the mechanism established for formal interagency trade policy coordination\u2014the Trade Policy Staff Committee (TPSC)\u2014to establish the U.S. position and approach for addressing certain foreign SPS measures. However, TPSC discussions have focused primarily on determining which individual SPS measures the U.S. government should raise for discussion in meetings of the WTO SPS committee. Neither USTR, because of its limited resources, nor the TPSC addresses all SPS measures that concern the U.S. government.", "A second coordination mechanism was recently implemented at USDA. Although the bulk of federal efforts to address foreign SPS measures occurs at USDA, neither any of the eight USDA agencies nor the Secretary of Agriculture\u2019s Special Assistant for International Trade has responsibility for directing and prioritizing overall USDA efforts to address SPS measures or allocating resources. We discussed this situation several times with the Special Assistant during the course of our review. In October 1997, the Secretary of Agriculture announced the formation of a Working Group on Agricultural Trade Policy to address SPS and other trade issues. The working group, which will be led by the Special Assistant and comprised of the heads of several USDA agencies, is to coordinate USDA efforts on agricultural trade issues and provide direction regarding the allocation of resources and establishment of priorities. However, because the group\u2019s primary purpose is to improve coordination within USDA on trade issues, participation is to be limited to USDA agencies. The group is to serve as USDA\u2019s point of reference for coordination on trade policy issues with other federal agencies.", "A group of industry associations representing various commodities has suggested that the federal structure and approach for addressing SPS measures could be improved with the creation of a single office that would be responsible for receiving complaints about SPS measures, coordinating U.S. government activities to address the measure, and communicating with the industry."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some Roles and Responsibilities Not Clearly Defined", "paragraphs": ["Absent overall leadership of federal efforts, some federal entities\u2019 specific roles in addressing individual measures as well as their overall responsibility for addressing trade issues have not been clearly defined.

However, it may be difficult to determine which of these entities should lead initial federal efforts to address an individual SPS measure because their areas of responsibility overlap or are closely related. In discussing federal efforts to address individual SPS measures with responsible officials, we sometimes found examples of a lack of clarity about which entity was considered to be leading federal efforts or disagreement about which entity should be leading federal efforts. For example, it was not clear whether USTR or USDA was leading federal efforts to address the Chinese ban on U.S. wheat imports found to contain TCK, and there were differences of opinion about whether the U.S. strategy should focus on technical issues or trade policy.", "USTR, FAS, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, and the Food Safety and Inspection Service have all had leadership roles in addressing certain SPS measures and have all supported each other\u2019s leadership in addressing other measures. FDA and EPA officials told us they have generally not led federal efforts to address individual SPS measures but have instead supported such efforts by providing important technical expertise. (As discussed in app. II, FDA has a lead role in other SPS-related activities that were not the focus of this report.) The Agricultural Research Service, the Economic Research Service, and State have also played primarily support roles.", "In addition to the lack of clarity about leadership roles to address individual SPS measures, several U.S. and industry officials expressed concern about various entities\u2019 overall responsibility for, and commitment to, addressing trade issues. For example, several industry officials expressed concern that USTR has not taken a sufficiently active role in addressing foreign SPS measures. While USTR is the only federal entity that can initiate WTO dispute settlement cases, some industry officials said USTR has appeared reluctant to do so regarding certain SPS measures. USTR officials said they will pursue dispute settlement in all SPS cases that have merit, but said that dispute settlement may not be the only way to resolve a problem. They also said industry groups are sometimes uncomfortable elevating their complaints to such a formal level. Some industry officials also said USTR has appeared reluctant to play a role during bilateral negotiations on certain SPS measures, prior to seeking dispute settlement within the WTO or NAFTA. USTR officials said their role tends to become more active on a bilateral basis when USDA agencies believe they have done all they can to address a case. USTR officials noted they had been heavily involved in several bilateral negotiations on SPS measures.", "Several government and industry officials also expressed concern that regulatory and research entities\u2019 roles and responsibilities for addressing foreign SPS measures have not been clearly defined. As discussed previously, regulatory and research entities were created to achieve domestic objectives related to ensuring food safety and protecting U.S. agricultural resources but are increasingly expected to help facilitate trade. However, officials from USTR and FAS and several industry officials expressed concern that some regulatory entities do not regard their role in addressing foreign SPS measures as an agency priority. On the other hand, several regulatory officials expressed concern that their role in the trade area has expanded but their resources, which must still be allocated to their primary food-related missions, have not changed. Therefore, they said, increasing their trade facilitation activities would probably require resources to be reprogrammed.", "Many officials from trade, regulatory, and research agencies, and industry representatives agreed that the participation of regulatory and research entities in this area is necessary because these entities have technical and scientific expertise that trade agencies lack. Beyond their technical expertise, certain USDA entities have a mandated trade role because they are responsible for certifying that exports of products they regulate are healthy and safe."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Workloads and Resources Vary", "paragraphs": ["Because the SPS-related roles and responsibilities of federal entities vary, their workloads and the resources they have allocated to addressing SPS measures also vary. Some entities have substantial responsibility regarding SPS measures, while others\u2019 responsibility is more limited. Some entities, accordingly, have increased the staff allocated to this issue. However, the resource allocations of certain entities remained a concern among government and industry officials.", "In USTR, SPS responsibilities are handled primarily by the Director for SPS Affairs, staff from the Offices of Agricultural Affairs and General Counsel and, as needed, various regional trade specialists. USTR officials acknowledged that its responsibilities for addressing SPS measures are broad, but its resources for doing so are limited. The Director for SPS Affairs, who is currently detailed to USTR from State, estimated that USTR allocates three to four full-time staff year equivalents to addressing SPS issues; other staff are assigned as needed. As a result, USTR officials said they rely on USDA agencies to help them identify SPS measures, perform technical and scientific assessments of the measures, initiate discussions with foreign government officials about measures, and keep USTR informed of their progress. In addition, several USTR and USDA officials said USTR\u2019s small legal staff has been overwhelmed by the growing workload associated with initiating and following dispute settlement cases on behalf of multiple trade sectors. USTR officials said the number of dispute settlement cases involving agricultural products, in particular, has grown since the WTO was created, and the litigation of such cases is extremely resource intensive. (As discussed in app. I, a WTO official also expressed concern about the growing number of dispute settlement cases.)", "Within USDA, although the Secretary\u2019s Special Assistant has a central role in coordinating USDA efforts to address SPS measures, he does not control any budget or staff resources. FAS, which has broad daily responsibility for addressing SPS measures, has increased its staff resources over the last few years to respond to this problem (see fig. 2). In 1990, it established the Office of Food Safety and Technical Services to better address SPS issues affecting U.S. exports. In 1997, the office was renamed the Food Safety and Technical Services Division.", "Number of full-time staff years Among regulatory entities, workloads for addressing SPS measures vary according to their food-related responsibilities and technical expertise. USDA officials told us that technical assistance is required most often from the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, the Food Safety and Inspection Service, and FDA. Because of varying workloads, as well as the continued lack of clarity about regulatory entities\u2019 growing trade role, these entities have allocated different levels of resources to address SPS measures. For example, officials from the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service told us that their agency\u2019s mission has been expanded to include trade facilitation of both imports and exports and they have allocated additional staff and budget resources to addressing foreign SPS measures. Officials from the Food Safety and Inspection Service told us that while trade facilitation is important, it is not their primary mission, and they have not allocated additional resources to this activity. Figure 3 shows the full-time staff years that the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service and the Food Safety and Inspection Service told us they devoted to negotiating with foreign government officials about SPS measures from 1994 to 1997.", "FDA and EPA officials told us they do not have a mandate or any resources to assist agricultural exports, although they have made resources available when USDA or USTR requested their assistance.

Responsible federal officials said inadequate coordination led to a lack of knowledge among responsible entities about which measures each was working on, what activities were planned or had been performed, or the status of each other\u2019s efforts. We found inadequate coordination could be attributed to several factors, including lack of overall leadership, shifting and sometimes unclear roles, and separate management structures. For example, seven of the eight USDA entities report to their own administrators and to one of four undersecretaries or assistant secretaries, who make independent decisions about their agencies\u2019 priorities and how to allocate their agencies\u2019 budget and staff resources.", "Inadequate coordination among multiple federal entities is not a new problem. For example, in our past work on the U.S. system for ensuring food safety, which is comprised of multiple federal entities, we concluded that agency self-interest and differing regulatory approaches hindered adequate coordination. Moreover, we noted that efforts to improve coordination have traditionally fallen short because federal entities continued to operate under different statutes and appropriation acts. Many of the entities we examined in our past work also have responsibility for addressing the technical aspects of foreign SPS measures.", "In a March 1997 review of NAFTA implementation, USDA\u2019s Office of the Inspector General also concluded that departmental guidance is needed to improve coordination among USDA trade and regulatory entities on trade issues, particularly regarding the development of unified negotiating strategies. The Inspector General also found that the lack of such coordination had hampered USDA\u2019s progress in negotiating with Mexico about SPS measures and related issues that blocked access for certain U.S. agricultural products.", "To address coordination problems within USDA, two interagency groups were created in 1995 at the staff and management levels. The staff level group is headed by FAS\u2019 Food Safety and Technical Services Division; it includes staff from all responsible USDA entities and coordinates informally with non-USDA entities. It meets weekly to discuss new developments and the status of ongoing efforts. The management level group, called the \u201cSPS Action Team,\u201d was headed by the Secretary of Agriculture\u2019s Special Assistant and included high-level staff from all responsible USDA entities. The action team met intermittently to coordinate overall USDA efforts regarding certain SPS measures based on information provided by the staff level group. According to the Special Assistant, the action team is being replaced by the Working Group on Agricultural Trade Policy.

Based on our review of federal efforts to resolve six SPS measures, we found that the specific federal efforts undertaken to address each measure differed from case to case. We also found that entities with food-related technical expertise typically lead bilateral discussions on technical issues, in which they assess the necessity of foreign measures and provide data or conduct research to demonstrate the health or safety of U.S. products or the process by which they are produced. Trade entities typically lead bilateral discussions that focus on international trade rules, in which they discuss a foreign measure\u2019s compliance with WTO rules regarding SPS measures.

The federal structure contributes to this problem because information about SPS measures is collected and tracked separately by trade and regulatory entities. For example, several USDA entities have developed their own electronic data bases or management systems for identifying SPS measures and tracking the status of their efforts to address them. However, even though these systems may include some of the same issues, they are not linked and cannot be accessed by other USDA staff. Moreover, whether entities had such systems or not, most were unable to tell us what measures they were working on at any given time.", "Some centralized information has been developed, but it is of limited use. In 1996, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service developed a system to track the status of its efforts to address trade issues, many of which are SPS measures. The system, in which the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service plans to store certain other entities\u2019 trade issues, can be accessed outside of the agency by authorized USDA staff. So far the system only contains information about a limited number of issues tracked by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service and the Agricultural Marketing Service. Officials from the Food Safety and Inspection Service and the Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration told us they plan to add their trade issues to the system, but FAS officials said they do not plan to do so. According to several USDA officials, progress on developing this system has been slowed by concern among the participating entities about storing what they view as internal agency information on a system that can be accessed by other USDA agencies or the public. The other centralized information is contained in the 1996 USDA survey. FAS has begun to update the survey on a quarterly basis to add new issues and remove resolved issues. It is not clear whether the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service system and FAS efforts related to the USDA survey are duplicative.", "In addition to lacking centralized information about SPS measures and their efforts to address them, the U.S. government does not have a regular process by which entities jointly evaluate complaints about foreign SPS measures to determine which measures the U.S. government should address. Trade entities evaluate foreign SPS measures for their compliance with WTO provisions, while regulatory entities evaluate foreign SPS measures for their technical or scientific basis. However, we found that differences of opinion regarding the consistency of certain foreign SPS measures to relevant WTO provisions or their technical legitimacy may exist among federal entities or between federal entities and the affected industry.

Officials from both trade and regulatory entities provided examples of instances in which they had requested help from another entity to address one of their issues, but the other entity did not respond in a timely way or did not appear to place as much importance on the issue. Some USDA officials expressed concern that industry pressure has played a larger role in determining what USDA addresses than has objective analysis of individual measures and their impact on trade.", "During most of our review, federal entities lacked objective criteria to help them decide which foreign SPS measures should be addressed and prioritize their efforts. In February 1997, USTR developed provisional criteria to help TPSC members determine which of a small subset of measures should be raised for discussion in WTO SPS committee meetings. The criteria included the following factors: (1) domestic producers requested government assistance to address the measure; (2) the measure appears to be inconsistent with the WTO SPS agreement or other WTO provisions or involves the non-use or improper use of international standards, guidelines, and recommendations; (3) bilateral technical discussions or WTO consultations have taken place but have not achieved progress toward resolution; and (4) agencies agree that addressing the measure in the WTO SPS committee will promote resolution of the issue and will not damage other U.S. bilateral interests. In an August 1997 meeting, USTR officials identified other factors that are not among the list of provisional criteria. For example, they told us the TPSC considers whether sufficient scientific evidence exists to refute the measure and whether U.S. efforts to address the measure will undermine U.S. regulatory interests.", "USDA officials told us the Department does not have formal criteria for determining which foreign SPS measures responsible agencies should address or establishing priorities, but FAS officials identified unofficial criteria they believe are useful. These included the estimated impact of the measure on U.S. exports, an assessment of the industry\u2019s interest in resolving the measure, and the availability of conclusive scientific evidence (or whether additional research must be conducted and, if so, whether the research can be funded and the amount of time required for its completion).", "The Secretary\u2019s Special Assistant told us the Working Group on Agricultural Trade Policy will establish official criteria to help evaluate SPS measures and determine USDA priorities and resource allocation.

It reported concerns that USDA\u2019s objectives for such meetings were not clear.

It also found that USDA trade and regulatory entities differed in their viewpoint about whether bilateral issues should be discussed at meetings of the NAFTA SPS committee\u2014FAS considered this to be a key function of the committee, whereas regulatory entities were reluctant to discuss issues in the committee until they had thoroughly pursued bilateral negotiations. The Inspector General concluded that departmental guidance is needed to overcome these differences of opinion about approach and ensure that coordinated strategies are developed.", "Like the Inspector General, we found that trade and regulatory authorities, as well as industry representatives, sometimes had different opinions about the appropriateness of a foreign measure or the country\u2019s reason for establishing it. Therefore, they were likely to disagree about the best negotiating approach to resolve the issue. In such instances, government and industry officials often expressed concern that the lack of agreement hampered effective decision-making and progress. We found differences of opinion (such as among government entities, among industry officials, and between the government and industry) throughout the six SPS measures we reviewed. In these cases, and others that we discussed with federal and industry officials, we found that trade authorities and industry officials were more likely to characterize a foreign measure as an unfair trade barrier and favor moving quickly to trade policy discussions with foreign trade authorities. Meanwhile, regulatory authorities were more likely to emphasize the technical complexity of the issue and favor thorough technical discussions with foreign regulatory authorities.", "We found that conflicting perspectives between trade and regulatory authorities were not unusual. For example, some trade authorities and industry officials expressed frustration that regulatory authorities seemed to lack a sense of urgency regarding trade matters and were willing to engage in technical discussions for many months and years. They expressed concerns that regulatory authorities lacked negotiating expertise, which sometimes precluded them from obtaining the most advantageous result for the U.S. industry. Some regulatory authorities expressed frustration that trade authorities and industry officials did not seem to understand that deliberate and lengthy technical and scientific processes were often necessary to adequately and properly address foreign regulatory authorities\u2019 stated concerns about U.S. products.

However, we were unable to determine whether the meetings have achieved their stated purposes because, although we requested thorough documentation of the meetings and their results, USDA could only provide a limited number of meeting minutes.

Within USDA, responsible entities have had difficulty agreeing that they have done all they can to resolve an SPS issue and that dispute settlement is probably the appropriate next step. This may stem from underlying disagreements about whether current efforts are working or different opinions about whether scientific evidence against a particular measure is strong. When USTR and USDA determine that a more formal process should be considered to address a measure, such as the WTO SPS committee or WTO consultations or dispute settlement, the debate expands to include relevant members of the TPSC. USTR officials said the TPSC discusses the issue according to the provisional criteria USTR established, but said substantial debate among TPSC members still occurs.", "The debate about whether to refer SPS cases to the WTO for dispute settlement occurs not only among federal entities but between federal entities and the private sector, as shown by several of the SPS cases we reviewed. Dispute settlement procedures were invoked regarding Korean shelf-life standards and the EU ban on hormones and were considered as a possible approach regarding the Japanese ban on tomatoes. In several of these cases, we found evidence of debate among federal entities about whether dispute settlement was the appropriate course of action. In several cases, industry officials told us they were disappointed that the government was slow to decide about moving to dispute settlement. For example, some industry officials told us they expected USTR to invoke dispute settlement procedures in the EU hormone case immediately following the WTO\u2019s implementation in January 1995. Filing this case was delayed until May 1996, however, in part because of indications during 1995 that the EU might revise the measure. Similarly, some industry officials told us they intended to insist that USTR invoke dispute settlement procedures in the Japanese case if it was not resolved by early 1996. While dispute settlement was considered and the possibility may have been mentioned to Japanese officials, it was not pursued. This case was ultimately resolved over a year later, in April 1997.

For example, during 1988, China accepted wheat from the Pacific Northwest on an experimental basis but stopped this practice because it continued to detect TCK in these shipments. China also reported finding TCK in U.S. wheat shipped from a Gulf port in 1989; USDA retested this shipment but did not find TCK. In the late 1980s, China established a schedule in its contracts with U.S. exporters to discount the price of wheat when TCK is found.

The new system became effective for all dried, packaged, canned, or bottled products on October 1, 1995, and for chilled, vacuum-packed pork and beef and all frozen food on July 1, 1996. According to a WTO official, the system for other products was to be phased in over time. After the agreement was announced, USTR and FAS officials said they monitored Korea\u2019s implementation to ensure it adhered to the agreement. These officials said Korea\u2019s initial notification to the WTO of its new measures in July 1995 did not appear to be consistent with the agreement reached, but a subsequent notification in September 1996 seemed to comply with the agreement."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Poultry to Russia", "paragraphs": ["In 1996, the Russian poultry ban threatened a U.S. market that had been growing dramatically since the collapse of the Soviet Union, from about $84 million in 1993 to about $608 million in 1995 (see fig. III.2). Russia has become the largest single market for U.S. poultry exports\u2014U.S. poultry exports to Russia represented about 26 percent of total U.S. poultry exports in 1995. Poultry exports have also become the largest single U.S. export to Russia. Because the ban was in effect for only about a week before the United States and Russia reached an agreement, and because U.S. poultry exports to Russia had increased somewhat during January and February of 1996 in anticipation of the ban\u2019s taking effect, total U.S. poultry exports to Russia actually increased during 1996. Nonetheless, the potential loss from a long-term ban was quite substantial.", "The case had its origins in a shipment of \u201coff-condition\u201d chicken received by a Russian importer in June 1995. In November 1995, Russian veterinary health officials stated they had concerns about the U.S. system for ensuring the safety of U.S. poultry exports and demanded that all U.S. processing and cold storage facilities involved in the export of chicken to Russia be inspected by Russian veterinarians.", "After consulting with industry officials, USDA officials agreed to the Russian inspection of U.S. facilities, even though an inspection of such magnitude was unusual. Shortly before the arrival of the Russian veterinarians in January 1996, Russia provided standards by which the U.S. facilities were to be judged. USDA and industry officials said the standards were very strict and were not similar to the existing U.S. poultry processing system. After inspecting about 50 of the more than 300 plants that were to be reviewed, a top Russian health official announced in February 1996 that none of the U.S. facilities had met Russian standards.", "Following this announcement, U.S. (APHIS, FSIS, and FAS) and Russian officials engaged in technical negotiations to attempt to resolve the problem. The negotiations addressed food safety and animal disease issues and lasted for several weeks. The U.S. position was that the U.S. system produces a safe and wholesome product and the Russian import requirements were unreasonable. U.S. officials argued that processing and inspection systems could differ but still offer the same degree of protection. On February 16, 1996, Russian officials announced that a ban on U.S. poultry imports would go into effect within 30 days unless Russian concerns were addressed. U.S. officials who participated in the talks said it became clear to them that technical negotiations were not going to resolve the problem.", "Following indications by Russian officials that they would ban U.S. poultry imports, the Office of the Vice President became involved, and USTR took the lead in the negotiations. The Russian ban was announced on March 16, 1996. Negotiations between the United States and Russia followed, and a resolution was announced about 1 week later, on March 25, 1996. The two sides reached agreement, among other things, on an updated export certificate and a framework for periodic inspections of U.S. poultry processing and cold storage facilities. According to U.S. officials, in this case, the Office of the Vice President had a unique channel to work through\u2014a committee set up between the Vice President and the Russian Prime Minister that held semiannual meetings to discuss bilateral issues.", "U.S. industry, which was willing to make certain concessions to protect its market, was heavily involved in developing the U.S. negotiating position.", "U.S. industry has noted, however, that the ban could perhaps have been avoided had higher level and/or appropriate U.S. officials been involved earlier in the negotiations.

To select the six measures, we examined a variety of factors and attempted to develop a group of measures that would allow us to address a range of issues, including (1) commodities affected, (2) countries establishing the measures, (3) duration of the measures (from a few months to many years), (4) impact of the measures on trade (from relatively small to relatively large), (5) status of U.S. efforts to resolve the case (from resolved to unresolved), (6) coverage by multilateral rules (involving WTO members, NAFTA members, and nonmembers of either agreement), and (7) the extent of participation of responsible U.S. government entities in addressing the measure.", "The measures we examined included a Chinese stated \u201czero tolerance\u201d on wheat infected with the TCK fungus, a measure in effect since 1973 that has primarily affected certain northwestern U.S. states where the fungus is known to occur; a Japanese ban (encountered as early as 1983) on imports of U.S. tomatoes because of Japanese government concerns that tomatoes carried TBM; a 1989 EU ban on imports of hormone-treated meat that blocks U.S. beef", "1991 measures adopted in Mexico to establish multiple preshipment requirements for imports of fresh U.S. peaches and nectarines; a 1994 change to a Republic of Korea shelf-life standard that adversely affected U.S. meat product exports; and a brief 1996 Russian ban on U.S. poultry exports due to Russian dissatisfaction with U.S. inspection processes and disease certifications.", "For each measure, we developed a chronology of U.S. government and industry actions taken to address the measure, from the time the U.S. government first learned about the measure until the measure was resolved, or if unresolved, to the present time. To do so, we conducted interviews with agency officials who had been involved in addressing the measure; obtained any documents these officials could provide to demonstrate their or their entity\u2019s actions, including chronologies, trip reports, memos, meeting minutes, press releases, and the text of any agreements reached with the foreign government; and reviewed reporting cables between State (headquarters) and embassy officials located abroad during 1994-96 that discussed these cases, including information about meetings with foreign officials and their results.

We updated our discussion of USTR\u2019s Government Performance and Results Act (Results Act) strategic plan based on the final version that had not been completed when the draft report was sent to USTR for comment. We also added information about organizational developments at USTR and the interagency Trade Policy Staff Committee (TPSC) that USTR leads. Information throughout the report is based on discussions held with USTR and USDA officials continuously through October 1997 and documents gathered from both agencies. However, we continue to believe that our assessment of the overall U.S. approach and the need for coordinated goals, objectives, and performance measurements is accurate. First, the TPSC process is not a substitute for coordinated management of overall federal efforts. While this process is an important component of the federal approach, it is focused on obtaining interagency consensus on a limited number of SPS issues that the United States may raise for discussion in the WTO SPS committee and possibly refer to dispute settlement. According to USTR and USDA officials, the number of issues addressed in the TPSC process is a small subset of the hundreds that USDA entities address, which accounts for the report\u2019s focus on USDA\u2019s SPS-related activities. Second, we found only broad goals related to SPS measures in USTR\u2019s Results Act plan, rather than the \u201cspecific negotiating goals\u201d that USTR said it contained. In our view, these broad goals are not sufficient to ensure the more integrated approach for addressing SPS measures that we believe is necessary. 2. We added information about the important role the regulatory agencies play not only in addressing foreign SPS measures but also in ensuring that U.S. trade policy does not undermine U.S. regulatory interests. However, the focus of this report is, as requested, on the facilitation of U.S. agricultural exports. 3.

The report identifies several SPS measures that have been resolved or regarding which the U.S. government has made progress, including five of our six case studies, and discusses how federal entities have used the provisions of the WTO SPS agreement in their negotiations to address SPS measures. However, we continue to believe that federal entities cannot measure the degree of their success because they lack adequate data on the size and potential impact of the problem, the status of their efforts to address the problem, and the effect of their efforts on U.S. exports. Moreover, we believe that federal efforts to address SPS measures are hampered by the structural and procedural weaknesses we identify. 2. We clarified that our assessment of the U.S. approach applied to the entire scope of federal efforts, not just to measures that might be referred to the WTO. As noted in our response to USTR\u2019s comments (app. V,  comment 1), we updated our discussion of recent organizational initiatives but continue to believe our overall assessment of the federal approach is accurate. 3. We understand that informal mechanisms may be a valuable and integral part of any system. However, our review demonstrates that, in the absence of high-level, unified management, the ad hoc and informal nature of USDA\u2019s efforts to address SPS measures has caused coordination, communication, and prioritization problems. USDA notes in its comment letter that increased written guidance is needed to document its informal processes. We encourage USDA to focus this guidance on how federal entities can best use such processes. 4.
