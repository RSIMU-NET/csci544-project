GAO reviewed 31 FPS guard contracts, and analyzed guard files from 11 contracts, selected based on geographic diversity; interviewed officials from guard companies, FPS headquarters, and 4 of 11 FPS regions; and reviewed the contract guard requirements and processes at six federal agencies, selected for their comparability to FPS."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Several of the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Federal Protective Service's (FPS) guard requirements are generally comparable to those of the six selected agencies GAO reviewed, but FPS faces challenges in some aspects of guards' training. FPS and the six selected agencies GAO reviewed require basic, firearms, and screener (x-ray and magnetometer equipment) training for their armed guards. However, GAO found that providing screener training remains a challenge for FPS. For example, officials from one of FPS's contract guard companies stated that 133 (about 38 percent) of its approximately 350 guards have never received this training. Similarly, according to officials at five guard companies, some of their contract guards have not received training on how to respond during incidents involving an active shooter. Additionally, while contract guard industry guidance states that all training should be done with a certified instructor, GAO found that FPS does not require guard instructors to be certified to provide basic and refresher training, which represents the majority of guards' training. According to six guard companies, the lack of a requirement has led to having to retrain some guards, potentially increasing costs to FPS.", "Twenty-three percent of contract guard files GAO reviewed did not have required training and certification documentation. GAO reviewed 276 randomly selected (non-generalizable) guard files maintained by 11 of the 31 guard companies GAO interviewed and found that 212 files (77 percent) contained the required training and certification documentation, but 64 files (23 percent) were missing one or more required documents. For example, the 64 files were missing items such as documentation of initial weapons and screener training and firearms qualifications. Although FPS has taken steps to address its challenges in this area, GAO's previous recommendations concerning monitoring guard companies' performance are a guide to furthering FPS's efforts. According to FPS officials, it plans to address GAO's recommendations in the near future. FPS continues to lack effective management controls to ensure its guards have met its training and certification requirements. For instance, although FPS agreed with GAO's 2010 and 2012 recommendations that it develop a comprehensive and reliable system for managing information on guards' training, certifications, and qualifications, it still does not have such a system. According to FPS officials, it plans to address this recommendation in the near future.", "FPS also lacks sufficient management controls to ensure consistency in its monthly guard file review process (its primary management control for ensuring that guards are trained and certified), raising questions about the utility of this process. In the absence of specific guidance regarding how files are to be selected, FPS's 11 regions varied in how they conducted the monthly file reviews. For example, FPS officials from three regions stated that they randomly select their files for review, while officials from one guard company in another region stated that FPS asks the guard company to select the files for review. Allowing contract guard company officials to select files for review by FPS could result in selection bias and affect the results of FPS's review. FPS also lacks guidance on reviewing and verifying the results of its guard-file reviews. Without such guidance, FPS may not be able to determine the accuracy of its monthly file review results or if its contract guard companies are complying with the guard training and certification requirements."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the Secretary of DHS direct FPS to take immediate steps to determine which guards have not had screener or active-shooter scenario training and provide it to them; require that guard instructors be certified to teach basic and refresher training; and develop and implement guidance for selecting guard files and verifying the results.

These facilities house 1.1 million occupants and  average 1.4 million visitors per day. To help accomplish the mission of  protecting federal facilities, FPS obligated about $767 million in fiscal year  2012 for contract guard companies to provide about 13,500 guards at  over half of GSA\u2019s facilities. In recent years, we have reported on the  challenges FPS faces overseeing its contract guard program. Specifically,  in August 2012, we reported that FPS had no centralized database to  ensure that guards have completed required training and have the  appropriate certifications and qualifications to be deployed at federal  facilities. In 2010, we reported that FPS\u2019s contract guard program  required more oversight and that FPS should reassess its use of contract  guards. We recommended, among other things, that FPS develop and  implement a comprehensive guard management system capable of  providing reliable, comprehensive data on its contract guard program on a  real time basis, and that FPS provide guards with building-specific and  scenario-based training and guidance. Our 2010 and 2012 reports  contained 13 recommendations.

We  drew a non-generalizable sample of 31 contracts from FPS\u2019s 117 guard  services contracts (one contract for every guard company with which FPS  has contracted for non-emergency guard services). Eleven of the 31  guard contracts were chosen based on geographic diversity and  geographic density of contracts within FPS regions to allow us to conduct  file reviews for multiple contracts during each of four site visits that we  conducted. For each of these 11 contracts, we reviewed the contracts as  well as a random sample of guard files associated with each contract.  The remaining 20 guard services contracts we selected were the most  recent contract for each of the remaining guard companies that FPS had  contracted with as of November 2012. We also interviewed officials from  each of the 31 contract guard companies and industry stakeholders,  including the National Association of Security Companies (NASCO), the  Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Academies (CALEA),  the Federal Law Enforcement Training Accreditation Board (FLETA), and  the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s (DHS) Interagency Security  Committee (ISC). To determine how FPS\u2019s requirements compare to  those of other agencies that contract for guard services, we selected six  federal agencies that contract for guard services and reviewed their  requirements and processes for managing their contract guards.", "Agencies were selected based on survey responses regarding use of  contract guards for a previous GAO report and discussions with guard  companies and industry stakeholders. Specifically, we reviewed policies  and interviewed officials from the Department of Energy (DOE), the  National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the Department  of Defense\u2019s Pentagon Force Protection Agency (PFPA), the Department  of State (State), the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts  (Kennedy Center), and the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum (Holocaust  Museum). Our findings from our review of these agencies\u2019 practices are  not generalizeable to other agencies that contract for guard services.  However, the six agencies we selected are comparable to FPS because  they also are responsible for protecting and providing guard services to a  large number and wide variety of federal facilities such as public buildings  and museums.", "To determine the extent to which contract guard companies documented  compliance with FPS\u2019s guard training and certification requirements, we  examined documentation related to our non-generalizeable sample of 11  contracts, as previously discussed. From these 11 contracts, we  randomly selected 276 guard files to review for compliance with FPS  requirements. For each guard file, we compared the file documents to a  list of requirements contained in FPS\u2019s Administrative Audit and  Protective Security Officer File Review Forms, which FPS uses to  conduct its monthly guard file reviews.", "To identify the management controls and processes FPS and the guard  companies use to ensure compliance with training, certification, and  qualification requirements, we reviewed FPS\u2019s procedures for (1)  conducting monthly guard file reviews; (2) documenting compliance with  guard training, certification, and qualification requirements; and (3)  monitoring performance. We also visited 4 of FPS\u2019s 11 regions to discuss  how regional officials ensure that guards are qualified to be deployed to  federal facilities. We selected the 4 regions to provide geographic density  of contracts in the region to facilitate reviews of guard files, diversity in the  size of guard companies, and geographic diversity. During regional visits,  we interviewed FPS regional managers, contract guard program  managers, contracting officers, contracting officer\u2019s representatives, and  inspectors regarding oversight policies and practices and challenges to  ensuring compliance with requirements. In addition, we interviewed  officials from each of FPS\u2019s 31 guard companies regarding their policies  and procedures for complying with FPS\u2019s guard training and certification  requirements. While the results of our work are not generalizeable, about  40 percent of the GSA facilities with guards are located in the four regions  where we conducted our site visits and our review of guard files involved  11 of FPS\u2019s 31 guard companies. To assess the extent to which FPS  monthly guard file review results identified files with missing  documentation of training, certifications, and qualifications, we compared  FPS\u2019s monthly file review results from the month in which we conducted  our file review for each of the 11 contracts to identify guard files that were  included in both our review and FPS\u2019s monthly review. We identified any  discrepancies between the reviews and used FPS\u2019s file review forms to  examine the discrepancies.", "We conducted this performance audit from August 2012 through  September 2013 in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards.

In 2009 and 2010,  we reported that FPS had not provided screener training to 1,500 contract  guards in one FPS region. In response to our reports, FPS stated that it  planned to implement a program to train its inspectors to provide screener  training to all of its contract guards. Under this program, FPS planned to  first provide x-ray and magnetometer training to its inspectors who would  subsequently be responsible for training the guards. However, FPS  continues to have guards deployed to federal facilities without this  training.", "As noted in table 1, FPS requires all guards to receive 8 hours of initial  screener training provided by FPS. Screener training is important  because guards control access points at federal facilities and thus must  be able to properly operate x-ray and magnetometer machines and  understand their results. However, 3 years after our 2010 report, guards  are deployed to federal facilities who have never received this training.  For example, an official at one contract guard company stated that 133 of  its approximately 350 guards (about 38 percent) on three separate FPS  contracts (awarded in 2009) have never received their initial x-ray and  magnetometer training from FPS. The official stated that some of these  guards are working at screening posts without having received the  training. Further, officials at another guard company in a different FPS  region stated that, according to their records, 78 of 295 guards (about 26  percent) deployed under their contract have never received FPS\u2019s x-ray  and magnetometer training. These officials stated that FPS\u2019s regional  officials were informed of the problem, but allowed guards to continue to  work under this contract, despite not having completed required training.  Because FPS is responsible for this training, according to guard company  officials, no action was taken against the company. In May 2013, FPS  headquarters officials stated that they were unaware of any regions in  which guards had not received screener training.", "In July 2013, according to FPS officials, the agency began designing a  \u201ctrain-the-trainer\u201d pilot program with four guard companies. Through this  pilot program, contract guard company instructors, in addition to FPS  inspectors, will be certified to provide screener training to guards. FPS  officials stated that they plan to implement the pilot program in the first  quarter of 2014. According to FPS officials, once implemented, FPS\u2019s  train-the-trainer program should increase the number of certified  instructors capable of providing screener training nationwide. If this  program is fully implemented, FPS screener training could be provided  largely by the guard companies. This is the method by which four of the  six agencies we spoke with provide their guards with screener training. In  addition, officials from 13 of the 31 guard companies that we interviewed  stated that responsibility for x-ray and magnetometer training should be  shifted to the guard companies to alleviate scheduling problems, while  officials from 7 companies stated that FPS should retain this  responsibility. The remaining 11 guard companies did not state an opinion  on this issue. FPS\u2019s train-the-trainer program could provide resources to  address the challenges it faces in providing screener training to guards.  However, the program is in its beginning stages and there are still guards  deployed to federal facilities who have not received required screener  training. Screener training is essential to helping prevent unauthorized  individuals and items from entering federal facilities. Thus, it is critical that  FPS immediately provide this training to those guards who have not  received it.", "According to FPS officials, the agency requires its guards to receive  training on how to respond to an active-shooter scenario, but we found  that some guards have not received it. According to DHS, an active  shooter is an individual killing or attempting to kill people in a confined  and populated area. Since June 2009 there have been several incidents  involving active-shooters at government facilities. For instance, in 2010  an active-shooter opened fire in the Lloyd D. George Federal Courthouse  in Las Vegas, Nevada, killing a security officer and wounding a deputy  U.S. Marshal.", "According to FPS officials, since 2010, it has provided training on how  guards should respond during an active-shooter incident to guards as part  of the 8-hour FPS-provided orientation training guards receive. FPS  officials were not able to specify how much time is devoted to this  training, but said that it is a small portion of the 2-hour special situations   In addition, officials stated that guards hired before 2010 should  training.have received this information during guard-company-provided training on  the guards\u2019 post orders (which outline the duties and responsibilities  associated with each guard post and include information on responding to  an active-shooter situation) during basic and refresher training.", "However, when we asked contract guard company officials if their guards  had received training on how guards should respond during active- shooter incidents, responses varied. For example, of the 16 contract  guard companies we interviewed about this topic: eight contract guard company officials stated that their guards have  received active-shooter scenario training during orientation,  five guard company officials stated that FPS has not provided active- shooter scenario training to their guards, and  three guard companies stated that FPS had not provided active- shooter scenario training to their guards during the FPS-provided  orientation training, but that the topic was covered in one of the  following ways: during guard company-provided basic training or refresher training,", "FPS provided on-the-job instruction on the topic during post", "FPS provided a link to an active-shooter training video, which the  company shows its guards.", "The six agencies we reviewed\u2014State, the Holocaust Museum, NASA,  PFPA, the Kennedy Center, and DOE\u2014also recognize this threat and five  of them require active-shooter response training for their contract guards.  According to officials at DOE, the agency is in the process of requiring  guards to complete active-shooter response training to ensure they are  capable of addressing this threat and protecting facility occupants.  Similarly, Holocaust Museum officials stated that they require this training  because current trends in law enforcement warrant active-shooter  response training for guards.", "In May 2013, an FPS official stated that the agency is collaborating with  its guard companies to develop a standardized national lesson plan for  guards and revising the Security Guard Information Manual (SGIM). FPS  officials stated that the lesson plan being developed is meant to  standardize the training guards receive. However, according to the  official, FPS has not yet decided whether the national lesson plan will  specify countermeasures necessary to mitigate threats from active  shooters. FPS does not have a timeline for developing or implementing a  national lesson plan for guards. Until it develops one, some guards may  continue to go without training on how guards should respond to incidents  at federal facilities involving an active shooter.", "FPS requires some contract guard company instructor certifications, but  does not require guard company instructors to be certified to teach basic  or refresher training or have any training in basic instructional techniques.  According to ISC guidance, training is a critical component of developing  a well-qualified guard force and all training should be done with a certified  instructor or training organization. Similarly, Federal Law Enforcement  Training Accreditation Board (FLETA)training programs have an instructor development course and review  process to ensure that instructors provide consistent, quality instruction.  FPS requires that guard instructors be certified to provide training in CPR,  first aid, AED, and firearms and have a minimum of 2 years of law  enforcement, military, or security training experience. However, FPS has  no certification requirements for instructors teaching the guards\u2019 basic  and refresher training, nor does FPS require instructors to be  knowledgeable in instructional techniques. Basic training, which  represents 64 hours of the initial 120 hours of training that guards receive,  and the 40-hour refresher class cover topics included in the SGIM, such  as access control and crime detection and response.", "In contrast to FPS, three of the six selected agencies that we reviewed  (NASA, DOE, and the Holocaust Museum) require guard instructors to  attend instructor training or to be certified by the agency. For example,  NASA requires contract guard company instructors to be certified by a  NASA training academy. NASA stated that instructor certification  requirements have reduced legal liabilities, ensured standardization of  training, and led to greater efficiency of its training programs throughout  the agency. Under NASA\u2019s instructor certification program, instructors  must meet the following requirements, among others:  completed training from the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center  (FLETC);", "2-week internship as a student instructor to observe and work with an  established instructor, including an evaluation; physical fitness requirements;  re-evaluation every 2 years to ensure instructors are effective and  follow required lesson plans; and annual workshop for instructors on curriculum development.", "Similarly, DOE requires that in addition to specific certifications for the  level of training they provide, instructors must complete a basic instructor  training course and be evaluated for competency at least once every 36  months.", "According to some of FPS\u2019s guard companies, the absence of an  instructor certification requirement has affected the quality of training  provided to some guards. For example, 6 of FPS\u2019s 31 contract guard  companies stated that they have experienced problems related to training  quality when taking over a contract from a previous guard company and  employing guards who had worked for the previous company. The  companies stated that they either retrained or did not hire guards who  they believed had been inadequately trained by the previous company. In  these situations, costs may be passed on to FPS via increased rates for  guard services to account for the increased training costs to guard  companies. Four of the 31 guard companies stated that they already have  additional requirements or training for instructors. However, such  additional requirements and training are on a company-by-company basis  and do not necessarily conform to any standards. Sixteen of the guard  companies and officials from FLETA and CALEA stated that FPS should  standardize instructor training and certification requirements or require  FPS certification for guard instructors. Such standardization would help  ensure quality and consistency in the training received by guards  providing protective services across GSA\u2019s federal buildings. FPS officials  stated that FPS reviews each instructor\u2019s resume to ensure that  instructors have the minimum qualifications necessary to provide guard  instruction."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Twenty-three Percent of Contract Guard Files We Reviewed Did Not Have Required Training and Certification Documentation", "paragraphs": ["Some contract guard files we reviewed did not contain all required  documentation.

For example, three of the four regions we visited  told us that they review randomly selected files either at the guard  company\u2019s office or the guard company gives them electronic access to  the files for review. In contrast, officials in the fourth FPS region stated  that they submit a list of the selected guard files to the guard company 24  to 48 hours before the file review and request that the files be delivered  either electronically or in hard copy to the regional office. As such,  contract guard company officials in that region stated that they can review  the selected files to ensure that they comply with requirements prior to  delivering them to FPS. FPS headquarters officials stated that this  indicates that guard company officials are performing due diligence to  ensure the file is up to date. However, this practice decreases the utility of  randomly selecting files for review and reduces the ability of FPS  reviewers to accurately assess the guard company\u2019s ongoing ability to  keep all of its guard files up to date. Additionally, officials at a contract  guard company in another FPS region stated that the COR occasionally  asks the guard company to select the files for review and bring them to  the regional office. FPS stated that this is not standard practice. Allowing  contract guard company officials to select files for review by FPS could  result in selection bias and affect the results of FPS\u2019s review.", "FPS headquarters officials stated that monthly file review results are  reported to headquarters and that the data are combined into a  spreadsheet, summarizing the number of deficiencies by contract, region,  and nationally. Officials stated that these data are used to identify  possible trends in vendor documentation and to determine if corrective  actions need to be taken at the regional level. However, if file review  results are affected by selection bias or by guard company actions to alter  the contents of the files selected for review, these data may not lead to an  accurate understanding of trends or the need for corrective action."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FPS Lacks Guidance on Reviewing and Verifying File Review Results", "paragraphs": ["The Government Performance and Results Act Modernization Act of 2010  requires agencies to develop an approach to validation and verification in  order to assess the reliability of performance data. However, FPS\u2019s  directive regarding monthly file reviews, discussed above, does not  include requirements for reviewing and verifying the results of the file  reviews. From March 2012 through March 2013, FPS reviewed more than  23,000 guard files as part of its monthly review process. FPS found that a  majority of the guard files had the required documentation but more than  800 (about 3 percent) did not. FPS\u2019s file reviews for that period showed  files missing, for example, documentation of screener training, initial  weapons training, CPR certification, and firearms qualifications. However,  without an approach to reviewing and verifying results, FPS is not able to  use these results to accurately assess the performance of its contract  guard companies in complying with training and certification  requirements.", "As part of its monthly file reviews for November 2012 through March  2013, FPS reviewed some of the same guard files we examined, but our  results differed substantially from what FPS found. Specifically, we  compared the results of FPS\u2019s file reviews for the 11 contracts for which  we conducted file reviews; we found that 29 of the 276 files we reviewed  had also been reviewed by FPS. FPS\u2019s review and our examination of  each file occurred in the same month. For each of the 29 files, FPS did  not identify any missing documentation. In contrast, we found that 6 of the  29 files did not have the required training and certification documentation  (and some were missing more than one required document). In 4 of the 6  guard files, FPS\u2019s review indicated that required documentation was  present, but we were not able to find documentation of training and  certification, such as initial weapons training, DHS orientation, and pre- employment drug screenings. We also identified files with expired  documentation. For example, 2 of the 6 files had expired refresher- training documentation and another guard file had expired firearms  qualification documentation. Since we used FPS\u2019s file review checklist to  conduct our file review, it is unclear why the results differed. FPS officials  were unsure about the reasons for this, but stated that human error and  contract requirements that differ from the requirements listed on  administrative audit forms may have been factors.", "Additionally, differing results may be due to differences in the type of  documentation accepted by GAO and FPS. For example, in our review of  FPS monthly file review records for one contract, we identified 2 files for  which, according to the PSO file review form, the FPS reviewer accepted  documentation of CPR and AED training that we did not accept as valid.  While FPS guard contracts require guard files to contain a copy of the  CPR and AED certification card, the FPS reviewer accepted a roster of  individuals who attended the training. However, the roster did not indicate  whether attendees had passed the course or been officially certified and  was not signed by an instructor.", "FPS can take action against guard companies if it determines that a  contract guard company has not complied with contractual requirements,  but it may not have accurate information to do so. FPS\u2019s contracts for  guard services state that if guard companies do not comply with contract  requirements (e.g., guard training, certification, and qualification  requirements), FPS may require the contractor to take actions to ensure  compliance in the future and also may reduce the contract price to reflect  the reduced value of the service provided. Determining the extent to  which FPS took actions against guard companies for not complying with  guard training and certification requirements was not within the scope of  our engagement. However, the results of our comparison of FPS\u2019s guard  file reviews to our reviews raises questions about whether FPS has  effective management controls in place to identify areas in which guard  companies have not complied with requirements."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["FPS continues to lack the management controls to ensure that its  approximately 13,500 contract guards have the required training,  certification, and qualifications, which are central to effectively protecting  employees and visitors in federal facilities. FPS agreed with the  recommendations in our 2010 and 2012 reports. We recommended,  among other things, that FPS develop and implement a comprehensive  system for guard oversight. Without such a system, among other things,  FPS has no independent means of ensuring that its 13,500 guards  deployed to federal facilities are properly trained and qualified. As such,  we strongly encourage FPS to continue addressing the challenges we  identified in our prior work and to be more proactive in managing its  contract guard workforce. Although FPS has taken steps to address some  of our prior recommendations, we found that FPS still has challenges  providing screener training to some guards. Consequently, some guards  deployed to federal facilities may be using x-ray and magnetometer  equipment that they are not qualified to use. This raises questions about  the capability of some guards to screen access control points at federal  facilities\u2500one of their primary responsibilities.", "According to FPS officials, the agency has recently decided to make  changes to its guard program, including developing a national lesson  plan. We agree with this decision, given the problems that we have  identified. A national lesson plan could help FPS standardize and ensure  consistency in its training efforts. For example, without ensuring that all  guards receive training on how to respond to incidents at federal facilities  involving an active shooter, FPS has limited assurance that its guards are  prepared for this threat. Similarly, the lack of certification requirements for  instructors who teach basic and refresher training may ultimately affect  guards\u2019 ability to perform their duties.", "Finally, inconsistencies in how FPS regional officials conduct monthly file  reviews (which are FPS\u2019s primary management control for ensuring  compliance with the guard contract requirements) indicate that the current  guidance for monthly file reviews is insufficient to ensure that, for  instance, guard companies do not have the opportunity to select files for  review and thus affect the results of the file reviews. Further, our work  raises questions about the reliability and quality of FPS\u2019s monthly file  reviews. These findings are of particular concern given that FPS  continues to pay guard companies over half a billion dollars annually to  provide qualified guards yet it appears that some guards have been  deployed to federal facilities without meeting all of the training,  certification, and qualification requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To improve the management and oversight of FPS\u2019s contract guard  program, we recommend that the Secretary of Homeland Security direct  the Under Secretary of NPPD and the Director of FPS to take the  following three actions:  take immediate steps to determine which guards have not had  screener or active-shooter scenario training and provide it to them  and, as part of developing a national lesson plan, decide how and  how often these trainings will be provided in the future require that contract guard companies\u2019 instructors be certified to teach  basic and refresher training courses to guards and evaluate whether a  standardized instructor certification process should be implemented;  and develop and implement procedures for monthly guard-file reviews to  ensure consistency in selecting files and verifying the results."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to DHS for review and comment.
