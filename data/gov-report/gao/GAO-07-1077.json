The potential destruction, incapacitation, or exploitation of critical DIB assets by attack, crime, technological failure, natural disaster, or man-made catastrophe could jeopardize the success of U.S. military operations. GAO was asked to review the Department of Defense's (DOD) Defense Critical Infrastructure Program and has already reported that DOD has not developed a comprehensive management plan for its implementation. This, the second GAO report, has (1) determined the status of DOD's efforts to develop and implement a risk management approach to ensure the availability of DIB assets, and (2) identified challenges DOD faces in its approach to risk management. GAO analyzed plans, guidance, and other documents on identifying, prioritizing, and assessing critical domestic and foreign DIB assets and held discussions with DOD and contractor officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["DOD has begun developing and implementing a risk management approach to ensure the availability of DIB assets needed to support mission-essential tasks, though implementation is still at an early stage. Its sector assurance and sector-specific plans focus on steps to identify a list of critical assets that, if damaged, would result in unacceptable consequences; prioritize those critical assets based on a risk assessment process; perform vulnerability assessments on high-priority critical assets, and encourage contractors' actions to remediate or mitigate adverse effects found during these assessments, as appropriate, to ensure continuity of business. The Defense Contract Management Agency, the executing agency for the DIB, has developed a process to identify the most important DIB assets and to narrow this list to those it considers critical. It has also developed an asset prioritization model for determining a criticality score and ranking critical assets, and it has established a standardized mission assurance vulnerability assessment process for critical DIB assets. DOD faces several key challenges in implementing its DIB risk management approach. Overall, DOD's methodology for identifying critical DIB assets is evolving, and DOD lacks targets and time frames for completing development of key program elements that are needed for its risk management approach. Without them, DOD cannot measure its progress toward ensuring that DIB assets supporting critical DOD missions are properly identified and prioritized. The specific challenges are as follows: First, DOD is not fully incorporating the military services' mission-essential task information (i.e., listings of assets whose damage, degradation, or destruction would result in DOD-wide mission failure) in compiling its critical asset list. Second, GAO's analysis of DOD's prioritization model shows that weighting factors were selected and data determined according to subjective decisions and limited review, and that needed contractor-specific data were lacking, as was comprehensive threat information, thus undermining the utility of the index score for prioritizing contractors. Without these comprehensive data and a reliable asset prioritization model, DOD will not be in a sound position to know that it has identified the most important and critical assets, as called for in the National Military Strategy. Third, with regard to scheduling and conducting assessments of critical DIB assets, DOD is currently doing so based on contractor amenability and security clearance status without regard for assets' priority rankings, and thus cannot ensure that the most critical DIB contractors are assessed. Fourth, DOD lacks a plan for developing options to work with the Department of State and other appropriate agencies to identify and address potential challenges in assessing vulnerabilities in foreign critical DIB assets. Until all these challenges are addressed, DOD will lack the visibility it needs over critical DIB asset vulnerabilities, will be unable to encourage critical DIB contractors to take needed remediation actions, and will be unable to make informed decisions regarding limited resources."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. military relies on the defense industrial base (DIB) to meet  military requirements to fulfill the National Military Strategy.

The DIB comprises hundreds of thousands of industrial sites, and  the preponderance of the DIB is privately owned and includes businesses  of all sizes. The potential destruction, incapacitation, or exploitation of  critical DIB assets by terrorist attack, criminal activity, technological  failure, natural disaster, or man-made catastrophe could jeopardize the  success of U.S. military operations.

While risk  generally cannot be eliminated, it can be reduced by taking actions such as  establishing backup systems to protect against or reduce the effect of an  incident. DOD\u2019s risk management approach is based on assessments of  threats, vulnerabilities, and criticality, and requires DCMA to identify and  prioritize its most critical assets, assess vulnerabilities, and identify  remediation requirements.

The approach calls for multidisciplinary teams to conduct  performance-based assessments to identify vulnerabilities of critical  missions and recommend ways to mitigate those vulnerabilities. DOD  found these efforts to be effective, but costly and time consuming. It  developed a set of standards to conduct vulnerability assessments,  building on other vulnerability assessment methods DOD has used.  Working through DCMA and the National Guard Bureau, DOD has  established a standardized mission assurance assessment for application  to critical DIB assets. These assessments consider effect, vulnerability,  and threat/hazard from natural disaster, technological failure, human  error, criminal activity, or terrorist attack. To perform assessments, DCMA  partners with the Defense Security Service (DSS), the Counter Intelligence  Field Activity, the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), and appropriate  federal, state, and local law enforcement to identify and characterize all  hazard threats to key assets, and uses benchmarks and standards to  ensure consistency within the DIB and the broader DCIP community.", "The assessment process typically involves (1) using the critical asset list to  select the DIB contractor candidate for assessment; (2) notifying the  selected DIB asset to schedule the vulnerability assessment;                      (3) conducting a preassessment briefing with the contractor; (4)  scheduling the assessment; (5) negotiating a memorandum of agreement  with the contractor to coordinate the terms of the assessment; (6)  performing the assessment, which is designed to assess vulnerability to a  broad spectrum of threats; (7) providing an outbriefing; and (8) writing a  final vulnerability assessment report.", "The process for conducting vulnerability assessments on critical DIB  contractors is early in implementation and only 8 of the planned 203 have  been completed, with reports issued, as of June 1, 2007. DCMA estimated  that conducting assessments on all critical DIB assets will take several  years. Between fiscal years 2003 and 2006, DOD considered and evaluated  different approaches that might be used in conducting on-site vulnerability  assessments. For example, five assessments of different types were done  by different DOD groups prior to fiscal year 2006. With the benefit of the  earlier assessments, DCMA in fiscal year 2006 developed a pilot project  that included six vulnerability assessments and used the information  gained to develop an approach for conducting on-site vulnerability  assessments at all critical DIB asset locations. DCMA had settled on a  methodology for outreach to contractors, a standardized approach for  conducting on-site vulnerability assessments, and training for National  Guard teams to conduct these assessments.

In addition, DCMA officials said that,  as a result of the pilot assessments, they plan to change the process on  future assessments. For example, rather than a single visit to the  contractor to perform the entire assessment, they intend to conduct an  advance site visit to identify key officials, gather information, and perform  preliminary analyses on manufacturing and infrastructure.

Without independent formal review of its asset prioritization model,  DCMA cannot be assured that the model is valid and suitable for its  intended purpose."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Needed Contractor-Specific Data Are Missing", "paragraphs": ["Our review of the model also revealed that contractor-specific data were  missing for a number of the critical assets. DCMA collects open-source  and in-house statistical data on contractor operations, but it lacks some  needed contractor-specific information from the DIB contractors on their  operations for use in the model. DCMA has undertaken two surveys to  obtain these needed data and is planning a third survey, but these efforts  depend on contractors\u2019 willingness to provide business sensitive  information and they have thus far not been fully successful.", "The model does not distinguish between assets marked as high risk by  default for lack of data and those for whom data corroborate the high-risk  designation. Our review of the asset prioritization model found that DIB  contractors with similar entries based on missing data for several factors  may not be differentiated one from another; it was not always apparent  whether some contractors were identified as high risk because of an  unavailability of data or the presence of data that justified the  identification. The ability to distinguish between high scores due to risk  and high scores due to missing data has important implications for  resource allocation, for data collection and assessment, and for risk  remediation. Additionally, prioritization of data collection should focus on  those items that are most mission-critical and have the highest weight in  the model\u2019s scores.", "DCMA has conducted two surveys, called industrial capabilities  assessments, to obtain contractor-specific information on DIB assets, but  both of these efforts have met with limited response rates. DCMA officials  said this was due at least partly to contractors\u2019 reluctance to provide  information. In 2004 DCMA sent a questionnaire to obtain additional  information from DIB contractors. DCMA had requested this information  using a cover letter to the companies signed by the Assistant Secretary of  Defense for Homeland Defense (ASD-HD) and coordinated with DCMA  officials in the field. DCMA officials said that these steps were taken to  help ensure a greater response to the survey. Nevertheless, of those  responding, some of the survey forms were incomplete and some of the  data provided were determined to be unreliable. In 2005, DCMA sent a  revised questionnaire, but it was not administered with the same level of  discipline used in the first one. For example, it did not use DOD on-site  personnel to help ensure high response rates, and only 30 percent of those  surveyed responded. Again, responses were incomplete and some of the  data were not considered reliable. DOD officials said that contractors  were more reluctant to provide certain types of data, such as financial,  disaster planning, reconstitution, and especially forecast data. DCMA did  not conduct a survey in 2006.", "DCMA is planning another effort in fiscal year 2007 to send out a revised  capabilities-assessment questionnaire to DIB contractors. DCMA officials  are in the process of revising and expanding on the assessment to be sent  to contractors to more specifically address critical infrastructure  protection. Once DCMA has finalized the critical asset list for 2007, it is  planning to conduct a new industrial capabilities survey. However, it will  take several months for DIB critical contractors to receive, fill out, and  return the industrial capabilities survey; and DCMA has not identified  specific steps to ensure that this survey receives a high response rate with  quality information."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Model Does Not Yet Incorporate Comprehensive Threat Information", "paragraphs": ["Our review of DOD\u2019s asset prioritization model also revealed a lack of  comprehensive threat information. DOD officials told us that intelligence- gathering agencies currently provide information to DCMA through ad hoc  agreements, as opposed to a more formalized arrangement. The collection  and analysis of DIB-related intelligence information has evolved over time  between such agencies as DSS, Counter Intelligence Field Activity, and  DCMA. According to DCMA as well other DOD officials, DCMA does not  receive comprehensive threat information from the appropriate  intelligence agencies to enable it to accurately prioritize DIB assets. These  intelligence agencies include the National Counterterrorism Center, DHS\u2019s  Office of Intelligence and Analysis and its Homeland Infrastructure Threat  and Risk Analysis Center, the FBI, and others. While DCMA obtains  information for prioritization from the Counter Intelligence Field Activity,  DCMA does not routinely obtain full threat information from these other  intelligence agencies.

According to DCMA, one purpose  of the prioritization model is to rank critical assets and to use this order to  prioritize assessments. DCMA should schedule and conduct its  vulnerability assessments on the critical DIB assets based upon their  respective rankings as validated in the asset prioritization model.", "Furthermore, DOD has not established targets or time frames for resolving  this issue.", "The assessments to be performed should be identified from a  comprehensive critical asset list that has been ranked based on a reliable  asset prioritization model. However, DCMA has not used the rankings  from its asset prioritization model to schedule outreach visits or on-site  vulnerability assessments. According to DCMA officials, a high score on  the model should result in DCMA\u2019s contacting the contractor to conduct a  vulnerability assessment. However, they said that coordinating on-site  assessments is complicated and highly sensitive. DCMA officials say that  lack of facility security clearances complicates their efforts to get DIB  contractors to participate in DOD\u2019s risk management program because  DCMA cannot inform uncleared contractors that they are on the classified  critical asset list or discuss with them vulnerabilities found at their  facilities. Consequently, officials have devoted outreach efforts, first, to  those contractors at facilities having the necessary security clearances,  and next, to those that DCMA officials believe would be most amenable to  undergoing an assessment. About 52 percent of the DIB facilities identified  as critical lack security clearances for the facility or any of its personnel,  and thus cannot receive vulnerability assessments or discuss needed  remediation actions. DSS officials told us that, though they recognized that  many critical contractors did not have facility security clearances, DSS  lacks the resources needed to preemptively clear all critical DIB facilities.", "In further explaining why they have not followed the prioritization ranking  in conducting assessments, DCMA officials said that because private- sector DIB contractors\u2019 participation in the program is voluntary, DCMA  must rely on the contractors\u2019 willingness to cooperate and provide  information. According to DCMA officials, some DIB contractors have had  concerns about sharing information that they consider proprietary, and  about the possibility of incurring additional costs and liabilities to correct  any vulnerabilities identified as part of this program as a result of sharing  this information. These concerns regarding sharing information with DOD  were echoed by some of the DIB contractors with whom we spoke, for a  variety of reasons. For example, when asked about his willingness to share  certain information with DOD, one DIB contractor we spoke with said that  he was concerned that information that he deemed proprietary or  potentially damaging to the company could somehow be released or  disclosed, and he was unsure how DOD would protect such information.  Furthermore, DOD officials noted that some significant DIB contractors  are involved in classified, special access programs that could involve  military mission-essential tasks and as a result may not be allowed or  willing to share certain types of information. They also noted that there is  no similar effort to identify critical DIB assets from the classified special  access program perspective. Consequently, some significant critical DIB  assets may not currently be included as part of the program.", "DCMA officials told us that, in order to overcome resistance from those  DIB contractors that may be reluctant to share information and participate  in the program, they have developed tactics that in some cases have been  successful in promoting greater voluntary participation. For example, in at  least one case, DCMA requested that a high-level DOD official reach out to  the contractor directly and make the informational request. Also, DCMA  officials told us that they develop memoranda of agreement with  contractors that delineate what the on-site assessment will entail, what the  assessment team and the company are agreeing to do, and the manner in  which the contractor\u2019s information will be used and protected. DCMA  officials told us that while these steps have resulted in progress, they have  also been time-consuming and have affected the sequence according to  which critical DIB contractors have been scheduled for assessment.", "The program, and DCMA\u2019s outreach and educational efforts in eliciting  contractor information, continue to evolve. For example, the sector- specific plan states that DOD plans to develop an accreditation plan for  identifying and certifying Protected Critical Infrastructure Information  (PCII) under DHS\u2019s PCII program. The PCII program was established by  DHS pursuant to the Critical Infrastructure Information Act of 2002. The  act provides that critical infrastructure information that is voluntarily  submitted to DHS for use by DHS regarding the security of critical  infrastructure and protected systems, analysis, warning, interdependency  study, recovery, reconstitution, or other informational purpose, when  accompanied by an express statement, shall receive various protections,  including exemption from disclosure under the Freedom of Information  Act. If such information is validated by DHS as PCII, then the information  can only be shared with authorized users. Before accessing and storing  PCII, organizations or entities must be accredited and have a PCII officer.  Authorized users can request access to PCII on a need-to-know basis, but  users outside of DHS do not have the authority to store PCII until their  agency is accredited. However, the lack of accreditation does not  otherwise prevent entities from sharing information directly with DOD.", "However, we noted in our April 2006 report that nonfederal entities  continued to be reluctant to provide their sensitive information to DHS  because they were not certain that their information will be fully  protected, used for future legal or regulatory action, or inadvertently  released. Since our April report, DHS published on September 1, 2006, its  final rule implementing the act, but we have not examined whether  nonfederal entities are more willing to provide sensitive information to  DHS under the act at this time, or DOD\u2019s cost to apply for, receive, and  maintain accreditation. However, one of the DIB contractors we  interviewed mentioned generally that while some advances have been  made in information protection, such as the establishment of the PCII  program, the contractor continues to be concerned that the program has  yet to demonstrate that it can provide good security for contractor- provided information, and remains wary about damage from public or  competitor disclosure.", "DCMA officials also pursued new legislation and additional provisions for  the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation in order to, in their view,  potentially increase industry participation, but these changes were  ultimately not enacted. For example, DCMA officials had drafted a  legislative proposal that stated that \u201ccritical supplier assessments and  company specific assessments developed under the Defense Critical  Infrastructure Program, evaluating the security of Defense Critical  Suppliers, shall not be disclosed under the Freedom of Information Act.\u201d", "However, DCMA officials told us that the legislative proposal was  ultimately not approved to be included in the DOD legislative proposals  that are sent to the Congress for consideration and there are no current  plans within DOD to pursue this legislation. In addition, DCMA officials  also pursued the addition of clauses to the Defense Federal Acquisition  Regulation. The language that was proposed would have included several  provisions pertaining to the critical infrastructure of the defense industrial  base, such as stating that the contractor shall be responsible for the  overall organizational physical protection and security of its own critical  infrastructures; have in place a comprehensive security plan relating to  overall plant and facility security designed to protect its critical  infrastructures; that the government shall be permitted to conduct or  facilitate vulnerability and mission assurance assessments under the DCIP.

The DIB sector-specific plan recognizes the challenge involved when DIB  assets are located in foreign countries, and states that where DIB assets  are located in foreign countries many of the plan\u2019s proposed activities  could be perceived as U.S. government intrusion into sovereign areas of  the host country, particularly with respect to threats and vulnerabilities.  The plan also recognizes that DOD and the DIB Sector Coordinating  Council must ensure that DIB protection activities are coordinated with  U.S. embassies and host governments; that where pertinent treaties exist,  activities should conform to them; and that a strategy needs to be  developed for an action plan in foreign countries with DIB assets."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["DOD is in the process of implementing a risk management approach to  identify, prioritize, evaluate, and remediate threats, vulnerabilities, and  risks to critical DIB assets, including those DIB assets that are critical to  achieving DOD\u2019s mission-essential tasks. Several key challenges to the  implementation of this program need to be addressed in order for DOD to  be able to ensure that its approach is sound. First, in identifying and  prioritizing critical DIB assets, DOD is not currently incorporating data  reflecting mission-essential task information from all of the services.  Second, in order for DOD\u2019s asset prioritization model to be reliable, the  model would benefit from appropriate external technical review, and it  also lacks selected contractor-specific data that need to be provided by  DIB contractors, as well as comprehensive threat information from the  appropriate intelligence agencies. Without a comprehensive list of critical  assets and a reliable asset prioritization model, DOD cannot ensure that it  has identified the most important DIB critical assets, as is necessary for  carrying out the National Military Strategy. Third, DOD is currently  scheduling and conducting assessments based on contractor amenability  and security clearance status, rather than on the rankings assigned to  critical DIB assets according to its asset prioritization model. Unless DOD  assesses assets based on their rankings determined by a reliable asset  prioritization model, DOD will not be in a sound position to know that it is  assessing the most critical DIB assets or making the best use of limited  resources. Fourth, DOD has not yet developed a plan for identifying and  addressing potential challenges in assessing vulnerabilities of critical  foreign DIB contractors. As a result, vulnerabilities in these critical foreign  contractors can potentially threaten their availability to DOD. Until all of  these issues are addressed, DOD will lack the visibility it needs over  critical DIB asset vulnerabilities, will be unable to encourage critical DIB  contractors to take needed remediation actions, and will be unable to  make informed decisions regarding limited resources."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To manage the complete development of the risk management approach to  better ensure its effectiveness we recommend the Secretary of Defense  direct the ASD(HD&ASA) to develop a management framework that  includes targets and time frames and undertakes the following steps:    Obtain comprehensive data from all the combatant commands and  services based on mission-essential task information, and incorporate  these data with those set forth in DCMA guidance, to develop a  comprehensive list of the critical DIB assets.

DOD also commented that  developing a detailed plan may improve the contractor response rate and  data quality; but noted that participation by industry to provide  information is voluntary and contractors continue to be concerned with  the release of certain types of data, such as financial, disaster planning,  reconstitution, and especially forecast data. We agree that contractor  participation is voluntary but there are strategies available to DCMA to  improve response rates.
