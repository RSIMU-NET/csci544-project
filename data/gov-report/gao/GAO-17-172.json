Federal internal control standards state that management should implement control activities through policies and practices, including periodically reviewing control activities for continued effectiveness. DOD's Office of Small Business Programs (OSBP) manages the program and oversees program policies and procedures. However, OSBP does not review the DOD components' processes for approving mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 agreements and therefore has not taken appropriate oversight actions to provide reasonable assurance that agreements meet all requirements.

Some of these measures show that during this period, prot\u00e9g\u00e9s' revenue, number of employees, and DOD prime and subcontract awards increased while prot\u00e9g\u00e9s participated in the program, but revenues and employment levels decreased in the 2 years after their participation ended. GAO found that DOD has not established any measurable goals for these measures. In addition, DOD collects information from mentors on how they have enhanced the capabilities of prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, but DOD does not include this information in the program's annual report and has not developed performance measures or goals related to this information. GAO has previously identified performance measurement as a best practice that allows organizations to track progress and gives managers information to plan needed improvements. DOD officials told GAO they are working to develop measures that better indicate program outcomeseffectiveness, but as of January 2017 they had not established such measures.

DOD\u2019s Office of Small Business Programs  (OSBP) manages the program, including developing and overseeing the  policies and procedures for the program.  In addition, a number of DOD  components administer individual mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 agreements.  DOD  components and the mentors and prot\u00e9g\u00e9s that participate in the program  are required to follow DOD\u2019s regulations and policies and procedures. For  example, DOD\u2019s regulations state that the director of small business  programs for each DOD component has the authority to approve firms as  mentors and to approve mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 agreements, among other things.  OSBP has developed tools to facilitate program administration, including  a template to assist mentors and prot\u00e9g\u00e9s in developing proposed  agreements and a checklist to assist DOD components with ensuring that  proposed agreements address required elements, which we discuss later  in this report. However, DOD components and mentors and prot\u00e9g\u00e9s are  not required to use the tools.", "DOD\u2019s Pilot Mentor-Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Program offers two types of agreements.  Reimbursable agreements provide payments directly to the mentor for the  cost of providing developmental assistance to the prot\u00e9g\u00e9. Credit  agreements provide mentors with credit toward their subcontracting goals  for providing developmental assistance to prot\u00e9g\u00e9s.  Mentors can  provide prot\u00e9g\u00e9s with various types of assistance under mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9  agreements, including general business management, subcontract  awards, progress payments, advance payments, and loans.  Mentors  may also obtain assistance for prot\u00e9g\u00e9s from Small Business  Development Centers, Procurement Technical Assistance Centers,  historically black colleges and universities, and minority institutions of  higher education (see fig. 1).", "DOD policies and procedures also require mentors to report on the  progress made under active mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 agreements in semiannual  reports. Mentors must also include in semiannual reports, among other  things, (1) any assistance obtained by the mentor firm for the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 firm  from Small Business Development Centers, Procurement Technical  Assistance Centers, historically black colleges and universities, and  minority institutions of higher education for developmental assistance  provided to prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, (2) dollars credited (if any) toward applicable  subcontracting goals as a result of developmental assistance provided to  the prot\u00e9g\u00e9, and (3) the impact of the agreement in terms of capabilities  enhanced, certifications received, or technology transferred. In addition,  annual reports are to contain data on the prot\u00e9g\u00e9\u2019s employment, revenue,  and participation in DOD contracts. DOD procedures also require  prot\u00e9g\u00e9s to report on the progress made in each of the 2 years following  the completion of their agreement. Further, DOD procedures require the  Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA), another DOD  component that manages agreements for the department, to conduct a  performance review annually of each mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 agreement.", "DOD\u2019s process for establishing and approving mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9  agreements generally consists of nine steps (as illustrated in fig. 2):  1.  Mentor seeks approval to participate in program. A firm that is  interested in participating in the DOD Pilot Mentor-Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Program  must submit an application for approval as a mentor to the Director of  OSBP. To be eligible as a mentor, among other factors, a firm must  not be affiliated with the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 prior to the approval of the  agreement and must demonstrate it is qualified to provide assistance  that will contribute to the program\u2019s purpose, among other  requirements.  2.  Mentor establishes a counterpart. The mentor is solely responsible for  selecting the prot\u00e9g\u00e9. To be eligible as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9, a firm must be,  among other things, a women-owned small business, Historically  Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) small business, service- disabled veteran-owned small business, or an eligible entity  employing the severely disabled.  3.  Mentor conducts a needs assessment. Once the mentor selects the  prot\u00e9g\u00e9, the mentor conducts a preliminary assessment of the  prot\u00e9g\u00e9\u2019s developmental needs. The mentor and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 then  mutually agree on the developmental assistance that the mentor is to  provide to address those needs.  4.  Parties determine the type of agreement. The mentor and prot\u00e9g\u00e9  may apply for either a reimbursable mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 agreement or a  credit agreement.  5.  Parties develop the agreement. The mentor and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 develop a  proposed mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 agreement that must address a number of  required elements, which we discuss in greater detail later in this  report.  6.  Mentor submits proposed agreement for review. The mentor submits  the proposed agreement to the cognizant DOD component for review  and approval.  7.  DOD component approves or denies agreement. As previously noted,  the director of small business programs for each DOD component has  the authority to approve mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 agreements.  8.  Parties start the agreement. The mentor and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 begin the  agreement, which cannot generally exceed 3 years.  9.  Parties report on progress. The mentor is required to submit a  semiannual report on the progress made under an active mentor- prot\u00e9g\u00e9 agreement throughout the term of an agreement. The prot\u00e9g\u00e9  is required to submit an annual report on progress made during each  fiscal year of the program term and for each of the 2 fiscal years  following the expiration of the agreement.", "The NDAA for Fiscal Year 2016 made several changes to DOD\u2019s Pilot  Mentor-Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Program.  For example, with respect to the relationship  between a mentor firm and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 firm, the act strengthened affiliation  rules by explicitly stating that the presence of certain family relationships  between owners and managers in both the mentor and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 firms  constitutes affiliation and thereby is not allowed. In addition, the act  amended the size requirement so that DOD\u2019s size standard for prot\u00e9g\u00e9s  is set at less than half of that used by SBA.

For  fiscal year 2016, the Air Force was first to solicit white papers from  prospective mentors describing, among other things, the proposed  developmental assistance the mentor planned to provide to the  prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and the anticipated benefits of the agreement to the Air Force  and prot\u00e9g\u00e9. Second, the Air Force was to invite mentors with white  papers found to be consistent with the program goals to submit a  formal mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 agreement proposal. As part of the proposal,  mentors were required to submit a mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 agreement using  the template found on OSBP\u2019s website. The announcement also  stated that the Air Force planned to consider four factors when  determining whether to recommend proposals for award: (1)  relevance of proposed technology to current Air Force requirements,  (2) overall technical approach to providing transfer of technology and  developmental assistance to the prot\u00e9g\u00e9, (3) the mentor\u2019s capacity  and capability to achieve the objectives of the mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9  program, and (4) estimated cost of the proposed assistance.", "Army.

The guidance states that the Army intends to  approve and fund proposed agreements that have a strong technical  component or focus on the innovative transfer of state-of-the-art  technology that supports Army troops. The Army guidance further  states that mentors are required to submit a mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9  agreement using the template found on OSBP\u2019s website. The  guidance notes that the Army is to consider the following factors in  descending order of importance when evaluating proposed mentor- prot\u00e9g\u00e9 agreements: (1) subcontracting and prime contractor  opportunities, (2) technical approach for developmental assistance,  (3) involvement of historically black colleges and universities and  minority institutions, (4) relevance to Army programs, (5) corporate  capability and commitment, (6) management plan, and (7) mentor and  prot\u00e9g\u00e9 past and present performance.", "Navy. The Department of the Navy (Navy) guidance states that the  prospective mentor and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 are required to schedule an informal  introductory briefing with the Navy\u2019s director of small business  programs to discuss the proposed concept and objective of the  mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 agreement. As part of the briefing, the mentor and  prot\u00e9g\u00e9 are required to discuss, among other things, the mentor\u2019s  experience providing developmental assistance under other mentor- prot\u00e9g\u00e9 agreements; the proposed benefits to the mentor, prot\u00e9g\u00e9,  and the Navy under the proposed agreement; and the rationale for  why the proposed agreement should be sponsored. The Navy is to  then provide the mentor and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 with feedback on whether to  submit a proposed mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 agreement. The Navy\u2019s guidance  also states that the Navy accepts mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 agreement  proposals during three time frames each fiscal year (December 1-31,  March 1-31, and August 1-31). As part of the proposal, mentors are  required to submit a mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 agreement using the template  found on OSBP\u2019s website. The guidance further states that the Navy  is to consider the following factors in descending order of importance  when evaluating proposed mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 agreements: (1) merit of  the technology transfer to the prot\u00e9g\u00e9, (2) perceived benefit of the  agreement to the Navy, (3) perceived benefit of the agreement to the  prot\u00e9g\u00e9, (4) percentage of hours associated with technology transfer,  (5) subcontracting opportunities available to the prot\u00e9g\u00e9, (6) utilization  of historically black colleges and universities and minority institutions,  Procurement Technical Assistance Centers, and Small Business  Development Centers, and (7) proposed cost.", "Although DOD components have flexibility in considering a range of  factors when approving mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 agreements, the agreements  themselves are required to include certain elements that are defined in  DOD\u2019s procedures, and these elements serve a variety of purposes. For  example, an agreement must include the prot\u00e9g\u00e9\u2019s primary North  American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code, which is used to  determine the prot\u00e9g\u00e9\u2019s eligibility to participate in the program. In  addition, the agreement must describe the developmental assistance  planned for the prot\u00e9g\u00e9, how the assistance is to address the prot\u00e9g\u00e9\u2019s  identified needs and enhance its ability to perform successfully under  contracts or subcontracts within DOD and other federal agencies, and  factors to assess the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 firm\u2019s developmental progress under the  program, including specific milestones for providing assistance. The  agreement must also specify a program participation term that does not  exceed 3 years, which provides assurance that the mentor provides  assistance to the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 in a timely manner.  Further, the agreement  also is required to be signed and dated by the mentor and prot\u00e9g\u00e9, which  provides evidence of meeting the program requirement between the two  parties. Figure 3 presents a complete list of the elements that mentors  and prot\u00e9g\u00e9s are required to include in their agreements.", "Our review of a randomly selected probability sample of 44 of the 78 total  active DOD mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 agreements in place as of June 2016 found  that a number of these agreements were missing required elements.  Specifically, based on our review, we estimate that 27 percent of the  agreements did not address all required elements.  With respect to  specific elements, we estimate that 25 percent of the agreements did not  include the signature of the mentor and prot\u00e9g\u00e9, 9 percent did not include  the prot\u00e9g\u00e9\u2019s primary NAICS code, and 7 percent did not include an  anticipated start and end date for the agreement. These missing elements  suggest that the components\u2019 procedures for approving mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9  agreements do not provide reasonable assurance that agreements are  completed in accordance with DOD requirements.", "According to officials from OSBP, which manages DOD\u2019s Pilot Mentor- Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Program, the DOD component that approves a mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9  agreement is responsible for providing assurance that the agreement  includes the required elements in accordance with the program\u2019s policies.  However, DOD\u2019s procedures do not define how DOD components should  review these proposals. OSBP officials told us that OSBP developed a  checklist for DOD components to use to document the review of proposed  mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 agreements. The checklist includes whether the mentor  and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 have signed the agreement, whether the mentor and prot\u00e9g\u00e9  meet the program\u2019s eligibility requirements, and whether the agreement  includes a description and milestones for the developmental assistance  that is to be provided under the agreement, among other things. A senior  OSBP official added that OSBP does not require DOD components to use  the checklist, nor does OSBP periodically review the actions DOD  components have taken to review mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 agreements for  approval because OSBP does not want to micromanage the components.

As part of its responsibility for  managing the Pilot-Mentor Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Program, OSBP is ultimately  responsible for overseeing the program\u2019s policies and procedures.

DOD\u2019s annual reports show that prot\u00e9g\u00e9s experienced  increased revenues, number of employees, and DOD prime contracts and  subcontracts while participating in the program from fiscal years 2011  through 2015. In contrast, the reports show that prot\u00e9g\u00e9s that left the  program during this period experienced decreased revenues and  employees in the 2 years following program participation (see table 1).", "However, we found that DOD lacks performance goals and additional  measures needed to effectively assess its Pilot Mentor-Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Program.  Specifically, DOD has not established any measurable goals for the  performance information it reports for the program. Performance  measurement is the ongoing monitoring and reporting of program  accomplishments, particularly progress toward pre-established goals. We  have previously identified performance measurement as a best practice  that allows organizations to track progress in achieving their goals and  gives managers crucial information to identify gaps in program  performance and plan any needed improvements. In addition, according  to federal internal control standards, managers need to compare actual  performance against planned or expected results and analyze significant  differences. While DOD collects and reports information on prot\u00e9g\u00e9s\u2019  annual revenue, employment levels, and prime contract and subcontract  awards, it has not established goals for these measures. As a result,  DOD is limited in its ability to use this information to assess program  performance.", "In addition, DOD has not established measures for one part of the  program\u2019s statutory purpose. The information that DOD currently reports  relates to the part of the program purpose to increase the participation of  small businesses in DOD and other federal government contracts. As  previously discussed, part of the program\u2019s purpose is also to enhance  the capabilities of eligible small businesses to perform as subcontractors  and suppliers under DOD and other contracts and subcontracts, and the  current program measures do not address this part of the program\u2019s  purpose. Mentors report information to DOD in semiannual reports on  how the capabilities of prot\u00e9g\u00e9s were enhanced, what certifications the  prot\u00e9g\u00e9s obtained, and what technology the mentors transferred to the  prot\u00e9g\u00e9s. However, DOD does not include this information in its annual  report for the program, and it has not developed performance measures  or goals related to this information. As a result, DOD is not using the  information it collects to fully assess how well the program is enhancing  the capabilities of eligible small businesses to perform under DOD and  other contracts, and, therefore, not fully addressing the purpose of the  program.", "OSBP officials told us that they have not considered setting targets each  year for the program\u2019s current performance measures because these  measures\u2014revenues, employee levels, and prime contract and  subcontract awards\u2014do not reflect the primary focus of the program,  which the officials noted is to assist small businesses in becoming part of  the defense supply chain.

However, DOD had yet  to establish any such measures as of January 2017. Moreover, the  officials estimated that it would take about 2 years for DOD to develop  and establish baselines for these measures.

Implementation of SBA\u2019s All Small Mentor-Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Program is ongoing,  but DOD and SBA officials said they plan to consider harmonizing their  programs after SBA\u2019s program is fully implemented in July 2017."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Program Differences Include Eligibility Requirements for Prot\u00e9g\u00e9s and Participation Incentives", "paragraphs": ["Based on our review of statutory provisions and program rules, we found  that DOD\u2019s Pilot Mentor-Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Program and SBA\u2019s All Small Mentor- Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Program differ in a number of ways. For example, DOD and SBA  apply the SBA size standards differently when determining the eligibility of  prot\u00e9g\u00e9s under their respective programs. SBA\u2019s small business size  standards establish the largest that a firm can be and still qualify as a  small business for federal government programs.  DOD\u2019s Pilot Mentor- Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Program limits the size of eligible prot\u00e9g\u00e9s to less than one-half  of SBA\u2019s small business size standard.

Under SBA\u2019s All Small  Mentor-Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Program, mentors generally are not permitted to have  more than one prot\u00e9g\u00e9 at a time. However, SBA may authorize a firm to  mentor more than one prot\u00e9g\u00e9 at a time if it can demonstrate that the  additional mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 relationship will not adversely affect the  development of either prot\u00e9g\u00e9 firm (e.g., the second firm may not be a  competitor of the first firm), but under no circumstances does SBA permit  a mentor to have more than three prot\u00e9g\u00e9s at one time.", "In addition, DOD\u2019s Pilot Mentor-Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Program receives appropriated  funds, while SBA\u2019s All Small Mentor-Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Program does not; as  previously noted, DOD\u2019s Pilot Mentor-Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Program received $28.3  million for fiscal year 2016. DOD uses its appropriated funding to provide  direct reimbursement to mentors for providing developmental assistance  to prot\u00e9g\u00e9s. Incentive mechanisms are another key difference between  DOD\u2019s Pilot Mentor-Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Program and SBA\u2019s All Small Mentor- Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Program. Under DOD\u2019s program, mentors may receive direct  reimbursement or credit toward subcontracting goals for providing  developmental assistance to prot\u00e9g\u00e9s. Under statute, generally a mentor  in DOD\u2019s Pilot Mentor-Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Program may not receive reimbursements  for costs of assistance that exceed $1 million in a fiscal year.  Under  SBA\u2019s All Small Mentor-Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Program, a mentor and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 may  agree to seek any government prime contract or subcontract jointly as a  small business, provided the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 qualifies as \u201csmall\u201d for the  procurement, and receive exclusion from the affiliation rules for the  duration of the mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 agreement after both meeting certain  regulatory requirements and obtaining SBA approval.
