Accordingly, GAO was asked to (1) identify the models of cloud computing, (2) identify the information security implications of using cloud computing services in the federal government, and (3) assess federal guidance and efforts to address information security when using cloud computing. To do so, GAO reviewed relevant publications, white papers, and other documentation from federal agencies and industry groups; conducted interviews with representatives from these organizations; and surveyed 24 major federal agencies."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Cloud computing has several service and deployment models. The service models include the provision of infrastructure, computing platforms, and software as a service. The deployment models relate to how the cloud service is provided. They include a private cloud, operated solely for an organization; a community cloud, shared by several organizations; and a public cloud, available to any paying customer. Cloud computing can both increase and decrease the security of information systems in federal agencies. Potential information security benefits include those related to the use of virtualization, such as faster deployment of patches, and from economies of scale, such as potentially reduced costs for disaster recovery. Risks include dependence on the security practices and assurances of a vendor, dependency on the vendor, and concerns related to sharing of computing resources. However, these risks may vary based on the cloud deployment model. Private clouds may have a lower threat exposure than public clouds, but evaluating this risk requires an examination of the specific security controls in place for the cloud's implementation. Federal agencies have begun efforts to address information security issues for cloud computing, but key guidance is lacking and efforts remain incomplete. Although individual agencies have identified security measures needed when using cloud computing, they have not always developed corresponding guidance. For example, only nine agencies reported having approved and documented policies and procedures for writing comprehensive agreements with vendors when using cloud computing. Agencies have also identified challenges in implementing existing federal information security guidance and the need to streamline and automate the process of implementing this guidance. These concerns include having a process to assess vendor compliance with government information security requirements and the division of information security responsibilities between the customer and vendor. Furthermore, while several governmentwide cloud computing security initiatives are under way by organizations such as the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the General Services Administration (GSA), little has been completed as a result of these efforts. For example, OMB has not yet finished a cloud computing strategy. GSA has begun a procurement for cloud computing services, but has faced challenges in completing the procurement due in part to information security concerns. In addition, while the Department of Commerce's National Institute of Standards and Technology has begun efforts to address cloud computing information security, it has not yet issued cloud-specific security guidance. Until specific guidance and processes are developed to guide agencies in planning for and establishing information security for cloud computing, they may not have effective information security controls in place for cloud computing programs."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is recommending that the Office of Management and Budget, General Services Administration, and the Department of Commerce take several steps to address cloud computing security, including completion of a strategy, consideration of security in a planned procurement of cloud computing services, and issuance of guidance related to cloud computing security.

We also obtained perceptions of  security implications from federal agencies by developing, pretesting, and  distributing a survey to 24 major federal agencies. To assess federal  guidance and efforts to address information security when using cloud  computing, we obtained and analyzed federal information security  guidance relevant to cloud computing, identified federal agencies that  have implemented cloud computing services, and examined relevant  agency security practices related to cloud computing for consistency with  existing federal guidance.

The President\u2019s budget has identified the adoption of cloud computing in  the federal government as a way to more efficiently use the billions of  dollars spent annually on IT. As part of the 2011 budget, the  administration plans to deploy cloud computing in a series of pilot  projects across the government.

Department of Defense (DOD) officials responsible for one cloud  computing program stated that virtualization allows a cloud computing  provider to rapidly replicate secure configurations for cloud-based virtual  servers, rather than manually applying secure configurations to physical  servers, which could be required in a traditional environment that has not  employed virtualization techniques. Private sector representatives also  stated that virtualization can allow faster deployment of secure server  configurations, security upgrades, and patches for security vulnerabilities  than a traditional computing infrastructure can.", "Other advantages relate to cloud computing\u2019s broad network access and  use of Internet-based technologies. For example, several agencies stated  that cloud computing provided a reduced need to carry data in removable  media because of the ability to access the data through the Internet,  regardless of location. NIST officials stated that shifting public data to a  public cloud using the Internet that is separate from the agency\u2019s internal  network is a means of network segmentation that may reduce exposure of  sensitive data on the agency\u2019s internal network.", "Additional advantages relate to the potential economies of scale and  distributed nature of cloud computing. For example, in response to our  survey, 22 of the 24 agencies identified low-cost disaster recovery and data  storage as a potential benefit. Specifically, cloud computing may provide a  cheaper way to store backup copies of information. Agencies also stated  that a cloud provider may have more resources to devote to security than  the agency may have available. The large-scale and mitigation techniques  that cloud providers offer may also reduce vulnerability to denial of  service attacks. Department of Transportation (DOT) officials responsible  for a cloud computing program noted that the program\u2019s Web site, which  used a cloud computing service provider, was better able to withstand a  denial of service attack because of the use of the cloud provider. The  National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) officials  responsible for another cloud computing program stated that it may  require less effort for cloud computing customers to ensure effective  information security if information security controls were already  implemented by the provider. Customers could also be freed from the  responsibility of maintaining a physical infrastructure, as well as resolving  management, operational, and technical issues related to the underlying  cloud platform, although the customers would still be responsible for  ensuring these issues are addressed and that data are adequately  protected.", "The self-service aspect of cloud computing may also provide benefits. For  example, 20 out of the 24 agencies identified the ability to apply security  controls on demand as a potential benefit.

All 24 agencies  specifically noted concern about the possibility of loss of data if a cloud  computing provider terminated its services. For example, the provider and  the customer may not have agreed on terms to transfer or duplicate the  data. The European Network and Information Security Agency also  identified dependency on a vendor as a high risk, noting the lack of tools,  procedures, or standard data formats to ensure data, application, and  service portability. The agency stated that this can make it difficult for the  customer to migrate from one provider to another or to migrate data and  services back to an in-house IT environment. One member of GAO\u2019s  Executive Council on Information Management and Technology stated  that if an agency chooses to implement cloud computing, at some point in  the future the vendor may want to raise the cost for use of the cloud. The  agency may then have no alternative to paying the cost because it lacks  the technical ability to bring the service back in-house.", "Multitenancy and use of shared resources can also increase risk. Twenty- three out of the 24 agencies identified multitenancy as a potential  information security risk because one customer could intentionally or  unintentionally gain access to another customer\u2019s data, causing a release  of sensitive information.", "Additional concerns relate to exchanging authentication information on  users and responding to security incidents. For example, NASA officials  responsible for a cloud computing program stated that identity  management and user authentication are a concern because customers  and a provider may need to establish a means to securely exchange and  rely on authentication and authorization information for system users. In  addition, responding to security incidents may be more difficult in a  shared environment because there could be confusion over who performs  the specific tasks\u2014the customer or the provider. The Nuclear Regulatory  Commission emphasized the importance of a clear delineation of  responsibilities as they relate to incident response management, whereby  the cloud computing service provider has the responsibility to report the  security incident to the agency and the agency is responsible for reporting  the incident to the appropriate government entity.", "Another concern is the increased volume of data transmitted across  agency and public networks. This could lead to an increased risk of the  data being intercepted in transit and then disclosed.", "NIST also stated that cloud computing security is dependent on the  security of a user\u2019s Internet browser, and that vulnerabilities in the  browser can create vulnerabilities for the cloud computing service.", "Although there are numerous potential information security risks related  to cloud computing, these risks vary based on the particular deployment  model. For example, NIST states that private clouds may have a lower  threat exposure than community clouds, which may have a lower threat  exposure than public clouds. Officials from another agency stated that  they are considering implementing a private cloud behind their agency\u2019s  firewall because of the moderate-to-high impact classification of sensitive  data they were considering placing into this system. Several agency  officials and industry representatives stated that initial use of public  clouds may be focused on low-impact information.

However, the representatives also stated that  requiring each individual agency that uses a service provider to conduct its  own assessment of controls and audits and complete a separate  assessment and authorization process would be burdensome and remove  the cost advantages offered by cloud computing. In response,  representatives raised the idea of having a single government entity or  other independent entity conduct security oversight and audits for cloud  computing service providers. The process could be similar to the  Statement on Auditing Standards (SAS) 70 audit process often used as part  of financial audits. A SAS 70 report is issued by an independent auditor  for a service provider that processes financial data on behalf of others; it  discusses the effectiveness of the service provider\u2019s internal controls over  the processing of transactions that may be relevant to the financial  reporting of customers. Management of the customer organization and its  auditor may use this report to assess the internal control policies and  procedures at the service provider as part of the overall evaluation of the  internal control at the customer organization. Some cloud computing  service providers have obtained a SAS 70 audit for use and review by its  customers. In discussing the use of SAS 70 reports to meet information  security requirements, OMB Memorandum M-09-29 states that it is the  agency\u2019s responsibility to ensure that  the scope of the SAS 70 audit is sufficient and fully addresses the specific  contractor system requiring FISMA review, and the audit encompasses all controls and requirements of law, OMB policy,  and NIST guidance.", "There are attestation standards, similar to those in SAS 70, that could be  used to provide an assessment of controls at a service provider that relates  to the effective implementation of security and compliance with specified  requirements of laws and guidance. However, the scope of an audit based  on a standard such as SAS 70 is defined by the service provider and could  exclude key controls essential to effectively protecting agency  information.

For example, effective incident  response in a cloud environment requires delineation of customer and  provider responsibilities, which is information that is not currently  addressed in federal guidance. NASA Nebula officials noted that the exact  number of controls for which the customer is responsible varies  depending on the cloud computing service model. In Nebula\u2019s current  infrastructure as a service offering, the customer is responsible for 47 of  the 112 total controls in NIST SP 800-53 Revision 3 for low-impact systems.

The Web site was considered a low-impact system under FIPS 199, but the  payment processing system, which contained personal information, was  considered a moderate-impact system.", "The public Web site used a cloud computing service provider that hosted  the Web site and provided additional surge capabilities to cope with spikes  in demand for Web content. Effective communication through the Web  site was vital to implementation of the CARS program. According to  department officials, because of the use of a cloud service provider, the  CARS Web site was not affected by the July 4, 2009, cyber attacks. Also,  using the cloud service provider for Web content allowed the CARS  program information to be accessible while protecting DOT\u2019s primary Web  site from being overwhelmed and potentially disabled by the high demand  for information about the program.

Although the payment processing  system was originally designed to process up to 250,000 transactions over  4 months, the system actually processed approximately 690,000  transactions in about 1 month. Partly as a result of the overwhelming  interest in the program, the department encountered several technical  issues and capacity-related deficiencies with the payment system.  Specifically, the system had numerous outages and periods of slow  operation, causing frustration among dealers and disrupting the  department\u2019s ability to review submissions. Since the payment processing  system did not use cloud computing, expanding the system\u2019s capacity was  more challenging.", "Information Security Controls and Lessons Learned  Officials said they briefly considered use of a cloud computing model for  the payment processing system, but were reluctant to do so because of  programmatic constraints to using applications already in use by the  department. They also were concerned about processing personal  information in a cloud environment without the environment having been  precertified to handle the information. The officials acknowledged that  many characteristics of the CARS program would have made the payment  processing system a good candidate for cloud computing. These included  the program\u2019s limited time available for deployment, short duration, and  need to cope with sudden peaks in demand. However, the need to  interface with existing department computing infrastructure, including  using expertise from the existing vendor and the lack of an already  developed and deployed cloud that had been certified to handle personal  information made them hesitant to use a cloud computing solution and led  them to instead use a more traditional application.
