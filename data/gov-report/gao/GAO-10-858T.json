Due to the continuing cost, schedule, and tri-agency management challenges of the National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS)--a key satellite acquisition managed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA), the Department of Defense (DOD), and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)--the White House's Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) decided in February 2010 to disband NPOESS and, instead, to have NOAA and DOD undertake separate acquisitions. GAO was asked to summarize its report being released today on plans for NOAA's and DOD's separate acquisitions and the key risks of the transition, as well as its recent work on federal efforts to establish long-term strategies for satellite-provided climate and space weather data."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["OSTP's decision to disband NPOESS came at a time when the program's cost estimate had more than doubled--to over $15 billion, the launch date for a demonstration satellite had been delayed by over 5 years, and the tri-agency management structure had repeatedly proven to be ineffective. To implement the decision, NOAA and DOD have begun planning for separate acquisitions to replace NPOESS. NOAA has developed preliminary plans for its new program--called the Joint Polar Satellite System--to meet the requirements of the afternoon NPOESS orbit. DOD expects to make final decisions on the spacecraft and sensors in August 2010. However, because neither agency has completed its plans, the impact of the decision to disband the program on the expected costs, schedules, and capabilities has not yet been determined. Moving forward, the agencies face key risks in transitioning from NPOESS to their separate programs, including the loss of key staff and capabilities, delays in negotiating contract changes and establishing new program offices, the loss of support for the other agency's requirements, insufficient oversight of new program management, and cost growth resulting from contract and program changes. While NOAA and DOD are establishing plans for their new programs, the development of key NPOESS components is continuing. However, the launch date of the demonstration satellite--to be used operationally to ensure climate and weather data continuity--has been delayed by 9 months, and the program has slowed down work on all development activities. Until the transition risks are effectively mitigated, and unless components are able to continue scheduled development, it is likely that launch dates will continue to be delayed. Further delays are likely to jeopardize the availability and continuity of critical weather and climate data. For over a decade, the climate community has clamored for a national interagency strategy that coordinates agency priorities, budgets, and schedules for environmental satellites over the long-term--and the governance structure to implement that strategy. While the federal government has taken several steps to ensure the provision of environmental data from satellites for both climate and space weather in the short term, federal efforts to ensure the long-term provision of these environmental measurements are still lacking. Specifically, although both the climate and space weather communities have recently drafted reports for OSTP containing recommendations for climate and space weather satellites, respectively, the climate report focuses only on short-term needs and does not include longer term priorities, nor does it include budgets or schedules. Further, OSTP does not have plans for finalizing or releasing either the climate or space weather reports. Until an interagency strategy for environmental observation is established, and a clear process for implementing it is in place, federal agencies will continue to procure their immediate priorities on an ad hoc basis, the economic benefits of a coordinated approach to investments in earth observation may be lost, and our nation's ability to understand long-term climate changes may be limited. In its reports, GAO recommended that NOAA and DOD address key transition risks, and that the President's Assistant for Science and Technology implement interagency strategies for the long-term provision of environmental observations. NOAA and DOD agreed, while the Assistant's office neither agreed nor disagreed, but noted its plan to develop a strategy for earth observations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for the opportunity to participate in today\u2019s hearing on efforts  to disband the National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite  System (NPOESS) and federal planning to ensure long-term environmental  monitoring from satellites.

Satellites  provide a global perspective of the environment and allow observations in  areas that may be otherwise unreachable or unsuitable for measurements.  Used in combination with ground, sea, and airborne observing systems,  satellites have become an indispensable part of measuring and forecasting  weather and climate. For example, satellites provide the graphical images  used to identify current weather patterns, as well as the data that go into  numerical weather prediction models. These models are used to forecast  weather 1 to 2 weeks in advance and to issue warnings about severe  weather, including the path and intensity of hurricanes. Satellite data are  also used to warn infrastructure owners when increased solar activity is  expected to affect key assets, including communication satellites or the  electric power grid. When collected over time, satellite data can also be  used to observe climate change\u2014the trends and changes in the earth\u2019s  climate. For example, these data are used to monitor and project seasonal,  annual, and decadal changes in the earth\u2019s temperature, vegetation  coverage, and ozone coverage."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Satellite-provided Environmental Data for Climate and Space Weather", "paragraphs": ["One key subset of satellite-provided data is climate data. These data are  used in combination with ground and ocean observing systems to  understand seasonal, annual, and decadal variations in the climate.  Satellites provide land observations such as measurements of soil  moisture, changes in how land is used, and vegetation growth; ocean  observations such as sea levels, sea surface temperature, and ocean color;  and atmospheric observations such as greenhouse gas levels (e.g., carbon  dioxide), aerosol and dust particles, and moisture concentration. When  these data are obtained over long periods of time, scientists are able to use  them to determine short- and long-term trends in how the earth\u2019s systems  work and how they work together. For example, climate measurements  have allowed scientists to better understand the effect of deforestation on  how the earth absorbs heat, retains rainwater, and absorbs greenhouse  gases. Scientists also use climate data to help predict climate cycles that  affect the weather, such as El Ni\u00f1o, and to develop global estimates of  food crop production for a particular year or season.", "Another subset of satellite-provided environmental information is space  weather data. Satellite-provided observations of space weather generally  describe changes in solar activity in the space environment.

Currently, there is one operational POES  satellite and two operational DMSP satellites that are positioned so that  they cross the equator in the early morning, midmorning, and early  afternoon.

Together, they ensure that, for any region of the earth, the data provided  to users are generally no more than 6 hours old.", "With the expectation that combining the POES and DMSP programs would  reduce duplication and result in sizable cost savings, a May 1994  Presidential Decision Directive required NOAA and DOD to converge the  two satellite programs into a single satellite program\u2014NPOESS\u2014capable  of satisfying both civilian and military requirements.  To manage this  program, DOD, NOAA, and NASA formed a tri-agency Integrated Program  Office, with NOAA responsible for overall program management for the  converged system and for satellite operations; the Air Force responsible  for acquisition; and NASA responsible for facilitating the development and  incorporation of new technologies into the converged system.", "Since the program\u2019s inception, NPOESS costs have grown by over $8  billion, and launch schedules have been delayed by over 5 years. In  addition, as a result of a 2006 restructuring of the program, the agencies  reduced the program\u2019s functionality by decreasing the number of originally  planned satellites, orbits, and instruments. The restructuring also led  agency executives to mitigate potential data gaps by deciding to use a  planned demonstration satellite, called the NPOESS Preparatory Project  (NPP) satellite, as an operational satellite providing climate and weather  data. Even after this restructuring, however, the program continued to  encounter technical issues, management challenges, schedule delays, and  further cost increases. To address these issues, in recent years we have  made a series of recommendations to, among other things, improve  executive-level oversight and develop realistic time frames for revising  cost and schedule baselines.", "In August 2009, the Executive Office of the President formed a task force,  led by OSTP, to investigate the management and acquisition options that  would improve the NPOESS program.

NOAA is also planning technical changes to  the satellites, including using a smaller spacecraft than the one planned for  NPOESS and removing sensors that were planned for the NPOESS  satellites in the afternoon orbit. In addition, NOAA plans to transfer the  management of acquisition from the NPOESS program office to NASA\u2019s  Goddard Space Flight Center, so that it can be co-located at a space  system acquisition center as advocated by an independent review team.

Although this estimated cost is  less than the current baseline and recent estimates for the NPOESS  program, DOD will still need to fund and develop satellites to meet the  requirements for the early morning orbit. DOD\u2019s initial estimates are for  its new program to cost almost $5 billion through fiscal year 2015. Thus,  the cost of the two acquisitions will likely exceed the baselined life-cycle  cost of the NPOESS program.", "Schedule: Neither NOAA nor DOD has finalized plans that show the full  impact of the restructuring on the schedule for satellite development. We  have previously reported that restructuring a program like NPOESS could  take significant time to accomplish, due in part to the time taken revising,  renegotiating, or developing important acquisition documents, including  contracts and interagency agreements.

In  addition, both NOAA and DOD will need to establish and fully staff  program offices to facilitate and manage the transition and new programs.  Until decisions are made on how the program is to proceed with contract  changes and terminations, the contractors and program office cannot  implement the chosen solution, and some decisions, such as how to hold  schedule slips to a minimum, could become much more difficult.", "Failure to support the other agency\u2019s requirements: As a joint program,  NPOESS was expected to fulfill many military, civilian, and research  requirements for environmental data. However, because the requirements  of NOAA and DOD are different, the agencies may develop programs that  meet their own needs but not the other\u2019s. If the agencies cannot find a way  to build a partnership that facilitates both efficient and effective decision- making on data continuity needs, the needs of both agencies may not be  adequately incorporated into the new programs.", "Insufficient oversight of new program management: Under its new JPSS  program, NOAA plans to transfer parts of the NPOESS program to NASA,  but it has not yet defined how it will oversee NASA\u2019s efforts. We have  reported that NASA has consistently underestimated time and cost and has  not adequately managed risk factors such as contractor performance.  Because of these issues, we listed NASA\u2019s acquisition management as a  high-risk area in 1990, and it remains a high-risk area today. NOAA  officials reported that they are developing a management control plan with  NASA and intend to perform an independent review of this plan when it is  completed. They could not provide a time frame for its completion.  Without strong NOAA oversight of NASA\u2019s management of program  components, JPSS may continue to face the same cost, schedule, and  contract management challenges as the NPOESS program.", "Cost growth resulting from contract and program changes: Because  neither acquisition has fully developed plans for their respective programs,  it is unclear whether contracts will need to be fully or partially terminated,  and what the terminations and other program changes could ultimately  cost. We have previously reported that if the government decides to  terminate a contract for convenience, it must compensate the contractor\u2014 in the form of a termination settlement\u2014for the work it has performed.  However, a settlement only addresses the government\u2019s obligation under a  terminated contract, and there may be additional costs. For example,  additional costs could result from awarding a new contract to replace a  terminated contract. Until NOAA and DOD make decisions and plans for  their programs, the full cost of contract and program changes will be  unknown.", "NOAA, NASA, and DOD acknowledge that there are risks associated with  the transition to new programs, but they have not yet established plans to  mitigate these risks.", "While NOAA and DOD are developing plans for their new programs, the  development of key NPOESS components is continuing.

Four of the five sensors  intended for NPP are now on the spacecraft. In addition, the program  continues to work on components of the first and second NPOESS  satellites, which are to be transferred to NOAA and DOD to become part of  their respective follow-on programs. However, the expected launch date of  the NPP satellite has been delayed by 9 months (moving the launch date to  September 2011 or later), due to technical issues in the development of the  NPP sensor that has not yet been integrated. In addition, the development  of the VIIRS sensor for the first NPOESS or JPSS satellite is experiencing  significant cost overruns. Further, the program is slowing down and may  need to stop work on key components because of potential contract  liabilities and funding constraints, but it has not developed a prioritized  list on what to stop first.", "Until the transition risks are effectively mitigated, and unless selected  components are able to continue scheduled development, the launches of  NPP and the first NOAA and DOD satellites could be further delayed.  Further launch delays are likely to jeopardize the availability and  continuity of weather and climate data. For example, the POES satellite  currently in the afternoon orbit is expected to reach the end of its lifespan  at the end of 2012.

Faced with  expected cost growth exceeding $8 billion, schedule delays of over 5  years, and continuing tri-agency management challenges, a task force led  by the President\u2019s Office of Science and Technology Policy decided to  disband NPOESS so that NOAA and DOD could pursue separate satellite  acquisitions. While the two agencies are scrambling to develop plans for  their respective programs, it is not yet clear what the programs will  deliver, when, and at what cost, but it is very likely that they will cost more  than the existing NPOESS baseline and recent program office estimates.  Timely decisions on cost, schedule, and capabilities are needed to allow  both acquisitions to move forward. In addition, the agencies face a number  of transition risks, but neither agency has developed plans to mitigate  these risks. Meanwhile, the NPOESS program is continuing to develop  components of the NPP satellite and components of the first two satellites.  However, program officials reported that they have slowed all  development work, and may need to stop work on these deliverables.  Slowing or stopping work could further delay the satellites\u2019 launches, but  the program has not developed a prioritized list of what to stop first to  mitigate impacts on satellite launches.

For example, NOAA  recently removed sensors from JPSS that were originally planned for the  NPOESS satellites in the afternoon orbit, but it is unclear how this will  affect other agencies and programs. Until an interagency strategy for earth  observation is established, and a clear process for implementing it is in  place, federal agencies will continue to procure their immediate priorities  on an ad hoc basis, the economic benefits of a coordinated approach to  investments in earth observation may be lost, and the continuity of key  measurements may be lost. This will hinder our nation\u2019s ability to  understand long-term climate changes and risk our ability to measure,  predict, and mitigate the effects of space weather."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["If you have any questions on matters discussed in this testimony, please  contact David A.
