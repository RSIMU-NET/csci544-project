In this review, GAO identified (1) the role of OFPP and the FAI in assisting agencies in meeting certification requirements; (2) agencies' approaches to providing training; and (3) the extent to which agencies collect information on the costs and benefits of their acquisition training. To determine OFPP and the FAI roles, GAO analyzed relevant legislation. GAO obtained information from 23 federal agencies on their training approaches through a questionnaire, and selected 4 agencies--the Departments of Education and the Treasury, DHS, and VA--to provide illustrative examples. GAO used its questionnaire and a subsequent data call to obtain information on how agencies collect information on the costs and benefits of their training."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) sets standards and policies for the federal acquisition workforce, and has established certification requirements, including minimal training, for the three main acquisition roles--contracting staff, Contracting Officer's Representatives, and Program/Project Managers--to promote the development of government-wide core acquisition competencies and facilitate mobility across agencies. DOD follows separate certification standards. The Federal Acquisition Institute (FAI), which is responsible for fostering and promoting the training and development of the acquisition workforce, works closely with OFPP and has initiatives underway to improve the collection and management of training information, including cost data and course evaluations; streamline communication of acquisition training guidance; and coordinate efforts to leverage acquisition workforce training resources throughout the government.", "To support efforts for the acquisition workforce to attain and maintain federal certification requirements, most agencies (17 of 23) provide the majority of their acquisition training using external sources--vendors, FAI, the Defense Acquisition University, or other agencies. The Departments of Homeland Security (DHS), the Treasury, and Veterans Affairs (VA) operate their own permanent centers with dedicated resources that train the agency's acquisition workforce. Education reported using a different approach to providing acquisition training--it gets most of its training from other government entities. Federal agencies face similar challenges in providing training to their acquisition workforce. The top challenges reported by agencies in obtaining training for their acquisition workforce involved having sufficient resources. Twenty of 23 agencies identified obtaining adequate funding and 19 of 23 identified obtaining sufficient staff to manage training as challenging. In addition, almost half of the agencies reported that the fundamental step of identifying the acquisition workforce is a challenge especially when members of the workforce are involved in acquisitions as a secondary and not primary duty.", "The training cost data that agencies collect is not comparable and agencies have limited information on the benefits of their acquisition workforce training investments. Although almost all agencies provided some cost data in response to GAO's questionnaire and subsequent data call, the agencies' cost data did not allow for government-wide assessment of their training investment. To date, FAI's efforts to collect training cost data has also met with limited success. Cost data collected in 2012 by GAO and FAI included different cost components-- such as facilities, travel, and instructors--which do not allow for government-wide analysis. Having comparable training cost data are important to inform FAI efforts to establish government-wide contracts for training. As for determining benefits of training, 7 of 23 federal agencies reported having no metrics, not even basic endof- course evaluations. Without basic data, agencies do not have insight into the benefits of their acquisition workforce training efforts."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that OFPP help ensure that agencies collect and report comparable cost data and assess the benefits of acquisition training by (1) providing further guidance on the cost data agencies are to report annually, and (2) requiring agencies to analyze course evaluations, at a minimum, to help assess the benefits of training investments.

As for maintaining a  government-wide database to identify and track acquisition workforce  members, FAI officials noted that agencies are encouraged to use the  FAITAS registration system to track their workforce\u2019s individual training  records and certifications. However, registration into the system is  currently voluntary.", "Agencies also reported that their acquisition workforces are challenged in  finding time in their workload to attend training. Most agencies\u201414 of  23\u2014considered the ability to find time as extremely or very challenging.

For  example, some agencies provided data on the cost per seat of specific  courses, while others provided the total costs for delivery of each course.  Some agencies provided the costs associated with the development of an  in-house course, while others included development costs with delivery  costs as a total cost of obtaining the course from a vendor. Although the  data do not allow direct comparisons among agencies, the data show a  range of costs for similar courses. For example, five agencies provided a  per seat cost for a COR Refresher course, which ranged from $97 to  $363 per seat. In addition, five agencies provided a per seat cost for a  Cost Analysis and Negotiation Techniques course, which ranged from  $282 to $925 per seat. However, a number of factors can produce the  variation in the agency-reported costs and these factors, along with the  agencies\u2019 data collection methods, can limit the ability to make  government-wide decisions on acquisition workforce training investments.   According to agency officials, the costs of individual acquisition workforce  training courses can vary greatly among agencies due to a variety of  factors, including: the number of times per year the course is provided,  actual attendance numbers, location of training, and whether courses are  tailored with agency-specific information.", "FAI officials reported that they also received limited responses to their  request for training cost data in the agencies\u2019 latest AHCPs, which made  it impossible for them to complete their planned comparative analyses.  The instructions for the FAI data request did not include definitions of the  cost components to be reported, which are important to help ensure  consistent reporting. Due to the limited response on cost data, FAI  initiated a subsequent data call. As of November 2012, FAI had received  responses from 20 of the 23 agencies, but again was unable to perform a  comparative analysis of the cost data due to various limitations in the data  it received. FAI officials noted that collecting cost data from agencies is  an evolving process and that having comparable training cost data is  important to help FAI in its efforts to maximize the use of acquisition  workforce training dollars government-wide. FAI plans to request cost  data annually with the AHCPs; however, the guidance for completing the  next submission does not include definitions of the cost data to be  reported, which may again yield data that cannot be compared across  agencies. Improved reporting of cost data could assist FAI as it moves  forward with its plans to award government-wide contracts for acquisition  workforce training in 2014 by allowing FAI to obtain insight into the  agencies\u2019 training costs when obtaining training from a variety of external  sources."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agencies Gather Limited Information on Benefits of Acquisition Workforce Training Investment", "paragraphs": ["About half of the agencies\u201412 of 23\u2014did not have insight into whether  their acquisition workforce training investment is improving individual  skills or agency performance.

Five  agencies did not provide information to support use of metrics to measure  the training benefits, either improving individual skills or agency  performance, of acquisition training in response to our supplemental data  request.", "We have previously reported that training programs can be assessed by  measuring (1) participant reaction to the training program, (2) changes in  employee behavior or performance, and (3) the impact of the training on  program or organizational results, which may include a return on  investment assessment that compares training costs to derived benefits.  Of the 11 agencies that provided information to support their use of  metrics, 3 reported using end-of-course evaluations to measure  participants\u2019 reaction, one reported using end-of-course tests to measure  changes in employees\u2019 knowledge, and one reported using post-course  surveys to supervisors or participants to measure if what was learned  affected the participants\u2019 behavior. The other 6 agencies reported  measures aimed at determining the impact of training on the agency\u2019s  mission. Furthermore, DHS officials said that they plan to begin using  post-course surveys of participants and supervisors in fiscal year 2013,  and they are pursuing the development of additional measures to  evaluate the impact of training on the agency. VA is also pursuing the  development of additional metrics, such as proxy measures for return on  investment, to evaluate the impact of training on the agency. Participant  evaluations offer limited insight into improvements in individual and  agency performance; however, we recognize that higher levels of  evaluation (such as evaluating the impact on organizational performance  or comparing training costs to derived benefits) can be challenging to  conduct because of the difficulty and costs associated with data collection  and the complexity in directly linking training and development programs  to improved individual and organizational performance.", "Officials at some of the selected agencies told us that when the course is  provided by an external source, such as FAI or DAU, they rely on the  external source to provide end-of-course evaluations to the participants.  As we noted earlier, 17 of 23 agencies obtain the majority of their  acquisition training from external sources. In particular, some agencies  noted that they do not collect or assess the end-of-course evaluations,  relying solely on the external source to use the evaluations as they  believe appropriate. FAI officials noted that if the agencies do not review  the evaluations themselves, they are missing the opportunity to ensure  that the courses are effective in training their acquisition personnel. We  have previously reported that it is increasingly important for agencies to  be able to evaluate their training programs and demonstrate how these  efforts help develop employees and improve the agencies\u2019 performance  because it can aid decision makers in managing scarce resources and  provide credible information on how training has affected individual and  organizational performance.22 Although FAI has an initiative underway to  standardize the evaluations provided for its courses, its impact may be  limited if agencies do not obtain the evaluation results and use them to  evaluate the effectiveness of the training."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["GAO-12-878 and GAO-04-546G. to ensure that every training seat is filled\u2014to assist agencies in meeting  OFPP requirements and leveraging federal government training  resources, these efforts face significant obstacles. Agencies, FAI, and  OFPP lack data on the acquisition workforce itself and the benefits of  training, as well as cost data that can be used to make comparisons.  These limitations hinder government-wide efforts to share information  during these times of constrained budgets. OFPP, FAI, and the agencies  need basic information on how much agencies are spending to train the  acquisition workforce. Providing definitions and guidance about the  elements of costs agencies should include in their annual acquisition  human capital plans will help OFPP and FAI in their efforts to collect  comparable data across agencies. FAI can then analyze and share  information to help agencies make choices regarding how best to  dedicate resources to effectively train the acquisition workforce.  Additionally, comparable costs data will be helpful to inform FAI efforts to  award government-wide contracts for standard acquisition workforce  certification training.", "Currently, the main focus of monitoring and tracking acquisition workforce  training efforts in agencies is on completion of training to attain and  maintain the FAC certifications. Although the higher levels of evaluation  (such as evaluating the impact on organizational performance or  comparing training costs to derived benefits) can be challenging to  conduct due to costs and complexity, agencies should, at a minimum,  evaluate participant reaction to the training program through end of  course evaluations. However, this is a basic measure that some agencies  are lacking because the evaluations currently being administered go to  the provider of the class and not the agency paying for the training.  Therefore, these agencies have little insight into how the workforce  perceives the training they received. We note that FAI has initiatives  underway to standardize the course evaluations for the courses it  provides and to make completion of the course evaluations mandatory to  receive course credit. At present, this effort only applies to FAI-sponsored  courses and will not include agencies that use other vendors, and does  not guarantee that agencies will analyze the results; it is important for all  agencies to collect and analyze this basic information."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To help ensure that agencies collect and report comparable cost data and  perform a minimal assessment of the benefits of their acquisition training  investments to aid in the coordination and evaluation of the use of  resources government-wide, we recommend the Director of the Office of  Management and Budget direct the Administrator of the Office of Federal  Procurement Policy, in consultation with the Director of the Federal  Acquisition Institute, to take the following two actions: provide further guidance, including definitions, on the types of costs  that agencies should include in their Acquisition Human Capital Plan  submission to help determine total training investment; and  require all agencies, at a minimum, to collect and analyze participant  evaluations of all acquisition workforce training as a first step to help  assess the effectiveness of their training investment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to OFPP, FAI, and the selected  agencies\u2014DHS, Education, Treasury, and VA.

Because this was not a  sample survey, it has no sampling errors. However, the practical  difficulties of conducting any survey may introduce errors, commonly  referred to as nonsampling errors. For example, difficulties in interpreting  a particular question, sources of information available to respondents, or  entering data into a database or analyzing them can introduce unwanted  variability into the survey results. We took steps in developing the  questionnaire, collecting the data, and analyzing them to minimize such  nonsampling error.  After we drafted the questionnaire, we asked for  comments from federal officials knowledgeable about acquisition  workforce and training issues and from independent GAO survey  professionals. We conducted pretests to check that (1) the questions  were clear and unambiguous, (2) terminology was used correctly, (3) the  questionnaire did not place an undue burden on agency officials, (4) the  information could feasibly be obtained, and (5) the survey was  comprehensive and unbiased.
