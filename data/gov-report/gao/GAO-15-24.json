Also, GAO examined how the lists of programs identified compare with program inventories prepared by DOD and VA pursuant to law. To address these objectives, GAO established and applied its definition of \u201cprogram.\u201d In general, GAO defined programs as federally funded, organized sets of activities agencies undertake that are directed toward specific purposes or goals and are being administered in fiscal year 2014.

This limited comparability is primarily due to differing contexts in which the lists were compiled. While GAO's lists address specific mandated questions, DOD's and VA's lists were developed following Office of Management and Budget guidance, which generally provides flexibility in how agencies define their programs. Both DOD and VA chose to identify programs at a broad level. For example, DOD's inventory is partially organized by its strategic goals. One goal is \u201cpreserving and enhancing the all-volunteer force,\u201d for which wounded warrior care is cited as a high priority. Under this goal, DOD lists \u201chospitals\u201d and \u201cregional defense facilities\u201d as programs.

We established a definition for \u201cprograms\u201d to clarify the types of DOD  and VA programs and activities to be included on our lists because no  standard definition of \u201cprogram\u201d exists. Past GAO work and OMB  have defined \u201cprogram\u201d in very broad terms. For this report, our  definitions reflect the specific area of interest specified in the  mandate; therefore, we did not attempt to develop a definitive  definition. We established a definition for program by reviewing our  prior work and other relevant studies on related programs for  servicemembers and veterans who have served in recent conflicts.  We also obtained input from internal GAO experts on research  methods and federal programs for servicemembers and veterans, as  well as officials from DOD and VA. In general, we defined \u201cprograms  or activities\u201d as a federally funded, organized set of activities directed  toward a specific purpose or goal that an agency undertakes and is  being administered in fiscal year 2014. We further scoped our  definition for each of our objectives as follows:", "Objective 1: DOD or military services\u2019 programs or activities that  address the effects of combat\u2014including physical, mental, or social  heath\u2014on post-9/11 active-duty servicemembers or their spouses or  dependents.", "Objective 2: DOD, military services, or VA programs that focus  primarily on helping active duty servicemembers transition or veterans  readjust to civilian life.", "Objective 3: DOD, military services, or VA programs that focus  primarily on raising civilian public awareness of the combat  experiences of servicemembers and the readjustment experiences of  veterans.", "For the first objective, we scoped our definition of programs differently  than for the second and third objectives. Specifically, for the first  objective, although servicemembers and their spouses or dependents  must benefit from a program or activity that addresses the effects of  combat as we have defined that term, a program or activity does not have  to only benefit servicemembers that directly experience combat. For  example, the Joint Family Support Assistance Program supports military  families who are geographically dispersed from a military installation. This  program could support military families in which one or more  servicemembers are serving in a combat zone or deployed to Germany  (or other noncombat zone) while the family is living stateside. For the  second and third objectives, we defined programs as focusing primarily  on servicemember transition and veteran readjustment to civilian life as  well as efforts to raise public awareness and understanding of  servicemembers\u2019 and veterans\u2019 experiences in combat, coming home,  and transitioning to civilian life. An example of such a program includes  VA outreach and readjustment counseling services through Vet Centers.  VA administers other programs that provide interventions or treatments to  help certain veterans, such as the homeless and those contemplating  suicide. However, we did not include those types of programs or activities  because helping veterans readjust to civilian life is not their primary focus.", "For all three objectives we excluded the following types of programs:", "Programs conducting research.", "Programs in which post-9/11 Iraq and Afghanistan servicemembers or  veterans are not eligible, such as efforts aimed only at veterans of  conflicts or wars prior to Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi  Freedom/Operation New Dawn (OEF/OIF/OND).", "Programs developed and administered by individual military  installations or VA hospitals specifically for the populations they serve  at those locations. For example, for the second objective we excluded  the Road to Reintegration, a program designed to serve Michigan  veterans with a network of resource providers as they return to civilian  life. Thus, our findings are limited to the national perspective.", "Programs providing a one-way, passive transmission of information  (for example, a directory that lists services available).", "Programs that may have been created or revised to meet our  inclusion criteria after fiscal year 2014.", "The following further elaborates on these definitions.", "General Definition of Terms for Objectives 1\u20133", "DOD or military services: DOD, Office of the Secretary of Defense  (OSD) and all subordinate agencies, offices, and programs under  DOD; departments of the Army; Air Force, and Navy (including the  Marine Corps); the reserve components for each of the military  services, including the National Guard. (We exclude U.S. Coast  Guard programs because they are administered by the Department of  Homeland Security.)", "VA: All VA administrations, centers, offices, and programs.", "Program or activities: Federally funded, organized set of activities  directed toward a specific purpose or goal that an agency undertakes  and are being administered in fiscal year 2014. These activities may  include assistance for health, housing, employment, and family  support, as well as various program types (e.g., direct federal  programs, direct federal benefits programs, and grants). In addition,  our definition included tax expenditures (credits, deductions, deferrals,  or preferential tax rates) that are managed or administered by DOD or  VA (and related offices and departments as defined above); however,  we did not identify any such programs.", "Active-duty servicemembers: Those who are currently serving on  active duty in the United States armed forces. This includes activated  members of the National Guard and Reserve under Title 10 (full-time  duty in the armed forces) or Title 32 (duty performed for which  National Guard receives pay from federal government).", "Veterans: A person who served in the active military, naval, or air  service and who was discharged or released under conditions other  than dishonorable. This also includes Title 10 or Title 32 active Guard  and Reserve components that have deployed but are still serving in  the Reserve Component.", "Public: The broader civilian community in the United States, including  citizens, public and private employers, police, and court systems.", "Specific Definition of Terms for Objective 1  I.

Effects of combat - One or more of the following that results from  combat, warfare, or armed conflict:  1.  Physical health - care for extremity, hearing, vision, burns, or other  physical injuries and pain, as well as clinical case management and  coordination support.  2.  Mental / emotional health - care for psychological and brain injuries\u2014 such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) psychotherapies and  traumatic brain injury (TBI) treatments\u2014substance abuse, suicide  prevention, as well as clinical case management and coordination  support.  3.  Social domains - support for family and caregivers, legal support, non- medical case management, support for reserve components, post- deployment reintegration support for servicemembers and their  families, and spiritual support, and other related effects.  4.  While servicemembers and their spouses or dependents must benefit  from a program or activity that addresses the effects of combat, a  program or activity does not have to only benefit servicemembers that  directly experience combat. For example, the Joint Family Support  Assistance Program supports military families who are geographically  dispersed from a military installation. This program could support  military families in which one or more servicemembers are serving in  a combat zone or deployed to Germany (or other noncombat zone)  while the family is living stateside.", "IB. Criteria for excluding programs  1.  Exclude programs that exclusively provide services to post-9/11  active-duty servicemembers who are transitioning to VA or civilian  employment or civilian life (these programs are included in objective  2).", "Specific Definition of Terms for Objective 2  II. Definition: DOD, military services, or VA programs or activities whose  primary focus is to help post-9/11 servicemembers transition or veterans  or deactivated members of the reserve components readjust to civilian  life, including their spouses or dependents.", "Specific definitions for this objective:  IIA. Primary focus: Key reasons for which the program or activity was  designed or created (or one of its main missions or objectives) as stated  in the agency\u2019s description of the program or activity.", "IIB. Help: Assist transition or readjustment through services and efforts,  such as: providing physical and mental health services; counseling and outreach;  training, job placement and support, employment benefits, and career  guidance, education benefits;  campaigns designed to raise awareness of DOD or VA resources  available to post-9/11 servicemembers or veterans or their spouses or  dependents; providing technology like assistive technology, equipment; case management, legal support; housing benefits/support; and, support for family or caregivers, benefits counseling, or other related  efforts.", "IIC. Civilian Life: Time after separating from the military, including VA  care, services, or benefits; nonmilitary employment; or higher education.", "IID. Criteria for excluding programs  1.  Exclude programs that provide services to post-9/11 servicemembers  who remain in the military or transition back to active-duty. (These  types of programs are covered in objective 1.)  2.

Awareness and appreciation campaigns and events as well as public  service announcements aimed at civilians, and efforts to educate  business leaders about the skills veterans can provide employers, and  other related efforts.", "IIIC. Criteria for excluding programs  1.  Excludes programs and public awareness campaigns aimed  specifically at providing assistance, service, or awareness to  servicemembers, veterans or their families. (These types of  programs are covered in objective 2.)  2.  Excludes DOD and VA efforts to provide stakeholder assistance to  nonfederal entities, such as nonprofits, that provide support or  assistance to servicemembers, veterans, and their families.  2.  We identified publicly available sources that contain lists of relevant  federal programs. We identified these sources based on discussions  with DOD and VA officials and internal GAO experts on research  methods and federal programs for servicemembers and veterans, as  well as through online searches. Table 5 provides the name and  description of each source we used by objective.  3.  We used the definitions and sources from steps 1 and 2 to identify  the relevant programs for our lists. For the programs included on  our lists, we used the sources identified in step 2 to collect  information about the (1) program/activity\u2019s name, (2)  purpose/objectives, (3) the agency and/or office responsible for its  administration, and (4) the population served. For a subset of the  programs identified in the searches, we conducted tests to  determine the degree to which analysts agreed on the same  programs for inclusion. Once we compiled preliminary lists of  programs, we provided the lists to internal GAO experts on  research methods and federal programs for servicemembers and  veterans for review and comment. We modified the lists  accordingly.", "Next, a GAO analyst reviewed all of the sources and documented  a judgment about whether the programs identified conformed to  the definitions we developed in step 1. A second GAO analyst  then reviewed separately the assessment and documented an  agreement or disagreement with the initial decision. If any  differences emerged, the two analysts discussed the differences  and made changes based on a verbal resolution of those  differences. For any instances in which the two analysts did not  resolve differences, a third GAO analyst adjudicated and a final  decision was reached.  4.  We sent our preliminary list of programs to officials at DOD and  VA for comment and verification. Agencies either confirmed that  programs on our preliminary lists should be included, identified  those that should not be on our lists, or added programs that were  not included on our preliminary lists. We modified the lists  accordingly.", "This four-step process identified 170 separate programs, although some  of them are relevant to more than one objective. Specifically, 26 programs  are included in more than one objective, such as the Air Force Wounded  Warrior Program (AFW2) that addresses the effects of combat and helps  wounded and injured servicemembers and veterans transition to civilian  life. In addition, some programs share a common name but are  independently implemented by each military service branch. For example,  the Yellow Ribbon Reintegration Program provides similar services but is  independently administered by each service branch. With such programs,  we separately counted each military service\u2019s program. In carrying out  this four step process, we did not conduct an independent legal analysis  of the statutory or regulatory basis or requirements for any of the  programs we identified. We used the various documentary and data  sources to corroborate one another and determined that the documentary  and data sources used together were sufficiently reliable for our  descriptive purposes.", "To help convey our findings, we developed categories to group the types  of service provided by the programs. The categories include (1) caregiver  support, (2) case management/care coordination, (3) counseling, (4)  disability, (5) education assistance, (6) employment assistance, (7)  information and referral, (8) mental health and substance abuse, (9)  physical health, (10) spiritual health, and (11) other. Because some  programs offer more than one type of service, programs can fall into more  than one category or service type. Although a service may be included in  many programs or activities, the service may not or may be commonly  used by servicemembers or veterans. For example, the Transition  Assistance Program (TAP) is one program, but the services provided  through the program are widespread because all eligible, transitioning  servicemembers are generally required to participate in this program.", "Finally, our scope for the first three objectives was limited to identifying  DOD and VA programs based on the types of service provided; we did  not analyze these programs to identify instances of fragmentation,  overlap, duplication, or gaps in benefits or services. In addition, the  programs included in our review were accurate and up-to-date when we  issued the report. However, some may change over time."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comparing Lists of Programs", "paragraphs": ["To address the fourth objective, we compared the lists of programs that  we generated under objectives 1-3 with DOD and VA\u2019s 2013 program  inventories\u2014part of OMB\u2019s federal program inventory compiled in  response to a GPRAMA requirement\u2014to identify similarities and  differences between the agencies\u2019 inventories and our lists. To help make  this comparison, we drew upon prior GAO work on agencies\u2019 GPRAMA  program inventories. Although this objective was not included in the  mandate, we added it because of the parallels between the mandate and  the GPRAMA requirement for developing program inventories.", "We conducted our work from March 2014 to November 2014 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
