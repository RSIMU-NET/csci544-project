To assess Social Security Administration's (SSA) implementation of the Medicare Part D low-income subsidy, GAO was asked to review (1) the progress that SSA has made in identifying and soliciting applications from individuals potentially eligible for the low-income subsidy, and (2) the processes that SSA uses to track its progress in administering the subsidy. This statement is drawn from GAO's ongoing study for the committee on the Medicare Part D low-income subsidy, which is expected to be published at the end of May. To conduct this work, GAO reviewed the law, assessed subsidy data, and interviewed officials from SSA, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the Internal Revenue Service, state Medicaid agencies, and advocacy groups."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["SSA approved approximately 2.2 million Medicare beneficiaries for the low-income subsidy as of March 2007, despite barriers that limited its ability to identify individuals who were eligible for the subsidy and solicit applications from them. However, the success of SSA's outreach efforts is uncertain because there are no reliable data to identify the eligible population. SSA officials had hoped to use Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax data to identify the eligible population, but the law prohibits the use of such data unless an individual has already applied for the subsidy. Even if SSA could use the data, IRS officials question its usefulness. Instead, SSA used income records and other government data to identify 18.6 million Medicare beneficiaries who might qualify for the subsidy, which was considered an overestimate of the eligible population. SSA mailed low-income subsidy information and applications to these Medicare beneficiaries and conducted an outreach campaign of 76,000 events nationwide. However, since the initial campaign ended, SSA has not developed a comprehensive plan to distinctly identify its continuing outreach efforts apart from other agency activities. SSA's efforts were hindered by beneficiaries' confusion about the distinction between applying for the subsidy and signing up for the prescription drug benefit, and the reluctance of some potential applicants to share personal financial information, among other factors. SSA has collected data and established some goals to monitor its progress in administering the subsidy, but still lacks data and measurable goals in some key areas. While SSA tracks various subsidy application processes through its Medicare database, it has not established goals to monitor its performance for all application processes. For example, SSA tracks the time for resolving appeals and the outcomes of its initial redeterminations of subsidy eligibility, but does not measure the amount of time it takes to process individual redetermination decisions. According to SSA officials, implementing the low-income subsidy was manageable overall due to increased funding for the outreach and application processes and did not significantly affect the agency's workload and operations. GAO is considering recommendations for SSA to work with IRS to assess the extent to which taxpayer data could help identify individuals who might qualify for the subsidy, and help improve estimates of the eligible population; and for SSA to develop a plan to guide its continuing outreach efforts and develop key management tools to measure the results of its subsidy application processes."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here to discuss the Social Security Administration\u2019s  (SSA) progress in approving individuals for the Medicare Part D low-  income subsidy.

Such high costs may cause some elderly patients to forgo or restrict their  use of prescription drugs. To help the elderly and disabled with these  costs, the Congress passed the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement,  and Modernization Act (MMA) of 2003.

SSA identified the target population by  using income data from various government sources to screen out  Medicare beneficiaries whose income made them ineligible for the Part D  subsidy. SSA realized that using these data sources would result in an  overestimate of the number of individuals who might qualify for the  subsidy, because the data provided limited information on individuals\u2019  resources or nonwage income.

However, IRS officials  told us that its data have many limitations. For example, IRS officials said  that they have limited data on resources for individuals whose income is  less than $20,000, because these individuals do not typically have interest  income, private pensions, or dividend income from stocks that could assist  SSA in estimating an individual\u2019s potential resource level. Also, the  officials said that many people with low incomes do not have incomes  high enough to require them to file taxes, and therefore, IRS might not  have information on them. IRS also explained that its tax data would  most likely identify individuals that would not qualify for the subsidy,  rather than individuals that would qualify.  Moreover, the IRS officials said  that the data it would provide to SSA to determine eligibility could be  almost 2 years old. For example, for subsidy applications filed in early  2007, the last full year of tax data the IRS could provide would be for 2005.  Given these factors, IRS officials stated that summarily sharing private  taxpayer data to identify individuals who could qualify for the subsidy, and  the potential cost of systems changes, would have to be weighed against  the added value of the data.
