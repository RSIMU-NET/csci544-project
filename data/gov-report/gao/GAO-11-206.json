Primary outpatient care generally includes caring for acute and chronic illnesses, disease prevention, screening, patient education and follow-up care from hospitalization. The replacement hospital will be located on the site of the current hospital, while one of the new branch health clinics will replace medical and dental clinics currently in operation on Naval Base Guam, and the other clinic will be located in North Finegayan on the site of a proposed Marine Corps base. According to Navy officials, the development of the requirements for the clinics allowed the Navy to retain the size and footprint of an initially planned version of the replacement hospital, which was already programmed and approved prior to the announcement of the proposed military buildup on Guam. The two outpatient primary care clinics are to be funded by the government of Japan as part of the agreement to realign Marine Corps units from Okinawa, Japan to Guam, and DOD will fund the new hospital. The Navy's proposed military treatment facility solution on Guam expands on the health care services currently offered on Guam, but in instances when patients require care not offered on Guam, the Navy determined that it will continue to medically evacuate them to other military treatment facilities, such as Naval Hospital Okinawa, Tripler Army Medical Center in Hawaii, or Naval Medical Center San Diego. GAO found that the Navy's documentation used to support its recommended military treatment facility solution for Guam does not clearly demonstrate how the Navy determined the size and configuration of the proposed branch health clinics, nor could Navy officials adequately explain their analyses or assumptions. Navy officials indicated that the Navy's health care requirements analysis report was the basis for decisions regarding the size and configuration of the proposed military treatment facilities. The Navy's health care requirements analysis report estimates the overall health care workload for the services the Navy intends to offer on Guam following the realignment, but does not show how this workload translates into the size and configuration of the Navy's proposed facilities. Therefore, it is difficult for stakeholders to be fully assured that the facility solution will be the most cost- effective solution to meet beneficiary health care needs following the realignment. Without clear documentation of key analyses and identification of risks, the Navy cannot fully demonstrate that it is making the most cost-effective decisions with its proposed military treatment facility solution on Guam."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that Navy clearly document the basis for health care workload and staffing on Guam.

The hospital is centrally located on the island,  while the outpatient clinic and dental clinic are located on Naval Base  Guam in the southern part of the island. The Navy has determined that the  current hospital is outdated and does not meet modern facility standards  as it was constructed in 1954 using 1940s design criteria.", "While the Navy was initially developing requirements for a replacement  hospital on Guam, separately the United States and Japan began a series of  sustained security consultations, referred to as the Defense Policy Review  Initiative, which were aimed at reducing the burden of the U.S. military  presence on Japanese communities and strengthening the U.S.-Japan  security alliance. By 2006, these consultations established the framework  for the future U.S. force structure in Japan, including the relocation of U.S.  military units from Okinawa, Japan to Guam. DOD plans to move about  8,600 Marines and their estimated 9,000 dependent family members to  Guam as part of the Defense Policy Review Initiative. As a result of this  realignment from Japan to Guam and other DOD plans to expand the  capabilities and presence of the Army, Navy, and the Air Force on Guam  over the next several years, the military population on Guam is expected  to grow by over 160 percent, from 15,000 to over 39,000 by 2020. DOD  estimates the cost of developing facilities and infrastructure for the Marine  Corps relocation to Guam to be approximately $10.27 billion. The  government of Japan is anticipated to provide $6.09 billion, in U.S. fiscal  year 2008 dollars, of this amount. Part of this funding will be used to  enhance DOD\u2019s current infrastructure on Guam, including the  construction of new military treatment facilities. In addition to the  realignment, the other military services are planning to expand their  operations and presence on Guam. For instance, the Navy plans to  enhance its infrastructure, logistic capabilities, and waterfront facilities;  the Air Force plans to develop a global intelligence, surveillance, and  reconnaissance strike hub at Andersen Air Force Base; and the Army plans  to place a ballistic missile defense task force on Guam.

Navy officials told us that in deciding what health care  services to provide on Guam, they held discussions with pertinent medical  officials and considered factors such as the size of the beneficiary  population, the expected workload, and the availability of staff.  Nonetheless, the Navy\u2019s documentation provided to support these  decisions shows that the Navy assumed no new inpatient services would  be provided on Guam and only neurology would be added to outpatient  care. However, this documentation does not easily allow for external  stakeholder examination by TRICARE Management Activity and other  stakeholders\u2014a key aspect of internal controls\u2014in that it does not clearly  show why certain health care services were assumed to be included or  excluded.", "The Navy reported the staffing requirements for its recommended facility  solution in its health care requirements analysis, but the methods and  criteria for how the Navy reached decisions are not clearly documented.  DOD policy requires that manpower requirements generally (including  staffing for military treatment facilities) be established at the minimum  level necessary to accomplish mission and performance objectives. In the  health care requirements analysis report, the Navy noted that they  determined the additional staffing needs to meet health care requirements  associated with the military buildup on Guam through a series of  discussions with Navy headquarters, regional, and Guam medical  commands. However, when we asked for additional information on how  staffing requirements were determined for the proposed facilities, the  Navy could not provide documentation or explain what was discussed at  these meetings or the decision process leading up to their staffing  requirement decisions other than stating that the limited number of  available medical specialists was a key factor that influenced staffing  requirements decisions for the proposed military treatment facilities on  Guam.", "During the course of our review, we asked Navy officials to explain the  assumptions used in health care requirements analysis as well as how the  health care requirements analysis was used to determine the size of the  replacement hospital and clinics. In some instances, the officials could not  provide an explanation and said that they will request that future health  care requirements analyses clearly illustrate all the steps and calculations  used to determine facility requirements. In other instances, the Navy\u2019s  explanations and additional supporting documentation did not match the  results of the health care requirements analysis. For example, DOD space  planning guidance notes that the annual number of births of the projected  beneficiary population is used, among other things, to help determine the  size and configuration of labor and delivery units. However, the Navy\u2019s  health care requirements analysis used a different metric (the number of  obstetrics inpatient visits). Existing documentation does not clearly  demonstrate how the Navy determined the projected number of births or  how the results of the health care requirements analysis report\u2019s number  of obstetrics visits would translate to the size of the replacement hospital\u2019s  labor and delivery units. Navy officials told us that the health care  requirements analysis was still up-to-date, though we found that the report  does not currently reflect the design plans for the proposed clinic on Naval  Base Guam. For example, the design plans of the proposed clinic on Naval  Base Guam indicate a projected visit rate of 64,271 visits per year. It  indicates that the number of visits was derived from the health care  requirements analysis. However, the health care requirements analysis  does not break down the workload per facility. Therefore it is unclear how  this number is supported. In addition the design plans show that 65 staff  members will be working at the Naval Base clinic, whereas the health care  requirements analysis projects a need for 25 staff members.", "Since the Navy\u2019s health care requirements analysis is not sufficiently  documented, specifically with regard to health care and staffing  requirements, both the Navy and TRICARE Management Activity may not  be sufficiently assured that (1) Navy\u2019s military treatment facility solution  of the replacement hospital and two branch health clinics will be adequate  to meet the demand of the military population on Guam and (2) result in  the most cost-effective facility solution that will meet the expected  increase in military population on Guam."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "TRICARE Management Activity Issued the Design Authorization for the Navy\u2019s Replacement Hospital but Not the Two Clinics Funded by the Government of Japan", "paragraphs": ["TRICARE Management Activity is responsible for, among other things, the  acquisition of all military health care facilities worldwide, including the  planning, design, and construction of all military health care projects.  The Unified Facilities Criteria also provide for a process for TRICARE  Management Activity to approve the design of a proposed military  treatment facility project. TRICARE Management Activity issued the  design authorization of the Navy\u2019s replacement hospital in May 2008.  However, according to TRICARE Management Activity officials, they were  not responsible for issuing the design authorization for each clinic since  the design and construction of the clinics is to be funded by the  government of Japan, and TRICARE Management Activity stated that it is  responsible only for projects which it funds. Since funding for the design  and construction of the clinics is provided by the government of Japan,  these officials said that the Joint Guam Program Office would lead the  acquisition team and be responsible for ensuring compliance with the  Unified Facilities Criteria. This would include issuing the design  authorizations for the clinics.", "Conversely, officials from the Joint Guam Program Office said that  projects to be constructed with government of Japan funding should  follow procedures outlined in the Unified Facilities Criteria. In addition,  these officials noted that the design authorizations for the clinics were  provided by Naval Facilities Engineering Command headquarters, which is  the design agent for military construction on Guam. However, the Unified  Facilities Criteria indicate that TRICARE Management Activity is to  provide design authorizations to the design agent. Moreover, the design  agent is not to pursue any level of design beyond what is authorized by  TRICARE Management Activity. In the case of the clinics, the design agent,  Naval Facilities Engineering Command, issued its own design  authorization, thereby calling into question whether the policies and  procedures of the Unified Facilities Criteria were followed.", "Although TRICARE Management Activity did not issue the design  authorizations for the clinics, the activity\u2019s officials said they reviewed the  requirements for the clinics based on results of the Navy\u2019s health care  requirements analysis.

Conclusions  The Navy determined that to accommodate the additional inpatient and  outpatient requirements of the increased military population on Guam  following the military buildup, it would need to construct three military  treatment facilities consisting of a replacement hospital and two branch  health clinics. However, the Navy\u2019s health care requirements analysis  report does not clearly document the analyses and assumptions used by  the Navy to determine its military treatment facility requirements,  including forecasting health care demand and determining health care  workload and staffing requirements nor could Navy officials adequately  explain their analyses or assumptions. Such documentation facilitates  external stakeholder examination and can lead to reasonable assurance of  the adequacy of facilities to meet mission requirements.
