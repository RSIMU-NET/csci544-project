The unweighted average reduction in payment rates for the five rate-adjusted DME items with the highest expenditures in 2016 within each DME category was 46 percent.", "Changes in the number of suppliers furnishing rate-adjusted items were generally consistent with the years before adjusted rates went into effect. GAO found that the number of suppliers furnishing rate-adjusted items in non-bid areas in 2016 decreased 8 percent compared to 2015.", "GAO's review of Medicare claims data found that beneficiary utilization of rate-adjusted items in non-bid areas in 2016 showed little change compared to 2015. GAO also found that CMS's activities to monitor beneficiary access, including changes in health outcomes, showed little change between 2015 and 2016.", "GAO interviewed several stakeholder groups that reported anecdotal examples of specific beneficiary access concerns they attributed to the rate adjustments, but stakeholders could not provide evidence to substantiate that the access issues were widespread. GAO's findings are consistent with CMS's monitoring results, which indicate that there were no widespread effects on beneficiary access in the year after the adjusted rates went into effect.

According to the 2018 Medicare Trustees Report, in 2017, 33.6 million, or  about 63 percent of the total 53.4 million Medicare enrollees, were  enrolled in the Medicare FFS Part B program that helps pay for DME  items, such as oxygen, wheelchairs, hospital beds, and walkers, if they  are medically necessary and prescribed by a physician. Medicare  beneficiaries typically obtain DME items from suppliers, who then submit  claims for payment to Medicare on behalf of beneficiaries.", "Historically, Medicare paid for DME items by using a fee schedule  generally based on what suppliers charged for the items and services  during the 1980s, and these amounts were updated annually. However,  both we and the HHS Office of Inspector General have reported that  Medicare and its beneficiaries sometimes paid higher than market rates  for various DME items, and there were long-standing concerns about the  high rates of improper payments related to DME. To achieve savings  and address improper payment concerns, Congress\u2014through the  Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of  2003\u2014 directed that CMS change the way it pays for DME and other  items in certain areas of the country by implementing a competitive  bidding program (CBP).", "The CBP has been implemented through several rounds, each operating  in specific CBP areas and for specific time frames. The first round began  in 2011 in nine of the largest metropolitan statistical areas, and the CBP  currently includes 130 areas. The CBP payment for a CBP-covered DME  item is based on winning bids submitted by competing suppliers within  each designated CBP area. As such, the same item can have a different  payment rate in different areas. We have previously found that CMS\u2019s  implementation of the CBP decreased expenditures for both Medicare  and beneficiaries residing in designated CBP areas as a result of lower  payment rates and decreased utilization. We also reported that CMS\u2019s  monitoring activities indicated that beneficiary access and satisfaction had  not been affected by the CBP.", "Beginning January 1, 2016, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care  Act required CMS to use payment information from the CBP to adjust  FFS payment rates (hereafter referred to as adjusted rates) in all non- rural and rural areas of the United States that are not included in the CBP  (hereafter referred to as non-bid areas). These adjustments reduced  payment rates for almost all affected DME items in non-bid areas. CMS  estimates that about half of DME items furnished to Medicare FFS Part B  program beneficiaries are furnished to beneficiaries residing in non-bid  areas, and the reduced rates after adjustment in non-bid areas will save  the Medicare program about $3.6 billion between fiscal years 2016  through 2020. CMS officials told us adjusted rates in non-bid areas have  also helped limit fraud by making DME a less lucrative target for fraud  and abuse, and may also have curbed unnecessary utilization of certain  DME. However, some stakeholder groups have raised concerns that  reduced payment rates in non-bid areas have disrupted beneficiary  access to needed DME items and such issues may be exacerbated in  rural areas because some suppliers have limited their service areas.", "You asked us to examine the potential effects of reduced payment rates  for DME in non-bid areas. In this report, for non-bid areas, we examine:  1.  DME payment rate reductions and any changes in the number of  suppliers after the rate adjustments went into effect;  2.  any changes in the utilization of rate-adjusted DME items after the  rate adjustments went into effect; and  3.  available evidence related to potential changes in Medicare  beneficiaries\u2019 access to rate-adjusted items after the rate adjustments  went into effect.", "To examine the extent to which FFS payment rates changed after  adjusted rates went into effect, we used FFS payment rate information on  CMS\u2019s website to compare 2015 non-adjusted payment rates with 2016  and 2017 adjusted rates. Specifically, we analyzed payment rates for  the five items with the largest percentage of 2016 total expenditures for all  rate-adjusted items furnished to beneficiaries in non-bid areas within each  of the 11 general DME product categories established by CMS. Based  on Medicare claims data, the resulting top 53 of the 393 rate-adjusted  items accounted for 80 percent of 2016 total expenditures for all rate- adjusted items. We analyzed payment rates by product category and by  individual item.", "To examine any changes in the number of suppliers in non-bid areas, we  used Medicare claims data and other CMS data to calculate percentage  changes in the number of suppliers furnishing any of the 393 rate- adjusted DME items to Medicare beneficiaries from 2010 through 2016.  We also reviewed changes in the number of suppliers furnishing items not  included in the CBP (non-adjusted items). We did this to evaluate the  effect reduced payment rates may have had on the number of suppliers in  the context of broader health industry developments and CMS antifraud  efforts that were not limited to rate-adjusted items, such as the  implementation of new safeguards to better screen Medicare suppliers.  (See Appendix I for information about CMS\u2019s CBP and antifraud initiatives.) In addition, we compared changes in the number of suppliers  in both non-rural and rural areas and by product category.

Specifically, we examined changes in beneficiary  utilization of the 393 rate-adjusted items from 2010 through 2016 and  compared changes in utilization in non-rural versus rural areas and by  product category. We also examined changes in CBP areas and in  beneficiary utilization of non-adjusted items to determine how these  compared to non-bid areas and rate-adjusted items.", "To examine available evidence regarding the extent to which adjusted  rates for DME items potentially affected Medicare beneficiaries\u2019 access to  those items in non-bid areas, we reviewed: (1) data from CMS\u2019s 1-800- MEDICARE beneficiary help line; (2) CMS data on DME suppliers\u2019 rates  of assignment for rate-adjusted items\u2014i.e., whether suppliers accepted  the Medicare-approved amount in full or charged beneficiaries an  additional amount\u2014because CMS reported that a high rate of assignment  indicates that adjusted rates are sufficient; and (3) results from CMS\u2019s  health status monitoring tool that tracks real-time health outcomes for  beneficiaries residing in both CBP areas and non-bid areas. We also  conducted our own analysis for a particular set of beneficiaries using rate- adjusted oxygen items in both non-bid and CBP areas to determine if  certain health outcomes for that set of beneficiaries changed pre-and  post-implementation of adjusted rates. We selected rate-adjusted oxygen  items because most of these items are billed on a monthly basis, which  allowed us to more easily associate utilization with changes in health  outcomes. In addition, according to CMS officials, oxygen items are  generally used for the entirety of a beneficiary\u2019s life once prescribed.  Specifically, we reviewed trends for two health outcomes\u2014death and  hospital admissions\u2014by identifying a cohort of beneficiaries who began  using oxygen items in the first half of 2014 and tracking their utilization of  those items through the end of 2016.", "In addition, we interviewed CMS officials, CMS\u2019s competitive acquisition  ombudsman, and representatives from the State Health Insurance  Assistance Program. We also interviewed representatives from the  California Hospital Association, who monitor the effects of CBP and  payment changes on beneficiary access, and three beneficiary advocacy  groups representing Medicare beneficiaries who may have specific  conditions requiring DME items. We asked about their members\u2019  experiences in obtaining rate-adjusted items in non-bid areas and the  extent to which they reported widespread issues related to access and  choice of DME items. When we interviewed the four large DME industry  trade organizations, we asked them if they were aware of any effects on  beneficiaries such as access issues and whether such effects were  widespread.", "We assessed the reliability of the Medicare claims data we used for this  report by reviewing existing information about the data and the systems  that produced them, performing electronic data checks, and interviewing  CMS officials.

From  January 1 through June 30 of 2016, FFS payment rates were based on a  50/50 blend of non-adjusted and adjusted rates, and from July 1 through  December 31 of the same year, FFS payment rates were 100 percent  adjusted based on CBP information. However, the 21st Century Cures  Act required CMS to retroactively apply the 50/50 blended payment rates  to claims in the second half of 2016, delaying the fully adjusted payment  rates to January 1, 2017. Because the retroactively applied 50/50  blended rates were based on newly available information from the CBP  round 2 recompete that went into effect on July 1, 2016, the adjusted  rates for the second half of 2016 may have differed from the adjusted  rates for the first half of 2016. CMS contractors retroactively adjusted  claims for this period, which were processed during the second half of  calendar year 2017. Because this rate change became effective mid- December 2016, most decisions by suppliers and beneficiaries during the  second half of 2016 were made based on the 100 percent adjusted rates,  and the retroactive adjustments affected the total allowed charges, or  expenditures, that suppliers were reimbursed. The implementation of  adjusted rates may also affect other populations in addition to Medicare  suppliers and Medicare beneficiaries in non-bid areas, because some  private and other government insurers base their payment rates on  Medicare\u2019s fee schedule.

Participating suppliers must accept  the FFS payment rate in full for all claims and cannot charge beneficiaries  an additional amount above the 20 percent copayment. DME suppliers  can also elect to be \u201cnon-participating\u201d suppliers meaning they can  choose to accept assignment on a claim-by-claim basis and there is no  limit on the amount that they can charge for a DME item. Non- participating suppliers in non-bid areas are not required to accept  assignment of Medicare claims. This means a non-participating supplier  can decide not to accept assignment for an item and can charge  beneficiaries an amount above the Medicare payment rate. CMS told us  the rate of participating suppliers in 2016 was unchanged from 2015 and  decreased by one percent in 2017, and the rates of assignment for rate- adjusted items remained very high (over 99 percent of all claims for rate- adjusted items in non-bid areas) in 2016 and 2017."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Number of Inquiries to CMS and the State Health Insurance Assistance Program Did Not Increase Following the Implementation of Adjusted Rates", "paragraphs": ["CMS told us the nationwide number of inquiries to 1-800-MEDICARE  associated with access issues did not increase after the implementation  of adjusted rates. According to a CMS official, CMS uses the same  process for all DME calls received, regardless of whether the caller lives  in a CBP or non-bid area, so there is no way to distinguish DME-related  calls in CBP areas from non-bid areas. However, the CMS official said  there has been no evidence of systemic access issues in non-bid areas,  such as beneficiaries reporting they were not able to find suppliers to  furnish DME items with adjusted rates.", "We spoke with officials from three of CMS\u2019s regional offices, who also  reported there has not been an increase in the number of DME-related  inquiries since adjusted rates in non-bid areas went into effect. One of the  officials told us that her regional office is forwarded information about all  inquiries related to Medicare Parts A and B from the other CMS regional  offices. She also said the regional offices generally receive direct inquiries  from a variety of sources including beneficiaries, beneficiary advocates,  local partners, congressional district offices, and providers, and some are  also escalated by 1-800-MEDICARE customer service representatives.  According to that official, each year regional offices receive close to  40,000 inquiries nationwide regarding a wide range of DME issues, and  most are related to questions about coverage and documentation  requirements (such as what types of DME may require additional  documentation or face-to-face visits with physicians). In addition, the  official told us that regional offices capture detailed information about  each inquiry. This includes contact information for the individual  submitting the inquiry, the type of DME involved and whether it is included  in the CBP, and the regional office\u2019s response. Officials said they review  this information to specifically look for access issues or trends by product  category but have not identified any issues. One official said she had  heard anecdotal reports of beneficiaries contacting regional offices  claiming they had experienced access issues, but such reports did not  indicate these issues were widespread or sustained.", "We also interviewed representatives from the State Health Insurance  Assistance Program who reported there has not been an increase in  requests for assistance with DME-related issues since the adjusted rates  went into effect. The representatives told us State Health Insurance  Assistance Program counselors log all contacts, but the data do not  distinguish between non-bid and CBP areas. However, they said  counselors have received about 300 to 500 DME-related contacts each  quarter since 2015, and the number of requests for assistance with DME- related issues remained consistent before and after adjusted rates went  into effect. State Health Insurance Assistance Program representatives  said counselors attempt to resolve issues on their own, but can also  contact CMS\u2019s regional offices for assistance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Several Stakeholder Groups Reported Anecdotal Examples of Specific Beneficiary Access Concerns, But Did Not Have Evidence That Issues Were Widespread", "paragraphs": ["We interviewed representatives from one state hospital association, three  beneficiary advocacy groups, and four DME industry trade organizations  who provided anecdotal examples of varying degrees of beneficiary  access issues in non-bid areas. For example, representatives from the  state hospital association told us some hospital case managers in non-bid  areas have reported difficulty in locating suppliers to provide DME items  such as wheelchairs or walkers, but these issues are not widespread. A  representative from one beneficiary advocacy group told us her  organization does not receive many direct inquiries from Medicare  beneficiaries in regard to access issues to DME, but it has been  contacted by entities such as hospital discharge planners and pharmacies  regarding issues with delivery of DME items. For example, the  representative said some hospital discharge planners have reported that  DME suppliers are more resistant to delivering DME items, such as  wheelchairs and walkers, to the hospital when the beneficiary resides in a  non-bid area as opposed to a CBP area. However, the representative  said such reports are anecdotal and she does not think that issues  reported are widespread or have created significant hardship. She added  that her organization makes webinars available on a fairly regular basis,  and very few people signed up for the DME webinar, which was not the  case for webinars held for other topics.", "In contrast, a representative of another beneficiary advocacy group that  focuses on a condition in which beneficiaries would typically use oxygen  items with adjusted rates told us that without a real research instrument, it  is difficult to determine if the increase in complaints that her group began  receiving in 2016 from beneficiaries in non-bid areas is directly related to  the adjusted rates, but she said she believes they are because she had  not heard certain types of complaints before the adjusted rates went into  effect. For example, she said the beneficiary advocacy group has received complaints about reduced delivery services and reductions in  the number of portable oxygen tanks that DME suppliers are willing to  furnish in a single delivery and these complaints are more frequent from  beneficiaries who live in rural areas. The representative said given that  rural areas may have higher delivery costs, it is not surprising that some  suppliers may have decreased the number of deliveries, but she was  surprised to hear they have decreased the number of portable oxygen  tanks they are willing to provide. According to CMS, the agency  encourages individuals to report any supplier that delivers fewer tanks of  oxygen than a beneficiary needs to CMS, so this violation can be  immediately addressed.", "Representatives from four DME industry trade organizations that we  spoke with told us the implementation of adjusted rates has caused some  suppliers to change their business models and practices. Specifically,  individuals from all four DME industry trade organizations told us DME  companies have lowered costs by reducing their number of employees,  decreasing their service areas, or consolidating deliveries in specific  areas to only certain days. For example, several DME suppliers told us  that since the implementation of adjusted rates, they will only service  beneficiaries who reside within the city limits or within a certain number of  miles from their locations. Several DME suppliers told us the quality and  range of items provided by DME suppliers in non-bid areas has changed  since the adjusted rates went into effect. For example, several suppliers  reported they provide cheaper, lower quality items and that some  suppliers will no longer provide liquid oxygen to Medicare beneficiaries. In  addition, individuals from all four DME industry trade organizations also  told us there have been delays in hospital discharges as a result of not  being able to find a DME supplier to provide needed DME. In contrast,  CMS officials told us they investigated reported concerns about delayed  patient discharges because of difficulties in acquiring rate-adjusted items  and found there has not been a noticeable change in the average length  of hospital stay before and after the implementation of adjusted rates.  Specifically, CMS officials told us they measured: 1) average length of  hospital stay for beneficiaries who received new rate-adjusted items  shortly after their discharge, 2) whether beneficiaries were being  discharged prior to receiving new rate-adjusted items, and 3) average  length of stay for beneficiaries in individual access groups whether or not  they received rate-adjusted items after being discharged. According to  CMS, results of this analysis indicated no apparent changes in the  average length of hospital stay after adjusted rates were implemented.", "In addition to speaking with these representatives, we also reviewed  several publicly released studies that assessed the effect of the  implementation of adjusted rates on beneficiaries, DME suppliers, and  others. We found these studies did not provide persuasive evidence of  substantial effects, primarily because of methodological issues with how  the participants in the studies were recruited. Specifically, respondents  were recruited on social media platforms or through targeted email  notifications, raising concerns about selection bias.", "Although the number of DME suppliers and beneficiary utilization of DME  items have decreased throughout the past several years, available  evidence indicates there were not widespread beneficiary access issues  in 2016. According to CMS officials, the long-term decreases in utilization  do not necessarily indicate that beneficiaries did not receive needed  DME, and suggested instead that these decreases are the result of a  decline in unnecessary utilization. However, some stakeholders we  interviewed continued to express concerns that lower FFS payment rates  may have made it more difficult for some beneficiaries to receive needed  DME, and one DME trade organization told us some decreases in  utilization could be attributed to beneficiaries opting to pay for items  outright rather than going through Medicare. Because there is only limited  experience on changes in the number of DME suppliers and utilization of  DME based on the first year that adjusted rates have been in effect, some  effects may take longer to appear, and it is possible that trends could  differ in 2017 or subsequent years.
