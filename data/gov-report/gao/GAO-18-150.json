In 2015, Congress authorized the expansion of MTW by adding 100 new agencies. GAO was asked to evaluate the MTW demonstration. GAO examined HUD oversight of MTW agencies, including its monitoring of demonstration effects on tenants.", "For this report, GAO reviewed HUD and MTW agency policies and documentation; interviewed officials at HUD and seven MTW agencies (selected based on type of policy changes, size, and geographic diversity); and interviewed tenants served by selected agencies. GAO also conducted a statistical analysis comparing data for MTW and non-MTW agencies on public housing occupancy rates, voucher utilization rates, and program expenses."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2018s (HUD) oversight of the Moving to Work (MTW) demonstration has been limited. Improving oversight\u2014particularly for information collection and analysis\u2014would help HUD assess what MTW agencies have done, including funding use. HUD took steps to improve oversight and reporting, but GAO found limitations in the following areas:", "Workforce planning. While HUD has taken steps to address staffing to oversee the current 39 MTW agencies, HUD has not finalized its workforce planning for 100 agencies to be added to the demonstration. According to a 2015 HUD analysis, a large number of additional staff would be needed for the expansion. HUD officials said field office staff might assume greater oversight responsibilities to fill this gap, but a joint (headquarters-field) oversight structure is not final and HUD's workforce analysis has not been updated to reflect this proposed oversight structure.", "Data collection. Due to limited data, HUD cannot fully determine the extent to which demonstration flexibilities affected the performance of MTW agencies, especially in relation to outcomes that affect the number of tenants served\u2014occupancy and voucher utilization rates and program expenses. GAO found that MTW agencies had lower yearly median rates for public housing occupancy and Housing Choice Voucher (voucher) unit utilization and higher yearly median program expenses than comparable non-MTW agencies. The differences may be partly the result of demonstration funding flexibilities, such as the ability to use public housing and voucher funding for purposes such as gap financing for affordable housing (a nontraditional activity). But limitations in HUD data (such as not differentiating expenses for nontraditional activities) make it difficult to fully explain differences in outcomes GAO analyzed.", "Oversight of reserves. HUD has not implemented a process to monitor MTW reserves or agencies' plans for such reserves, which led to agencies accruing relatively large amounts of unused funds that could be used for vouchers. According to HUD data as of June 30, 2017, the 39 MTW agencies had more voucher reserves than the 2,166 non-MTW agencies that administer the voucher program combined ($808 million compared to $737 million). Without a monitoring process, HUD cannot provide reasonable assurance that MTW agencies have sound plans for expending reserves.", "Monitoring the effect of rent reform, work requirements, and time limits on tenants. HUD is limited in its ability to evaluate the effect of MTW policies on tenants. HUD does not have a framework\u2014including clear guidance on reporting requirements and analysis plans\u2014for monitoring the effect of rent-reform, work-requirement, and time-limit policies. HUD guidance instructs agencies to analyze the impact of their rent reform activities, describe how they will reevaluate them, and develop a tenant hardship policy for such policies (but not for time limits or work requirements). But the guidance does not describe what must be included in the analyses or policies, leading to wide variation in how agencies develop them. Also, HUD does not assess the results of agencies' analyses."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO makes 11 recommendations to HUD, which include completing workforce planning, developing processes to track use of funds and monitor agencies' reserves, and developing a framework\u2014including clear guidance on reporting requirements and analysis plans\u2014to monitor effects on tenants.

In  fiscal year 2017, MTW agencies received funding of about $4.3 billion,  which represented more than 17 percent of HUD\u2019s public housing and  Housing Choice Voucher (voucher) programs. The Consolidated  Appropriations Act, 2016 authorized HUD to expand the MTW  demonstration to an additional 100 public housing agencies over 7  years.

These were the most reliable and recent data available  at the time of our analysis. We combined the HUD data with data from the  American Community Survey (1-year estimates) conducted by the  Census Bureau. To assess the reliability of the data, we reviewed  relevant documentation on the information systems, conducted electronic  testing, and interviewed officials knowledgeable about the data. We  determined the data were sufficiently reliable to identify a comparison  group and compare the outcomes of certain measures for MTW and  comparable non-MTW agencies. We used the data and multivariate  statistical methods to compare MTW and similar non-MTW agencies to  estimate any association between MTW flexibilities and public housing  occupancy rates, voucher unit utilization rates, and various public housing  and voucher expenses.

We also reviewed MTW agencies\u2019  2011\u20132016 annual plans and requested information from all MTW  agencies on tools they use to monitor the effects of rent reform on  tenants.

This fungibility is intended to give  MTW agencies greater flexibility. For example, public housing operating  funds are traditionally used to make up the difference between rents  charged for units and the cost of operating them. Capital funds are  traditionally used for modernization and management improvements,  while voucher funds traditionally provide rental assistance in the private  market. However, an MTW agency may use public housing capital funds  to issue additional vouchers or use voucher funds to develop more public  housing. MTW agencies also have the authority to use their funds to  implement innovative activities that differ from traditional housing  assistance.

If larger  public housing agencies implement HUD\u2019s property management rules,  they generally are required to create a central office cost center, which  manages all the centralized activities of the agency and earns fees for  providing day-to-day oversight of individual public housing properties  such as property management. As figure 6 shows, median public  housing operating expenses related to the central office cost center for  MTW agencies were about 9 percent higher than comparable non-MTW  agencies in each year during 2009\u20132015 ($2,745 per household and  $2,520, respectively).

These  results are consistent with MTW agencies having more flexibility to use  funds to provide tenant services. The median yearly expenses for tenant  services for MTW agencies were about $37 per household. Although  tenant services are an allowable administrative expense under the  traditional voucher program, more than half of the non-MTW agencies in  our sample did not report any expenses for tenant services for most of the  years we examined. Non-MTW agencies generally use their voucher  funds to make subsidy payments to landlords and for administrative  expenses.", "The statistical matching and modeling analysis we conducted improved  upon unadjusted comparisons of MTW and non-MTW agencies, but it  was not designed to estimate the causal effects of MTW flexibilities. To  reduce the influence of known differences between the two groups, we  accounted for broad characteristics that differed between MTW agencies  and non-MTW agencies. However, our analysis did not attempt to  measure the unique circumstances of each MTW agency, but rather  broad outcomes relevant to public housing and voucher programs in  general. For additional details on our methods and results, see appendix  II.", "As noted by others who studied the MTW demonstration and our previous  report, no central source of systematic data exists for MTW activities and  outcomes. However, a July 2017 report by Abt Associates, a research  and consulting firm, identified and tested indicators they developed to  track the performance of MTW demonstrations and compare them to  similar non-MTW agencies. As with our analysis, the Abt study found  MTW agencies tended to have worse outcomes than similar non-MTW  agencies on the indicators of voucher administrative expenses and  voucher unit utilization. The study also analyzed other indicators such as  increases in earnings of nonelderly, nondisabled households; households  served by a service coordinator; and share of voucher households in  neighborhoods with lower poverty rates. On many of the other indicators  analyzed, the study found that MTW agencies did better than similar non- MTW agencies. For example, for the self-sufficiency measures examined  in the study, estimates showed that household earnings were more likely  to increase at MTW agencies than at comparison non-MTW agencies.  The study also concluded that MTW agencies were able to serve a  significant number of individuals not reached by traditional housing  assistance and that in many cases, they were also able to offer additional  supportive services. However, because our analysis did not look at these  other indicators, we could not confirm these results."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Limitations in HUD Data Make It Difficult to Fully Understand Differences", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Potential Reasons for Observed Differences", "paragraphs": ["The observed differences in public housing occupancy and voucher unit  utilization rates and program expenses between MTW and non-MTW  agencies, which could affect the number of tenants served, may be a  result of MTW agencies\u2019 ability to (1) combine their public housing and  voucher funds and use them interchangeably and (2) use funds to  implement policies that go beyond traditional forms of housing  assistance.", "Combined funding and fungibility. The single fund authorization  permits MTW agencies to combine their public housing operating, public  housing capital, and voucher funds into a single agency-wide funding  source and use the funds interchangeably. For instance, voucher funds  may be used for public housing expenses and vice versa, which could  affect utilization and occupancy rates. Our analysis of 2015 data from  FDS, which HUD uses to account for the agencies\u2019 MTW financial data,  showed that 19 MTW agencies transferred voucher funding to their public  housing program as the result of the single-fund authorization (that is,  they transferred more funding to their public housing accounts than they  received through their public housing funding allocation). This analysis  was possible because HUD requires agencies to report financial information in FDS at the public housing project level. However, the  data could not be used to determine whether all the funds transferred to  the public housing accounts were spent on public housing expenses  because, according to HUD officials, FDS is not a system that tracks the  actual drawdown or disbursement of funds. Instead, public housing  agencies use the system to report year-end financial activity. (As  discussed later in this report, FDS data could not be used to determine  the extent to which public housing funds were used for voucher  expenses.)", "Nontraditional activities. Public housing occupancy and voucher unit  utilization rates might be lower for MTW agencies in part because MTW  agencies can use funds to implement policies that go beyond traditional  forms of housing assistance. Since October 2009, the demonstration\u2019s  \u201cbroader uses of funds\u201d authorization under the standard agreement has  permitted all MTW agencies to adopt local, nontraditional activities, which  HUD guidance organizes into four categories (see table 3).", "In July 2017, HUD provided us with data it had recently compiled on the  number of households served through local, nontraditional activities, by  MTW agency, during 2009\u20132016 (see fig. 10). According to these data,  in 2009 four agencies implemented at least one type of local,  nontraditional housing assistance activity and served 1,177 households (that is, less than 1 household served through local, nontraditional  housing assistance for every 100 MTW public housing and voucher units  available). In 2016, the number of agencies that implemented at least one  local, nontraditional housing assistance activity grew to 25 agencies,  which served 9,787 households (about 2 households served through  local, nontraditional housing assistance for every 100 MTW public  housing and voucher unit available). Some of these households could be  served through a rental assistance program that offers a lower level of  subsidy than is available to households served through traditional  voucher and public housing programs. For example, a local,  nontraditional activity could result in an MTW agency lowering its share of  housing assistance, thereby increasing the tenant\u2019s share of rent.  Conversely, HUD officials pointed out that because MTW agencies assist  hard-to-serve households, the subsidies provided to these households  could be higher than the subsidy provided under HUD\u2019s traditional  housing assistance programs. As such, a household served through local,  nontraditional housing activity may not be equivalent to a household  served under the traditional voucher or public housing program.", "Other factors related to expenses. According to HUD officials, factors  that could explain the observed differences in the expenses for the public  housing and voucher programs of MTW agencies and non-MTW  agencies include that MTW agencies typically (1) need more time and  resources to develop and implement \u201cinnovative\u201d activities, (2) serve  hard-to-serve households such as those experiencing homelessness, and  (3) provide additional services to the households they serve as a result of  the funding flexibilities. According to a University of North Carolina at  Chapel Hill study, nearly all MTW agencies have used program flexibility  to provide supportive housing for various hard-to-serve populations,  including the previously homeless, mentally disabled, developmentally  disabled, formerly incarcerated, domestic abuse victims, youth aging out  of foster care, and those with substance abuse issues. Some of these  programs were provided through sponsor-based voucher programs  administered by partner agencies, which required coordination between  the MTW agency and the partnering agencies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Data Limitations Hinder Fuller Explanations", "paragraphs": ["Limitations in HUD data make it difficult to more fully explain the  differences that may affect the number of households served. For  instance, HUD cannot measure how participation in the demonstration  affected the occupancy and voucher unit utilization rates of MTW  agencies. As previously discussed, HUD uses FDS to account for the  agencies\u2019 MTW funds, but once combined in the system, the funds are  decoupled from the original funding source and it is difficult to determine  how these funds were used. As described earlier, although FDS data  could be used to illustrate how many agencies transferred voucher  funding to their public housing program, these data could not be used to  illustrate how many agencies transferred public housing funding to their  voucher program because, according to HUD officials, FDS does not  identify the source of funding that is available for the voucher program  and local, nontraditional activities.", "Similarly, FDS cannot measure expenses that were for local,  nontraditional activities because FDS expenditure categories are not  tailored to the MTW demonstration. HUD officials said the reporting of  expenses associated with local, nontraditional activities varies by MTW  agency, which affects where FDS captures such expenses. HUD has  not made changes to FDS because, according to HUD officials, FDS is an  accounting system that tracks agencies\u2019 year-end financial activity and,  therefore, is not designed to keep track of these data.", "Furthermore, historical data do not exist on the households served  through local, nontraditional activities. Although HUD provided us a  spreadsheet it compiled in July 2017 with data on the number of  households served through local, nontraditional housing assistance  activities from 2009 through 2016, HUD had to manually compile the  spreadsheet because its PIC system does not capture data on these  households. HUD officials said the agency was considering capturing  some data on local, nontraditional households in PIC, but making this  change would require HUD and MTW agencies to devote resources to  update their systems.", "HUD previously considered making changes to the system. In 2012, HUD  issued a Federal Register notice requesting public comment on changes  to the system to track households provided assistance through local,  nontraditional activities. According to the notice, agencies had not been  reporting these families into the system, which made it difficult to  accurately account for the number of MTW families being served. The  notice further stated that the MTW Office was manually collecting data on  the number of families served each year but the PIC system needed to be  revised to make information collection easier for MTW agencies and  HUD. HUD officials said HUD did not have the information technology  resources needed to make this change in PIC.", "Federal internal control standards state that management should use  quality information to achieve the entity\u2019s objectives. Additionally, one of  the statutory objectives of the MTW demonstration is to reduce costs and  achieve greater cost-effectiveness in federal housing expenditures, and a  key demonstration requirement is to assist substantially the same total  number of eligible low-income families under MTW as would have been  served absent the demonstration.", "As discussed previously, intermingled funding streams, the purpose and  structure of FDS, and limitations in PIC have combined to limit the data  collected and readily available on the MTW demonstration. According to  HUD officials, it would be difficult for HUD to require existing agencies to  report additional financial data because doing so would require changes  to the standard agreement, which generally cannot occur without mutual  agreement between the agencies and HUD. Yet agencies\u2019 specific  reporting obligations are not set forth in the general standard agreement  but rather in Attachment B, which HUD already expanded without  requiring an amendment to the standard agreement in 2011 and 2013  and proposed to do in 2016.

As a result, these agencies have an incentive to expend their voucher  funding to keep their budget utilization rate high. However, the voucher  formula for MTW agencies, which is outlined in an attachment to each  agency\u2019s standard agreement, is generally based on the actual, per-unit  costs in the year prior to the agency joining the MTW demonstration.

For example,  before 2016 HUD did not capture data that would help it determine the  amount of voucher reserves held by MTW agencies. In January 2012, as  part of a new cash management requirement for the voucher program,  HUD implemented a process to help transition the accrual of excess  funds held at the agency level to HUD-held reserves. According to HUD  officials, this process was only partially implemented for MTW agencies at  that time because voucher subsidy expenses were comingled with  expenses associated with other allowable MTW activities in VMS. In  2016, HUD added new fields in VMS to distinguish various MTW  nonvoucher subsidy expenses (such as those for capital improvements of  existing public housing units and operation of local, nontraditional  activities) from unspent funding. According to HUD officials, these  enhancements to VMS now allow HUD to keep track of MTW agencies\u2019  reserves. Consequently, in 2016, HUD started cash reconciliations for  MTW agencies, consistent with the cash management procedures for  non-MTW agencies.", "HUD also does not have a process to systematically determine if MTW  agencies have public housing reserves. Unlike for the voucher program,  HUD was unable to determine the extent to which MTW agencies had  unspent public housing funding in reserves. According to HUD officials,  FDS tracks overall MTW reserves but HUD cannot distinguish between  public housing and voucher reserves because the MTW funds are  combined into a single account and because HUD does not have a  system similar to VMS that separately tracks public housing reserves for  MTW agencies.", "According to federal internal control standards, management should  internally communicate the necessary quality information, such as  through written communication, to help achieve the agency\u2019s objectives.

We also developed criteria\u2014a set of questions\u2014 that agency managers and Congress could use to identify and manage  fee revenue instability, including identifying common principles and  leading practices for managing reserve funds. For example, managers  should ask what level of reserves is to be maintained. In addition, they  should consider establishing minimum and maximum reserve levels to  ensure accountability and adherence to the reserve\u2019s goals, justifying the  numbers with program data and risk management considerations.

An impact  analysis for a similar policy from another agency included the number of  tenants who would be affected by the policy and a dollar estimate of how  much money tenants could save. Activities that might be considered  administrative, such as changes to the frequency of tenant  recertifications, were less likely to include details such as analysis of the  rent burden on tenants than were other activities. In several agencies\u2019  impact analyses, as well as in interviews with agency officials, agencies  generally indicated that they think of these MTW policies or activities as  being good for tenants, which may explain why agencies were less likely  to discuss burden on tenants.", "HUD officials acknowledged the need for more detailed guidance and  said they planned to provide such guidance for the expansion agencies.

Further, HUD has already revised Attachment B and  agencies\u2019 reporting requirements contained therein on multiple occasions  without requiring changes to the standard agreement. Officials stated they  could encourage existing agencies to follow the guidance for the  expansion agencies.", "Federal internal control standards state that management should  externally communicate the necessary quality information to achieve the  agency\u2019s objectives. By framing the steps in Attachment B as  suggestions and not prescribing the elements of impact analyses, HUD  cannot consistently collect the type of information it needs to assess the  effect of MTW activities on tenants across agencies.

The remaining proposals either did not include a  description or agencies stated that they would evaluate the activity  annually without providing further description of how they would perform  the evaluation. When we requested that agencies provide their 2015  annual reevaluations of their rent-reform policies, several of the MTW  agencies were confused about what we meant by annual reevaluation.  Some of those agencies asked if we were referring to their annual report  and one agency asked how an annual reevaluation was different from an  impact analysis.", "When we received documentation of what the agencies considered to be  the annual reevaluations of their rent-reform activities, 30 of the agencies  provided us information they are required to include for all of their  activities in their annual reports. For example, agencies must include a  description of their activities and their impact, compare policy outcomes to  HUD metrics, and explain challenges they faced if benchmarks were not  achieved. Most agencies referred us to all or part of this information.  However, some agencies provided analyses that went beyond those  required for annual reports, including evaluations from third-party  researchers. For example, one agency partners with a local university to  conduct an annual survey that allows the agency to assess the effect of  its rent-reform activities on households.", "During the course of our work, a HUD official said the agency had not  required MTW agencies to report annual reevaluations because, as long  as agencies had a plan to annually reevaluate their activities and HUD  had the ability to request the reevaluations if concerns arose, HUD did not  want to require agencies to report information HUD did not intend to  analyze. HUD officials later stated that the agency plans to provide more  detailed guidance for the expansion agencies and has been updating  Attachment B to clarify that agencies\u2019 annual reports must include the  results of their annual reevaluations of their rent-reform activities.", "In addition, HUD officials said they could issue guidance that encouraged  existing agencies to follow the guidance for the expansion agencies but it  would be difficult to require existing agencies to include specific elements  in these annual reevaluations without changes to the standard  agreement. However, the standard agreement merely requires that MTW  agencies fulfill the annual reporting requirements set forth in Attachment  B, which provides the detailed description of the required elements of the  annual plan and report and which HUD has already revised on multiple  occasions without requiring changes to the standard agreement.", "Because HUD allows agencies to determine the process for reevaluating  their activities, most MTW agencies have not collected or reported  additional information on rent-reform activities (including effects or  unintended consequences) outside of the requirements of their annual  reports.

For example, officials from  one agency said they relied on the 2009 draft guidance and officials from  another agency said they relied on Attachment B when developing their  policies. Officials from three other agencies said they reviewed the  hardship policies of other MTW agencies, had conversations with HUD  while planning the activity or waiting for HUD\u2019s review of their annual  plan, or looked to relevant federal regulations. In contrast, officials from  another agency said that there was no guidance available on how to  create their hardship policies because their agency joined the  demonstration the year it began.", "Our review of MTW agencies\u2019 hardship policies for rent-reform activities  showed that while these hardship policies had some commonalities, they  also were inconsistent in terms of the type of information included. For  example, of the 84 hardship policies we reviewed, MTW agencies  included a discussion of how the agency processes a hardship complaint  in 56 policies and what remedies are available for residents approved for  a hardship exemption or waiver in 75 policies. In contrast, 26 policies  included information about whether tenants have the ability to reapply for  a hardship exemption or waiver, and 26 policies mentioned if the  agencies have different rules for the elderly or persons with disabilities. In  addition, although most hardship policies generally discussed how a  tenant may claim a hardship and apply for an exemption, some agencies  were much more specific about the process. For example, one agency  stated only that tenants may request a hardship exemption in writing,  while another agency explained which application a tenant needed to fill  out, what supporting documentation to include, and how to submit the  application.", "Some agencies have created more parameters around a tenant\u2019s ability  to request a hardship exemption or waiver than others. For example,  some hardship policies are time-limited (that is, tenants have a certain  window of time in which to apply). One agency instituted a hardship policy  for its minimum rent that stated that tenants had 15 days from receipt of  notice of their new household tenant rental payment to apply for a  hardship exemption or waiver. Another agency instituting a hardship  policy for a similar activity did not seem to impose a time limit for a tenant  to request an exemption. In addition, some hardship policies provided  relief for current tenants. For example, one-third of agencies created a  hardship policy for at least one of their activities that either exempted  current residents from the rent-reform activity or provided some form of  temporary relief as the rent-reform policy was implemented.", "We also found variation in the information MTW agencies were able to  provide on the households that requested a hardship exemption. We  asked all the MTW agencies to provide us a list of all tenants who  requested a hardship exemption in 2011\u20132015, including the result of  each request (denied or approved), the current status of each tenant, and  the reason the tenant was no longer receiving housing assistance, if  applicable. Of all the MTW agencies, five said they had not received any  requests for hardship exemptions. Three agencies were only able to  provide us information on those hardship requests that were approved,  two agencies did not indicate if the requests they received were approved  or denied, and one agency did not provide any data because it could not  distinguish hardship requests for its traditional programs from its MTW  activities. Additionally, five agencies did not provide the reasons why  tenants who requested a hardship exemption were no longer receiving  assistance. The remaining 22 agencies were able to provide the  information as requested.", "Tenants and advocates expressed mixed opinions about the rent-reform  hardship policies created by the MTW agencies we interviewed.", "Some tenants with whom we spoke said they were aware of rent-reform  hardship policies the agencies developed. For example, tenants who  participated in one of our group meetings told us that during their income  recertification the case worker assigned to their case provided them a  checklist that outlined each of the agency\u2019s hardship policies.", "When we spoke with advocates who work with tenants subject to MTW  activities, some said most tenants do not know about the hardship  policies available to them. Some tenants and advocates with whom we  spoke said the process for requesting a hardship could be difficult. For  example, one tenant said that although the MTW agency mailed tenants  \u201cfrequently asked questions\u201d that described the hardship policy, the  document was confusing and included a citation to the Federal Register  for more information, which was difficult for tenants to access. Advocates  at one organization also said tenants asked for help because the tenants  applied for a hardship waiver through their case manager, but never  received a response. In contrast, during these meetings some other  tenants told us that they had no issues with the hardship policies or the  way in which the MTW agencies implemented them.", "As discussed previously, federal internal control standards require  agencies to communicate effectively with external stakeholders to help  achieve agency goals.

However, the standard agreement merely  requires that MTW agencies fulfill the requirements contained in  Attachment B, which HUD has already revised on multiple occasions  without requiring changes to the standard agreement. Officials said that  they plan to provide more descriptive guidance for expansion agencies  and encourage existing agencies to follow such guidance.

For example, as  previously discussed, HUD guidance in Attachment B requires agencies  to include an impact analysis, annual reevaluation, and hardship policy for  rent-reform activities in their annual plans when the activity is proposed.  However, Attachment B does not include similar requirements for  proposed work-requirement or time-limit policies.", "Further inconsistencies include that Attachment C of the standard  agreement, which lists the various MTW flexibilities available to agencies,  requires MTW agencies to create a hardship policy if they establish a  time-limit policy for public housing assistance. However, HUD did not  develop guidance requiring agencies to report on their hardship policies  for time-limit policies for public housing assistance. Furthermore, HUD  does not have a similar requirement for time-limit policies established for  voucher assistance. In addition, in the Federal Register operations notice  for the expansion of the MTW demonstration published in January 2017,  HUD proposed requiring the new MTW agencies to conduct an impact  analysis and develop a hardship policy for rent-reform and time-limit  policies, but develop only a hardship policy for work requirements.", "As previously discussed, federal internal control standards require  management to design control activities\u2014policies, procedures,  techniques, and mechanisms\u2014in response to the entity\u2019s risks.

However, they said, currently, these policies are typically  implemented in conjunction with a rent-reform activity so there is still  reporting on the combined policies. HUD officials also stated that if an  agency proposed an activity with a time limit for public housing, the MTW  coordinator reviewing the agency\u2019s annual plan would ensure that a  hardship policy was in place. In addition, when MTW staff review a  proposed work requirement for both the public housing and voucher  programs and a proposed time limit for the voucher program, staff  suggest that MTW agencies adopt hardship policies and conduct impact  analyses for these policies.", "HUD officials also stated that the agency plans to require expansion  agencies to develop an impact analysis, annual reevaluation, and  hardship policy for rent-reform, work-requirement, and time-limit policies.  Although HUD officials said it would be difficult to set a similar  requirement for existing MTW agencies because doing so would require  changes to the standard agreement, they stated they could update  Attachment B to incorporate the requirement for a hardship policy for  public housing time limits and develop guidance encouraging existing  agencies to comply with the additional requirements put in place for the  expansion agencies.

For instance, HUD has not always  reviewed annual reports that include information needed to determine the  demonstration\u2019s effect on tenants in a timely manner, annually assessed  whether current MTW agencies comply with demonstration requirements,  and fully documented its review processes. When complete, expansion of  the demonstration would more than triple the number of MTW agencies.  By finalizing its workforce planning (including an assessment of  competencies and skills needed) and documenting its compliance review  process, HUD can provide assurance that it would be positioned to  oversee an expanded demonstration before new agencies start being  added in 2018.", "Data collection. Our comparison of public housing occupancy and  voucher unit utilization rates and program expenses among MTW and  non-MTW agencies raises questions about agency performance and use  of funding that cannot be fully answered with current data. The  differences among agencies may result in part from the MTW  demonstration\u2019s funding flexibilities. However, HUD is limited in its ability  to readily determine the extent to which MTW funds were used for other  allowable purposes. More comprehensively capturing and tracking data  on uses of funding and the characteristics of households served by local  nontraditional activities would allow HUD to better assess agency  performance. HUD also would be better able to account for differences in  outcomes\u2014especially in relation to occupancy and voucher utilization  rates and program expenses\u2014that affect the number of tenants served.", "MTW reserves. The accumulation of relatively large reserves by MTW  agencies also raises questions about funding uses. HUD has performed  limited oversight of MTW voucher reserves and its data and financial  reporting systems are not structured to effectively track public housing  reserves.

For  example, the variations in reporting on rent reform and self-sufficiency as  a result of inconsistent definitions of these terms; limited guidance (often  couched as suggestions) HUD provided to agencies for developing  impact analyses, annual reevaluations, and tenant hardship policies; and  inconsistent treatment of rent-reform and work-requirement and time-limit  policies suggest that HUD may have emphasized flexibility to the  detriment of oversight.

As discussed in the draft report, due to  data limitations, we could not evaluate the effect of MTW flexibilities on  tenants. Instead, we focused on the extent to which HUD monitored the  effects of rent-reform, work-requirement, and time-limit policies on  tenants. Furthermore, our analysis of available data showed that MTW  agencies had lower public housing occupancy rates and voucher unit  utilization rates and higher program expenses than comparable non- MTW agencies, which could affect the number of tenants served.", "HUD also stated that it seemed we reviewed MTW agencies through the  lens of the traditional housing and voucher programs. HUD noted  fundamental differences in MTW and non-MTW agency operations and  stated it must consider the extensive MTW flexibilities and the locally- designed nature of each MTW agency\u2019s program in administering the  demonstration. HUD stated it did not agree with three of our  recommendations (discussed below) that it noted would restrict an MTW  agency\u2019s ability to exercise MTW flexibility and respond to variations in  local markets. As stated in the draft report, we recognize the challenges  involved with monitoring the MTW demonstration, but maintain it is  important for HUD to take steps to achieve and sustain a better balance  between flexibility and prudent oversight. Furthermore, given that the  demonstration\u2019s ultimate goal is to identify successful approaches that  can be applied to public housing agencies nationwide, we believe we  looked objectively and with the appropriate rigor and contextual  sophistication at MTW agencies.", "HUD disagreed with the draft report\u2019s third recommendation to develop  and implement a process to track how public housing and voucher  funding is being used for other allowable activities, including local,  nontraditional activities. HUD stated that funding fungibility and policy  flexibility are the core tenets of the MTW demonstration. As a result,  identifying and tracking expenses paid from a specific funding source are  not necessary and should not be a requirement. We acknowledge the  demonstration\u2019s funding and policy flexibility and did not intend for our  recommendation to be interpreted solely as a suggestion to track funding  sources. We therefore clarified our recommendation to focus on tracking  how MTW demonstration funds are being used for allowable activities,  such as local, nontraditional activities. HUD stated that the revised HUD  Form 50900 or Attachment B (expected to be published in early 2018)  would require existing MTW agencies to estimate the cost of each  planned activity. Although this would provide some cost information, it  would be limited to planned activities only and would not capture actual  costs. Therefore, we continue to believe that more comprehensively  tracking data on uses of funding would allow HUD to better account for  differences in outcomes\u2014especially in relation to occupancy and voucher  utilization rates and program expenses\u2014that affect the number of tenants  served.", "HUD disagreed with the fifth recommendation to develop and implement  a process to monitor MTW agencies' reserves. HUD stated that there is  no language in the 1996 Act that limits the reserves of MTW agencies to  a certain level. Although our draft report noted that leading practices for  managing reserve funds include considering establishing a maximum  reserve level, we did not recommend that HUD set such a reserve level  for MTW agencies because we recognized the demonstration\u2019s funding  flexibilities. Rather, we recommended that HUD develop a process to  monitor MTW agencies\u2019 plans for reserves. HUD also commented that by  reviewing and granting approval for all MTW activities that the existing 39  agencies implemented, it already had a process to determine if spending  of reserve funds was reasonable. However, as HUD noted in its  comments on the draft report\u2019s third recommendation, the agency does  not currently require MTW agencies to include the cost of a planned  activity when proposing the activity. An approval process that does not  include a review of information on planned costs, including the extent to  which reserves would be used to fund the activity, is not sufficient  because HUD lacks data needed to determine that reserve expenditures  are reasonable. Finally, HUD noted that PIH\u2019s Financial Management  Division currently tracks the public housing and voucher reserves of MTW  agencies. However, this does not address our concern that HUD does not  monitor existing MTW agencies\u2019 plans for their reserves and whether the  plans are reasonable given the amount of reserves. In order to provide  reasonable assurance that MTW agencies have sound plans for  expanding their reserves, HUD still would have to develop a process to  monitor MTW agencies\u2019 reserves. Therefore, we maintain our  recommendation.", "Similarly, HUD disagreed with our seventh recommendation to set  parameters for its definition of self-sufficiency for the demonstration,  either by providing one definition or a range of options from which  agencies could choose. It noted that the MTW demonstration provides  agencies with the ability to develop creative solutions to address local  conditions, and a one-size-fits-all approach is not appropriate. HUD  stated it intentionally has not developed a standard definition for self- sufficiency, because the definition could depend on local conditions such  as employment opportunities and availability of supportive services. We  recognized the need for flexibility in our recommendation by suggesting  that HUD could develop a range of definitions from which MTW agencies  could choose. This approach would provide the necessary flexibility while  still allowing HUD to collect the consistent information needed to evaluate  the effect of MTW rent-reform and occupancy policies on tenants.  Therefore, we maintain our recommendation.", "HUD generally agreed with our remaining eight recommendations. For  example, HUD agreed with the draft report\u2019s first recommendation on  workforce planning, but requested that due to the cross-cutting nature of  MTW, we expand the recommendation to include other PIH offices. We  acknowledge that the staff needed to manage the expanded  demonstration may be found outside the MTW Office, and therefore we  modified our recommendation. HUD also agreed with the second  recommendation to more fully document the process for annually  assessing compliance with the five demonstration requirements and said  it will finalize internal written procedures in early 2018. In addition, in  commenting on the fourth recommendation, HUD described plans to  update its data system to capture information on households served  through local, nontraditional MTW activities. Furthermore, in regard to the  eighth recommendation, HUD noted that it plans to develop guidance for  MTW agencies for the monitoring of high-impact activities such as rent  reform, work requirements, and time limits. Finally, in commenting on the  eleventh recommendation, HUD stated it will improve its process of  analyzing the data MTW agencies provide on high-impact activities.", "In commenting on our workforce planning finding, HUD made the  following points:", "HUD stated that our finding that planning for the MTW expansion  workforce structure has not been completed is not an accurate  characterization. It noted that HUD completed a workforce analysis and  hired five additional staff in 2016 in anticipation of the MTW expansion. In  our draft report, we acknowledged steps that HUD took to increase the  staffing levels of the MTW Office. However, we found that in its workforce  analysis, HUD had not assessed the knowledge, skills, and abilities  needed to implement an oversight structure for the MTW expansion  demonstration. HUD acknowledged in its response to the  recommendation that its workforce planning efforts will continue in 2018.", "HUD said our draft report did not discuss two other factors (beyond  insufficient staff) that affected oversight of the MTW demonstration: (1)  2013 was the first year HUD assessed each agency\u2019s compliance with  the five demonstration requirements, and (2) from 2013 to 2015, HUD  was in protracted and complex negotiations with the existing MTW  agencies to determine the terms of the extension of their MTW  participation. Our draft report acknowledged both factors. Specifically, we  noted that HUD developed a process for assessing compliance with the  five demonstration requirements in response to a recommendation in our  2012 report and that the process was implemented in 2013. Our draft  report also stated that HUD officials noted that in 2014 and 2015 existing  staff in the MTW Office had to focus on other priorities, including  renegotiating the standard agreement, and then in 2016 on implementing  the expansion of the demonstration.", "HUD said that even with limited staff, MTW agency plans had been  reviewed and approved within the required time frames.", "In commenting on our data collection finding, HUD made the following  points:", "Related to our multivariate statistical analysis to examine any association  between MTW flexibilities and program outcomes, HUD stated that HUD  and MTW agencies historically found it difficult to establish comparison  groups because MTW and non-MTW agencies implement significantly  different interventions. We agree that comparisons of MTW and non- MTW agencies are difficult to make. We acknowledge that MTW  agencies differ substantially from non-MTW agencies on factors such as  size and market housing costs. Accordingly, we used statistical  techniques to improve on simple comparisons between MTW and non- MTW agencies. These techniques enabled us to identify a group of  comparison non-MTW agencies that were similar to MTW agencies on  important factors such as geographic location, households served, and  county median rents. We then compared outcomes between the two  groups of agencies over a number of years (2009 through 2015). We did  not compare a single MTW agency to a non-MTW comparison group, as  HUD stated. For more detailed information on our analysis, see appendix  II.", "HUD also stated that our finding that MTW agencies had higher tenant  services expenses for the voucher program than non-MTW agencies was  an expected outcome (because the demonstration encourages MTW  agencies to engage in employment, self-sufficiency programming, and  tenant services). In our draft report, we stated that the results of the  analysis were consistent with MTW agencies having more flexibility to  use funds to provide tenant services.", "Furthermore, HUD said that a comparison of voucher administrative  expenses for MTW and non-MTW agencies was skewed and not a valid  comparison because administrative expenses for MTW agencies  included voucher administrative expenses and other administrative  expenses not permitted under the traditional voucher program.  Differences in financial and performance outcomes that only MTW  flexibilities allow, such as a broader range of administrative expenses,  represent the potential effects of the demonstration, not a source of bias.  The purpose of our analysis was to determine any association between  MTW flexibilities and program outcomes. Because MTW rules allow for  additional administrative expenses, it was appropriate to include these  expenses in our analysis.", "In addition, HUD stated that that it had requested the list of the  comparison group of non-MTW agencies to MTW agencies and  suggested the list be included in our report. The agency noted that  without this information, HUD was not able to validate our analysis. As  noted previously, our analysis was not a simple comparison of MTW and  non-MTW agencies. We developed a comparison group, applied  algorithms based on certain assumptions, and conducted sensitivity  analyses that tested these assumptions.  Therefore, simply providing the  list would not enable HUD to reproduce our analysis. Furthermore, we  selected the variables for matching because they were similar across all  agencies in each group (that is, the full distributions), not for any  particular pair of matched agencies. Consequently, we evaluated the  quality of our comparison group using the distributions of these variables  across all agencies in each group. We included those statistics in our  report, rather than the identity of particular agencies, to encourage  systematic evaluations of the matched comparison agencies using  aggregate statistics, rather than anecdotal evaluations of particular  matched pairs. Finally, we communicated with HUD throughout the  review about our data analysis. For example, we met with HUD to  discuss our methodology, provided initial results, and worked with HUD  officials to ensure we were using appropriate data fields.", "HUD also provided technical comments, which we incorporated as  appropriate. We considered one comment to be more than technical in  nature. Specifically, in response to our finding that HUD does not require  MTW agencies to submit the results of their annual reevaluations of the  impact of rent-reform activities, HUD officials stated that they consider the  annual report (and information therein) to be the annual reevaluation of  rent-reform activities. However, Attachment B does not include a  requirement that agencies report the results of their annual reevaluations.  Furthermore, if the information currently required to be included in the  annual report satisfied the annual reevaluation requirement, then there  would be no need for HUD to update Attachment B to clarify that  agencies\u2019 annual reports must include the results of their annual  reevaluations, as the agency plans to do. Therefore, we maintain our  finding and made revisions to the report to clarify what is currently  required in Attachment B.", "As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.

Small sample sizes would have  limited our statistical power to identify differences between treatment  groups, if they existed. In addition, the wide variety of MTW activities  would have made it difficult to produce a sufficient number of  homogenous groups, and would have required subjective judgment about  what activities were sufficiently similar.

In the sensitivity analyses described below,  we will fit this model on the unmatched population of agencies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Primary Results", "paragraphs": ["In the matched sample, MTW agencies had lower median public housing  occupancy rates and voucher unit utilization rates compared to non-MTW  agencies, as shown in table 9. Compared to non-MTW agencies, MTW  agencies had higher median public housing expenses per household  (operating and central office cost center operating expenses) and higher  median voucher administrative expenses per household, subsidy  expenses per household, tenant services expenses per household, and  reserves per household. These differences were significant at the 0.05  level for all variables using the nonparametric Wilcoxon signed-rank  test. However, using the parametric t-tests and related t-tests from the  regression models, there was not a significant difference in central office  cost center operating expenses. This could arise from the presence of  outliers skewing the distribution, leading to different results compared to  the Wilcoxon test that does not make any distributional assumptions.  Regardless of the particular method used, small sample sizes in each  group, as well as repeated observations over time, may limit our statistical  power to identify differences, if they existed. Sample sizes resulting from  missing data also affect the degree to which comparable non-MTW  agencies can be found, given the limited overlap in the covariate  distributions between groups."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Sensitivity Analyses", "paragraphs": ["We assessed the results above for sensitivity to various methodological  assumptions. For the matching analysis, we assessed the impact of  1.  measuring MTW status as of the agreement year, rather than as of 1  year following the agreement (i.e., 1 year lag);  2.  matching within 1 standard deviation calipers for each covariate;  3.  allowing matches between HUD regions;  4.  including county unemployment and poverty rates as covariates;  5.  including estimated propensity scores, as a logistic function of the  control variables described for the primary analysis, as a matching  covariate;  6.  increasing the number of comparison agencies for each MTW agency  to k = {2, 3, 4} using the control variables described for the primary  analysis; and  7.  excluding clusters where the MTW and/or non-MTW agencies had an  outlying value for an outcome of interest.", "For the regression model, we compared the results obtained from fitting  the model to the matched and unmatched data.", "The sensitivity tests above showed no substantively meaningful  differences in the results as compared to the primary analysis, with  several exceptions. Adding the caliper constraint and dropping the HUD  region constraint improved covariate balance. Dropping the HUD region  constraint led to MTW agencies having a smaller difference in voucher  subsidy expenses, compared to non-MTW agencies. In our primary  analysis, MTW agencies had higher subsidy expenses. However,  allowing matches between HUD regions may introduce unmeasured  geographic characteristics into the comparison group of non-MTW  agencies, which may limit the comparability of subsidy expenses and bias  the estimated difference in outcomes."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the Department of Housing and Urban Development", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Paige Smith (Assistant Director),  Josephine Perez (Analyst in Charge), Enyinnaya David Aja, Bethany  Benitez, Farrah Graham, Anar N.
