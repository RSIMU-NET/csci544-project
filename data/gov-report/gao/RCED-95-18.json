Now we know that the number of sites needing attention is much larger than originally believed and that the program could run at least several more decades. However, there is uncertainty about how many sites may eventually enter the program and whether fewer, less heavily contaminated sites are now being reported to EPA than were reported earlier in the program\u2019s history. Estimates about how many sites will need cleaning up in the future could influence policy-making about the program\u2019s design and the division of cleanup responsibilities between federal and state governments.", "Because of your interest in these subjects, you asked us to (1) examine trends in the number of reported sites and EPA\u2019s evaluation of potential contamination at these sites as indicated by the agency\u2019s site inspections and (2) review recent estimates of the future growth of the Superfund program."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["EPA does not actively seek out sites for the Superfund program but relies on states or interested parties to report them. Once reported, sites are added to EPA\u2019s inventory for evaluation. As of March 1994, EPA\u2019s inventory had 36,785 nonfederal sites, of which 1,192 had been placed on the National Priorities List.", "Evaluation of potentially hazardous sites occurs in several stages. At the completion of each stage, EPA may determine that no federal action is needed or it may proceed to the next stage. First, EPA requires that a site receive a preliminary assessment within a year of its entry into the inventory. The preliminary assessment involves a review of available documents and possible site reconnaissance. If the preliminary assessment indicates a potential problem, the site moves to the next stage of evaluation\u2014the site inspection\u2014which involves collecting and analyzing soil and water samples as appropriate.", "If warranted by the results of the site inspection, sites enter the final decision process. This process involves other evaluations, including an extended site inspection if needed, scoring under EPA\u2019s hazard ranking system; and a judgment by EPA officials on the appropriateness of listing the site on the priorities list. An extended site inspection requires more samples and could involve installing wells to monitor groundwater or other nonroutine data collection activities. The hazard ranking system is a method of quantifying the severity of site contamination to determine if a site should be placed on the list. The system assigns a numerical score based on the likelihood that a site has released or has the potential to release contaminants into the environment, the characteristics of the contaminants, and the people or environments affected by the release. A site must score at least 28.5 on the hazard ranking scale in order to be placed on the list. Sites can be dropped from further consideration following the extended site inspection or the scoring process. Sites also can be dropped from further consideration if, in the judgment of EPA regional officials, the sites do not pose risks great enough to warrant a Superfund cleanup.", "In addition to the sites following the process described above, the EPA inventory includes a large group of sites that have already been inspected but are awaiting reevaluation because of a change in the evaluation process. The Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 required EPA to revise its evaluation system to make it more comprehensive and accurate in its assessment of threats to human health and the environment. According to EPA site assessment officials, the revision will change the mix of sites, but not necessarily the number of sites, that will end up on the priorities list. The revision was effective in March 1991. During the transition to the revised system, sites were evaluated through the site inspection stage using the original evaluation system. However, EPA decided to use the new system to make final decisions about placing these sites on the priorities list. In October 1991, EPA began to reevaluate these 6,467 sites, which it referred to as its evaluation backlog. Reevaluation could include collecting additional site information as well as limited sampling. As of the close of fiscal year 1993, EPA had completed this process for about 1,600 of the 6,467 sites."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reported Sites Have Declined in Number but Not in Severity of Contamination", "paragraphs": ["Fewer sites are being reported to EPA for evaluation, but site inspection results indicate that new sites reaching the site inspection stage are as likely to have contamination requiring a Superfund cleanup as those inspected in the past."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Fewer Reported Sites", "paragraphs": ["The number of sites reported annually has been declining since fiscal year 1985.

However, the officials believe that contamination at newly discovered sites is generally not less severe than at previously reported sites\u2014just less obvious. Earlier site discoveries more often included sites where the hazards were visible, such as barrels of hazardous waste above ground.

The Office prepared low, medium, and high estimates, and EPA based its testimony on the medium estimate.

In EPA\u2019s medium estimate, 6.5 percent of the currently reported sites were estimated to become Superfund sites compared with 3.5 percent of the sites that will be reported in the future. The inventory of reported sites was estimated to grow by 20,500 sites by the year 2020, or 54 percent more than at present. The estimate projected that the number of sites added to the inventory each year would decline from 1,500 sites in fiscal years 1994 through 1999 to 500 sites in fiscal years 2010 through 2019.

(See app. V.) First, CBO estimated the number of sites that would be reported to EPA\u2019s inventory of potential hazardous waste sites by developing trend lines based on the number of sites reported from 1981 to 1992. Because of the data\u2019s variability, CBO developed a base case, or most probable scenario, and low- and high-case scenarios. In the base case, CBO estimated that 25,394 sites would be added to the inventory by the year 2027. This estimate was about 5,000 sites higher than EPA\u2019s medium estimate. In the low and high cases, CBO estimated that 15,151 and 50,000 sites, respectively, would be added.", "Second, to determine the percentage of reported sites that would ultimately be placed on the priorities list, CBO relied on EPA staff\u2019s opinion since, according to CBO\u2019s report, usable site evaluation data were not available. When asked by CBO, EPA staff estimated that between 5 and 10 percent of all future inventory sites would be placed on the priorities list. CBO chose 8 percent for its base-case estimate and applied this rate to current and future inventory sites. For its own medium forecast, EPA estimated that 6.5 percent of the current inventory and 3.5 percent of the sites added to the inventory in the future will be placed on the priorities list. CBO\u2019s base-case estimate, after adjustment to eliminate federal sites, resulted in adding 3,300 more sites to the priorities list.

This estimate was made as part of a study of EPA\u2019s processing of these backlogged sites. At the time of the Inspector General\u2019s review, EPA had evaluated only 942 of the 6,467 sites. To estimate the number of potential sites for the priorities list, the Inspector General determined the proportion of sites evaluated in each region that were found to warrant consideration for the priorities list. The Inspector General then applied these proportions to the total number of backlogged sites in each region and added the regional numbers. The Inspector General reduced the total to account for an estimated proportion of sites that drop out in the final decision process.", "More recent data suggest that the Inspector General\u2019s estimate may be somewhat high. According to EPA\u2019s site evaluation staff, the Inspector General\u2019s estimate of 3,136 additional sites is high since it assumed that in the future, 52 percent of the sites in the backlog could move beyond the site inspection stage, the rate prevailing when the Office of Inspector General did its study.

The 58,000-site estimate, on the other hand, is for sites that could be reported.", "The estimated 58,000 sites consisted of sites that were assessed as having a high or moderate hazard potential. The estimate was developed from estimates for 12 individual industries provided by EPA divisions familiar with them. Each industry estimate was based on an analysis of data and judgment by EPA officials. Most of the sites were in one of the following categories: Resource Conservation and Recovery Act industrial process waste facilities, municipal solid waste landfills, off-site oil and gas waste management facilities, and large-quantity hazardous waste generators.", "EPA officials familiar with seven of the major categories, accounting for 93 percent of the 58,000 sites, told us that the results are still valid.

First, the rate at which sites move through the assessment process onto the priorities list may change in the future, making projections based on past rates inaccurate. Also, proposed legislation to reauthorize Superfund, which has been considered by the Congress, contains provisions to encourage parties responsible for hazardous waste sites to clean them up outside of the regular Superfund program and to authorize states, in cooperation with EPA, to assume certain cleanup responsibilities.
