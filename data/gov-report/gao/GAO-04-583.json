Funding to operate and maintain existing government-owned housing is provided through the family housing operation and maintenance (O&M) appropriations. The amount of funding required varies based on a number of factors, including how quickly privatization occurs to reduce requirements for government-owned housing. As requested, this report discusses the (1) services' assumptions and methods used to develop budget requests and how well their budget justifications explain the impact of privatization on family housing O&M funds and (2) the extent to which Congress has visibility over the services' reprogramming of family housing O&M funds."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Budget justification materials submitted to Congress for family housing O&M funding do not clearly and consistently explain funding requirements and how the housing privatization program impacts the services' budget requests, frustrating congressional oversight. Various factors have contributed to this situation. The services use similar assumptions and methods to develop budget requests for family housing O&M, but they often rely on assumptions established up to a year and a half before the budgets are executed. While the services have the ability to revise and update their budget requests, they typically choose not to because of the difficulty of doing so related in part to other competing defense priorities and the relatively small size of the family housing O&M budget. Given these considerations, defense officials said that they are more likely to make the needed funding adjustments through reprogrammings. In addition, changes in the pace of expected privatization can affect funding required for the nine family housing O&M accounts and subaccounts--although not uniformly--but the effects of these changes are not well explained in budget justifications submissions to Congress. Although, in many cases, the services may have data that could result in better informed decision making, they do not always include such information in budget justifications. Congress has limited visibility of the services' reprogramming of family housing O&M funds. For example, Congress is not notified when reprogrammings are below 10 percent of the initial funding amount or result in a decrease. On the other hand, DOD provides congressional decision makers with more information on reprogrammings for other appropriations, such as regular O&M. In addition, compared with the other services, the Navy and the Marine Corps' reporting of reprogrammings provides even less visibility. For example, they did not report to Congress reprogrammings for the four subaccounts--management, services, furnishings, and miscellaneous--within the operations account. In addition, the Defense Finance and Accounting Service's obligation reports for the Navy and Marine Corps do not separate the four operations subaccounts, as they do for the other services. Navy and Marine Corps officials were not aware of the usefulness to separate the four operations subaccounts. Also, the Navy and the Marine Corps obligation data reflecting reprogramming actions do not always match comparable official obligation data produced by the Defense Finance and Accounting Service. Even though the two services have been working with the Defense Finance and Accounting Service, officials told GAO that this has been a long-standing issue and difficult to resolve. Collectively, this lack of visibility over the reprogramming of funds and data inconsistencies hinder the ability of congressional and DOD decision makers to evaluate family housing O&M budget requests and obligations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The military services own and operate much housing on their military  bases while at the same time they are increasingly moving to privatize  their housing.

The services\u2019 family housing O&M budget requests and resulting  congressional appropriations use a budget structure consisting of nine  accounts and subaccounts.

In its Defense Planning Guidance for fiscal  years 2004 through 2009, DOD set a deadline of fiscal year 2007 to  eliminate inadequate family housing across DOD. Recognizing this  situation, Congress gave DOD new authorities to use private sector  investment capital and housing construction expertise to finance, own,  operate, and maintain military housing known as the Military Housing  Privatization Initiative.

We recently provided your offices with  information summarizing our preliminary findings in a briefing format (see  app. I). This report summarizes and updates our findings contained in the  briefing materials in the following two areas: (1) the services\u2019 assumptions  and methods used to develop individual budget requests and how well  their budget justifications explain the impact of privatization on family  housing O&M funds and (2) the extent to which Congress has visibility  over the services\u2019 reprogramming of family housing O&M funds.", "To address these objectives, we interviewed Army, Navy, Marine Corps,  and Air Force family housing officials to obtain information on the  assumptions and methods used to develop the family housing O&M budget  requests, the impact of privatization on family housing O&M funds, and the  reprogramming of these funds. In addition, we reviewed the services\u2019  budget justification submissions to assess how well the services explained  their assumptions, methodology, and the impact of privatization. We  assessed the reliability of the services\u2019 data and found some  inconsistencies between Navy and Marine Corps data and Defense  Finance and Accounting Service data.

To operate and maintain  the government-owned infrastructure, the services use family housing  O&M funds to perform maintenance, pay utilities, provide services,  manage the family housing program, and fund various other family  housing requirements. Also, funding for military-owned and privatization  support costs is provided for in the family housing O&M portion of the  annual military construction appropriation. For fiscal year 2004, Congress  appropriated about $2.7 billion for family housing O&M in the military  construction appropriation. The services request these funds using a  budget structure comprised of nine accounts and subaccounts (see fig. 1).  In turn, Congress, in its conference report accompanying the bill, uses the  same nine accounts and subaccounts to designate its understanding of  how the funds are to be used. As shown in figure 1, DOD groups the four  subaccounts\u2014management, services, furnishings, miscellaneous\u2014under  the operations account.", "Congressional conferees expressed several concerns about the services\u2019  family housing O&M budget requests in the conference report  accompanying the 2004 military construction appropriation bill.

Furthermore, conferees reduced each of the services\u2019 fiscal year 2004  family housing O&M budget requests by $10 million due to the way the  services calculated their family housing O&M requirements. Conferees  further reduced the Navy\u2019s request by another $7.7 million due to concerns  about how the Navy accounted for its housing privatization effort in its  family housing O&M budget request for fiscal year 2004."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Family Housing O&M Budget Process", "paragraphs": ["As part of the President\u2019s budget request to Congress, the services develop  budget requests and justification submissions to fund family housing O&M  programs and activities. The process begins with the family housing  master plans, which provide a consolidated strategy for planning,  programming, and executing the family housing program and include  funding plans for maintaining government-owned housing and plans  indicating a time frame for privatization. The services\u2019 budget formulation  process translates the strategy from the family housing master plans into  their respective budget requests. In that process, assumptions about the  future requirements for family housing, including assumptions related to  housing privatization, are established and refined. The budget requests are  based largely on historical obligations adjusted for pricing and program  assumptions. The Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) provides  inputs on key pricing assumptions such as inflation, foreign currency  rates, and pay adjustments. OSD and the services determine program  assumptions including expected reductions in inventory due to housing  privatization. For example, when the services are developing the budget  request for the utilities account, they typically look at prior year costs per  unit and adjust the costs for anticipated inflation and expected changes in  housing unit inventory.", "The family housing O&M budget requests are developed through a series  of scheduled steps as part of DOD\u2019s Planning, Programming, and  Budgeting System. The planning stage begins about one year before the  budget request is sent to Congress, as the family housing O&M  requirements are defined based on the family housing master plans (see  app. I, slides 10 and 11). Around the same time, OSD issues its Defense  Planning Guidance, which may provide broad planning assumptions for  the services. For example, DOD\u2019s requirement to eliminate inadequate  housing by 2007 is derived from the Defense Planning Guidance. In the  programming phase, the services develop their Program Objectives  Memorandums, which are 6-year plans that define service requirements.  Program Objectives Memorandum budget targets, including family housing  O&M budget targets, are then matched against the services\u2019 available  resources. The programming phase concludes with decisions that are  documented in OSD\u2019s Program Decision Memorandums issued about 3 to  4 months before the President submits the budget to Congress. At the  same time, the services are developing the family housing O&M budget  request. This request is included in the budget submission the services  send to OSD for consideration. As the budgeting phase begins, changes to  the budget estimation submission are issued as Program Budget Decisions,  the last of which is generally issued 2 months before the President submits  the budget to Congress in February.", "When submitting the budget requests to Congress, the services include  justification submissions to summarize the process by which the budget  request was derived. Typically, the justification submissions for family  housing O&M accounts include a definition of what the account funds, a  description of the prior fiscal year\u2019s appropriation, and expected pricing  and program changes to that account. The estimate for the budget year is  then developed based on those changes.

Delays in housing privatization have also  caused some of the services to reprogram funds to pay for expenses  associated with housing units they had expected to privatize, according to  service officials. Also, OSD and the services consider all family housing  O&M accounts, except maintenance, as \u201cmust-pay\u201d accounts, meaning that  such programs and activities funded in these accounts must be paid even if  the obligations differ from the initial funding amount.", "According to DOD\u2019s Financial Management Regulation, the services are  required to notify Congress of any reprogramming of family housing O&M  funds that are 10 percent or more of the initial funding level.

As the services  privatize their housing, reductions in their housing inventory will occur. As  such, funding levels for the family housing O&M accounts and  subaccounts are affected differently by privatization (see app. I, slide 15).  Some accounts are more directly related to the inventory of military- owned housing and will therefore be expected to decrease generally in  proportion to the decrease in inventory due to privatization. These  accounts include costs for utilities, furnishings, and services (e.g., trash  removal, snow clearing, and fire and police protection). Other accounts,  such as leasing, are based on specific anticipated requirements  independent from the housing inventory and pace of privatization. Some  accounts, primarily the management subaccount and maintenance of real  property account, are partially influenced by privatization-related factors.  The management subaccount, for example, covers mostly salary costs for  activities such as housing referrals, waiting lists, tenant and landlord  complaints, and basic housing allowance surveys in addition to the  administrative costs directly related to managing military-owned housing.

Also, the  Army and the Navy are currently conducting studies to better determine  the impact of housing privatization on their management costs. OSD  officials said that more experience with housing privatization is needed to  properly assess its impact on funding levels for the management  subaccount.

First, the services are not required  to inform Congress of reprogrammings below 10 percent.

As shown in  table 1, in fiscal year 2003, the Army reprogrammed 4.7 percent   ($22.6 million) to the maintenance account. Although the amount  reprogrammed into the maintenance account was below 10 percent, this  amount represented 54.4 percent of the services subaccount.

We evaluated how these justifications  incorporated the services\u2019 privatization schedule and the resulting  explanation in the budget requests. In addition, we interviewed Army,  Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force family housing officials to obtain  information on the assumptions and methods used to develop the family  housing O&M budget requests. We identified statements in the services\u2019  budget justification submissions to assess how well the services explained  their assumptions, methodology, and the impact of privatization.", "To assess the extent to which Congress has visibility over the services\u2019  reprogramming of family housing O&M funds, we compared the services\u2019  initial funding levels with year-end obligations for the nine family housing  O&M accounts and subaccounts to determine the amount reprogrammed  by the services during fiscal years 2001 through 2003. To review the  reprogramming of funds between the family housing O&M accounts,  including amounts over and under established reprogramming thresholds,  we analyzed the services\u2019 and the Defense Finance and Accounting  Service\u2019s budget data for the family housing O&M account. In addition, we  compared these reprogrammings with the congressionally mandated  requirements for the services to report reprogrammings to Congress and  the execution data in the services\u2019 justification submissions to the Defense  Finance and Accounting Service\u2019s reports to ensure that the information  was consistent. For the Army and the Air Force, we found that the  obligation amounts reported matched those reported by the Defense  Finance and Accounting Service. Based on our comparisons and speaking  with Army and Air Force officials, we were satisfied with the information.  Consequently, we determined the use of Army and Air Force justification  materials and Defense Finance and Accounting Service reports was  sufficiently reliable for meeting our objectives. For the Navy and Marine  Corps, we found inconsistencies between the services\u2019 justification  submission and the Defense Finance and Accounting Service\u2019s reports.", "We discussed the results of our work with officials from the Office of the  Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller); the Housing and Competitive  Sourcing Office within the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for  Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics; the Defense Finance and  Accounting Service; and the military services. We have designated DOD\u2019s  financial management area\u2014including funding and cost data\u2014as high risk  due to long-standing deficiencies in DOD\u2019s systems, processes, and  internal controls.
