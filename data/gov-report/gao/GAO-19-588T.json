The decennial census is mandated by the Constitution and provides vital data for the nation. A complete count of the nation's population is an enormous undertaking as the Bureau seeks to control the cost of the census, implement operational innovations, and use new and modified IT systems. In recent years, GAO has identified challenges that raise serious concerns about the Bureau's ability to conduct a cost-effective count. For these reasons, GAO added the 2020 Census to its High-Risk list in February 2017.", "GAO was asked to testify about the reasons the 2020 Census remains on the High-Risk List and the steps the Bureau needs to take to mitigate risks to a successful census. To do so, GAO summarized its prior work regarding the Bureau's planning efforts for the 2020 Census. GAO also included preliminary observations from its ongoing work examining the IT systems readiness and cybersecurity for the 2020 Census. This information is related to, among other things, the Bureau's progress in developing and testing key systems and the status of cybersecurity risks."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The 2020 Decennial Census is on GAO's list of high-risk programs primarily because the Department of Commerce's Census Bureau (Bureau) (1) is using innovations that are not expected to be fully tested, (2) continues to face challenges in implementing information technology (IT) systems, and (3) faces significant cybersecurity risks to its systems and data. Although the Bureau has taken initial steps to address risk, additional actions are needed as these risks could adversely impact the cost, quality, schedule, and security of the enumeration.", "Innovations. The Bureau is planning several innovations for the 2020 Census, including allowing the public to respond using the internet. These innovations show promise for controlling costs, but they also introduce new risks, in part, because they have not been used extensively, if at all, in earlier enumerations. As a result, testing is essential to ensure that key IT systems and operations will function as planned. However, citing budgetary uncertainties, the Bureau scaled back operational tests in 2017 and 2018, missing an opportunity to fully demonstrate that the innovations and IT systems will function as intended during the 2020 Census. To manage risk to the census, the Bureau has developed hundreds of mitigation and contingency plans. To maximize readiness for the 2020 Census, it will also be important for the Bureau to prioritize among its mitigation and contingency strategies those that will deliver the most cost-effective outcomes for the census.", "Implementing IT systems. The Bureau plans to rely heavily on IT for the 2020 Census, including a total of 52 new and legacy IT systems and the infrastructure supporting them. To help improve its implementation of IT, in October 2018, the Bureau revised its systems development and testing schedule to reflect, among other things, lessons learned during its 2018 operational test. However, GAO's ongoing work has determined that the Bureau is at risk of not meeting near-term IT system development and testing schedule milestones for five upcoming 2020 Census operational deliveries, including self-response (e.g., the ability to respond to the 2020 Census through the internet). These schedule management challenges may compress the time available for the remaining system development and testing, and increase the risk that systems will not function as intended. It will be important that the Bureau effectively manages IT implementation risk to ensure that it meets near-term milestones for system development and testing, and that it is ready for the major operations of the 2020 Census.", "To its credit, the Bureau is also working with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to support its 2020 Census cybersecurity efforts. For example, DHS is helping the Bureau ensure a scalable and secure network connection for the 2020 Census respondents and to strengthen its response to potential cyber threats. During the last 2 years, as a result of these activities, the Bureau has received 42 recommendations from DHS to improve its cybersecurity posture. GAO recently recommended that the Bureau implement a formal process for tracking and executing appropriate corrective actions to remediate cybersecurity findings identified by DHS. Implementing the recommendation would help better ensure that DHS's efforts result in improvements to the Bureau's cybersecurity posture.", "In addition to addressing risks which could affect innovations and the security of the enumeration, the Bureau has the opportunity to improve its cost estimating process for the 2020 Census, and ultimately the reliability of the estimate itself, by reflecting best practices. In October 2017, the 2020 Census life-cycle cost estimate was updated and is now projected to be $15.6 billion, a more than $3 billion (27 percent) increase over its earlier estimate. GAO reported in August 2018 that although the Bureau had taken steps to improve its cost estimation process for 2020, it needed to implement a system to track and report variances between actual and estimated cost elements. According to Bureau officials, they planned to release an updated version of the 2020 Census life-cycle estimate in the spring of 2019; however, they had not done so as of June 28, 2019. To ensure that future updates to the life-cycle cost estimate reflect best practices, it will be important for the Bureau to implement GAO's recommendation related to the cost estimate.", "Over the past decade, GAO has made 106 recommendations specific to the 2020 Census to help address these risks and other concerns. The Department of Commerce has generally agreed with these recommendations and has taken action to address many of them. However, as of June 2019, 31 of the recommendations had not been fully implemented. While all 31 open recommendations are important for a high-quality and cost-effective enumeration, 9 are directed at managing the risks introduced by the Bureau's planned innovations for the 2020 Census. To ensure a high-quality and cost-effective enumeration, it will be important for the Bureau to address these recommendations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["Over the past decade, GAO has made 106 recommendations specific to the 2020 Census to help address issues raised in this and other products.

We also discussed the status of our  recommendations with Commerce and Bureau staff. Other details on the  scope and methodology for our prior work are provided in each published  report on which this testimony is based.", "In addition, we included information in this statement from our ongoing  work on the readiness of the Bureau\u2019s IT systems for the 2020 Census.  Specifically, we collected and reviewed documentation on the status and  plans for system development and testing, and for addressing  cybersecurity risk, for the 2020 Census. This includes the Bureau\u2019s  integration and implementation plan, memorandums documenting  outcomes of security assessments, and reports prepared by the  Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for the Bureau on cybersecurity  risks. We also interviewed relevant agency officials.", "We provided a copy of the applicable new information that we are  reporting in this testimony to the Bureau and DHS for comment on June  25, 2019.

The 2010 Census was the most expensive  in U.S. history at about $12.3 billion, and was about 31 percent more  costly than the $9.4 billion 2000 Census (in 2020 dollars). According to  the Bureau, the total cost of the 2020 Census in October 2015 was  estimated at $12.3 billion and in October 2017 that cost estimate grew to  approximately $15.6 billion, approximately a $3 billion increase.", "Additionally, Bureau officials told us that while the estimated cost of the  census had increased to $15.6 billion, it was nevertheless managing the  2020 Census to a lower cost of $14.1 billion. Bureau officials explained  that the $14.1 billion includes all program costs and contingency funds to  cover risks and general estimating uncertainty. The remaining $1.5 billion  estimated cost is additional contingency for \u201cunknown unknowns\u201d\u2014that  is, low probability events that could cause massive disruptions\u2014and  several what-if scenarios such as an increase in the wage rate or  additional supervisors needed to manage field operations.", "Moreover, as shown in figure 1, the average cost for counting a housing  unit increased from about $16 in 1970 to around $92 in 2010 (in 2020  constant dollars). At the same time, the return of census questionnaires  by mail (the primary mode of data collection) declined over this period  from 78 percent in 1970 to 63 percent in 2010. Declining mail response  rates have led to higher costs because the Bureau sends temporary  workers to each non-responding household to obtain census data.", "Achieving a complete and accurate census has become an increasingly  daunting task, in part, because the population is growing larger, more  diverse, and more reluctant to participate in the enumeration. In many  ways, the Bureau has had to invest substantially more resources each  decade to conduct the enumeration.", "In addition to these external societal challenges that make achieving a  complete count a daunting task, the Bureau also faces a number of  internal management challenges that affect its capacity and readiness to  conduct a cost-effective enumeration. Some of these issues\u2014such as  acquiring and developing IT systems and preparing reliable cost  estimates\u2014are long-standing in nature.", "At the same time, as the Bureau looks toward 2020, it has faced  emerging and evolving uncertainties. For example, on March 26, 2018,  the Secretary of Commerce announced his decision to add a question to  the decennial census on citizenship status which resulted in various  legislative actions and legal challenges. Ultimately, the case was heard  by the U.S. Supreme Court, which, in a June 26, 2019, ruling, prevented  the addition of the question because the Court found that the evidence  Commerce provided in the case did not match the Secretary\u2019s  explanation. In addition, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals remanded  other legal challenges to the district court on June 24, 2019, for further  legal action, which is yet to be resolved.", "According to Bureau officials, on June 28, 2019, Commerce asked the  Bureau to put its scheduled July 1 start date for printing questionnaires on  hold while it considered legal implications of the Supreme Court ruling.  On July 2, 2019, Commerce told the Bureau to proceed with printing  questionnaires and other materials without the citizenship question on  them. As of July 5, 2019, the Department of Justice (DOJ) indicated that,  although printing was continuing without the citizenship question, DOJ  was evaluating legal options to include the question.", "On July 11, 2019, the President announced that instead of collecting this  information from the census questionnaire, he ordered all federal  agencies to provide data on citizenship status to Commerce using legally  available federal records. We have not analyzed this decision or its  implications, if any, for how the Bureau will tabulate its official counts. We  will continue to monitor developments for Congress.", "The Bureau also faced budgetary uncertainties that, according to the  Bureau, led to the curtailment of testing in 2017 and 2018. However, the  Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 appropriated for the Periodic  Censuses and Programs account $2.544 billion, which more than doubled  the Bureau\u2019s request in the President\u2019s Fiscal Year 2018 Budget of  $1.251 billion. According to the explanatory statement accompanying  the act, the appropriation, which is available through fiscal year 2020, was  provided to ensure the Bureau has the necessary resources to  immediately address any issues discovered during operational testing,  and to provide a smoother transition between fiscal year 2018 and fiscal  year 2019.", "The availability of those resources enabled the Bureau to continue  preparations for the 2020 Census during the 35 days in December 2018  to January 2019 when appropriations lapsed for the Bureau and a  number of other federal agencies. Moreover, the Consolidated  Appropriations Act, 2019 appropriated for the Periodic Censuses and  Programs account $3.551 billion. According to Bureau officials, this level  of funding for fiscal year 2019 is sufficient to carry out 2020 Census  activities as planned.", "Importantly, the census is conducted against a backdrop of immutable  deadlines. In order to meet the statutory deadline for completing the  enumeration, census activities need to take place at specific times and in  the proper sequence. Thus, it is absolutely critical for the Bureau to stay  on schedule. Figure 2 shows some dates for selected decennial events."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Bureau Has Begun Opening Offices and Hiring Temporary Staff", "paragraphs": ["The Bureau has begun to open its area census offices (ACO) for the 2020  Census. It has signed leases for all 248 ACOs, of which 39 of the offices  will be open for the address canvassing operation set to begin in August  2019 where staff verifies the location of selected housing units. The  remaining 209 offices will begin opening this fall. In 2010 the Bureau  opened 494 census offices. The Bureau has been able to reduce its  infrastructure because it is relying on automation to assign work and to  record payroll. Therefore there is less paper\u2014field assignments, maps,  and daily payroll forms\u2014to manually process.", "For the 2020 Census, the Bureau is refining its recruiting and hiring goals,  but tentatively plans to recruit approximately 2.24 million applicants and to  hire over 400,000 temporary field staff from that applicant pool for two key  operations: address canvassing, and nonresponse follow-up, where they  visit households that do not return census forms to collect data in person.  In 2010 the Bureau recruited 3.8 million applicants and hired 628,000  temporary workers to conduct the address canvassing and nonresponse  follow-up field operations. According to Bureau officials, it has reduced  the number of temporary staff it needs to hire because automation has  made field operations more efficient and there is less paper. As of June  2019, the Bureau reported that for all 2020 Census operations it had  processed about 430,000 applicants.", "In addition, the Bureau was seeking to hire approximately 1,500  partnership specialists by the end of June 2019 to help increase census  awareness and participation in minority communities and hard-to-reach  populations. As of July 9, 2019, the Bureau\u2019s latest biweekly reporting  indicated that it had hired 813 partnership specialists as of June 22, 2019.   Moreover, as of July 10, 2019, Bureau officials told us that another 830  applicants were waiting to have their background checks completed.  According to Bureau officials, hiring data are based on payroll dates  generated biweekly, while background check data are tracked internally.  Therefore, according to Bureau officials, more current hiring data were  not available as of July 10, 2019 to indicate whether the Bureau had met  its June 30 hiring goal.", "Among other things, partnership specialists are expected to either provide  or identify partners to help provide supplemental language support to  respondents locally in over 100 different languages. We will continue to  monitor the Bureau\u2019s progress in meeting its partnership specialist  staffing goals and addressing any turnover that takes place. Hiring  partnership specialists in a timely manner and maintaining adequate  partnership specialist staffing levels are key to the Bureau\u2019s ability to  carry out its planned outreach efforts, especially to hard-to-count  communities.", "Moreover, Bureau officials also stated that the current economic  environment (i.e., the low unemployment rate compared to the economic  environment of the 2010 Census) has not yet impacted their ability to  recruit staff. The Bureau will continue to monitor the impact of low  unemployment on its ability to recruit and hire at the local and regional  levels."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Bureau Plans to Rely Heavily on IT for the 2020 Census", "paragraphs": ["For the 2020 Census, the Bureau is substantially changing how it intends  to conduct the census, in part by re-engineering key census-taking  methods and infrastructure, and making use of new IT applications and  systems. For example, the Bureau plans to offer an option for households  to respond to the survey via the internet and enable field-based  enumerators to use applications on mobile devices to collect survey  data from households. To do this, the Bureau plans to utilize 52 new and  legacy IT systems, and the infrastructure supporting them, to conduct the  2020 Census.", "A majority of these 52 systems have been tested during operational tests  in 2017 and 2018. For example, the Bureau conducted its 2018 End-to- End test, which included 44 of the 52 systems and was intended to test all  key systems and operations in a census-like environment to ensure  readiness for the 2020 Census.", "Nevertheless, additional IT development and testing work needs to take  place before the 2020 Census. Specifically, officials from the Bureau\u2019s  Decennial Directorate said they expect that the systems will need to  undergo further development and testing due to, among other things, the  need to add functionality that was not part of the End-to-End test, scale  system performance to support the number of respondents expected  during the 2020 Census, and address system defects identified during the  2018 End-to-End test.", "To prepare the systems and technology for the 2020 Census, the Bureau  is also relying on substantial contractor support. For example, it is relying on contractors to develop a number of systems and components of the IT  infrastructure, including the IT platform that is intended to be used to  collect data from households responding via the internet and telephone,  and for non-response follow-up activities. Contractors are also deploying  the IT and telecommunications hardware in the field offices and providing  device-as-a-service capabilities by procuring the mobile devices and  cellular service to be used for non-response follow-up.", "In addition to the development of technology, the Bureau is relying on a  technical integration contractor to integrate all of the key systems and  infrastructure. The contractor\u2019s work is expected to include, among other  things, evaluating the systems and infrastructure and acquiring the  infrastructure (e.g., cloud or data center) to meet the Bureau\u2019s scalability  and performance needs; integrating all of the systems; and assisting with  technical, performance and scalability, and operational testing activities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "2020 Census Identified by GAO as a High-Risk Area", "paragraphs": ["In February 2017, we added the 2020 Decennial Census as a high-risk  area needing attention from Congress and the executive branch.

Specifically, its plan for 2020  includes four broad innovation areas: re-engineering field operations,  using administrative records, verifying addresses in-office, and  developing an internet self-response option (see table 2).", "If they function as planned, the Bureau initially estimated that these  innovations could result in savings of over $5 billion (in 2020 constant  dollars) when compared to its estimates of the cost for conducting the  census with traditional methods. However, in June 2016, we reported that  the Bureau\u2019s initial life-cycle cost estimate developed in October 2015  was not reliable and did not adequately account for risk.", "As discussed earlier in this statement, the Bureau has updated its  estimate from $12.3 billion and now estimates a life-cycle cost of $15.6  billion, which would result in a smaller potential savings from the  innovative design than the Bureau originally estimated. According to the  Bureau, the goal of the cost estimate increase was to ensure quality was  fully addressed.", "While the planned innovations could help control costs, they also  introduce new risks, in part, because they include new procedures and  technology that have not been used extensively in earlier decennials, if at  all. Our prior work has shown the importance of the Bureau conducting a  robust testing program, including the 2018 End-to-End test. Rigorous  testing is a critical risk mitigation strategy because it provides information  on the feasibility and performance of individual census-taking activities,  their potential for achieving desired results, and the extent to which they  are able to function together under full operational conditions.", "To address some of these challenges we have made numerous  recommendations aimed at improving reengineered field operations,  using administrative records, verifying the accuracy of the address list,  and securing census responses via the internet.", "The Bureau has held a series of operational tests since 2012, but  according to the Bureau, it scaled back its most recent field tests because  of funding uncertainties. For example, the Bureau canceled the field  components of the 2017 Census Test including non-response follow-up, a  key census operation. In November 2016, we reported that the  cancelation of the 2017 Census Test was a lost opportunity to test, refine,  and integrate operations and systems, and that it put more pressure on  the 2018 End-to-End test to demonstrate that enumeration activities will  function under census-like conditions as needed for 2020.", "However, in May 2017, the Bureau scaled back the operational scope of  the 2018 End-to-End test and, of the three planned test sites, only the  Rhode Island site would fully implement the 2018 End-to-End test. The  Washington and West Virginia sites would test just one field operation. In  addition, due to budgetary concerns, the Bureau delayed ramp up and  preparations for its coverage measurement operation (and the technology  that supports it) from the scope of the test. However, removal of the  coverage measurement operation did not affect testing of the delivery of  apportionment or redistricting data.", "Without sufficient testing, operational problems can go undiscovered and  the opportunity to improve operations will be lost, in part because the  2018 End-to-End test was the last opportunity to demonstrate census  technology and procedures across a range of geographic locations,  housing types, and demographic groups under decennial-like conditions  prior to the 2020 Census.", "We reported on the 2018 End-to-End test in December 2018 and noted  that the Bureau had made progress addressing prior test implementation  issues but still faced challenges. As the Bureau studies the results of its  testing to inform the 2020 Census, it will be important that it addresses  key program management issues that arose during implementation of the  test. Namely, by not aligning the skills, responsibilities, and information  flows for the first-line supervisors during field data collection, the Bureau  limited its role in support of enumerators within the re-engineered field  operation.", "The Bureau also lacked mid-operation training or guidance, which, if  implemented in a targeted, localized manner, could have further helped  enumerators navigate procedural modifications and any commonly  encountered problems when enumerating.

The recommendations included implementing  reliable cost estimation and scheduling practices in order to establish  better control over program costs, as well as taking steps to better  position the Bureau to develop an internet response option for the 2020  Census.", "In addition to our recommendations, to better position the Bureau for a  more cost-effective enumeration, on March 18, 2019, we met with OMB,  Commerce, and Bureau officials to discuss the Bureau\u2019s progress in  reducing the risks facing the census. We also meet regularly with Bureau  officials and managers to discuss the progress and status of open  recommendations related to the 2020 Census, which has resulted in  Bureau actions in recent months leading to closure of some  recommendations.", "We are encouraged by this commitment by Commerce and the Bureau in  addressing our recommendations. Implementing our recommendations in  a complete and timely manner is important because it could improve the  management of the 2020 Census and help to mitigate continued risks.", "In conclusion, while the Bureau has made progress in revamping its  approach to the census, it faces considerable challenges and  uncertainties in implementing key cost-saving innovations and ensuring  they function under operational conditions; managing the development  and testing of its IT systems; ensuring the cybersecurity of its systems  and data; and developing a quality cost estimate for the 2020 Census and  preventing further cost increases. For these reasons, the 2020 Census is  a GAO high-risk area.", "Going forward, continued management attention and oversight will be  vital for ensuring that risks are managed, preparations stay on track, and  the Bureau is held accountable for implementing the enumeration, as  planned. Without timely and appropriate actions, the challenges  previously discussed could adversely affect the cost, accuracy, schedule,  and security of the enumeration. We will continue to assess the Bureau\u2019s  efforts and look forward to keeping Congress informed of the Bureau\u2019s  progress.", "Chairman Johnson, Ranking Member Peters, and Members of the  Committee, this completes our prepared statement.
