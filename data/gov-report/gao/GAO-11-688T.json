The Transportation Security Administration (TSA), within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), is the primary federal agency responsible for rail security. This testimony addresses the following: (1) the extent that DHS has conducted comprehensive risk assessments for the transportation sector, including for rail, (2) technologies available to enhance rail security, (3) TSA's efforts regarding rail security training, and (4) rail stakeholders' satisfaction with security-related information TSA is providing. GAO's testimony is based on GAO reports issued from March 2009 through September 2010, selected updates conducted in May through June 2011, and preliminary results from ongoing work on information sharing. As part of the ongoing work, GAO surveyed the seven largest freight rail carriers (based on revenue) and interviewed security officials from three of these rail carriers selected for location, as well as TSA officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["TSA has taken steps to conduct comprehensive risk assessments across the transportation sector and within passenger and freight rail modes that combine the three elements of risk--threat, vulnerability, and consequence. For example, in March 2009, GAO reported that TSA had taken actions to implement a risk management approach but had not conducted comprehensive risk assessments for the transportation sector as a whole, and recommended that TSA do so to help ensure that resources are allocated to the highest-priority risks. DHS concurred and in June 2010 produced the Transportation Sector Security Risk Assessment, which assessed risk as a factor of all three risk elements within and across the transportation sector, including rail. GAO has also made recommendations to strengthen risk assessments within individual modes, such as expanding TSA's efforts to include all security threats in its freight rail assessments, including potential sabotage to bridges, tunnels, and other critical infrastructure. DHS concurred and is addressing the recommendations. Several technologies are available to address rail security, such as security cameras, handheld explosive trace detection systems, x-raying imaging systems, and canines. However, technologies are at varying levels of maturity and involve trade-offs in mobility, cost, and privacy. In July 2010, for example, we reported that the ability of explosives detection technologies to help protect the passenger rail environment depends on detection performance and how effectively they can be deployed. TSA has not issued regulations for public transportation and railroad security training programs, as required by the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007. In June 2009, GAO reported that TSA had not implemented the training requirement and recommended that DHS develop a plan with milestones for doing so, as called for by project management best practices. DHS concurred, and in June 2011 TSA stated that it had developed a timeline for uncompleted 9/11 Commission Act requirements. TSA also stated that it is finalizing the security training program regulations and expects to issue a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for public comment by November 2011. Opportunities exist to streamline security information for transit agencies, and preliminary results of ongoing work indicate that some freight rail agencies do not receive actionable information from TSA. In September 2010, GAO recommended that DHS assess opportunities to streamline information-sharing mechanisms to reduce overlap. DHS concurred, and in response it and the rail industry have developed a streamlined product. However, preliminary observations from GAO's ongoing work indicate that some rail stakeholders would prefer to receive actionable security information and analysis from TSA that could allow them to adjust to potential terrorist threats. TSA officials agreed that improvements are needed in the products and mechanisms by which they alert rail agencies of security-related information. GAO will continue to monitor this issue and expects to issue a report by the end of 2011."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO has made recommendations in prior work to enhance DHS's and TSA's rail security efforts.

Rail systems in the  United States have received heightened attention as several alleged  terrorists\u2019 plots have been uncovered, including plots against transit  systems in the New York City and Washington, D.C., areas. Intelligence  recovered from Osama bin Laden\u2019s compound indicates that U.S. rail  systems were a suggested target as recently as February 2010, although  there has been no indication of a specific or imminent threat to carry out  such an attack. Terrorist attacks on rail systems around the world\u2014such  as the March 2010 Moscow, Russia, subway bombings, and the May 2010  passenger train derailment near Mumbai, India, that resulted in  approximately 150 fatalities\u2014highlight the vulnerability of these systems  to terrorist attacks. Further, the Mineta Transportation Institute has  reported that terrorists attempted to derail trains on at least 144 occasions  between 1995 and 2010, many of which were in South Asia and mostly  through the use of track bombs.", "One of the critical challenges facing rail system operators\u2014and the federal  agencies that regulate and oversee them\u2014is finding ways to protect rail  systems from potential terrorist attacks without compromising the  accessibility and efficiency of rail travel. The systems are vulnerable to  attack in part because they rely on an open architecture that is difficult to  monitor and secure due to its multiple access points, hubs serving multiple  carriers, and, in some cases, no barriers to access. Further, rail systems\u2019  high ridership, expensive infrastructure, economic importance, and  location in large metropolitan areas or tourist destinations make them  attractive targets for terrorists. In addition, the multiple access points  along extended routes make the costs of securing each location potentially  prohibitive.", "My testimony today focuses on the following issues: (1) To what extent  has the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) conducted  comprehensive risk assessments to inform its security efforts across all  modes of transportation, including rail? (2) What technologies are  available to assist rail operators in securing their systems? (3) What is the  status of Transportation Security Administration\u2019s (TSA) efforts regarding  security training for frontline rail employees? (4) How satisfied are rail  stakeholders with the quality of security-related information TSA is  providing?", "This statement is based on related GAO reports issued from March 2009  through September 2010, including selected updates conducted from May  2011 through June 2011 on TSA\u2019s efforts to implement our prior  recommendations regarding surface transportation security. In  conducting these updates, we obtained information from TSA regarding  the agency\u2019s efforts to develop regulations for security training programs  for rail employees and to enhance its overall risk management approach to  rail security, among other things. Our previous reports incorporated  information we obtained and analyzed from officials from various  components of DHS, the Department of Transportation (DOT), state and  local transportation and law enforcement agencies, and industry  associations, as well as a survey of 96 U.S. public transit agencies (that  represented about 91 percent of total 2008 ridership). Our previously  published products contain additional details on the scope and  methodology, including data reliability, for those reviews. In addition, this  statement includes preliminary observations based on ongoing work, the  results of which will be issued in a report later this year, assessing the  extent to which freight rail carriers that receive security-related  information are satisfied with the products and mechanisms that TSA uses  to disseminate this information, among other things. As part of this  ongoing work, we surveyed all seven Class I freight rail carriers. We also  interviewed security officials from three Class I freight rail carriers  selected on the basis of their location. While the results of our interviews  are not generalizable to all Class I rail carriers, the responses provide  perspectives and examples to expand on survey findings. All of our work  was conducted in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards. These standards require that we plan and perform the  audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable  basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We  believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our  findings based on our audit objectives. For new information that was  based on work not previously reported, we obtained TSA views on our  findings and incorporated technical comments where appropriate."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["TSA is the primary federal agency responsible for overseeing the security  of the mass transit, passenger rail, and freight rail systems. However,  several other agencies, including DOT\u2019s Federal Transit Administration  (FTA) and Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), also play a role in  helping to oversee these systems. Since it is not practical or feasible to  protect all assets and systems against every possible terrorist threat, DHS  has called for using risk-informed approaches to prioritize its security- related investments and for developing plans and allocating resources in a  way that balances security and commerce.", "In June 2006, DHS issued the National Infrastructure Protection Plan  (NIPP), which established a six-step risk management framework to  establish national priorities, goals, and requirements for Critical  Infrastructure and Key Resources protection so that federal funding and  resources are applied in the most cost-effective manner to deter threats,  reduce vulnerabilities, and minimize the consequences of attacks and  other incidents. The NIPP, updated in 2009, defines risk as a function of  three elements:  threat\u2014an indication of the likelihood that a specific type of attack will be  initiated against a specific target or class of targets;    vulnerability\u2014the probability that a particular attempted attack will  succeed against a particular target or class of targets; and    consequence\u2014the effect of a successful attack.", "In August 2007, the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11  Commission Act (9/11 Commission Act) was signed into law, which  included provisions that task DHS with actions related to surface  transportation security. Among other things, these provisions include  mandates for developing and issuing regulations for transportation  security training programs and ensuring that transportation modal security  plans include threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences for transportation  infrastructure assets including rail."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "TSA Has Made Progress in Conducting Comprehensive Risk Assessments across All Modes of Transportation, Including Rail", "paragraphs": ["In response to our previous recommendations, TSA has taken steps to  conduct comprehensive risk assessments across the transportation sector  and within the passenger and freight rail modes that are based on  assessments of threat, vulnerability, and consequence. In March 2009, we  reported that TSA had taken some actions to implement a risk  management approach but had not conducted comprehensive risk  assessments that integrate threat, vulnerability, and consequence for each  mode or the transportation sector as a whole, as called for by the NIPP.  We recommended that TSA conduct risk assessments that combine these  three elements to help the agency produce a comparative analysis of risk  across the entire transportation sector, which the agency could use to  inform current and future investment decisions.", "DHS concurred with this recommendation, and in June 2010 TSA  produced the Transportation Sector Security Risk Assessment (TSSRA),  which assessed risk within and across the various aviation and surface  transportation modes, including rail, and incorporated threat,  vulnerability, and consequence. A September 2009 letter from the  Director of DHS\u2019s Office of Risk Management and Analysis noted that in  developing the TSSRA, TSA was making progress toward developing a  strategic and comprehensive risk management approach that would bett align with DHS\u2019s risk management framework and address our  er  recommendations. However, TSA noted limitations in the June 2010  TSSRA report that could limit its usefulness in guiding investment  decisions across the transportation sector as a whole. For example, the  TSSRA excluded the maritime sector and certain types of threats, such as  from \u201clone wolf\u201d operators. In June 2011, agency officials stated that TSA  is working to address these limitations in the next version, which is  scheduled for completion by the end of calendar year 2011. TSA also said  that it is strengthening and enhancing the TSSRA methodology based on  an ongoing independent verification and validation that is scheduled for  completion later this year. In addition, TSA officials noted that other DHS  components, such as the U.S. Coast Guard, conduct risk assessments of  the maritime sector that complement the TSSRA.", "With regard to assessments of mass transit and passenger rail  transportation, we reported in June 2009 that although TSA had  contributed to DHS\u2019s risk assessment effort, it had not conducted its own  risk assessment of mass transit and passenger rail systems. We  recommended that TSA conduct a risk assessment that integrates all three  elements of risk. DHS officials concurred with the recommendation, and  in March 2010 said that they had developed a mass transit risk assessment  tool to assess risk to mass transit and passenger rail systems using threat,  vulnerability, and consequence, in addition to the TSSRA. According to  TSA, they have completed pilot tests of this tool on three transit systems  as of June 2011 and anticipate assessing six additional transit systems by  the end of the calendar year.", "Similarly, in April 2009, we reported that TSA\u2019s efforts to address freight  rail security were limited and did not focus on a range of threats identified  by federal and industry assessments. TSA\u2019s security efforts focused  almost entirely on transportation of Toxic Inhalation Hazards (TIH);  however, other federal and industry assessments had identified additional  potential security threats, such as risks to bridges and tunnels. We  reported that although TSA\u2019s focus on TIH had been a reasonable initial  approach, there are other security threats for TSA to consider and  evaluate, including potential sabotage to critical infrastructure. We  recommended that TSA expand its efforts to include all security threats in  its freight rail security strategy. TSA concurred and reported that it had  developed a Critical Infrastructure Risk Tool to measure the criticality and  vulnerability of freight railroad bridges. As of June 2011, the agency has  used this tool to assess 77 bridges, some of which transverse either the  Mississippi or Missouri Rivers, and 26 freight rail tunnels.", "Our prior work has also assessed TSA\u2019s efforts to incorporate risk  management principles into the grant allocation process, and we reported  that transit grant funding decisions could be improved with better  assessments of vulnerability. For example, we reported in June 2009 that  the Transit Security Grant Program (TSGP) risk model included all three  elements of risk, but could be strengthened by measuring variations in  vulnerability. DHS held vulnerability constant in its assessments, which  limits the model\u2019s overall ability to assess risk. We recommended that DHS  strengthen its methodology for determining risk by developing a cost- effective method for incorporating vulnerability information in its TSGP  risk model. DHS concurred with the recommendation, and in April 2010  TSA stated that it is reevaluating the risk model for the fiscal year 2011  grant cycle. In June 2011, TSA stated that it is considering asset-specific  vulnerability when looking at risk, although TSA noted that the Federal  Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has ownership of the TSGP risk  model. TSA provides input into the model, however. We are currently  assessing DHS and FEMA efforts to improve the TSGP grant-allocation  process as part of our current review of DHS grant programs being  conducted for your committee and expect to issue a report on the results  of this effort later this year."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Technologies Are Available to Strengthen Rail Security, but Challenges in the Rail Environment and Low Maturity of Some Technologies May Limit Implementation", "paragraphs": ["Industry stakeholders have examined and implemented various  technologies to enhance the security of the rail system. For example, in  April 2009, we reported that several freight rail carriers we met with  installed security cameras and monitoring equipment at some of their key  facilities to better monitor the activities in and around these areas. We  also reported that officials from three railroads and two chemical  companies we met with stated that they had taken steps to attempt to  better track the movements of their TIH rail shipments by installing Global  Positioning System technology on their locomotives and tank cars.  Similarly, in June 2009, we reported that many mass transit and passenger  rail agencies reported making capital improvements to secure their  systems.  For example, 19 of the 30 transit agencies we interviewed had  embarked on programs since 2004 to upgrade their existing security  technology, including upgrading closed circuit television at key station  locations with video surveillance systems that alert personnel to  suspicious activities and abandoned packages and installing chemical,  biological, radiological, nuclear, and explosives detection equipment and  laser intrusion detection systems in critical areas.", "While industry has taken these steps to implement technology to enhance  rail security, the nature of the rail system has presented challenges to  further implementation. For example, we reported in July 2010 that in  commuter or light rail systems, many stations may be unmanned outdoor  platforms without barriers between public areas and trains. Stations may  also have few natural locations to place technologies to be able to screen  passengers. With limited existing chokepoints, implementation of certain  technologies may require station infrastructure modifications to aid in  funneling passengers for screening. Similarly, challenges to using  technology to secure the freight rail system include the size and open  nature of the system, the need for railcars to be able to continuously move,  and limited resources.", "We have also reported that several technologies are available to help  address rail security challenges, but they are at varying levels of maturity  and using them involves trade-offs in mobility, cost, and privacy. For  example, in July 2010, we reported that the ability of explosives detection  technologies to help protect the passenger rail environment depends both  upon their detection performance and how effectively the technologies  can be deployed in that environment. Detection performance of these  technologies varies across the different technologies and additional  limitations\u2014such as limited screening throughput, privacy, openness,  physical infrastructure, cost, and mobility concerns\u2014have restricted their  more widespread or more effective use in passenger rail. More-established  explosives detection technologies\u2014such as handheld explosive trace  detection systems, x-raying imaging systems, and canines\u2014have  demonstrated good performance against many conventional explosives  threats but are challenged by threats from certain explosives. Newer  technologies\u2014such as Explosive Trace Portals (ETP), standoff detection  systems, and Advanced Imaging Technologies (AIT)\u2014while available, are  in various stages of maturity and more operational experience would be  required to determine whether they can be effectively implemented in a  rail environment. For example, AIT technologies have the ability to  detect hidden objects; however, they are walk-through devices that would  require rail passengers to be funneled through the equipment, limiting  passenger throughput with long screening times. Standoff technology can  be used to detect hidden objects on an individual from a significant  distance and is attractive because it may have less effect on passenger  throughput than other new technologies. However, certain types of  standoff systems, as well as AIT technologies raise privacy concerns  because they create images of individuals underneath their clothing.", "In our July 2010 report, we did not make any recommendations regarding  the explosives detection technologies available or in development that  could help secure passenger rail systems, but we raised various policy  considerations. Among other things, we noted that securing passenger rail  involves multiple security measures, with explosives detection  technologies just one of several components that policymakers can  consider as part of the overall security environment. In determining  whether and how to implement these technologies, federal agencies and  rail operators will likely be confronted with challenges related to the costs  versus the benefits of a given technology and the potential privacy and  legal implications of using explosives detection technologies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "TSA Has Not Issued Rail Security Training Regulations but Has Provided Funding and Guidance for Training", "paragraphs": ["In 2007 TSA officials identified the need for increased security training at  mass transit and passenger rail systems because the extent of training  provided varied greatly\u2014with a majority providing an introductory level of  safety and security training for new hires, but not refresher training. In  addition, TSA identified security awareness training and a lack of a robust,  standardized corporate security planning for freight railroads as  systematic security gaps. The 9/11 Commission Act mandates TSA to  develop and issue regulations for a public transportation security training  program and for a railroad security training program. In June 2009, we  reported that TSA had not implemented this requirement or several others  related to mass transit and passenger rail security, and recommended that  DHS develop a plan with milestones for doing so. DHS concurred with  this recommendation, and in June 2011, TSA stated that it had developed a  plan and milestones for addressing uncompleted 9/11 Commission Act  requirements. TSA also stated that it is finalizing the security training  program regulations and expects to issue a Notice of Proposed  Rulemaking for public comment by November 2011. A TSA official  indicated that the delay was due, in part, to difficulties incurred in trying  to address multiple modes of transportation in one regulation.", "To address identified training deficiencies, TSA supports security training  through its TSGP and voluntary security awareness programs. TSA  established a Mass Transit Security Training program in 2007 to provide  curriculum guidelines for basic and follow-on security training areas and  makes funding available through TSGP. For example, TSA offers mass  transit and passenger rail agencies the option of using grant funding to  cover costs for training to employees that is supplied by either (1) training  providers that are federally funded or sponsored or (2) other training  providers. However, in June 2009 we reported that opportunities exist for  TSA to strengthen its process for ensuring consistency in the performance  of nonfederal training vendors that mass transit and passenger rail  agencies use to obtain training through the program. We recommended  that to better ensure that DHS consistently funds sound and valid security  training delivery programs for mass transit and passenger rail employees,  TSA should consider enhancing its criteria for evaluating whether security  training vendors meet the performance standards of federally sponsored  training providers and whether the nonfederally sponsored providers  could be used by transit agencies for training under the transit security  grant program. DHS concurred with the recommendation, noting that TSA  would work with the FTA through an existing joint working group to  develop criteria for reviewing new vendor-provided training courses. In  February 2010, TSA stated that it had proposed a joint task group with the  FTA to define evaluation criteria for courses submitted by mass transit or  passenger rail agencies, academic institutions, or other entities. In June  2011, TSA stated that the joint task group\u2014which is being led by TSA and  will include members from the FTA and industry\u2014is in the process of  organizing its first meeting. According to TSA, the group will use the  criteria it develops to evaluate vendor training courses by the fall of 2011.", "DHS, DOT, and others have also taken steps to enhance rail and transit  security awareness in partnership with the public and private entities that  own and operate the nation\u2019s transit and rail systems through voluntary  security awareness programs. For example, the Transit Watch Program,  co-led by TSA and the FTA, provides a nationwide safety and security  awareness program designed to encourage the active participation of  transit passengers and employees. By means of this program, the federal  government, in collaboration with industry, created templates for transit  agencies to develop or enhance their own public awareness programs. In  July 2010, DHS launched the \u201cIf You See Something, Say Something,\u201d  campaign as a way to raise public and frontline employee awareness of  indicators of terrorism, crime, and other threats and emphasize the  importance of reporting suspicious activity to the proper transportation  and law enforcement authorities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Opportunities Exist to Streamline Security Information for Transit Agencies, and Preliminary Results Indicate Some Freight Rail Agencies Do Not Receive Actionable Information and Analysis from TSA", "paragraphs": ["While TSA is taking steps to improve information sharing with freight and  passenger rail stakeholders, potential overlap could complicate  stakeholder efforts to discern relevant information and take appropriate  actions to enhance security. In September 2010, we identified the potential  for overlap among three federal information-sharing mechanisms: the  public transit portal on the Homeland Security Information Network  (HSIN-PT), TSA Office of Intelligence\u2019s page on HSIN, and the Public  Transit Information Sharing and Analysis Center (PT-ISAC). Each of  these receives funding from DHS to share security threats and other types  of security-related information with public transit agencies. We  recommended that DHS establish time frames for a working group of  federal and industry officials to assess opportunities to streamline  information-sharing mechanisms to reduce any unneeded overlap. DHS  concurred with this recommendation.", "In response to our recommendation, DHS and the rail industry have taken  steps to streamline the information distributed to stakeholders. TSA and  key industry groups have developed the Transit and Rail Intelligence  Awareness Daily (TRIAD) Report and associated Transportation  Information Library. The overall intent of TRIAD is to streamline the  analysis, sharing, and exchange of intelligence and security information  that had been disseminated by multiple sources. TRIAD includes a daily  publication to enhance situational awareness, an alert message to provide  immediate awareness of a developing threat or incident, and a catalogue  of supporting reports and related documents. According to TSA and its  industry partners, HSIN-PT will supplement TRIAD by serving as a  reference source to house cross-sector best practices, additional  intelligence, and threat information as well as transit security standards  and all-hazards information. The TSA Office of Intelligence stated that it  will continue to have a portal on HSIN that supplements the information  on the PT-ISAC and HSIN-PT. While the TRIAD report may reduce the  number of security-related e-mails that transit agencies receive, it does not  reduce overlap among the three information-sharing mechanisms. In June  2011, TSA officials stated that they are continuing to coordinate with other  members of the working group to identify actions and time frames for  addressing our recommendation.", "Our recent work indicates that some rail stakeholders do not receive  security information from TSA. In September 2010, we reported that less  than half of public transit agencies (34 of 77) responding to our 2010  survey reported that they had log-in access to HSIN, TSA\u2019s primary  mechanism for sharing open-source security-related information with  transportation stakeholders, and had not lost or forgotten their log-in  information. Our survey also identified that, of the 19 transit agencies  that did not have HSIN access, 12 had never heard of the mechanism, and  an additional 11 agencies did not know whether they had access to HSIN.  We recommended that TSA establish time frames for the transit-sector  public-private working group to conduct targeted outreach efforts to  increase awareness of HSIN among agencies that are not currently using  or aware of this system. DHS officials concurred with this  recommendation and in January 2011 provided an implementation plan  with target dates for addressing it. However, the plan was insufficiently  detailed for us to determine whether it fully addresses the  recommendation. For example, the plan stated that TSA officials created a  consolidated \u201csuperlist\u201d of current PT-ISAC and HSIN-PT members and  transit agencies on a TSA distribution list and intend to encourage all  entities on this superlist to join the PT-ISAC and HSIN-PT. However, the  plan did not indicate how TSA would target its outreach efforts to those  entities not already on one of those lists. In June 2011, a TSA official stated  that the public-private working group plans to reach out to other transit  entities, such as small agencies, to encourage them to join the PT-ISAC  and HSIN-PT. As noted above, TSA officials stated that they are continuing  to coordinate with other members of the working group to identify actions  and time frames for addressing our recommendation.", "Preliminary observations from our ongoing work also indicate that some  freight rail stakeholders would prefer to receive more analysis or  actionable security information from TSA. The federal government\u2019s  National Strategy for Information Sharing discusses the need to improve  the two-way sharing of terrorism-related information on incidents, threats,  consequences, and vulnerabilities, including enhancing the quantity and  quality of specific, timely, and actionable information provided by the  federal government to critical infrastructure sectors. According to three  Class I rail stakeholders that we interviewed, TSA distributes information  on rail security that is generally used for situational awareness. However,  rail security stakeholders from three of the seven Class I railroads that we  surveyed indicated that TSA\u2019s security information products lack analysis,  such as trend analysis, that could help predict how certain events may  affect freight rail. In follow-up interviews, security officials at three Class I  railroads stated that security information provided by TSA does not offer  actionable information that could allow them to develop or adjust their  current countermeasures against potential terrorist threats. These security  officials added that they have often received the same information that  TSA provides from the media or other sources before it is distributed from  TSA. For example, two of these officials told us that they received little or  no security-related information from TSA in the aftermath of Osama bin  Laden\u2019s death. However, security officials at two of the three rail carriers  that we interviewed stated that they felt confident that someone from the  federal government would alert them of any direct threat to that carrier.  TSA officials agree that improvements are needed in the products and  mechanisms by which they alert rail agencies of security-related  information and intelligence. For example, a TSA official stated in June  2011 that the agency is in the process of revising its reports on suspicious  incidents to regionalize the information provided to rail carriers, in  response to feedback from those carriers. We will continue to assess TSA\u2019s  efforts related to security information-sharing and will report the final  results later this year.", "Chairman Rockefeller, Ranking Member Hutchison, and members of the  Committee, this completes my prepared statement.
