GAO's analysis of the ASC-to-APC and OPPS-to-APC cost ratios showed that 45 percent of all procedures in the analysis fell within a 0.10 point range of the ASC-to-APC median cost ratio, and 33 percent of procedures fell within a 0.10 point range of the OPPS-to-APC median cost ratio. These similar patterns of distribution around the median show that the APC groups reflect the relative costs of procedures provided by ASCs as well as they reflect the relative costs of procedures provided in hospital outpatient departments and can be used as the basis for the ASC payment system. GAO's analysis also identified differences in the cost of procedures in the two settings. The median cost ratio among all ASC procedures was 0.39 and when weighted by Medicare claims volume was 0.84.

ASCs were  established as an alternative to hospital inpatient care, which was  considered a more costly setting. Medicare\u2019s initial ASC payment rates  were based on ASC cost and charge data from 1979 and 1980. The Centers  for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the agency that administers  Medicare, was required by law to review the ASC payment rates  periodically and adjust them as appropriate. CMS last revised the ASC  payment rates in 1990 using ASC data on costs and charges that CMS  collected in 1986. Since the payment rates were last revised, there has  been substantial growth in both the number of ASC facilities and  procedures they perform, as well as changes in medical practice and  technology. In 2004, there were approximately 4,100 Medicare- participating ASCs, a number that has grown substantially since 2000  when there were about 2,900 Medicare-participating ASCs. In 2004, ASCs  received approximately $2.5 billion in total Medicare payments, a   79 percent increase since 2000 when Medicare payments to ASCs totaled  approximately $1.4 billion.", "While the ASC setting was originally intended to be an alternative to  hospital inpatient care, the procedures performed in ASCs are now  frequently performed in the hospital outpatient setting. Medicare pays  ASCs and hospital outpatient departments through different payment  systems. While procedures performed in ASCs are placed into payment  groups based on similar costs, hospital outpatient department procedures  are placed into payment groups, known as ambulatory payment  classification (APC) groups, based on both cost and clinical similarity.  Unlike the ASC payment system, the payment rates for hospital outpatient  departments are revised annually based on cost and charge data included  in reports hospitals are required to submit to CMS each year.", "Although ASCs and hospital outpatient departments perform a similar set  of procedures, no comparison between the Medicare ASC payment system  and the Medicare hospital outpatient department payment system, known  as the outpatient prospective payment system (OPPS), has been  conducted. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and  Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) directed us to conduct a study that  compares the relative costs of procedures performed in ASCs to the  relative costs of procedures performed in hospital outpatient  departments. As discussed with the committees of jurisdiction, we  compared (1) additional services billed with procedures performed in  ASCs with those billed with procedures performed in hospital outpatient  departments and whether there were any Medicare payments associated  with those services and (2) the relative costs of procedures when  performed in ASCs to the relative costs of those procedures when  performed in hospital outpatient departments, in particular, how  accurately the APC groups used in the OPPS reflect the relative costs of  procedures performed in the ASC setting. In addition, we examined the  proportion of ASCs\u2019 costs that are labor-related; this information is  provided in appendix I.", "To compare the delivery of additional services provided with procedures  performed in ASCs and hospital outpatient departments, we identified all  additional services frequently provided in each setting with one of the top  20 procedures based on highest Medicare ASC claims volume, which, as a  group, represented approximately 75 percent of all Medicare ASC claims  volume in 2003. Using Medicare claims data for 2003, we identified  beneficiaries receiving one of the top 20 procedures performed in either an  ASC or hospital outpatient department, then identified any other claims  for those beneficiaries submitted by ASCs, hospital outpatient  departments, durable medical equipment suppliers, and other Medicare  part B providers. We identified claims for the beneficiaries on the day the  procedure was performed and the day after. We created a list that  included all additional services that were billed at least 10 percent of the  time with each of the top 20 procedures when they were performed in  ASCs. We created a similar list of additional services for each of the top 20  procedures when they were performed in hospital outpatient departments.  We then compared the lists to determine if the additional services  provided by ASCs and hospital outpatient departments with each of those  procedures were similar. To compare the Medicare payments for  additional services provided with procedures performed in ASCs and  hospital outpatient departments, we identified whether any additional  services included in our analysis resulted in an additional payment.", "To compare the costs of procedures performed in ASCs and hospital  outpatient departments, we first compiled information on ASCs\u2019 costs and  procedures performed.

We then allocated each  ASC\u2019s direct costs among procedures it performed using a relative weight  scale we constructed with data from CMS, supplemented by information  from medical specialty societies and clinicians who work for CMS. The  relative weight scale captures the general variation in costs associated  with performing the different procedures. We allocated each ASC\u2019s  indirect costs equally across all procedures it performed. For each  procedure, we summed the direct and indirect costs for each ASC and  arrayed the total cost for each of the ASCs performing that procedure.

We then calculated a ratio between the  median cost for each procedure performed at an ASC, as determined by  the survey, and the median cost of each procedure\u2019s corresponding APC  group under the OPPS. For the same procedures, we also calculated a  ratio between the median cost of each procedure under the OPPS and the  median cost of the procedure\u2019s APC group, using the data obtained from  CMS. To evaluate the difference in procedure costs between the two  settings, we compared the ASC-to-APC and OPPS-to-APC cost ratios.

The ASC payment for a procedure  does not include payment for implantable devices or prosthetics related to  the procedure; ASCs may bill separately for those items. In addition, the  payment to the ASC does not include payment for professional services  associated with the procedure; the physician who performs the procedure  and the anesthesiologist or anesthetist bill Medicare directly for their  services. Finally, the ASC payment does not include payment for certain  other services that are not directly related to performing the procedure  and do not occur during the time that the procedure takes place, such as  some laboratory, X-ray, and other diagnostic tests. Because these  additional services are not ASC procedures, they may be performed by  another provider. In those cases, Medicare makes payments to those  providers for the additional services. For example, a laboratory service  needed to evaluate a tissue sample removed during an ASC procedure is  not included in the ASC payment. The provider that evaluated the tissue  sample would bill and receive payment from Medicare for that service.

In 1990, using these data, CMS revised the payment rates and  increased the number of payment groups to eight. A ninth payment group  was established in 1991.

In 1994,  Congress required that CMS conduct a survey of ASC costs no later than  January 1, 1995, and thereafter every 5 years, to revise ASC payment  rates. CMS conducted a survey in 1994 to collect ASC cost data. In 1998,  CMS proposed revising ASC payment rates based on the 1994 survey data  and assigned procedures performed at ASCs into payment groups that  were comparable to the payment groups it was developing for the same  procedures under the OPPS.

These procedures represented approximately 75 percent of all Medicare  ASC claims in 2003. Using Medicare claims data for 2003, we identified  beneficiaries receiving one of the top 20 procedures in either an ASC or  hospital outpatient department, then identified any other claims for those  beneficiaries from ASCs, hospital outpatient departments, durable medical  equipment suppliers, and other Medicare part B providers. We identified  claims for the beneficiaries on the day the procedure was performed and  the day after. We created a list that included all additional services that  were billed at least 10 percent of the time with each of the top 20  procedures when they were performed in ASCs. We created a similar list  of additional services for each of the top 20 procedures when they were  performed in hospital outpatient departments. We then compared the lists  for each of the top 20 procedures between the two settings to determine  whether there were similarities in the additional services that were billed  to Medicare. To compare the Medicare payments for procedures  performed in ASCs and hospital outpatient departments, we identified  whether any additional services included in our analysis resulted in an  additional payment.", "We used Medicare claims data from the National Claims History (NCH)  files. These data, which are used by the Medicare program to make  payments to health care providers, are closely monitored by both CMS and  the Medicare contractors that process, review, and pay claims for  Medicare services. The data are subject to various internal controls,  including checks and edits performed by the contractors before claims are  submitted to CMS for payment approval. Although we did not review these  internal controls, we did assess the reliability of the NCH data. First, we  reviewed all existing information about the data, including the data  dictionary and file layouts. We also interviewed experts at CMS who  regularly use the data for evaluation and analysis. We found the data to be  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comparison of Per- Procedure Costs", "paragraphs": ["To compare the relative costs of procedures performed in ASCs and  hospital outpatient departments, we first compiled information on ASCs\u2019  costs and procedures performed. Because there were no recent existing  data on ASC costs, we surveyed 600 ASCs, randomly selected from all  ASCs, to obtain their 2004 cost and procedure data. We received response  data from 397 ASC facilities. We assessed the reliability of these data  through several means. We identified incomplete and inconsistent survey  responses within individual surveys and placed follow-up calls to  respondents to complete or verify their responses. To ensure that survey  response data were accurately transferred to electronic files for our  analytic purposes, two analysts independently entered all survey  responses. Any discrepancies between the two sets of entered responses  were resolved. We performed electronic testing for errors in accuracy and  completeness, including an analysis of costs per procedure. As a result of  our data reliability testing, we determined that data from 290 responding  facilities were sufficiently reliable for our purposes. Our nonresponse  analysis showed that there was no geographic bias among the facilities  responding to our survey. The responding facilities performed more  Medicare services than the average for all ASCs in our sample.", "To allocate ASCs\u2019 total costs among the individual procedures they  perform, we developed a method to allocate the portion of an ASC\u2019s costs  accounted for by each procedure. We constructed a relative weight scale  for Medicare ASC-approved procedures that captures the general variation  in resources associated with performing different procedures. The  resources we used were the clinical staff time, surgical supplies, and  surgical equipment used during the procedures. We used cost and quantity  data on these resources from information CMS had collected for the  purpose of setting the practice expense component of physician payment  rates. For procedures for which CMS had no data on the resources used,  we used information we collected from medical specialty societies and  physicians who work for CMS. We summed the costs of the resources for  each procedure and created a relative weight scale by dividing the total  cost of each procedure by the average cost across all of the procedures.  We assessed the reliability of these data through several means. We  compared electronic CMS data with the original document sources for a  large sample of records, performed electronic testing for errors in  accuracy and completeness, and reviewed data for reasonableness. Based  on these efforts, we determined that data were sufficiently reliable for our  purposes.", "To calculate per-procedure costs with the data from the surveyed ASC  facilities, we first deducted costs that Medicare considers unallowable,  such as advertising and entertainment costs. (See fig. 3 for our per- procedure cost calculation methodology.) We also deducted costs for  services that Medicare pays for separately, such as physician and  nonphysician practitioner services. We then separated each facility\u2019s total  costs into its direct and indirect costs. We defined direct costs as those  associated with the clinical staff, equipment, and supplies used during the  procedure. Indirect costs included all remaining costs, such as support  and administrative staff, building expenses, and outside services  purchased. To allocate each facility\u2019s direct costs across the procedures it  performed, we applied our relative weight scale. We allocated indirect  costs equally across all procedures performed by the facility. For each  procedure performed by a responding ASC facility, we summed its  allocated direct and indirect costs to determine a total cost for the  procedure. To obtain a per-procedure cost across all ASCs, we arrayed the  calculated costs for all ASCs performing that procedure and identified the  median cost.", "To compare per-procedure costs for ASCs and hospital outpatient  departments, we first obtained from CMS the list of ambulatory payment  classification (APC) groups used for the outpatient prospective payment  system (OPPS) and the procedures assigned to each APC group.

We then calculated a ratio between each  procedure\u2019s ASC median cost, as determined by the survey, and the  median cost of each procedure\u2019s corresponding APC group under the  OPPS, referred to as the ASC-to-APC cost ratio. We also calculated a ratio  between each ASC procedure\u2019s median cost under the OPPS and the  median cost of the procedure\u2019s APC group, using the data obtained from  CMS, referred to as the OPPS-to-APC cost ratio. To evaluate the difference  in procedure costs between the two settings, we compared the ASC-to- APC and OPPS-to-APC cost ratios.
