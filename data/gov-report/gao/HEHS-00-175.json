As long as the expected exposure remains lower than the maximum safe exposure, the risk created by use of the particular pesticide is within acceptable limits and usually no action is required. However, once expected actual exposure levels exceed the maximum safe amount, EPA must determine the best ways to reduce exposure below the safe level to mitigate the risk. Many possible risk mitigation actions may be applied, ranging from prohibiting an agricultural or residential use of the pesticide to changing directions for its use (such as spraying less often). These mitigation steps are intended to reduce overall exposure from all sources, including exposure through pesticide residues on foods."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "New Law Fundamentally Changed How Risks Are Assessed", "paragraphs": ["FQPA made several fundamental changes in how EPA assesses and manages pesticide exposure risks to humans.Under FQPA, EPA must reevaluate existing tolerances for pesticide residues in foods within 10 years.

These FQPA requirements also apply in setting tolerances for new pesticides that are being registered and for new uses of existing pesticides. In reassessing existing tolerances, EPA must give priority to pesticides that appear to pose the greatest risk to public health. Table 1 provides a brief overview of these requirements.", "Among the difficulties EPA has faced in implementing FQPA requirements is the fact that the scientific knowledge necessary to accomplish some of these new mandates did not exist in 1996.

Under FQPA the agency has been required to develop the methods and data to perform the new aggregate exposure and cumulative effects assessments, which incorporate exposures from nonfood sources and the combined effects of entire classes of pesticides that were previously considered individually.", "The first class of pesticides to be affected by cumulative assessment under FQPA will likely be the organophosphates. EPA has identified the organophosphates as a class of pesticides requiring cumulative assessment because they can impair nervous system function by inhibiting the enzyme cholinesterase. The organophosphates are older pesticides, and EPA considers some of them to be more hazardous (although not all older pesticides are necessarily more hazardous). They are of special concern because of their toxicity and widespread use both in agriculture and in homes and gardens, according to the National Research Council\u2019s 1993 report, PesticidesintheDietsofInfantsandChildren.One of them is the single most widely used household pesticide in the United States\u2014 chlorpyrifos, which is sold under such names as Dursban and Lorsban."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "EPA\u2019s Office of Pesticide Programs Has Main Responsibility for Implementation", "paragraphs": ["EPA\u2019s Office of Pesticide Programs (OPP) has the lead responsibility for implementing the new FQPA requirements within its existing system of pesticide regulation.

The committee\u2019s procedures call for systematically reviewing both toxicology and exposure data for each chemical, focusing on two overriding concerns: (1) uncertainties in the data used for the toxicology and exposure assessments (data gaps) and (2) evidence of increased susceptibilities in infants and children (the potential for pre- and postnatal toxicity).Examples of the types of questions considered in these subject areas are presented in table 2.", "Committee members are encouraged to apply scientific judgment as well as qualitative and quantitative data in reaching consensus on whether to apply, reduce, or remove the safety factor.

In reviewing the committee\u2019s justifications for its recommendations, we found that when the committee identified both toxicology data gaps and evidence of increased susceptibility in children, the pesticides were most likely to receive a recommendation for a 10-fold safety factor. When there was no evidence of increased susceptibility, but incomplete data, a safety factor was also recommended, but it was less than 10 when the data suggested that a lower safety factor was sufficient. Pesticides with neither increased susceptibility nor data gaps usually received a recommendation for no additional safety factor.", "While EPA has incorporated consideration of the new safety factor in its pesticide reviews, it has continued efforts to refine its policies on applying the safety factor. A formal policy document on the safety factor has been developed (it is not a regulation), which discusses in detail the legal framework, overall approach, and related toxicology and exposure issues. It is much more extensive than the guidelines under which the Safety Factor Committee has been operating, but is consistent with them. An EPA official explained that the two documents serve somewhat different purposes, with the policy document providing comprehensive discussion of the issues and the operating procedures translating those policies into practical guidelines.

Common residential uses include lawn and gardening uses, pet applications, and roach and termite treatments. Not all pesticides have residential uses, but for those that do, adding those types of exposures to food and water exposures might push the total beyond the maximum safe level of exposure, leading to a need for mitigation steps and possible changes in tolerances.", "Because of its traditional focus on pesticide exposures from foods, EPA\u2019s data and methods for estimating food exposures are relatively highly developed, but for most pesticides the agency has lacked the data and methods to estimate nonfood exposures from drinking water and residential uses.

In a working paper on assessing these residential exposures, EPA stated that it relies primarily on the scientific literature and industry sources because it lacks data for most pesticides to characterize exposures from nonfood sources.

Similarly, we used various criteria to determine other attributes of the tolerances EPA has counted as reassessed, such as pesticide type (organophosphate, carbamate, organochlorine, and so on), risk priority group (Group 1, 2, or 3), and the resulting tolerance reassessment actions (raise, lower, same, or revoke)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Three Pesticides Evaluated Under FQPA\u2019s New Requirements: Dicofol, Methomyl, and Phosmet", "paragraphs": ["We asked a consultant with expertise in environmental toxicology, H.B.

A safety factor of 3 was recommended. The main concern in terms of exposure was for occupational users. However, at that time there were two homeowner uses, and no data were available to assess residential exposure.

Regarding the data gap for acute and subchronic neurotoxicity studies in rats that was the reason for the 3-fold safety factor, the reviewer noted that the gap did not seem to be a pressing need, because similar data were available for two other species, dogs and rabbits. His opinion was that if EPA had been willing to accept the data for dogs and rabbits as an alternative to the rat data, the safety factor might have been removed.

In the case of phosmet, it concurred with the findings of the May 1998 toxicology review committee marathon meeting and recommended a 3-fold FQPA safety factor, based on data gaps noted by the toxicology group.Specifically, the marathon meetings found that there was no evidence of increased susceptibility to phosmet in young animals, but there were data gaps for two types of neurotoxicity studies, and the requirement for a developmental neurotoxicity study would depend on the results of those other studies.

Almost all of the poisoning incidents resulted from failure to properly dilute a concentrated formulation of phosmet for use as flea dip treatment for dogs.
