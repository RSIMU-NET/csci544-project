Although it cost less than a penny for the government to mint a penny, the government lost $8 million to $9 million in 1994 after considering the cost of distributing the penny to commercial banks.", "Public opinion on the penny is mixed.

The penny\u2019s purchasing power is now about one-ninth of what it originally was. Today, pennies are made of 97.5 percent zinc and 2.5 percent copper. Contractors in Tennessee and Illinois produce copper-coated zinc blanks for the Mint to stamp as pennies. Pennies are then coined by the U.S. Mint, a unit of the Treasury Department, at its Denver and Philadelphia facilities. In 1995, the Mint issued 13.5 billion pennies, which represented 69 percent of all circulating coins produced that year and about 50 pennies per American. Over the past 30 years, the Mint has produced 288 billion pennies.", "In our 1990 report on the penny, we said that, while some Americans would welcome the elimination of the penny because of its low purchasing power and inconvenience, they seemed to tolerate the coin. We also reported that several other industrialized countries, including France, the Netherlands, Spain, and the United Kingdom, stopped producing their lowest denomination coins during the 1970s and 1980s because they were expensive to produce, did not circulate, and had very little purchasing power. Similarly, Australia, in 1990, and New Zealand, in 1989, stopped producing their 1-and 2-cent coins because their manufacturing cost exceeded their face value and because of their low purchasing power."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Objectives", "paragraphs": ["Mr. Chairman, when you requested this work, you asked us to update our 1990 report. We examined the government\u2019s cost to produce and distribute the penny; the public\u2019s attitude toward the penny; the budgetary and operational impact on the Mint of eliminating the penny; other economic impacts associated with eliminating the penny; the environmental impact of producing and disposing of pennies; and how prices for cash transactions could be rounded.", "I will summarize the results of our work. A summary of the scope of our work and methodology is contained in appendix I."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Penny Production and Distribution Were Not Profitable to the Government in Fiscal Year 1994", "paragraphs": ["The government as a whole did not profit from producing and distributing pennies in fiscal year 1994. After considering both the Mint\u2019s profit from producing pennies and the Federal Reserve System\u2019s cost of handling pennies, we estimated that the net cost to the government was $8.5 million to $9.2 million in fiscal year 1994.", "The Mint reported that its fiscal year 1994 total cost to produce and transport 13.5 billion pennies to the Federal Reserve was $96.9 million, resulting in a unit cost per penny that was less than the face value of the penny\u20140.7 cents (seven-tenths of a penny). We made adjustments to the Mint\u2019s calculated costs to produce the penny which increased the Mint\u2019s total costs from $96.9 million to $106.6 million and the unit cost from 0.7 cents to 0.8 cents. The rationale for our adjustments of the Mint\u2019s overhead and general and administrative costs are discussed below and shown in table 1.", "First, we reallocated overhead and general and administrative costs on the basis of the number of coins produced, as opposed to the Mint\u2019s allocation which is based on direct labor hours for all circulating coins. Although the penny represented 70 percent of the total 19.2 billion circulating coins the Mint produced in fiscal year 1994, the Mint\u2019s allocation, which was based on direct labor hours, resulted in charging only about 50 percent of all overhead and general and administrative costs to the penny. The Mint indicated that it uses direct labor hours to allocate overhead because much of the work on the penny is completed by contractors before it reaches the Mint. However, because the work completed on the penny before it reaches the Mint is done under Mint contracts, there are Mint overhead and general and administrative costs associated with contract negotiation and contract monitoring. This adjustment increased the total cost of penny production in fiscal year 1994 by $9.6 million.", "Second, we added additional costs of retirement for employees under the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) that are incurred by the government but not paid for by the Mint. According to actuarial estimates prepared by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the annual accruing cost of CSRS is about 25 percent of employees\u2019 salaries. In general, employees contribute 7 percent of their salaries toward system costs, leaving a cost of about 18 percent of salary to be borne by the government. However, employing agencies\u2019 contributions are limited to 7 percent of salary, and much of the remaining government costs (about 11 percent of salary) are covered by other government contributions to the retirement fund. About 49 percent of the Mint\u2019s employees who worked on the penny in fiscal year 1994 were under CSRS. We added 11 percent of labor cost for the time spent by CSRS employees working on the penny in 1994, which amounted to about $100,000.", "We made no adjustments to the Mint\u2019s costs for metal and fabrication, direct labor, or transportation to Federal Reserve Banks. Multiplying the unit cost of producing a penny in fiscal year 1994\u20140.7 cents using the Mint\u2019s unit cost, or 0.8 cents using GAO\u2019s calculation of unit costs\u2014by 13.5 billion units, we estimated that the Mint\u2019s profit, or seigniorage, was between $28.0 million and $37.7 million. Seigniorage is defined by the Department of the Treasury as the difference between the face value of a coin and the coin\u2019s cost of production. Seigniorage is treated as a reduction in the amount of money that must be borrowed from the public to finance the deficit. production of 13.5 billion pennies. However, as also shown in table 2, the Federal Reserve System incurred costs in handling the penny, that are not recognized by the Mint. According to the Federal Reserve System, in 1994, it received and distributed about 36 billion new or circulating pennies, at a cost of $11.1 million. Deducting the Federal Reserve System\u2019s costs of handling the penny from the interest avoided by producing the penny in 1994 resulted in a net cost to the government of between $8.5 million and $9.2 million."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Public Support for the Penny Is Mixed", "paragraphs": ["Four surveys taken from 1990 to 1995 indicated that a majority of the responding public either supported retaining the penny or believed that the penny was useful.

For example, as shown in figure 1, in 1991, we calculated that the circulation rate for pennies was 42 percent, whereas the circulation rate for quarters was 93 percent. Our calculations showed that in 1995, the circulation rates were 34 percent for pennies and 88 percent for quarters. These numbers tell us that for almost two-thirds of the billions of pennies produced, the trip from the Mint to the Federal Reserve to the commercial banks and finally to consumers is a \u201cone-way trip\u201d\u2014they are not seen again in circulation. one-time event, but that it occurs periodically and resulted from the penny\u2019s low circulation rate."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Budgetary Impact of Eliminating the Penny Is Difficult to Quantify", "paragraphs": ["According to the Mint, an immediate withdrawal of the penny could have a negative impact on the Mint, if the public decided to return billions of pennies.

The Mint estimates that at least 132 billion pennies are currently in circulation, but neither Mint nor Federal Reserve officials said they could estimate how many might be returned. Mint officials said that they would incur costs to handle, store, and melt the returned pennies which might exceed their salvage value.", "Mint officials also said that negative seigniorage could result from the return of pennies if existing money were given to the public in exchange. These costs would be offset to some extent by the Federal Reserve System\u2019s avoidance of the cost to handle pennies and the scrap value of the metal salvaged from returned pennies. Mint officials also said that they did not know how much of the overhead costs now absorbed by the penny would be allocated to other coins. In discussing the budgetary impact of eliminating the penny with Mint officials, they suggested that such an analysis should also include the benefits provided by the reduced government borrowing resulting from the stock of pennies in circulation, which they estimated to be $18 million. We agree the interest avoided from the remaining pennies in circulation if the penny were eliminated should be treated as an offset to the cost of eliminating the penny.

LaSalle said that it would probably have to shut down if the penny is eliminated since 94 of its 110 employees work on the penny.", "Eliminating the penny would not appear to adversely affect the mining of zinc, since penny production represents only a fraction of total domestic zinc consumption. According to data provided by the Mint and the U.S. Geological Survey, in 1995 the penny represented 2.7 percent of total U.S. zinc consumption. According to the American Zinc Association, the United States produces about 30 percent of the zinc it consumes, and if the penny were eliminated, the same amount of domestic zinc mining could continue, since the United States does not produce enough zinc to meet domestic demand. This suggests that, if the Mint stopped producing pennies, the demand for zinc mined for pennies could be replaced by the demand generated by other domestic uses so that no zinc mining jobs should be lost in the United States.", "According to Americans for Common Cents, an organization that has been formed to encourage the continued production of the penny, the discontinuation of penny production could result in the loss of (1) 356 jobs in the zinc refining and smelting industry, (2) $700,000 in sales of chemicals used for penny production, (3) $1.2 million in wages for truck drivers who transport penny blanks to the Mint, and (4) an unknown number of railroad jobs from a decrease in rail shipments from Alltrista to the Denver Mint and in transportation of slab zinc to refining and smelting operations.

In this situation, demand for the penny might decrease over time, and the government could then phase out the penny, with reduced potential for significant one-time costs from returned pennies. A con of this option might be that consumers could try to game the rounding system to their advantage at the expense of the merchant; for example by opting to round only in those situations where the final purchase price ended in 1,2, 6, or 7 cents.
