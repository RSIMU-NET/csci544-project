GAO reviewed and analyzed documents and data, including information from the WTO to determine what portion of the imports from AGOA countries to major trade partners could enter under preference programs.

AGOA is unique in that it focuses eligibility on sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries. Most other countries' trade preference programs do not restrict eligibility to SSA countries.", "Product coverage. AGOA and some other countries' trade preference programs provide fairly comprehensive coverage of products, but exclude some agricultural and other products that are important SSA exports.", "Rules of origin. Like other countries' trade preference programs, AGOA has rules of origin that determine which products qualify for coverage. Some countries, including the United States have recently made their rules of origin less restrictive, to make it easier for beneficiary countries to take greater advantage of these programs.", "In 2014, the United States International Trade Commission reviewed studies comparing the performance of trade preference programs and found that the European Union's (EU) preference programs have had overall greater success in increasing trade with Africa and that AGOA had more success in increasing diversification in the range of products exported from Africa. Research on China's and India's trade preference programs suggests that their fairly new programs could have significant impacts on SSA trade and that they are among the biggest and fastest growing markets for sub-Saharan exports.", "As the United States continues to pursue expanded trade and a more two-way trade relationship with African partners at the World Trade Organization (WTO) and elsewhere; SSA countries' recent participation in bilateral and multilateral trade negotiations provides insights that can inform future U.S. negotiations. For example, years of bilateral negotiations between SSA countries and the EU have recently resulted in Economic Partnership Agreements with 32 SSA countries. Trade experts and SSA and EU officials GAO spoke with provided information about these negotiations that indicates that transitioning from non-reciprocal trade preference programs, such as AGOA, to two-way trade agreements like the Economic Partnership Agreements with SSA countries may require:", "many years to finalize and implement,", "the establishment of timeframes to end access to trade preference programs,", "a willingness to consider limiting the initial scope of the agreements, and", "an acknowledgment that aspects of the agreements may have tradeoffs and could constrain SSA countries' ability to integrate into the global economy.", "The involvement of SSA countries in recent multilateral negotiations at the WTO also yields important insights for U.S. agencies when negotiating with these countries.

Trade preferences, which  reduce tariffs, or duties, for many products from eligible countries, are  \u201cnonreciprocal\u201d\u2014i.e., granted unilaterally, without requiring reciprocal  liberalization for U.S. goods for countries receiving them. In 1968, the  United States supported a United Nations (UN) resolution to establish a  mutually acceptable system of preferences. To permit the implementation  of the generalized preferences, in June 1971, developed countries,  including the United States, were granted a 10-year waiver from their  obligations under the global trading system, now embodied in the WTO,  to trade on a most favored nation (MFN) basis. Following the granting of  this waiver, developed countries created Generalized System of  Preferences (GSP) programs, and Congress enacted the U.S. GSP  program in January 1975. At the 1979 conclusion of the Tokyo Round of  Multilateral Trade Negotiations, an agreement with no expiration date  (known as the Enabling Clause) replaced the waiver. As they developed  economically, beneficiary countries were to eventually move on from  unilateral preferences and participate more fully in the global trade  system, including by undertaking reciprocal trade commitments to  liberalize their own markets. Under U.S. law, the AGOA program is linked  to the GSP program in several important ways. For example, some of the  authorities and limitations on what products can be included in the  program are based on or relate to GSP, and country eligibility for AGOA  involves first being eligible for GSP. But at the WTO, because the  Enabling Clause applies to preference regimes that are \u201cgeneralized,  non-reciprocal, and non-discriminatory,\u201d a separate U.S. waiver was  sought for AGOA, as well as other regional preference programs.", "Despite relatively rapid economic growth in developing countries,  developed countries have reformed and extended their programs and the  number of preference programs has grown. The WTO\u2019s 2014 World  Trade Report shows that, over the 2000-2012 period, developing  countries grew faster than developed countries, and now account for  nearly half of world exports. Since 2010, Japan, the EU, and Canada  have reformed and extended most of their preference programs.  Congress recently passed legislation to extend AGOA and other U.S.  preference programs by 10 years. Developed countries had already  added more generous preferences for least developed countries (LDC) to  their GSP programs by the mid-2000s, and some key developing  countries have since introduced new trade preferences targeted at LDCs,  including some in sub-Saharan Africa. For example, both China and India  have established LDC programs in the last decade.

But for products that include foreign inputs, each program country uses its  own methodology to determine whether sufficient local processing was  performed on non-originating material for a product to be considered  \u201clocal\u201d or originating from a beneficiary. For example, the United States  requires that a product must be imported directly from an AGOA  beneficiary country and that the sum of the cost or value of the materials  produced in one or more AGOA beneficiary countries plus the direct costs  of processing operations performed in those countries may not be less  than 35 percent of the appraised value at the time it enters the United  States (is imported). In contrast, according to one trade policy expert,  China\u2019s rules of origin are stricter than those of AGOA because, at least  40 percent of value must be added in the exporting country, compared  with the 35 percent regional value-added requirement for AGOA. In  addition, China requires external inputs to undergo substantial  transformation so that the resulting product would no longer enter under  the same four digit code of the Harmonized System.", "Cumulation\u2014permitting beneficiary countries to combine inputs from  multiple sources to meet the local sourcing requirements\u2014can ease the  restrictiveness of rules of origin. Some developed countries\u2019 preference  programs provide wide scope for cumulation of inputs to reach the  required minimum. Others, such as Japan\u2019s, have restrictive cumulation  rules. Specifically, five Southeast Asian countries are considered as a  single territory for rules of origin purposes and may cumulate production  under Japan\u2019s GSP, but no cumulation among the other 146 GSP  participants is allowed.", "Some developed countries have made efforts to make cumulation rules  less restrictive. For example, the EU and Canada (1) widened the scope  for cumulation of inputs to attain their required value-added threshold (in  Canada\u2019s case, across GSP and GSP-LDC preference beneficiaries and,  in the case of the EU, with Free Trade Agreement/EPA partners), and (2)  relaxed certain product-specific rules for LDC beneficiaries. An LDC  group paper submitted to the WTO Rules of Origin Committee in October  2014 indicated that reforms by Canada and the EU have resulted in  increased utilization of preferences, manufacturing capacity, and numbers  of highly skilled jobs in LDCs. The recently passed AGOA reauthorizing  legislation also modifies cumulation rules to help increase utilization.", "In the EU\u2019s case, the European Commission noted that the changes were  the product of a long and extensive review process that ultimately led it to  postpone implementation of one proposed reform: changing from a  paper-based system that enables beneficiary customs authorities to issue  required certificates that qualify goods for entry under the EU preference  programs, to an electronic one that would require exporters to register  and place more responsibility on beneficiary country exporters that are  registered in the EU\u2019s new electronic system for compliance. This paper- based system was one of the aspects of the EU preference program that  African governmental representatives we met in Brussels told us makes  the EU program easier to use than AGOA.  Making rules of origin requirements more consistent across preference  programs could make it easier for beneficiary countries to use multiple  programs, but efforts to standardize them have faced challenges.   According to African officials we met with, multiple rules makes it more  difficult for exporters to make use of available preference programs. They  also increase the administrative burden associated with using  preferences and may conflict with supply chain realities by requiring  countries to adapt their manufacturing practices to meet different program  requirements. As a result, the WTO LDC group has been pressing  developed countries to ensure that preferential rules of origin applicable  to imports from LDCs will be transparent, simple, and contribute to  facilitating market access for non-agricultural products. WTO members  agreed to work on this topic at the December 2013 ministerial conference  in Bali and in 2015 LDCs have urged progress.

The experts said the EU set 2007 as its target  date, in part because it was the year the EU\u2019s trade preferences with SSA  countries under the Cotonou Agreement and the associated WTO waiver  were scheduled to expire, but it did not formalize a consequence if  agreements were not concluded by that year. Between 2008 and 2014,  trade experts reported that EPA negotiations continued, but only 5 of the  19 SSA countries that initialed interim EPAs signed and ratified them. For  example, Zambia initialed an interim EPA, but did not subsequently sign  or implement it. Cameroon signed an interim EPA in 2009, but did not  ratify it until July 2014.

For example, in the  negotiations between the EU and SADC, market access issues and  safeguards in the agricultural sector were sticking points.

According to trade experts and EU  officials, the agreements were not ratified by the time the Cotonou  preferences expired in 2007, so to prevent trade disruption, the EU  passed legislation in 2008 that allowed provisional access to EPA  preferences.

In many of our meetings, African officials expressed  concern over the loss of tariff (and other) revenue that is a significant  amount of their governments\u2019 budgets as a result of the requirement that  they provide the EU greater market access. Studies assessing the impact  of EPAs on the African signatories have found that they will impose a  fiscal burden on the countries, though the risk level differs from country to  country. Recent meta-analysis of such studies found that the fiscal impact  could be very high for eight countries (Benin, Cape Verde, Comoros,  Djibouti, the Gambia, Ghana, Guinea-Bissau, and Togo), and that fiscal  impact could be low for seven other SSA countries (Botswana, Lesotho,  Malawi, Namibia, Nigeria, Swaziland, and Zambia.) The meta-analysis  also found that the impact would depend on what steps the countries took  to adjust during the phase-in period. Because the EPAs also contain a  \u201cstandstill clause\u201d that prohibits countries from enacting new customs  duties or raising tariffs beyond those provided in the EPA agreement, the  EU may be more insulated than other countries, including the United  States, should the loss of tariff revenue become a fiscal problem.", "The terms of EPAs may also create challenges for SSA countries  because, according to trade experts, their relative benefit to the SSA  countries may diminish as the EU negotiates agreements with other non- SSA countries. The EU is negotiating trade agreements with other  developed countries that may erode margins of preference for SSA  countries. The experts reported that the agreements also focus on  development of better rules and regulations not captured in EPAs that  could increase competition with SSA countries in the EU market.", "In addition, trade experts reported the following about how EPA terms  may constrain African countries\u2019 leverage in trade negotiations with other  countries, including the United States:", "EPAs contain a Most Favored Nations (MFN) clause stating that if  African EPA signatories negotiate trade agreements in the future with  other developed or large developing countries, they would have to  extend any more favorable treatment offered to those countries to the  EU as well.", "Key trading partners that would potentially want to deepen their trade  relationship with SSA countries may be less interested in doing so if  they know that they will not have any margin of preference over the  EU.", "One think tank said that the MFN clause is against the spirit of the  EPA itself, which states that the EPA is a way of fostering the  integration of signatories into the global economy.", "However, at the insistence of African negotiators, most of the EPAs  contain language stating that implementation of the MFN clause in  EPAs is not automatic, but must be negotiated on a case-by-case  basis.", "Trade experts report that EPAs may also negatively affect other trading  partners and multilateral trade negotiations. World Bank simulations of  the impact of the West Africa EPA on Nigeria project that most of the 7-20  percent increase in imports from the EU will divert trade from the rest of  the world, including the United States. The EPAs that are currently in  place also set precedents in terms of rules and exclusions that may act as  disincentives to multilateral liberalization, according to trade experts.

To determine country eligibility, we used the WTO  Preferential Trade Arrangements database which identifies and compiles  information to identify all preferential trade agreements implemented by  WTO members. Information includes required submissions by WTO  members. We used the most up-to-date information available in the  database, which varied by country. We also used UNCTAD data to  determine selected trade preference programs\u2019 country eligibility. We  cross-checked the information found in the WTO database with the  UNCTAD data for eligibility as of January 1, 2015. We also used other  countries\u2019 government websites, as available, to determine SSA country  participation within its preference program. Furthermore, World Bank and  United Nations information was used to identify income classification and  some procedural and policy requirements.", "Product coverage and exclusions. To compare product coverage we  utilized WTO information including a 2014 WTO Secretariat report to  identify tariff and trade data used to assess the extent of duty-free access  available to AGOA countries\u2019 exports under various other countries\u2019  preference programs. We used tariff-line trade data presented in the  database, which are based on member notifications. We also used  government and non-government sources to gather information on  product coverage offered by other countries\u2019 preference programs.", "Rules of origin. To report generally on rules of origin and specifically on  rules of origin percentage levels, calculation methods, and cumulation, we  used information from the WTO along with government and non- government sources. We also conducted a semi-structured interview with  a sample of United States and foreign government officials, including  African officials, along with trade experts. We discussed their knowledge  of other countries\u2019 trade preference programs, including varying rules of  origin and the impact of rules of origin on preference program utilization.", "Performance. To determine performance among AGOA and other  preference programs we used a 2014 USITC report on AGOA that  includes a comprehensive economic literature review on selected  countries\u2019 trade preference programs. The study identified 48 economic  studies of preference programs, published from 2001 to 2013; of that  number, 11 compared the performance of programs, and 7 of the 11  compared the performance of the United States\u2019 and the EU\u2019s  programs\u2014in part because the United States and the EU are two of the  few preference providers that provide data on actual imports under their  preference programs.", "To examine AGOA countries\u2019 participation in trade negotiations, we used  WTO data to determine the bilateral and multilateral trade agreements to  which AGOA countries are party. To identify insights from AGOA country  trade negotiations, we chose to focus on AGOA countries\u2019 Economic  Partnership Agreements with the EU because (1) congressional  requesters specifically asked about the impact of these agreements, (2)  negotiations for the regional agreements were all concluded recently\u2014in  2014, (3) the EU is the largest recipient of SSA exports, and (4) the  agreements replace a unilateral trade preference arrangement with a  reciprocal trade arrangement. We reported insights based on our  literature review on the negotiations leading up to (and the terms of) the  agreements as well as interviews with trade experts from AGOA  countries, U.S. government agencies, other key trade partners with  AGOA countries, multilateral trade organizations (including the WTO),  and think tanks.", "To determine impediments to SSA countries\u2019 participation in trade  negotiations, we reviewed the USITC report on AGOA and other relevant  literature. We also developed a semi-structured interview tool. We  selected a sample of officials and experts who would participate in semi- structured interviews on the basis of (1) GAO selective sampling based  on literature review, (2) recommendations from U.S. government officials  knowledgeable about other countries\u2019 trade negotiations with Africa, and,  where applicable, (3) availability during our fieldwork in Geneva and  Brussels. We implemented the semi-structured instrument in interviews  with trade experts from AGOA countries, U.S. government agencies,  other key trade partners with AGOA countries, multilateral trade  organizations (including the WTO), and think tanks. From the literature  and semi-structured interviews, we also examined efforts to address  impediments to SSA countries\u2019 participation in trade negotiations and the  impact of those efforts. Our observations about upcoming trade  negotiations involving AGOA countries are based on WTO documents  and official government documents."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Additional Information about Trade Preference Programs of Countries That Are Major Importers of Products from Sub-Saharan African Countries", "paragraphs": ["Table 3 provides a comparison of key characteristics of selected  countries\u2019 trade preference programs with sub-Saharan African (SSA)  countries.

The margin of preference is defined as the difference  between the tariffs all countries face\u2014known as the most favored nation  (MFN) rate\u2014versus the tariff charged preference program beneficiaries.  Essentially it is the price advantage that the program accords  beneficiaries over other competitors in their market.", "In the case of programs that provide duty-free treatment to covered  products, the tariff charged is zero, and thus the margin of preference  is the entire value of that difference. Thus, if a country had an average  MFN tariff of 10 percent and accorded preference program  beneficiaries duty-free treatment, the beneficiary would enjoy a 10  percent margin of preference in that market.", "In the case of programs that provide reduced duties, the margin of  preference would be a fraction of that. For example, if the preference  program provider\u2019s average MFN tariff was 10 percent and its  preference program involved a 50 percent reduction in duties,  beneficiaries of its programs would face a 5 percent tariff and have a  5 percentage point advantage over competitors.", "As shown in table 5, according to WTO Secretariat calculations, many  developing countries have substantially higher tariffs than developed  countries on key products from LDCs.", "For example, developing country tariffs on agriculture are more than 20  times as high as those in developed countries, and tariffs on clothing and  textiles are about twice as high. Several of these developing countries,  such as China and India, have put preferences in place for LDCs.
