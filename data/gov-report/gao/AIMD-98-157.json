HIPAA requires HHS and DOJ to issue a joint annual report to Congress for the preceding fiscal year, on (1) amounts appropriated to (deposited to) the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fundpursuant to HIPAA and the source of such amounts and (2) amounts appropriated from the trust fund for the HCFAC program and the justification for the expenditure of such amounts.

In this regard, the HHS Office of the Inspector General (HHS/OIG) reported that in fiscal year 1997, an estimated 11 percent, or $20 billion of Medicare fee-for-service payments were improper. The Congress enacted HIPAA, in part, to respond to the problem of health care fraud and abuse. HIPAA consolidated and strengthened ongoing efforts to attack fraud and abuse in health programs and provided new criminal and civil enforcement tools, as well as expanded resources for fighting health care fraud, including $104 million in fiscal year 1997 for HCFAC.", "Under the joint direction of the Attorney General and the HHS Secretary (acting through the HHS/OIG), HCFAC is to achieve the following: coordinate federal, state, and local law enforcement efforts to control fraud and abuse associated with health plans; conduct investigations, audits, and other studies of the delivery and payment for health care in the United States; facilitate the enforcement of the civil, criminal, and administrative statutes applicable to health care; provide guidance to the health care industry, including the issuance of advisory opinions, safe harbor notices, and special fraud alerts; and establish a national database of adverse actions against health care providers.", "Funds for the HCFAC program are appropriated from the trust fund to a newly created expenditure account, referred to as the Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control Account, maintained within the trust fund. The Attorney General and the Secretary of HHS jointly certify that the funds transferred to the control account are necessary to finance health care anti-fraud and -abuse activities, subject to limits for each fiscal year as specified in HIPAA. Annual minimum and maximum amounts are earmarked specifically for HHS/OIG activities for the Medicare and Medicaid programs. For example, of the $104 million available in fiscal year 1997, a minimum of $60 million and maximum of $70 million was earmarked for the HHS/OIG. By earmarking funds specifically for the HHS/OIG, the Congress ensured continued efforts by the HHS/OIG to detect and prevent fraud and abuse in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.", "DOJ and HHS refer to the difference between the maximum annual HCFAC appropriation and the maximum amount earmarked for the HHS/OIG as the \u201cwedge amount.\u201d If the HHS/OIG is allocated less than the maximum statutory amount, that difference is added to the wedge amount, which is available to fund health care fraud and abuse activities at other HHS entities and DOJ. Funds that HHS and DOJ do not spend to administer and operate the program may be made available to other federal, state, and local agencies engaged in health care fraud and abuse activities. See appendix I for additional detail regarding HCFAC funding.", "HIPAA also requires amounts equal to the following types of collections to be deposited in the trust fund: criminal fines recovered in cases involving a federal health care offense, including collections pursuant to section 1347 of Title 18, United States Code, civil monetary penalties and assessments imposed in health care fraud amounts resulting from the forfeiture of property by reason of a federal health care offense, including collections under section 982(a)(6) of Title 18, United States Code, and penalties and damages obtained and otherwise creditable to miscellaneous receipts of the Treasury\u2019s general fund obtained under the False Claims Act (sections 3729 through 3733 of Title 31, United States Code), in cases involving claims related to the provision of health care items and services (other than funds awarded to a relator, for restitution or otherwise authorized by law).", "HIPAA also authorizes the trust fund to accept unconditional gifts and bequests."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To meet our first objective of identifying amounts deposited to the trust fund in fiscal year 1997 pursuant to HIPAA and the sources of these amounts, we reviewed HHS and DOJ\u2019s fiscal year 1997 joint HCFAC report. We also obtained the trust fund\u2019s fiscal year 1997 income statement, which received an unqualified opinion from the independent auditors, Cotton and Company. We compared amounts shown in the joint report as deposits of penalties and multiple damages, criminal fines, civil monetary penalties, and gifts and bequests with the respective amounts reported on the trust fund\u2019s audited income statement. In addition, we selected 17 deposit transactions, focusing on large dollar amounts. We tested the selected transactions to determine whether they were correctly classified as deposits to the trust fund. Further, we interviewed personnel at various HHS and DOJ entities to gain an understanding of procedures and controls related to collecting and reporting deposits.", "To satisfy our second objective of identifying amounts appropriated from the trust fund in fiscal year 1997 for the HCFAC program and the reported justification for expenditures of such amounts, as well as our third objective of identifying expenditures from the trust fund for HCFAC activities not related to Medicare, we reviewed the joint report. We also reviewed documents supporting the allocation of the HCFAC appropriation, such as HHS\u2019 and DOJ\u2019s funding decision memorandum, proposals for the wedge amount, and reallocation documents. In addition, we selected nine expenditures and three obligations, focusing on large dollar amounts. We tested the selected transactions to determine whether they were justified for fraud- and abuse-related activities. Also, because payroll costs were predominantly allocated to the HCFAC appropriation, rather than accounted for directly, we reviewed the allocation methodologies at two entities\u2014HHS/OIG and DOJ\u2019s Criminal Division\u2014to determine whether the methodologies were reasonable. Further, we interviewed personnel at various HHS and DOJ entities to gain an understanding of their procedures for allocating the HCFAC appropriation and reporting related expenditures, including non-Medicare related expenditures.", "To identify any savings to the trust fund, as well as any other savings, resulting from expenditures from the trust fund for the HCFAC program, which was our fourth objective, we reviewed the joint report. We reviewed all recommendations and the resulting cost savings as reported in the HHS/OIG\u2019s fiscal year 1997 semiannual reports to determine whether such cost savings related to the HCFAC program. In addition, we selected 10 cost savings items from the fiscal year 1997 semiannual reports and reviewed supporting documentation to determine whether such cost savings related to fiscal year 1997 and were adequately substantiated. Further, we interviewed HHS/OIG personnel to determine their methodology for estimating cost savings.", "We reviewed deposit, appropriation, and savings information reported in HHS\u2019 and DOJ\u2019s joint report. Our review of reported trust fund deposit, appropriation, and savings information was conducted in accordance with standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA)\u2014Attestation Standards sections 100.03 through 100.52. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on amounts reported in the HHS and DOJ 1997 joint report.", "In response to HIPAA\u2019s provision that we report on other aspects of the operation of the trust fund as we consider appropriate, we reviewed the status of HIPDB, the national health care fraud and abuse data collection program, which is a requirement of HIPAA. To gain an understanding of the program\u2019s implementation and current status, we reviewed the program status report prepared by Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA). We also interviewed knowledgeable personnel responsible for HIPDB\u2019s development and reviewed various documents relating to the program. Specifically, we discussed the planning and current status of the data bank with personnel from HHS/OIG and HRSA, the organizations primarily responsible for HIPDB. We did not perform a systems review or consider whether HIPDB, as planned, will be compliant with Year 2000requirements.", "We performed work and contacted officials at the Health Care Financing Administration in Baltimore, Maryland; HHS Headquarters, the HHS/OIG, the Administration on Aging, and DOJ\u2019s Justice Management Division, Executive Office of the United States Attorneys, Criminal Division, and Civil Division in Washington, D.C.; HRSA and HHS\u2019 Program Support Center in Rockville, Maryland; and the Pennsylvania Eastern District United States Attorneys Office in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.", "We conducted our work from February 1998 through May 6, 1998 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards, which incorporate AICPA standards and provide additional audit standards. We requested comments on a draft of this report from the Secretary of HHS and the Attorney General or their designees. The Inspector General of HHS provided us with written comments, which are reprinted in appendix II. On May 15, the DOJ Chief, Health Care Fraud Unit provided us with oral comments.

In addition, nothing came to our attention to suggest that HHS and DOJ did not accurately classify HIPAA deposits in their fiscal year 1997 joint HCFAC report, except for a $5 million overstatement of criminal fines that they noted in the joint report.", "Penalties and damages obtained under the False Claims Act and criminal fines resulting from health care fraud cases, as reported by HHS and DOJ, comprised about 68 percent and 32 percent, respectively, of the deposits to the trust fund pursuant to HIPAA. DOJ\u2019s Civil Division in Washington, D.C., and Financial Litigation Units in United States Attorneys Offices located throughout the country collect penalties and damages resulting from health care fraud cases. They report collection information to DOJ\u2019s Debt Accounting Operations Group, which in turn centrally accounts for collections of penalties and multiple damages and reports to the Department of the Treasury the amounts to be deposited to the trust fund. Clerks of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts located throughout the country collect criminal fines resulting from health care fraud cases and report these collections to the Financial Litigation Unit associated with their districts. The Financial Litigation Units report criminal fine collections to DOJ\u2019s Executive Office of the United States Attorneys in Washington, D.C., which centrally reports the amount of criminal fines collected to the Department of the Treasury.", "We found that the amounts shown in the joint report as deposits of penalties and multiple damages, criminal fines, civil monetary penalties, and gifts and bequests agreed with the respective amounts reported on the trust fund\u2019s audited fiscal year 1997 income statement. In addition, we found that the 17 deposit transactions we reviewed totaling approximately $43 million were accurately reported and classified as deposits to the trust fund.", "We also found that deposits reported in fiscal year 1997 primarily resulted from actions initiated prior to the creation of HCFAC. According to DOJ officials, investigation and litigation of health care fraud cases generally span several years. Once cases are settled, it may take several more years before any resulting fines, penalties, and damages are paid in full. Consequently, deposits to the trust fund reported in fiscal year 1997 pursuant to HIPAA essentially resulted from prior years investigation and litigation efforts. For example, in fiscal year 1997, DOJ reported nearly $41 million in deposits to the trust fund pursuant to HIPAA as a part of a $319 million settlement with Smithkline Beecham Clinical Labs, which was the result of a 3-year task force effort targeting unbundling schemes perpetrated by independent clinical laboratories. Also, a 7-year investigation of home health agency fraud resulted in a $255 million settlement with First American Home Health Care of Georgia, formerly ABC Home Health Services, in fiscal year 1997. DOJ reported almost $20 million in deposits to the trust fund pursuant to HIPAA in fiscal year 1997 as a result of this settlement.

The Attorney General and HHS Secretary entered into a memorandum of understanding which laid the groundwork for allocating funds among program participants. In applying for funds, applicants were required to explain how proposed activities conformed to the statute and the HCFAC program and to provide a spending plan. HHS and DOJ jointly reviewed proposals and made funding decisions for the HCFAC funds.", "In this first year, HHS and DOJ did not make the final funding decisions for allocating the wedge funds until December 1996.

Table 2 presents fiscal year 1997 allocations and obligations for the HCFAC program.", "The HHS/OIG was allotted $70 million, the maximum statutory amount authorized, to build upon the policies and practices of Operation Restore Trust (ORT), while strategically increasing resources dedicated to fraud activities, enhancing existing Medicare fraud protection activities, and pursuing new anti-fraud initiatives. The HHS/OIG reported that HCFAC funding allowed it to open six new investigative offices and three new audit offices and increase its staff levels by approximately 240 in fiscal year 1997.", "The following briefly summarizes the reported allocation of the $34 million wedge amount and the purposes for which those funds were used.", "The Department of Justice was allocated a total of $22.2 million primarily to increase efforts to litigate health care fraud cases and provide fraud training courses.

Medicare coverage review surveys are intended to provide fiscal and regional home health intermediaries, who process and pay Medicare claims, with better information to assess overpayments and implement collection procedures. The HCFA Customer Information System is designed to identify potential targets for Medicare fraud and abuse investigations. HCFA received funding to purchase hardware for the system and provide connectivity to the HHS/OIG and DOJ.

HIPAA restricts the HHS/OIG\u2019s use of HCFAC funds to the Medicare and Medicaid programs. According to HHS/OIG officials, they use HCFAC funds only for audits, evaluations, or investigations related to Medicare or Medicaid. The officials also stated that while some activities may be limited to either Medicare or Medicaid, most activities are generally related to both programs. Because HIPAA does not preclude the HHS/OIG from using HCFAC funds for Medicaid efforts, the HHS/OIG does not believe it is necessary or beneficial to account for such expenditures separately.", "Similarly, DOJ officials do not believe that it is practical or beneficial to separately account for non-Medicare expenditures due to the nature of health care fraud cases. HIPAA permits DOJ to use HCFAC funds for health care fraud activities involving other health care programs. According to DOJ officials, health care fraud cases usually involve several health care programs, including Medicare and health programs administered by other federal agencies, such as the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Defense, and the Office of Personnel Management. Consequently, it is difficult to separately charge personnel costs and other litigation expenses to specific parties in health care fraud cases. Also, according to DOJ officials, even if Medicare is not a party in a health care fraud case, the case may provide valuable experience in health care fraud matters, allowing auditors, investigators, and attorneys to become more effective in their efforts to combat Medicare fraud.

As discussed earlier, audits, evaluations, and investigations can take several years to complete. Once they are completed, it can take several more years before recommendations or initiatives are implemented. Likewise, it is not uncommon for litigation activities to span many years before a settlement is reached. Consequently, any savings resulting from health care anti-fraud and -abuse activities funded by the HCFAC program in fiscal year 1997 will likely not be realized until subsequent years.", "In their joint report, HHS and DOJ reported approximately $6.1 billion of cost savings during fiscal year 1997 resulting from implementation of HHS/OIG recommendations and other initiatives. However, as the recommendations and other initiatives relate to actions that predate the HCFAC program, the cost savings cannot be associated with expenditures from the trust fund pursuant to HIPAA.", "We found that $4 billion of the reported $6.1 billion of cost savings related to the Medicare program. The remaining $2.1 billion were specific to the Medicaid program and, thus, would not impact the trust fund since the Medicaid program is funded with general appropriations.
