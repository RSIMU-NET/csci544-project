Until they turned 65, they could  enroll in TRICARE Prime, the Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) managed  care plan, which gave them priority access to MTFs.  Alternatively, they  could use one of DOD\u2019s other plans that pays part of the cost of civilian  health care.  However, when they turned 65 and became eligible for  Medicare, retirees lost their right to military health care and could obtain  care at MTFs only if space were available after higher priority beneficiaries  were treated.", "The demonstration allowed retirees to get their care largely at MTFs by  enrolling in a DOD-run Medicare managed care organization known as  TRICARE Senior Prime.  Enrollees in Senior Prime could receive the full  range of Medicare services, as well as some additional TRICARE services,  and they would incur minimal out-of-pocket costs.  For enrollees, the MTF  became the focal point of their medical care\u2014the source of all their  primary care and much of their specialty care, as well as referrals to  civilian network providers.  Those retirees who chose not to enroll could  still use MTFs on a space-available basis.  However, given the MTFs\u2019 new  responsibilities for treating Senior Prime enrollees, nonenrollees might no  longer be able to get care at MTFs.", "In establishing the subvention demonstration, the BBA also directed us to  evaluate the demonstration over its initial 3-year period, which ended in  December 2000.  Our evaluation covers three major areas: the effect of the  demonstration on retirees\u2019 access  to care and the quality of care received  by enrollees; the cost of the demonstration to beneficiaries, Medicare, and  DOD; and management and implementation issues encountered during the  demonstration.", "This report, focusing on access to care, is one of several addressing these  issues.  Our objectives were to examine (1) the effect of the demonstration  on enrollees\u2019 and nonenrollees\u2019 access to health care and (2) the  consequences of changes in access to care for retirees\u2019 satisfaction, health  outcomes, and DOD costs.  To address these issues, we surveyed about  20,000 enrollees and eligible nonenrolled retirees by mail at the beginning  of the demonstration and at the end of 2000. (See app. I.) We supplemented  the surveys with Medicare and DOD administrative data, but did not  independently verify these data.  Although the survey data covered the  period of the initial demonstration, the administrative data related  primarily to 1999, due to reporting lags.

TRICARE offers three health plans: TRICARE Standard, a fee-for-service  plan; TRICARE Extra, a preferred provider plan; and TRICARE Prime, a  managed care plan.  In addition, TRICARE offers prescription drugs at no  cost from MTF pharmacies and, with co-payments, from retail pharmacies  and DOD\u2019s National Mail Order Pharmacy.", "Retirees have access to all of TRICARE\u2019s health plans and benefits until  they turn 65 and become eligible for Medicare.  Subsequently, they can only  use military health care on a space-available basis, that is, when MTFs have  unused capacity after caring for higher priority beneficiaries.  However,  MTF capacity varies from a full range of services at major medical centers  to limited outpatient care at small clinics.  Moreover, the amount of space  available in the military health system has decreased during the last decade  with the end of the Cold War and subsequent downsizing of military bases  and MTFs. Recent moves to contain costs by relying more on military care  and less on civilian providers under contract to DOD have also contributed  to the decrease in space-available care.", "Although some retirees age 65 and over rely heavily on military facilities for  their health care, most do not, and over 60 percent do not use military  health care facilities at all.  In addition to using DOD resources, retirees  may receive care paid for by Medicare and other public or private  insurance for which they are eligible.

They also can pay a monthly premium to join part B, which  covers physician and outpatient services as well as those home health  services not covered under part A.  Traditional Medicare allows  beneficiaries to choose any provider that accepts Medicare payment and  requires beneficiaries to pay for part of their care.  Most beneficiaries have  supplemental coverage that reimburses them for many costs not covered  by Medicare.  Major sources of this coverage include employer-sponsored  health insurance; \u201cMedigap\u201d policies, sold by private insurers to  individuals; and Medicaid, a joint federal-state program that finances health  care for low-income people.", "The alternative to traditional Medicare, Medicare+Choice, offers  beneficiaries the option of enrolling in managed care or other private  health plans.

About 125,000 dual eligibles (military retirees who  were also eligible for Medicare) lived in the 40-mile service areas of the six  sites\u2014about one-fifth of all dual eligibles nationwide living within an MTF\u2019s  service area.  DOD capped enrollment at about 28,000 for the  demonstration as a whole.  Over 26,000 enrolled\u2014about 94 percent of the  cap.  In addition, retirees enrolled in TRICARE Prime could \u201cage in\u201d to  Senior Prime upon reaching age 65, even if the cap had been reached, and  about 6,800 did so.  Beneficiaries enrolled in the program paid the Medicare  part B premium, but no additional premium to DOD.  Under Senior Prime,  all primary care was provided at MTFs, although DOD purchased some  hospital and specialty care from its network of civilian providers.  Senior  Prime enrollees received the same priority for care at the MTFs as younger  retirees enrolled in TRICARE Prime.  Care at the MTFs was free of charge  for enrollees, but they had to pay any applicable cost-sharing amounts for  care in the civilian network (for example, $12 for an office visit).", "The demonstration authorized Medicare to pay DOD for Medicare-covered  health care services provided to retirees at an MTF or through private  providers under contract to DOD.  As established in the BBA, capitation  rates\u2014fixed monthly payments for each enrollee\u2014for the demonstration  were discounted from what Medicare would pay private managed care  plans in the same areas.  However, to receive payment, DOD had to spend  at least as much of its own funds in serving this dual-eligible population as  it had in the recent past.", "The six demonstration sites are each in a different TRICARE region and  include 10 MTFs that vary in size and types of services offered. (See table  1.)  The five MTFs that are medical centers offer a wide range of inpatient  services and specialty care as well as primary care. They accounted for  over 75 percent of all enrollees in the demonstration, and the two San  Antonio medical centers had 38 percent of all enrollees.  MTFs that are  community hospitals are smaller, have more limited capabilities, and could  accommodate fewer Senior Prime enrollees.  At these smaller facilities, the  civilian network provides much of the specialty care.

(See table 2.)", "When asked specifically about their access to MTF care, those who had not  used MTFs in the past reported the greatest improvement.  (See figure 1.)", "About one-third of all enrollees said that their access to physicians had  improved, and a significantly smaller fraction said that it had declined.  For  example, 32 percent of enrollees said that, under the demonstration, their  primary care doctor\u2019s office hours were more convenient, while 20 percent  said they were less so.  Similarly, enrollees said that they did not have to  wait too long to get an appointment with a doctor and, once they reached  the office, their doctor saw them more promptly.  (See table 3.)", "For two aspects of access, however, Senior Prime enrollees\u2019 experience  was mixed.  TRICARE has established standards for the maximum amount  of time that should elapse in different situations between making an  appointment and seeing a doctor: 1 month for a well-patient visit, 1 day for  an urgent care visit, and 1 week for routine visits.  According to TRICARE  policy, MTFs should meet these standards 90 percent of the time.  While  Senior Prime met the standards for the time it took to get an appointment  and see a doctor for well-patient visits (like a physical), it fell slightly short  of the standard for urgent care visits (such as for an acute injury or illness  like a broken arm or shortness of breath) and, more markedly, for routine  visits  (such as for minor injuries or illnesses like a cold or sore throat).   (See table 4.)", "When asked about their ability to choose their own primary care doctors,  enrollees were somewhat more likely to say that it was more difficult than  before the demonstration.  This is not surprising, in view of the fact that  Senior Prime assigned a primary care doctor (or nurse) to each enrollee.   However, regarding specialists, enrollees said that their choice of doctors  had improved.", "Enrollees reported fewer financial barriers to access under Senior Prime.   They said that their out-of-pocket spending decreased and was more  reasonable than before.  By the demonstration\u2019s end, nearly two-thirds said  that they had no out-of-pocket costs.  Even at the smaller demonstration  sites, where care from the civilian network, which required co-payments,  was more common, about half of enrollees said they had no out-of-pocket  costs.", "These enrollee reports of better access under Senior Prime are largely  supported by DOD and Medicare administrative data.  Enrollees received  more services from Senior Prime than they had obtained before the  demonstration from MTFs and Medicare combined.  Specifically, their use  of physicians increased from an average 12 physician visits per year before  enrolling in Senior Prime to 16 visits per year after enrollment, and the  number of hospital stays per person also increased by 19 percent.", "Enrollees\u2019 use of services not only increased under Senior Prime\u2014as did  other measures of access to care\u2014but exceeded the average level in the  broader community.  Enrollees used significantly more care than their  Medicare fee-for-service counterparts.  These differences cannot be  explained by either age or health\u2014enrollees were generally younger and  healthier.  Adjusted for demographics and health conditions, physician  visits were 58 percent more frequent for Senior Prime enrollees than for  their Medicare counterparts, and hospital stays were 41 percent more  frequent.  Nonetheless, enrollees\u2019 hospital stays\u2014adjusted for  demographics and health conditions\u2014were about 4 percent shorter.", "We found three probable explanations for enrollees\u2019 greater use of hospital  and outpatient care:   Lower cost-sharing. Research confirms the commonsense view that  patients use more care if it is free.  Whereas in traditional Medicare the  beneficiary must pay part of the cost of care\u2014for example, 20 percent of  the cost of an outpatient visit\u2014in Senior Prime all primary care and  most specialty care is free.", "Lack of strong incentives to limit utilization.  Although MTFs  generally tried to restrain inappropriate utilization, they did not have  strong financial incentives to do so.  MTFs cannot spend more than their  budget, but space-available care acts as a safety valve: that is, when  costs appear likely to exceed funding, space-available care can be  reduced while care to Senior Prime enrollees remains unaffected.  MTFs  also had no direct incentive to limit the use of purchased care, which is  funded centrally, and the managed care contractors also lacked an  incentive, since they were not at financial risk for Senior Prime.", "Practice styles.  Military physicians\u2019 training and experience, as well as  the practice styles of their colleagues, also affect their readiness to  hospitalize patients as well as their recommendations to patients about  follow-up visits and referrals to specialists.  Studies have shown that  the military health system has higher utilization than the private sector.

However, for most nonenrollees, this  decline was not an issue, because they did not use MTFs either before or  during the demonstration.  Furthermore, of those who depended on MTFs  for all or most of their care before the demonstration, most enrolled in  Senior Prime, thereby assuring their continued access to care.

DOD further stated that the utilization data should cover the  full 3 years of the demonstration experience and that utilization might be  higher during the initial phase of a new plan.  Finally, DOD stated that  access and satisfaction for TRICARE Prime enrollees were adversely  affected by the demonstration.

We therefore did not attempt to obtain information on utilization  during 2001 and, in any case, the lag in data reporting would have  prevented our doing so.
