Recent studies have shown that small manufacturing businesses face a number of challenges in their efforts to remain competitive, including the inability to obtain operating and investment capital, a lack of familiarity with new business practices, and difficulty in finding independent advice and skilled employees. To help these businesses overcome such challenges, many federal agencies provide financial and nonfinancial technical services through targeted or general programs or create interagency work groups to better coordinate their efforts and more effectively support these businesses. In this context, GAO identified (1) federal programs that provide services to support small businesses engaged in manufacturing and (2) federal interagency efforts that focus on issues of concern to small manufacturing businesses. To identify these programs and efforts, GAO obtained documentation from 19 federal agencies. In commenting on a draft of this report, 18 of the 19 agencies made technical comments that we have incorporated as appropriate. GAO is not making recommendations in this report."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO identified 254 federal programs that provide services to support the business sector, of which 5 provide services specifically to small businesses engaged in manufacturing and an additional 15 target manufacturers, regardless of their size. Seven of the 20 programs had data on the level of services provided to small manufacturing businesses, and between fiscal years 2004 through 2006 these programs provided over $35 million and served from about 8,000 small manufacturing businesses in 2004 to over 9,000 in 2006. The 5 programs that target small businesses engaged in manufacturing provide primarily nonfinancial technical assistance to help firms improve the efficiency of their manufacturing operations and their quality control processes as well as to solve specific manufacturing problems. These 5 programs also offer small manufacturing businesses general assistance with their strategic and business planning, accounting and financing, and sales and marketing. In addition, 1 of the 5 programs offers financial assistance. Of the 15 programs that provide services to manufacturers, regardless of their size, 9 offer only nonfinancial services similar to the 5 that target small manufacturing firms, and 6 also provide financial services. Small businesses engaged in manufacturing also can obtain services from 127 other federal programs that are available to all small businesses, regardless of their business type. Many of these programs provide general business and management services, and about 35 percent also offer financial services, such as loans or grants. Finally, small manufacturing businesses can obtain general business, export, and financial services from an additional 107 federal programs designed to help the business sector in general, regardless of the size or type of the business involved. Because not all of these programs gather data on the size of the businesses they serve, it is unclear how many small manufacturing firms received services from these general programs. GAO identified 20 federal interagency efforts that focus on supporting the business sector. Of these 20 efforts, 4 were created specifically to focus on the challenges that small businesses engaged in manufacturing face, and 2 were created to focus on issues relevant to manufacturers in general, regardless of their size. The agencies involved in 3 of the 4 interagency efforts that focus on the concerns of small manufacturing businesses collaborate to expand and coordinate their services through national networks of technical assistance centers. The 4th effort involves efforts to help small manufacturing businesses improve the efficiency of their operations. The 2 interagency efforts that focus on issues relevant to manufacturers in general focus on developing strategies to improve the competitiveness of manufacturers and resolving issues associated with manufacturing-related research and development policies, programs, and budgets. The remaining 14 interagency efforts that GAO identified focus on the concerns of small businesses or of all businesses in general, which may include some issues that also are of concern to small manufacturing businesses."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The ability of U.S. manufacturers to successfully compete in the global  economy is essential to the nation\u2019s continued economic growth and  standard of living. Small businesses engaged in manufacturing (referred to  as \u201csmall manufacturers\u201d in this report), typically those with 500 or fewer  employees, comprise over 90 percent of all U.S. manufacturers and employ  6 million workers. Recent studies have shown that these small  manufacturers were particularly hard hit during the recession that began  in 2001 and the subsequent slow economic recovery, and that these  manufacturers continue to face serious challenges to their efforts to  remain competitive. These challenges include difficulties in obtaining  operating capital and investment funds to modernize their operations;  their relative lack of familiarity with changing technology, production  techniques, and business management practices; difficulties in finding  high-quality, independent advice and assistance; and difficulties in  obtaining skilled employees. While the federal government has devoted  considerable resources to programs that can help small businesses,  including manufacturers, to more effectively address these types of  challenges and compete in today\u2019s global market, industry analysts believe  that many small manufacturers may be unaware of this assistance.", "Federal programs that support manufacturing and other businesses offer  services designed to help businesses improve their operations in a range of  areas. For example, programs may offer financial services in the form of  loans or loan guarantees to help businesses obtain funds for daily or  export operations or to acquire needed buildings or equipment. Federal  programs also may offer nonfinancial services, such as consulting or  assessments, to help businesses improve their efficiency, adopt modern  technologies, export their products, or train their workers.", "In addition to programs that help individual businesses, federal support for  small businesses engaged in manufacturing may take the form of  interagency efforts that bring together officials from several federal  agencies to focus on specific challenges that businesses face. For example,  interagency efforts may focus on ensuring consistency in how a program is  implemented by more than one agency or in how a program might better  meet the needs of the businesses it serves. In other cases, interagency  efforts may address a specific task, such as coordinating research  programs across several agencies. These types of interagency efforts may  disband once their task is complete.", "In this context we identified (1) those programs that provide services to  support manufacturing by U.S. small businesses and, for fiscal years 2004  through 2006, the services and funds these programs provided and their  levels of participation and (2) current federal interagency efforts that  support manufacturing by U.S. small businesses. In addition, we compiled  a list of studies that focused on federal programs that support small  businesses engaged in manufacturing. See appendix XXII.", "To identify agencies and programs that provide services to support  manufacturing by small businesses, we obtained documentation and  interviewed officials at 17 executive departments, independent agencies,  and a government corporation, including the Departments of Agriculture,  Commerce, Defense, Education, Energy, Health and Human Services,  Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, the Interior, Labor,  Transportation, and Veterans Affairs; Environmental Protection Agency;  Export-Import Bank; National Aeronautics and Space Administration;  National Science Foundation; and Small Business Administration.  Throughout this report we refer collectively to these executive  departments, independent agencies, and the government corporation as  \u201cagencies\u201d. We also searched the agencies\u2019 Web sites and the Catalog of  Federal Domestic Assistance and interviewed officials representing state  governments and trade associations. Through these efforts, we also  identified relevant federal efforts at the National Technology Transfer  Center and the Appalachian Regional Commission, bringing the total to 19  federal entities that administer programs offering services to businesses,  including small manufacturers. We included assistance provided by federal  entities and through contracts or other agreements with state governments  as well as private and nonprofit entities that operate on the federal  government\u2019s behalf. We focused our work on federal programs that  support businesses by addressing challenges in the following five areas:  obtaining capital; developing or deploying new technologies; applying  improved technology, business, and management practices; exporting  goods; and training workers. Because agencies may not track funding and  participation in a consistent manner, the information they reported to us is  an estimate of the minimum funding provided and businesses served. We  excluded federal research programs that focus on advancing  manufacturing-related knowledge and tools, but that do not offer  operational services or financing to manufacturers. Because no  comprehensive list of federal programs that provide services to  manufacturers or other businesses exists, we cannot guarantee that we  identified all such programs. However, we attempted to verify the  accuracy and completeness of the information we gathered with relevant  agency officials. Officials reviewed and verified information on over 70  percent of the programs that we identified. The information we included  that was not reviewed by agency officials was obtained from agency  documents and information contained in agency Web sites. The program  descriptions included in this report, including the appendix descriptions,  were derived from agency materials and do not reflect independent GAO  legal analysis of any relevant program statutes, regulations, or  administrative guidance.", "To identify interagency efforts to support small businesses, we searched  the agencies\u2019 Web sites; obtained documentation; and interviewed officials  at federal agencies and at organizations that represent state government  officials and trade associations. We included both ongoing interagency  efforts that coordinate the activities of programs that operate in multiple  agencies and task-specific interagency efforts that may disband upon  completion of an assigned task. We attempted to verify the information we  gathered on these interagency efforts with relevant agency officials and  reviewed available documentation on the mission, goals, and  accomplishments of each effort. We consulted GAO technical experts and  determined that the information and data were sufficiently reliable for this  report. See appendix I for more details on the objectives, scope, and  methodology. We conducted our work from May 2006 to April 2007 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Manufacturing generally involves the mechanical, physical, or chemical  transformation of materials, substances, or components into new  products, including the production of food, automobiles, and clothing,  among many other things. The materials that manufacturers transform into  new products include raw materials from agricultural, forestry, fishing,  mining, or quarrying businesses as well as component items produced by  other manufacturers. Manufacturing also includes the assembly of  components into manufactured products. Businesses engaged in  manufacturing often are referred to as plants, factories, or mills, and most  use power-driven machines and materials-handling equipment. However,  products that are made by hand, or in a worker\u2019s home, and businesses  that both make and sell products at the same location, such as bakeries,  also qualify as manufacturers.", "In its narrowest sense, manufacturing consists of \u201cfactory floor\u201d activities  that contribute directly to the production of goods, such as cutting,  grinding, and assembly. More broadly, manufacturing can include a range  of activities that both precede and follow factory floor activities. Some  activities, such as product design, process improvements, and quality  management, are more specific to the manufacturing enterprise. Other  activities are common to many types of businesses, such as the effective  use of information technology, strategic planning, and administrative  operations.", "Although no standard definition for small manufacturing businesses exists,  two systems that are widely used to classify businesses by type and size  can be used to define small businesses engaged in manufacturing (referred  to in this report as \u201csmall manufacturers\u201d). Specifically, the North  American Industry Classification System (NAICS), which categorizes  businesses according to the principal activity in which they engage, has  three general classifications for businesses engaged in manufacturing. In  addition, the Small Business Administration (SBA) has size standards that  define small businesses on the basis of average annual revenue or number  of employees (typically, 500 or fewer). For this report, we define small  manufacturers as those businesses that have a NAICS manufacturing  classification and meet SBA\u2019s criteria for small businesses.", "Small manufacturers are an important component of the manufacturing  sector. These businesses numbered over 300,000 in 2004 and accounted for  almost 45 percent of all U.S. manufacturing jobs. Many small  manufacturers also export their goods directly or indirectly as suppliers or  contractors for larger companies. In addition, small manufacturers are a  significant source of innovation in the U.S. economy. On average, small  manufacturers produce patents that are more frequently cited as  important contributors to new patents than do large manufacturers.", "Over the past 14 years, studies have reported that small manufacturers  possess many strengths due to their size, such as the ability to respond  quickly to market changes. On the other hand, small manufacturers, like  small businesses in general, lack the staff, resources, and expertise of their  larger competitors and consequently face numerous challenges, including  (1) finding sources of operating capital and investment funds (financial  assistance); (2) bringing new products to market or finding new uses for  existing technology (technology development and deployment assistance);  (3) becoming familiar with new technologies, production techniques, and  business management practices (technology, business, and management  assistance); (4) competing in overseas markets (export assistance); and  (5) obtaining skilled employees (worker training assistance).", "Federal programs offer a wide range of services to help businesses of all  sizes and types address these challenges. For example, federal programs  may offer financial services, such as grants, loans, loan guarantees, or  insurance. These financial services may be for general business purposes,  such as providing working capital or acquiring new equipment, or targeted  to a specific need, such as covering the expenses necessary to export  goods. Programs that offer nonfinancial services may include those that  help businesses acquire the various types of specialized knowledge and  skills they need to begin, operate, and expand their businesses;  commercialize the results of their research projects; export their goods; or  appropriately train their workforce. Federal programs also may provide  financial and nonfinancial services using federal employees or through  agreements with state governments, private entities, and nonprofit  organizations that act on behalf of the federal government.", "Some federal programs are targeted to the needs of businesses of a  specific size, regardless of type, such as the assistance SBA offers to small  businesses. In other cases, federal programs target services to any size  business but of a specific type, such as the assistance that the Farm  Service Agency offers to food processors regardless of their size.  Assistance also may be targeted to businesses adversely affected by trade  policies or local disasters. Federal attention to the needs of manufacturers  increased following the economic recession that began in 2001 when  manufacturing job losses were substantial and recovery in the  manufacturing sector lagged behind other sectors.", "The extent to which agencies track program funding, the number of  businesses they assist, and the type of businesses they assist varies.  Agencies tend to track the financial services they provide in the form of  grants, loans, loan guarantees, letters of credit, or insurance, in terms of  both the value and the number of financial services. In addition, agencies  may track financial data according to the source of their funds. For  example, agencies may track the funds by their annual appropriations, the  obligations to which they dedicate the appropriated funds, or the amount  of dollars they expended in financial assistance. Agencies less often track  the funding for and participation in nonfinancial service programs. Such  services may be offered in single- or multipurpose \u201cservice centers\u201d that  offer assistance on a range of issues, and may involve the specialized  expertise of staff from multiple agencies. Service centers may track the  number of individuals or firms they serve but not the specific type of  service provided to each business. Moreover, agencies may not gather  NAICS codes or other information on the type of businesses they serve.", "Because of these differences, agencies may not track funding and  participation data in a consistent manner.", "Federal agencies also may form interagency groups to coordinate the  operations of their programs and help ensure that resources are used  efficiently. These interagency efforts may focus on a specific program; for  example, multiple federal agencies share responsibility for administering  the Small Business Innovation Research Program and have created an  interagency group to help ensure that the program is being implemented  consistently across all of the agencies. Similarly, agencies may form an  interagency effort to address specific activities, such as ensuring that  small businesses have access to federal procurement opportunities. In  addition, multiple agencies may be tasked by the President to focus their  efforts on a specific topic of relevance to the business community. These  agencies may create interagency groups consisting of representatives from  multiple federal agencies to better coordinate their individual programs  and crosscutting activities. For example, Commerce created an  interagency group to implement its 2003 Manufacturing Initiative, which  called for a comprehensive review of issues affecting manufacturers\u2019  competitiveness and a strategy to foster competition. Interagency groups  that are set up to coordinate task-specific efforts may disband upon  completion of the assigned task."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Few Federal Programs Target Small Businesses Engaged in Manufacturing, but Services Are Available through over 200 Federal Programs That Broadly Support the U.S. Business Sector", "paragraphs": ["Of the 254 federal programs we identified that provide financial or  nonfinancial services or both to support the U.S. business sector, 5  programs provide services specifically to small businesses engaged in  manufacturing, while an additional 15 programs target manufacturers,  regardless of their size.
