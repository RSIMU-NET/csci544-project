GAO's analysis found that BOP inmates with serious mental illness were incarcerated for sex offenses, robbery, and homicide/aggravated assault at about twice the rate of inmates without serious mental illness, and were incarcerated for drug and immigration offenses at about half or less the rate of inmates without serious mental illness. GAO also analyzed available data on three selected states' inmate populations and the most common crimes committed by inmates with serious mental illness varied from state to state due to different law enforcement priorities, definitions of serious mental illness and methods of tracking categories of crime in their respective data systems.", "BOP does not track costs related to incarcerating or providing mental health care services to inmates with serious mental illness, but BOP and selected states generally track these costs for all inmates. BOP does not track costs for inmates with serious mental illness in part because it does not track costs for individual inmates due to resource restrictions and the administrative burden such tracking would require. BOP does track costs associated with mental health care services system-wide and by institution. System-wide, for fiscal year 2016, BOP spent about $72 million on psychology services, $5.6 million on psychotropic drugs and $4.1 million on mental health care in residential reentry centers. The six state departments of corrections each used different methods and provided GAO with estimates for different types of mental health care costs. For example, two states provided average per-inmate costs of incarceration for mental health treatment units where some inmates with serious mental illness are treated; however, these included costs for inmates without serious mental illness housed in those units.", "DOJ, Department of Health and Human Service's Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), and criminal justice and mental health experts have developed a framework to reduce recidivism among adults with mental illness. The framework calls for correctional agencies to assess individuals' recidivism risk and substance abuse and mental health needs and target treatment to those with the highest risk of reoffending. To help implement this framework, SAMHSA, in collaboration with DOJ and other experts, developed guidance for mental health, correctional, and community stakeholders on (1) assessing risk and clinical needs, (2) planning treatment in custody and upon reentry based on risks and needs, (3) identifying post-release services, and (4) coordinating with community-based providers to avoid gaps in care. BOP and the six states also identified strategies for reducing recidivism consistent with this guidance, such as memoranda of understanding between correctional and mental health agencies to coordinate care.

Our search identified about 200  publications. We used a systematic process to conduct the review, which  appendix II describes in more detail. We ultimately identified 14 studies  that (1) assessed correctional institution or reentry programs for offenders  with mental illness implemented in the United States, (2) contained  quantitative analyses of the effect of a program on recidivism, and (3)  used sufficiently sound methodologies for conducting such analyses.", "The studies examined different kinds of recidivism outcomes (e.g., re- arrest, re-incarceration, reconviction) and one study often examined more  than one recidivism outcome. We categorize the findings for each study  as follows:", "Statistically significant reduction in recidivism: the study reported  that one or more outcome measures indicated a statistically significant  reduction in recidivism among program participants; the study may  also have one or more recidivism outcome measures that were not  statistically significant.", "Statistically significant increase in recidivism: the study reported  that one or more outcome measures indicated a statistically significant  increase in recidivism among program participants; the study may  also have one or more recidivism outcome measures that were not  statistically significant.", "No statistically significant effect on recidivism: the study reported  only outcomes indicating no statistically significant effect on recidivism  among program participants.", "The statistical significance finding categories are based on the effect of  the program as a whole and do not indicate if or how all individual  elements of the programs impacted recidivism. For additional information  on recidivism findings, see appendices V and VI. See appendix VII for a  bibliography of the studies.", "The results of the literature review provide insights into factors that can  affect recidivism among individuals with mental illness; however, the  following considerations should be taken into account: (1) the type of  mental illness of program participants varied within and across programs  making it difficult to generalize results to individuals with all types of  mental illness; (2) the studies may not provide a full description of the  programs; (3) not all participants may have used available program  services; (4) studies assessed the programs as a whole and did not  determine to what extent different elements of the programs impacted  recidivism; and (5) some studies used designs which cannot control for all  unobserved factors that could affect the recidivism results.", "Nine of the 14 studies we reviewed found statistically significant  reductions in recidivism. The studies that found statistically significant  reductions generally involved programs that offered multiple support  services, as shown in figure 6. Providing mental health and substance  abuse treatment (8 of 9 studies), case management (5 of 9 studies),  release planning (5 of 9 studies), housing (6 of 9 studies) and  employment assistance (4 of 9 studies) were the most common services  across the programs where studies we reviewed found statistically  significant reductions in recidivism. In addition, more than half of the  programs that resulted in statistically significant reductions in recidivism  were coordinated with multidisciplinary stakeholders, such as mental  health providers, correctional officials, substance use specialists, social  workers, and peer support specialists (7 of 9 studies), and community  corrections agencies, such as probation or parole offices (6 of 9 studies).  However, other studies found that programs that offered multiple support  services did not reduce recidivism, suggesting that other factors may also  affect recidivism. Such factors may include the extent to which  participants used services, as well as other unique programmatic factors,  such as addressing criminogenic risk or criminal thinking. We further  discuss examples of programs that did and did not reduce recidivism  below.", "For example, study 9 examined Washington\u2019s Dangerously Mentally Ill  Program, in which a multidisciplinary committee determines which  offenders meet the program criteria of having a mental illness and are at  high risk of being dangerous to themselves or others six months prior to  their release from prison. Members of the committee include  representatives from the Department of Social and Health Services,  Department of Corrections, law enforcement, and community mental  health and substance abuse treatment agencies. Offenders designated  for participation are immediately assigned a community mental health  treatment provider and receive special transition planning prior to their  release from prison. After release, and for up to five years, a variety of  services are available to participants based on assessed needs. Services  may include mental health and substance abuse treatment, housing and  medical assistance, training, and other support services. Researchers  found that program participants were about 42 percent less likely to be  reconvicted of a new felony than similar offenders in the comparison  group four years after release (recidivism rates were 28 percent and 48  percent, respectively).", "Two other studies (numbers 3 and 6) evaluated Colorado\u2019s Modified  Therapeutic Community, a residential program that was provided both as  a 12-month prison program and 6-month reentry program after release  from prison for offenders with co-occurring mental illness and substance  use disorders. Participants may have participated in only the prison  program, only the reentry program, or both. Both programs use a  cognitive-behavioral curriculum designed to help participants recognize  and respond to the interrelationship of substance abuse, mental illness,  and criminality and to use strategies for symptom management. The  reentry program was coordinated with the community corrections agency,  which provided the residential facility and monitored medication and  compliance with parole terms for both participants and the comparison  group. The reentry program also assisted with housing placement and  employment. Researchers found that both the prison program and the  reentry program resulted in statistically significant reductions in recidivism  among participants. Specifically, the studies found that at 12 months post- release, prison program participants had a 9 percent reincarceration rate  versus a 33 percent rate for the comparison group that did not participate  in either program; and reentry program participants had a 19 percent  reincarceration rate versus 38 percent for the comparison group. Further,  researchers found that those who participated in both the prison and  reentry program experienced the greatest reductions in recidivism, with a  reincarceration rate of 5 percent versus a rate of 33 percent for the  comparison group that did not participate in either program 12 months  after release from prison.", "Studies that did not find a reduction in recidivism also provide insights on  factors that may affect recidivism. For example, study 10 examined a  Washington program to help enroll inmates with severe mental illness in  Medicaid prior to their release from prison and found that jail and prison  stays were higher among program participants than non-participants. The  researchers hypothesized that receiving mental health treatment may  have led to more interaction with authorities, putting participants at a  greater risk of being caught violating the terms of their parole than non- participants. There was some evidence to support this: they found that  most of the difference in prison days between participants and non- participants was the result of noncompliance with conditions of parole  (technical violations) rather than the commission of new crimes. Further,  the researchers conclude that Medicaid benefits alone are not enough to  reduce arrests or keep people with severe mental illness out of jail or  prison.", "In addition, study 11 examined Minnesota\u2019s release planning services for  inmates with serious and persistent mental illness, which provided some  of the same types of services as the programs that did reduce recidivism.  For example, while incarcerated, inmates were provided pre-release  planning to address vocational, housing, chemical dependency,  psychiatric, disability, medical, medication, and transportation needs.  However, this program did not result in any significant reduction in  recidivism. The researchers conclude that including programming to  target criminogenic risks and providing a continuum of care from the  institution to the community, instead of only providing services in the  institution, may make the program more effective at reducing recidivism."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to DOJ and HHS for review and  comment.

We selected six state departments of  corrections (California, New York, Ohio, Texas, Virginia, and Washington)  based upon variation in the rate of incarcerated adults per capita to obtain  a mix of states with high, medium, and low rates, specialist  recommendations on data quality and quality of programs for inmates  with serious mental illness, and variation in geography. We contacted  officials from SAMHSA and the National Institute of Mental Health and  representatives from correctional accreditation organizations, as well as  subject matter specialists from Pew Charitable Trusts and the Treatment  Advocacy Center that we identified through previous work and asked for  their recommendations of states that, in their view, had reliable data  sources on the number of incarcerated individuals with serious mental  illness and the costs of providing mental health services, as well as  noteworthy programming for inmates with serious mental illness. The  results from these six states are not generalizable, but provide insights.  For purposes of this review, we based our work on the definition(s) of  serious mental illness that are provided by each of the selected federal  agencies and selected states\u2019 departments of corrections. We analyzed  policies and guidance at BOP and the departments of corrections in  selected states to determine how, if at all, the agencies define serious  mental illness and the processes used to identify incarcerated inmates  with serious mental illness. To determine the population of inmates with  serious mental illness for the purposes of our work, BOP operationalized  its definition of serious mental illness using six criteria, covering the  required degree of mental health care, mental illness diagnoses,   and suicide risk. BOP defined \u201cserious mental illness\u201d in accordance with  the agency\u2019s program statement, BOP Program Statement 5310.16,  Treatment and Care of Inmates with Mental Illness, May 1, 2014. On  August 15, 2017, in a memorandum for the Comptroller General of the  United States from the Acting Director of BOP, BOP defined \u201cserious  mental illness\u201d for purposes of section 14016 of the 21st Century Cures  Act. BOP officials indicated that BOP\u2019s program statement and the six  criteria to identify the population of inmates with serious mental illness  who were incarcerated in fiscal years 2016 and 2017 would coincide with  the definition for \u201cserious mental illness\u201d provided in the memorandum for  the Comptroller General of the United States for purposes of the 21st  Century Cures Act and identify an identical set of BOP inmates with  \u201cserious mental illness\u201d for fiscal years 2016 and 2017. BOP applied  these criteria to inmate information in its SENTRY, Bureau Electronic  Medical Record (BEMR), and Psychology Data System (PDS) data  systems to identify inmates with serious mental illness. To assess the  reliability of the these data, we performed electronic data testing for  obvious errors in accuracy and completeness, and interviewed agency officials knowledgeable about these systems to determine the processes  in place to ensure the integrity of the data.

With  regard to the study\u2019s relevance, we included studies that evaluated: a program for individuals with mental illness incarcerated in prison or  jail or provided directly upon release from prison or jail; or a program for individuals with mental illness that is not provided in a  prison, jail, or directly upon release from prison or jail (e.g., in a  psychiatric hospital or in the community after a psychiatric  hospitalization), but is hypothesized to impact criminal justice  involvement and could potentially be applied in a correctional setting.", "With regard to methodological rigor, two GAO methodologists used  generally accepted social science standards to assess the design and  analytic strategy of each study to ensure analyses were sufficiently sound  to support the results and conclusions.
