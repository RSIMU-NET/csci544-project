The RECA Amendments of 2000 required that GAO report to the Congress on the Department of Justice's administration of RECA not later than 18 months after the enactment of the amendments and every 18 months thereafter. GAO originally reported on the status of the program in September 2001. The objectives of this report are to update information on claims processing, payments from the Trust Fund, and administrative expenses."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Since the enactment of the RECA Amendments of 2000, which expanded eligibility for benefits, the RECA program has experienced a significant increase in the number of claims filed. Claims also are taking longer to process, and the number of pending claims has grown sharply. Since we last reported in September 2001, claims have increased from 7,819 to 14,987. Pending claims have increased 300 percent, from 653 to 2,654. About 3,200 new claims are anticipated in fiscal year 2003. In addition, the average time to process claims increased for each category of claimant. Given these circumstances, current funding for the RECA program to pay claims may be inadequate to meet projected needs. In fiscal year 2002, RECA was appropriated funds to cover a 10-year period--fiscal years 2002 through 2011 up to a specified amount per year--totaling $655 million. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) estimate that funding levels appropriated to the Trust Fund are insufficient to meet the projected claims. As a result, claims may be delayed, particularly through 2007. Since 1993, funding for DOJ administration of the program has been provided in a separate appropriation account for Radiation Exposure Compensation administrative expenses. There has been upward pressure on the program's administrative costs in recent years. For fiscal years 2001 and 2002, the RECA program may have exceeded its budget authority for administrative expenses. According to a program budget official, the RECA program spent about $100,000 in fiscal year 2001 and about $1 million for fiscal year 2002 in administrative expenses over the $1.996 million appropriated to the Radiation Exposure Compensation administrative expenses account in those fiscal years."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["From 1945 through 1962, the United States conducted a series of  aboveground atomic weapons tests as it built up its Cold War nuclear  arsenal.

On October 15, 1990, in  order to establish a procedure to make partial restitution to these victims  for their suffering associated with the radiation exposure, the Radiation  Exposure Compensation Act (RECA) was enacted. RECA provided that  the Attorney General be responsible for processing and adjudicating  claims under the act. The Department of Justice (DOJ) established the  Radiation Exposure Compensation Program (RECP) within its Civil  Division to administer its responsibilities under the act.

In  addition to creating eligibility criteria for compensation, RECA created a  Trust Fund to pay claims. The Attorney General is responsible for  reviewing applications to determine whether applicants qualify for  compensation and establishing procedures for paying claims. To discharge  these two responsibilities, the Attorney General has issued implementing  regulations.", "The regulations established RECP within DOJ\u2019s Civil Division and charged  it with administering claims adjudication and compensation under the act.  To file for compensation, the claimant or eligible surviving beneficiary,  either acting on his or her own behalf or represented by counsel, submits  the appropriate claim forms along with corroborating documentation to  RECP, whose claims examiners and legal staff review and adjudicate the  claims. If the claim is approved, a letter is sent notifying the person of the  approval and enclosing an \u201cacceptance of payment\u201d form for the claimant  to return to RECP. According to program officials, upon receipt of a  signed acceptance of payment form, DOJ authorizes the Treasury  Department to make payment from the Trust Fund. The RECA  Amendments of 2000 require that the Attorney General pay claims within   6 weeks of approval. If the victim is deceased, compensation may be  awarded to the victim\u2019s eligible survivors (e.g., the victim\u2019s spouse or  children). Appendix III shows RECP\u2019s claims adjudication process,  including the procedures for refiling and administratively appealing denied  claims.", "If a RECP claim does not satisfy the eligibility criteria, the claimant is  notified of the deficiency in writing. The claimant is allowed 60 days in  which to provide documentation correcting the deficiency. At the  expiration of the 60-day period, if the claim remains deficient, DOJ issues a  final denial decision explaining the reasons for the denial, and a copy is  sent to the claimant. Claimants may refile a claim with new information to  RECP up to two more times.", "DOJ\u2019s decision denying the claim may be appealed administratively to a  DOJ Appeals Officer, who can affirm or reverse the original decision or  remand the claim back to RECP for further action. Claimants who are  denied may also seek judicial review in a U.S. district court. Under DOJ  implementing regulations, claimants must first exhaust their  administrative remedies within DOJ prior to seeking judicial review.  Program officials said that from program inception in 1992 through  September 30, 2002, only eight claims denied by the RECP have been  brought to district court.", "The RECA Amendments of 2000 broadened the scope of eligibility for  benefits coverage, including increasing the geographical areas covered,  allowing more individuals to qualify, and establishing a prompt payment  period.

This law included several  provisions that further amended RECA. The amendments affect eligibility  criteria and revise claims adjudication procedures. These provisions were  enacted near the end of our review, and we did not assess their potential  impact on the program. Some of the major changes include  re-insertion of a Downwinder area that was inadvertently eliminated  when RECA was amended in July 2000;  requiring that lung cancer must, like other compensable cancers, be  \u201cprimary\u201d (i.e., originate in the specified organ or tissue);    allowing uranium miners to qualify by meeting either the 40 Working  Level Months (WLM) exposure standard or the 1-year duration of  employment standard; and    striking the requirement that, in cases where the claimant is living, a  claimant with lung cancer must submit the medical documentation  required for proof of a \u201cnon-malignant respiratory disease.\u201d", "Appendix II provides a more comprehensive summary of the key  provisions of RECA by claimant category.", "In addition to RECP, other programs are authorized to provide  compensation to persons who have presumably become ill as a result of  working for the federal government in producing or testing nuclear  weapons.

For example, rather than denying a claim  for a lack of documentation, program officials said that they allow  claimants additional time to provide corroborating documentation. In  many cases, claimants in the uranium industry were employed as millers,  miners, and ore transporters over the course of their career.

RECP said that in these instances, staff would conduct additional research  on behalf of the claimant or allow the claimant more time to provide the  proof necessary to meet the eligibility criteria. In addition to the increase  in the volume of claims, program officials said that the adjudication of the  newly added claimant categories (uranium millers and ore transporters)  presented challenges in terms of deciding the types of employment  records that existed and which records should be required and, therefore,  required additional processing time in some instances.
