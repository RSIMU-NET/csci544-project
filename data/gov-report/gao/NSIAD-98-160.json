In December 1996, NATO authorized a new mission and renamed the coalition the Stabilization Force (SFOR). That mission was scheduled to end in June 1998 but has since been extended indefinitely. In voting to continue the mission, the North Atlantic Council retained the name SFOR. The Council stated that the extent of support over time will be adapted to developments in the political and security situation and to progress in the implementation of the civilian elements of the accords. Force levels will be reviewed at regular intervals. The United States has been a major force provider to the mission, as shown in table 1.", "The SFOR level will likely remain at 31,000, but the United States is seeking to reduce its troop commitment in Bosnia to 6,900. The United States plans to continue basing about 3,400 troops in neighboring countries.", "If the President determines that it is necessary to augment the active forces for an operational mission, he may use PSRC authority, which allows for the activation of up to 200,000 reservists at any one time, with each reservist limited to no more than 270 days of involuntary service.

Most of the Army reservists were involuntarily called to active duty under PSRC, whereas most Air Force reservists volunteered to participate in the Bosnia mission. Reserve units have participated because some required support capabilities reside primarily or solely in the reserves. For example, most of the Army\u2019s movement control teams, civil affairs units, and fire fighter detachments are in the reserves. Of the 36 civil affairs units in the Army, only 1 is in the active force. The remainder are in the Army reserve. Reserve units also have been used to reduce the high level of activity of some active forces. For example, the Army uses reserve military police to relieve the high personnel tempo of active-duty military police units, and the Air Force uses reserve aircrews to relieve the high personnel tempo of its active-duty aircrews."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Army Personnel Needed to Be Added to Forces/Units Deploying to Bosnia", "paragraphs": ["Augmentation from reserve forces and U.S.-based active forces was required because USAREUR did not possess all the personnel and capabilities the mission needs.

Further, 8 to 10 percent of these units\u2019 personnel were not deployable for a variety of reasons. To bring these units to at least 92 percent of required strength, personnel had to be shifted from other USAREUR units and from U.S. Army Forces Command (FORSCOM) units, a process known as cross-leveling.", "Throughout the Bosnia mission, individuals have been needed to augment headquarters staffs at USAREUR, U.S. European Command, the American contingent of various NATO command elements such as the SFOR Headquarters in Saravejo, and actual units.

According to FORSCOM and USAREUR officials, active units have employed split-based operations. Split-based operations occur when only parts of units are deployed and the elements left behind must continue to perform their missions at the home station. For example, as of January 1998, elements of the First Armor Division\u2019s headquarters, military intelligence, signal, artillery, and support command were deployed to Bosnia, while the rest of the division, including its combat brigades, did not deploy. Split-basing has been a strain on USAREUR units. For example, during SFOR, USAREUR reported to the Department of the Army through its Status of Resources and Training System, which is used to measure readiness, that split-basing had a negative impact on the readiness of several of its units because of reduced personnel, equipment levels, or a combination of both factors at home station.", "For reserve units, the Army also has engaged in split-based operations. In many instances, the Army extracted elements of existing units and formed them into what is known as derivative units. It has been staffing derivative units with individuals drawn from the original unit and other Selected Reserve units. According to its mobilization data, the Army formed over 700 derivative units for the Bosnia mission since December 1995. Examples of derivative units that have been mobilized for Bosnia include the target acquisition radar elements of National Guard divisions, elements of Army Reserve garrison support units, and platoons from postal companies. According to a FORSCOM operations official, extracting these elements often affects the ability of the parent unit to conduct its normal peacetime activities, such as training, much in the same way that it has affected split-based active units. In responding to a draft of this report, the Army stated that a positive effect of split-based operations is that the redeploying soldiers can bring better developed or newly acquired skills to the unit.", "The Army has also created derivative units, such as various mobilization support detachments, that are not elements of existing units. These detachments are ad hoc units created for the sole purpose of activating individuals with assorted capabilities that are needed to meet miscellaneous individual requirements. According to an Army Reserve Personnel Center official, this was done because PSRC authority did not allow for the call-up of individuals unless they were members of a unit in the Selected Reserve. The requirements have been met in part by members who initially belonged to the Individual Ready Reserve but volunteered to join the Selected Reserve temporarily so that they could be subject to PSRC.", "Of the previously mentioned 1,613 reservists provided by the Army Reserve Personnel Center and the U.S. Army Reserve Command, 1,068 were reservists from the Individual Ready Reserve who transferred to the Selected Reserve, including 551 who were placed into derivative units."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Follow-on Force Planning Underway", "paragraphs": ["The Army has conducted multiple force rotations for varying lengths of time to support the Bosnia mission.

In the meantime, USAREUR is making plans for a follow-on force. It intends to provide personnel for the initial follow-on force according to the current SFOR organization and authorized troop level of 8,500 troops in Bosnia. If the United States succeeds in its effort to have other troop-contributing nations provide more troops, the U.S. force level in Bosnia could drop to 6,900. A smaller force, according to USAREUR and FORSCOM officials, would most likely have fewer combat support and combat service support units. For example, one of the potential reductions involves having only one aviation brigade\u2014a combat support unit\u2014responsible for supporting the forces in Bosnia and the SFOR Commander\u2019s reserve force. Additional force reductions will come from units such as the Army Center for Lessons Learned and military history units.", "With the decision to extend the Bosnia mission indefinitely, the Army canceled its June 1998 troop withdrawal and extended its plans for providing personnel beyond June. A USAREUR document on providing future forces specifies that the initial follow-on force deployment will be from June 1998 through October 1998. The Department of the Army has assigned USAREUR responsibility for providing the Army portion of this force. USAREUR has developed a strategy and identified those specific requirements that it can fill, which is most of the initial follow-on force requirements. According to USAREUR and FORSCOM officials, FORSCOM will provide most of the requirements that cannot be met by USAREUR units through October 1998.", "The Army plans for FORSCOM to provide most of the forces for the next two follow-on rotations\u2014one in October 1998 and the other in April 1999. This decision was made to relieve USAREUR of the high operating and personnel tempo it has experienced since the Bosnia mission began and to allow it to focus on training for its wartime mission. According to USAREUR officials, FORSCOM\u2019s providing the bulk of the forces for the Bosnia mission for a year will allow USAREUR to recover from the adverse impacts of almost 3 years continuous deployment to Bosnia. For example, in June 1995, 6 months before the first deployment to Bosnia, 46 percent of USAREUR\u2019s units achieved the readiness rating expected of these units; by August 1997, that percentage had dropped to 30 percent as a result of personnel, equipment, and training required for wartime missions being diverted to peacekeeping operations.", "The Air Force has rotated aircraft, aircrews, and ground support personnel to support the Bosnia mission.

Although the vast majority of the ground-based combat support and aviation-related requirements can be filled, about a dozen unit capabilities will require special attention in the future because the capabilities are primarily in the reserves and many of these capabilities have already been mobilized and deployed in support of the operation. Requirements for these capabilities have totaled several hundred persons per rotation. Solutions have been developed for providing some of these capabilities and are being sought for the others.", "FORSCOM recently identified 12 unit types that it may have difficulty providing from its forces in future rotations primarily because most of these types of units are predominately or exclusively in the reserves and have already been called up and participated in the Bosnia mission. Each succeeding call-up has reduced the available pool of members and units available for future rotations. Table 2 lists the number of these units in the Army and their distribution between the active and reserve components. Table 3 provides details on the 12 unit types, including the number of units needed per rotation, the number of reserve units remaining, and additional information on the active units. According to an Army operations official, other Army commands, such as the U.S. Army Pacific and Eighth U.S. Army, have some of the 12 unit types that FORSCOM has identified as difficult to fill. However, units assigned to those commands generally would not be able to meet Bosnia mission requirements because many of the units would be committed to missions in their command\u2019s primary area of responsibility.", "Three of the 12 unit types\u2014Broadcast Public Affairs, Replacement Headquarters, and Rear Tactical Operations Center\u2014do not exist in the active force. The active Army does maintain force structure for the nine remaining unit types, but two have already deployed to Bosnia and the availability of others may be limited. For example, a FORSCOM official told us that each Army division\u2019s artillery has a target acquisition battery or detachment, but deploying the target acquisition element independently would severely degrade the readiness of the remaining division. The active centralized movement control teams and the military history detachment have already deployed to Bosnia at least once, and FORSCOM would prefer to not deploy them again. The active movement control battalion headquarters, air terminal movement control team, mobile public affairs detachment, engineering fire fighter detachment, and medical distribution units have not been deployed to Bosnia.", "The availability of the Reserve Component to meet some of the future Bosnia mission requirements at current force levels is limited to some extent. According to FORSCOM, all Reserve Component Broadcast Public Affairs, Replacement Headquarters, Target Acquisition, Movement Control Headquarters, and some movement control teams already have been called up under PSRC. Only the Rear Tactical Operations Center, Military History and Medical Distribution missions can currently be met from existing reserve force structure. Moreover, FORSCOM told us that some of the remaining Reserve Component Mobile Public Affairs, Engineering Fire Fighters, and Medical Distribution units currently cannot meet the criteria for deployment. According to FORSCOM, these units could be used, but, depending on the unit, would require from 1 month to 12 months of notice before deployment to receive personnel, equipment, training, or a combination of these sufficient to meet the deployment criteria.", "FORSCOM requested the U.S. Atlantic Command, which can draw forces from all services in the continental United States, to assess whether other services can provide these capabilities. Solutions were identified for two of these areas for the next rotation. An air movement control unit requirement will be met by an ad hoc Marine Corps unit, and the Broadcast Public Affairs unit requirement will be met by an ad hoc unit that was formed by pooling individuals from the military services because no one unit was available in any service. According to FORSCOM and USAREUR, the use of ad hoc units will increase as the Army\u2019s ability to provide specific capabilites (active or reserve) decreases.", "As of April 1998, the U.S. Atlantic Command was developing solutions for the other areas. If the Atlantic Command is unable to find other services to meet these requirements, other solutions will be considered. These include using more ad hoc units, contracting civilians to perform the function, and seeking to have other NATO partners assume some of these responsibilities. For example, according to USAREUR, engineering fire fighter requirements will be contracted out.", "In addition to FORSCOM\u2019s identification of types of units that will be difficult to fill, the U.S. Army Special Operations Command has also identified certain components of its civil affairs and psychological operations capabilities that may be difficult to fill.

Initially the mission was handled by volunteers on a rotating basis from air traffic control units, but, beginning in June 1996, PSRC was used to call up Guard personnel for between 120 days and 179 days to perform this function. All Guard air traffic control units already have been activated under the Bosnia PSRC. In October 1997, the Air National Guard informed the active Air Force that it would be unable to solely meet these requirements beyond July 1, 1998, and asked to have the active Air Force provide the personnel to meet the requirement.", "Active and reserve Air Force officials have been seeking short- and long-term solutions to air traffic control requirements for the extended mission.

In each instance, an executive order stated the need for activating the Selected Reserve and defined the mission. As implemented in the past, the mission statements were broad in scope. Consistent with that practice, the scope of the Bosnia PSRC mission is defined in Executive Order 12982 as the \u201cconduct of operations in and around former Yugoslavia.\u201d", "The PSRC statute allows the Secretary of Defense to prescribe policies and procedures concerning such matters as the number and types of Selected Reserve units to be activated, the timing of the calls-ups, the number of reservists to be activated, and the time required for each reservist to remain on active duty. These matters are discussed in DOD  Directive 1235.10, July 1, 1995. In addition, an end date for the use of PSRC authority may be set by the Secretary of Defense. The end date for the Bosnia PSRC was first set at May 1997, then extended to August 1998, and, as of February 1998, the end date was extended indefinitely. The Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Reserve Affairs has stated that the current policy is that the Department of Defense will not request that the President invoke PSRC authority a second time for Bosnia to recall reservists who already have served 270 days.", "In November 1997, Congress enlarged the reserve components available for PSRC call-up. Section 511 of Public Law 105-85 directed the Secretary to create a PSRC mobilization category for members of the Individual Ready Reserves.

These steps have met the mission\u2019s needs with varying impacts on parent units that have provided personnel and have required the Army to operate in a fashion different from the way in which it organizes its forces, which is as entire units to fight a major theater war. The Army also has relied on the reserves both to provide support capabilities that reside primarily or solely in the reserve component and to reduce the high level of activity of some active forces. The Air Force has required a smaller number of forces, and the nature of the Air Force\u2019s responsibilities has allowed for extensive use of reserve and guard volunteers.", "The recent decision to extend the Bosnia mission will require rotating military forces for the foreseeable future. While formal guidance has not been finalized regarding mission needs, the Army is planning for follow-on forces through late 1999. The first follow-on force is expected to deploy in June 1998 to relieve the forces that are currently deployed. Although the vast majority of the types of capabilities needed do not represent challenges in providing personnel, a handful do, principally in the Army. These challenges exist because in a few instances all the needed capability is in the reserves and has already been involuntarily called up under the current PSRC and in other instances because there is limited capability in the active force structure or because the active capability is vital to its parent unit. For these capabilities, the Army\u2019s force structure does not match the needs of a mission of the duration and with the continuing requirements of the one in Bosnia. Solutions are being developed to meet these challenges. These challenges may exist as long as the mission continues at its current size and with its current tasks.", "The President has statutory authority to involuntarily activate units and members of the Selected Reserve.
