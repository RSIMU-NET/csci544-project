The DMP was originally designed to enable DEA to monitor the price and purity of retail- level heroin sold in the United States; it now also provides for the purchase of heroin for signature analysis. In the DMP, DEA provides funding for quarterly purchases by DEA field divisions, that may utilize cooperating sources to make retail-level purchases of heroin. Ten purchases are to be made in 22 of the 23 metropolitan areas, each quarter; in New York City, 20 purchases are to be made in each quarter.", "DEA guidelines provide that a certain number of DMP purchases be made each quarter, throughout the 3 months of each quarter, and in various locations in the metropolitan areas.

In addition, comparisons should not be made between the HSP data and DMP data because the HSP data reflect law enforcement investigative priorities and techniques, in terms of where and how seizures are made, as well as the difficulties associated with the various concealment techniques used by smugglers. In addition, large quantity seizures of heroin from one geographic source area may boost that geographic source area\u2019s representation in the HSP data.

DEA cited the emergence of heroin from South America as an example of how the HSP and DMP geographic source data have been used in law enforcement intelligence and management. Southeast Asian heroin dominated the market on the East Coast until 1991; Southwest Asian heroin was also readily available. In 1991, a high- purity heroin entered the eastern U.S. market and was initially identified by DEA as high-purity but atypical Southwest Asian heroin. Intelligence reports indicated that heroin was entering the United States from South America. Also, reportedly Southwest Asian heroin producers had taught Colombians their methods of processing opium into heroin. DEA\u2019s subsequent determination of a signature unique to South America confirmed this intelligence and, as a result, South America was identified as a new supplier of heroin into the United States.", "Officials said that the data are also used to monitor the success of various initiatives.

However, our analysis showed that DEA did not obtain a large proportion of the heroin seized by Customs, the seized heroin that was analyzed was not obtained from a random probability sample, and that the reporting methodology did not include procedures to adjust for the probability of exhibits being selected for the sample. If a snapshot of wholesale heroin geographic source is based on HSP data, then this snapshot may be misleading because accurate information about seized heroin cannot be developed from the flawed sample.", "Our analysis also showed that problems with sampling and statistical analysis in the DMP might lead to misleading information about the geographic source of heroin in the retail market also. DMP data are to be collected from random undercover purchases made in select metropolitan areas. However, our analysis of DMP data showed that these undercover purchases were not spread randomly over the year, as provided by DEA guidelines, but instead were concentrated in certain time periods of the quarter. Therefore, if the retail market characteristics vary over time or vary between midweek and weekend, the data could produce results that would be different from those that might have been obtained had these guidelines been followed. Furthermore, without knowledge of the size of the retail markets in the sampled metropolitan areas there are difficulties in combining DMP results across those metropolitan areas.", "The quality/validity of data derived from these two programs could be improved by more careful sampling, adhering to existing DEA guidelines, and enhancing data analysis."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["To help improve the HSP and DMP data on the geographic source of heroin, we recommend that the attorney general direct the administrator of DEA to   ensure that the HSP data are based on a probability sample so that all HSP exhibits have a known chance of selection, revise the HSP methodology for reporting testing results to include procedures to adjust for the probability of exhibits being selected for the test sample, take action to ensure that DMP purchases are made according to DEA guidelines, and study the utilization of alternative data sources for an estimate of the total number of retail heroin purchases in an area that could allow the DMP data to be combined across metropolitan areas.", "To enhance the usefulness of HSP data, we recommend that the attorney general and the secretary of the treasury direct the administrator of DEA and commissioner of Customs, respectively, to enter into discussions to determine whether additional seized heroin should be forwarded to DEA by Customs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We requested comments on a draft of this report from DEA, Customs, and ONDCP.

DEA said that the HSP should remain a program whose data are based solely on the results of signature analysis.  This seems to imply that the application of statistical analysis to signature testing results would yield unscientific data.  We disagree.  Without the use of data based on a probability sample, it is impossible to know how to interpret the HSP data.  In addition, DEA seems to imply that we want the signature of untested exhibits to be imputed based on the results of actual analyses of tested exhibits.  This is incorrect.  We recommended the use of a probability sample and standard weighting procedures that would allow the estimation of the geographic source of all seized heroin.  DEA also said that it should implement a stratified sample similar to the one we proposed to ensure that a significant portion of the total weight of heroin seized by DEA is sampled.  However, DEA did not want to use the stratified sample to produce estimates with the resulting data.  We believe that by implementing a stratified probability sample, DEA could produce estimates of the seized heroin, which would improve the overall data.", "Furthermore, DEA suggested expanding the number of DEA and Customs exhibits submitted for analysis.  However, this method would increase reliability only if a probability sample were used.  Expanding the number of exhibits submitted without using a probability sample limits the interpretation of the data to the tested exhibits alone.

We provided this straightforward model only as an example and strongly endorse any attempt DEA might make to enhance the suggested model.

The procedure for selecting the POE exhibit sample resulted in the selection of heavier exhibits. DEA laboratory personnel were responsible for identifying POE sample exhibits for testing and, according to DEA, selected exhibits generally tended to be the heaviest exhibit from a case. For example, if a POE seizure resulted in 3 exhibits weighing 10 gram, 15 grams, and 50 grams, it was likely that the 50-gram exhibit was tested. While not conclusive, the DEA exhibit sample also contained heavier than expected exhibits, suggesting that the heavier exhibits may generally have been selected for testing. Although only about 13 percent of the DEA exhibits were sampled in 1999, these sampled exhibits accounted for about 45 percent of the total weight of seized wholesale heroin sent to DEA for testing.2.  Exhibits did not have a known chance of selection because it appears that DEA did not consistently follow its policy for selecting exhibits, for either the POE or the DEA exhibit samples. The policy requires that, except for special request exhibits, no more than one exhibit per case be chosen. However, based on our review of 1999 and 2000 HSP data, this policy was apparently not implemented consistently. There were multiple exhibits for individual cases in the HSP sample for both 1999 and 2000.

For example, if exhibits are selected manually, with the use of a list of random numbers, the exhibits should first be numbered sequentially, before the random number list is used to identify sample exhibits;   after identifying the sample exhibits, DEA should ensure that sufficient information is maintained to identify each exhibit, indicate whether the exhibit was selected for the sample, and whether it was sent for signature analysis testing; and if an exhibit, that is ineligible for testing due to its low weight, were selected by the sampling procedure, it should be recorded as \u201cinsufficient for signature analysis.\u201d"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Revision of Current Methodology to Include Procedures to Adjust for the Probability of Exhibits Being Selected for the Test Sample", "paragraphs": ["Several changes to DEA\u2019s methodology are possible that would include procedures to adjust for the probability of exhibits being selected for the test sample. For example, DEA could use statistical weights for the sample design to produce estimates about the geographic source of all seized wholesale heroin sent to DEA for testing. These statistical weights would be determined by calculating a value that is the inverse of an exhibit\u2019s chance of selection. For example, referring to the example following table 5, all exhibits in stratum 1 would be selected and 5 percent of exhibits in stratum 3 would be selected. Stratum 1 sample exhibits would get a weighting factor of 1/1=1 and stratum 3 sample exhibits would get a weighting factor of 1/.05 = 20.", "DEA could also use supplemental data to improve the estimates. DEA could use data on the total weight of seized heroin sent to DEA for testing, by regional laboratory. This same quantity could be estimated from the HSP sample. The ratio of these two quantities could then be computed and used as a refinement to the statistical weights described above. For example, if one DEA regional laboratory received a total of 210 kg of heroin, and the sample estimate of heroin for that regional laboratory was 200 kg, then the final statistical weight for sample data from that regional laboratory would be the initial statistical weight multiplied by 210/200=1.05. Using the weighting factor for stratum 3 (from above), the final statistical weight for stratum 3 sample exhibits selected from that laboratory would be 20 x 1.05=21.", "Estimates of the percentage of seized heroin by geographic source area would then be computed as follows:   Compute the total weighted sum of heroin in grams for each of six categories. The weighted sum would use the final statistical weighting factors described earlier. This would produce six sums, H1, \u2026, H6;   Compute the total over all six categories, H = H1 + \u2026 + H6;   The ratio of each category to the total (converted to percentages) would then yield estimates of the percentages of seized wholesale heroin, sent to DEA for testing, by geographic region. For example, the percentage from geographic region i would be pi = 100(Hi / H)."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Domestic Monitor Program", "paragraphs": ["DEA produced tables using the Domestic Monitor Program (DMP) data.

For example, in the first quarter there were less than 5 purchases made in 3 of the metropolitan areas. Our analysis also showed that a disproportionate number of DMP purchases occurred in a certain month of a quarter, and on certain days of the week. If the purchases were spread randomly throughout each quarter, approximately a third of the purchases would be expected each month, and approximately one seventh of the purchases would be expected each day of the week.  However, based on our analysis of the DMP data, the purchase dates were not random by day of the week or by month of quarter.", "As a result, it is unlikely that the DMP data for 1999 were derived from a sample in which the days in each quarter selected for purchases were chosen with a known, equal probability of selection. In addition, assuming that the characteristics of retail heroin might change over time, biases may have been introduced due to oversampling in certain time periods within the quarter. For example, if the geographic source of heroin supplied to one location changed between the beginning and the end of a quarter, making most of the purchases during one part of the quarter would not reflect the geographic source of the heroin over the entire quarter."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DEA Does Not Take into Consideration the Size of the Heroin Markets", "paragraphs": ["The total number of retail sales in each metropolitan area in each quarter is not known.
