Multi-domain operations present adversaries with multiple challenges across multiple domains (land, air, sea, cyber, and space) in contested environments. To this end, the Army is revising its doctrine to guide how the force and specific units will function. The Army is also reorganizing its force by creating new units to conduct missions in multiple domains and by updating the responsibilities of key Army formations, such as Army divisions. Also, the Army is training its combat forces for multi-domain operations in part by increasing the focus on cyber operations.", "The Army is establishing new cyber and electronic warfare units for multi-domain operations, but did not fully assess the risk of activating some units at an accelerated pace and is experiencing staffing, equipping, and training challenges. For example, the Army activated a cyber battalion in December 2018, and as of March 2019, this unit was understaffed by more than 80 percent. Army guidance directs the Army staff to conduct assessments on new units to determine whether the Army can staff, equip, and train these organizations. However, Army leadership believed the threats justify developing these units at an accelerated pace. Consequently, the Army did not assess the staffing, equipping, and training risk before activating one unit, and only conducted an initial risk assessment before activating a second unit. As a result, senior Army leaders may not know what other challenges could arise, such as sustainment, as the units grow in capabililty. Army officials told GAO that as these units evolve, it is uncertain when more comprehensive risk assessments would take place. The Army has previously accelerated the activations of other units when it saw fit to do so, and is considering creating other new units for multi-domain operations. If the Army does not assess risks for units activated at an accelerated pace, those units may be unable to effectively conduct multi-domain operations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making three recommendations, including that the Army comprehensively assess the risk of staffing, equipping, and training the cyber and electronic warfare units that it has activated at an accelerated pace, and to do so for new organizations it plans to activate in an accelerated manner for multi-domain operations.

After a decade of counterinsurgency operations in Iraq and  Afghanistan, and what the unclassified Summary of the 2018 National  Defense Strategy called strategic atrophy, DOD concluded that its  competitive military advantage is eroding. Several DOD reports,  testimonies, and guidance all refer to the threats posed by both great- power competitors\u2014particularly China and Russia\u2014and other  adversaries, now and into the future. These threats are defined by rapid  technological change, competition with the United States through  operations below the threshold of armed conflict, and potential challenges  from adversaries in every operating domain, especially cyber and space.", "Against this backdrop, the Army has been developing a new Army  Operating Concept, which the Army is using to define how its forces will  engage jointly with the other services for the task of deterring and  defeating Chinese and Russian aggression in both competition and  conflict. The Army calls this concept The U.S. Army in Multi-Domain  Operations 2028, and it would enable the Army to confront adversaries in  contested environments by presenting those adversaries with multiple  challenges across multiple domains (land, air, sea, cyber, and space).  The multi-domain operations concept will significantly affect Army  doctrine, organizations, and training in the coming years.", "The Army\u2019s effort to rethink its overarching warfighting concept comes at  a time when it is also undertaking a significant effort to modernize the  force, while also rebuilding and sustaining the readiness of the current  force. In September 2018, we reported that the Army had reprioritized  tens of billions of dollars in planned modernization spending for new  priorities that support multi-domain operations, and also had established  a new Army Futures Command to provide additional guidance for its  modernization effort. In that report, we found that the Army had set  decisively defeating great-power competitors as an overarching objective,  but had not established processes for evaluating its modernization efforts  against this objective, and had not completed a cost analysis of its near- term modernization efforts. Further, we also reported in January 2019  that establishing the Army Futures Command creates unique  opportunities for the Army to improve its modernization efforts and that  the Army has generally applied leading management practices, such as  well-defined team goals and senior management support, to its  modernization. However, we also reported that the Army may be  beginning weapon systems development before technology is sufficiently  mature. This raises the risk that the resulting systems could experience cost increases, delivery delays, or failure to deliver desired capabilities.  We also testified on these issues in May 2019.", "Recognizing the significance of this effort and the need for multi-service  involvement, the House Armed Services Committee included a provision  in House Report 115-200 accompanying a bill for the National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 for us to review the Army\u2019s  progress in implementing the new warfighting concept.

The Army defines multi-domain operations as ways for  confronting adversaries in contested environments by presenting them  with multiple challenges through the combining of multiple capabilities.  This means that ground forces should be able to operate freely in other  warfighting domains and, if necessary, be able to overwhelm an  adversary\u2019s forces by combining capabilities across different domains,  such as land, air, sea, cyber, and space simultaneously.", "According to Army officials, in 2014 the then-Deputy Secretary of Defense  tasked the Army to update its warfighting concept to deal with the threats  and challenges posed by great-power competitors in the future operating  environment. The Army officials added that around the same time, the  Army began developing and running a wargame scenario focused on a  threat that employed similar doctrine, tactics, and capabilities as those  used by Russia in Ukraine. In 2016, the Army also assessed the  increasingly sophisticated Russian military capabilities and identified  specific multi-domain challenges that the Army would face if it came into  conflict with Russia. Army officials said that its analysis highlighted the  urgency of updating how it would fight such an adversary. In beginning to  develop this concept, the Army reached out to the Marine Corps, as both  services face similar problems in ground-combat operations.", "Since the Army began developing its concept, the Army established a  framework for assessing how the adversary operates and the problems  the Army needs to resolve as a ground force. For example, early on the  Army developed an expanded battlefield that stretches far beyond the  front lines, or \u201cclose area\u201d, where ground forces face off against each  other. Under this expanded battlefield, adversaries can use more  sophisticated weapons and cyber capabilities that are based in distant  and protected territories, potentially reaching targets that are located well  behind the front lines, even within the continental United States.

Army concepts  propose new approaches for the Army to develop capabilities against  emerging challenges. The new Army Operating Concept built around  multi-domain operations is intended to drive capability development,  which is addressed through changes to the Army\u2019s doctrine,  organizations, and training, among other areas. The Army\u2019s goal is to field  a more lethal and capable force by 2028 that is able to dominate  adversaries in a multi-domain environment. Figure 3 below summarizes  how the Army uses validated concepts to drive changes in capabilities  and the force.", "Doctrine. Given the Army\u2019s attention to multi-domain operations, it has  updated or is in the process of updating doctrine that guides how the  Army fights. Primary among this effort is updating the Army\u2019s overarching  operations field manual, which establishes how the Army conducts large- scale ground combat operations against the threat posed by a great- power competitor, among other things. In its most recent revision to its  doctrine, the Army incorporated several aspects of multi-domain  operations, such as the expanded battlefield that includes cyber and the  electromagnetic spectrum. TRADOC officials stated that they are also in the process of updating doctrine related to cyber operations and field  artillery operations in order to build a force that can integrate both cyber  capabilities and long-range fires\u2014such as artillery, rockets, and  missiles\u2014for multi-domain operations. The officials added that the Army  is developing or is planning to develop specific doctrinal guidance for new  Army units that will focus on multi-domain operations in the areas of  intelligence, cyber, electronic warfare, and space.", "Organizations. The Army wants to ensure that its warfighting  organizations have the engineering, artillery, air defense, and other  enabling capabilities needed to conduct multi-domain operations. For  example, the Army believes that formations above the brigade level, such  as division headquarters and corps headquarters, must have the ability to  conduct electronic warfare and cyber operations. To that end, the Army is  creating several new organizations focused on cyber and electronic  warfare (discussed later in the report). Additionally, the Army is trying to  align its multi-domain operations concept with a complementary concept  focused on the roles and responsibilities of these organizations above the  brigade level. Expanding the roles and responsibilities of formations  above the brigade level signifies a departure from the Army\u2019s modular  force, which was implemented beginning in 2004. At that time, the Army  embedded \u201ckey enablers\u201d such as military intelligence, reconnaissance,  and logistics functions, as well as other specialized personnel and  equipment, into brigade combat teams to provide them independent  capabilities. Moving forward, the Army envisions enhancing the  capabilities of brigade combat teams for multi-domain operations, as well  as providing additional key capabilities to formations above the brigade  level. For example:", "Brigade combat teams. Brigade combat teams are the Army\u2019s primary  tactical unit, composed of around 4,400-4,700 soldiers. They are  being adjusted to conduct operations in the cyber domain, including  new platoons focused on electronic warfare.", "Army division headquarters. Army divisions command multiple  brigade combat teams. The Army expects division headquarters to  manage the electromagnetic spectrum and to be the primary echelon  for integrating aviation, fires, and electronic warfare into ground  maneuver to defeat enemies in a close fight.", "Army corps headquarters. Army corps command multiple divisions.  Under the Army\u2019s concept, the Army corps headquarters will be the  primary echelon for defeating mid- and long-range enemy artillery  fires. The Army corps will also integrate artillery rockets and missiles,  as well as cyber capabilities in support of division or brigade ground  operations.", "Field armies. Field armies, which have the ability to command two or  more Army corps, are forward-stationed in regions with capable  threats posed by great-power competitors. They will conduct  campaigns to compete with adversaries short of armed conflict, and  manage the transition to armed conflict should it be needed. The field  army will also direct deception operations and provide long-range  artillery and fires support.", "Theater armies. Theater armies are also forward-stationed forces and  will be responsible for managing and combining Army capabilities in  support of information environment operations and space  operations. The theater army must be able to protect joint bases and  networks and enable access to the theater.", "Training. The Army is also updating its training across a broad range of  efforts. Army training officials stated that there is a need to train units  collectively under multi-domain operations conditions against great-power  competitors like Russia and China, per guidance from the Chief of Staff of  the Army. The commander of Army Forces Command also issued  guidance for fiscal year 2019 to help train and prepare soldiers to conduct  multi-domain operations. This guidance included increasing the realism  and rigor of every unit rotation to one of the Army\u2019s combat training  centers, as well as designing warfighter exercises that focus on units  conducting operations in contested electronic warfare, cyber, and space  environments. Additionally, the training officials stated that in recent years  the Army has updated its decisive-action training scenarios to include  regional versions for Europe, the Pacific, and Africa that comply with the  multi-domain operations concept. The officials added that, in future  years, several Army organizations will be collaborating to modernize the  Army\u2019s home-station training and combat training centers in support of  fielding a force capable of conducting multi-domain operations. All of  this builds upon the Army\u2019s earlier efforts to shift its training focus to  large-scale combat after a decade of training for counterinsurgency  operations, as we testified to Congress in February 2019.", "The Army is also taking steps to revise the training for cyber and  electronic warfare personnel. These steps include revising the U.S. Army  Cyberspace Operations Training Strategy so that it accounts for new  equipment and doctrine, but also for the new organizations being created  and the tasks those units will be expected to perform, according to Army  cyber officials. Additionally, the Army Cyber School is revising its cyber  and electronic warfare training so that personnel will be able to conduct  multi-domain operations. Furthermore, the Army is working on a joint  solution for training cyber personnel on behalf of U.S. Cyber Command,  according to Army Cyber Command officials. The Army\u2019s goal is to  provide the total cyber force with the ability to conduct joint cyber training,  including exercises and mission rehearsals by developing a virtual  training environment that simulates realistic cyber threats. This cyber  training solution, called the Persistent Cyber Training Environment, will  allow for experimentation, unit certification, and assessment and  development of the cyber mission force in a virtual training environment.  The Army\u2019s goal is that the environment will decrease training time,  increase throughput of personnel, and improve training quality.

The ICEWS unit will function as part of a larger  Multi-Domain Task Force, which will be capable of expanding those  operations into other domains such as land and air. The Army plans to  field at least two of these ICEWS units by the end of fiscal year 2020.  Additionally, the Army is restructuring or creating Cyber, Electromagnetic  Activities planning sections in the headquarters of more than 125 Army  formations, from special forces units up to theater-level Army  headquarters. This restructuring effort will take place during fiscal years  2020 through 2022, according to Army officials.", "Army guidance states that a unit\u2019s activation date should be identified 1 to  2 years in advance, according to Army officials, in order to provide time to  build up trained personnel and equipment in the unit before it is activated  and available to be deployed. As a result of accelerating the activation  of these units, the Army is facing interrelated challenges in terms of  staffing, equipping, and training the units, as discussed below.", "Accelerated pace creates challenges filling positions. The Army has  had difficulty filling its ICEWS unit and the 915th Cyber Warfare Support  Battalion with personnel to conduct operations. See table 1 below.", "By accelerating the activation of the ICEWS unit in October 2018 as a  pilot, or test, program, the Army activated the unit with only 32 percent of  its personnel in place, and Army headquarters officials report that filling  the unit with personnel with the right skills has been a slow process. The  915th Cyber Warfare Support Battalion is facing similar staffing  challenges. As of the end of March 2019, the unit was understaffed by  more than 80 percent as it filled 30 of 171 authorized positions for fiscal  year 2019, according to an Army headquarters official. The official  acknowledged that the 915th Cyber Warfare Support Battalion may not  meet the authorized staffing levels for fiscal year 2019 if higher priorities  arise for the service.", "Looking ahead, Army officials said that filling all of these new cyber and  electronic warfare units could be challenging because cyber personnel  are in high demand, with competition for these skilled personnel existing  between the Army, other government entities, and the private sector.  Army headquarters officials said they are exploring options to address the  challenges and have taken steps to retain the personnel that they have,  mostly in the form of retention bonuses and incentive pay. Some of those  incentives are targeted at the senior enlisted levels, which are some of  the personnel that Army officials indicated are in the most demand and of  which they have a shortage.", "Accelerated pace creates equipping challenges. Officials with both  Army headquarters and the Army Cyber School cited equipment  challenges as one of the key issues that must be addressed when  activating a unit on an accelerated basis. For example, in November  2018, an Army headquarters\u2019 official responsible for building the ICEWS  unit stated that the Army was having a difficult time identifying where the  unit\u2019s equipment would be coming from. By the end of January 2019, the  official said the situation was improving and that 55 percent of the  equipment had been identified, but the Army was trying to find a source  for the remaining 45 percent. However, most of this is common Army  equipment, such as firearms, according to an Army official; those  percentages do not include the specialized cyber equipment that the unit  will need to perform its missions, such as a communications system  designed to transfer data beyond the line of sight during air defense  operations. An Army headquarters\u2019 official stated that the Army is  prototyping different types of specialized equipment in order to expedite  the acquisition of such capabilities.", "Revisions to training not keeping up with activation of units. Army  officials acknowledged the need to update its cyber training, in part  because the doctrine for new units is still being written. Officials with the  Army Cyber School and the Army\u2019s Combined Arms Center stated that  the current U.S. Army Cyberspace Operations Training Strategy did not  foresee all of the new cyber and electronic warfare organizations the  Army now intends to create, including the Cyber Electromagnetic  Activities sections attached to various formations. Army headquarters  officials stated that they are working on a revision to the U.S. Army  Cyberspace Operations Training Strategy to address these issues.  However, the first ICEWS unit and the 915th Cyber Warfare Support  Battalion were activated without this updated training strategy. With other  units scheduled to be activated in fiscal year 2020, it is possible others  may be activated without the training strategy as well. Without the  updated doctrine and subsequent training strategies that will result from it,  TRADOC officials said they would have difficulty designing training for the  new units, and soldiers will not have a clear understanding of their tasks  and missions.", "Obtaining equipment also could be a challenge for training  servicemembers before they are assigned to cyber or electronic warfare  units, according to some Army officials. Officials with the Army Cyber  School stated that it could end up growing and producing a workforce that  outpaces its ability to procure equipment. However, Army headquarters\u2019  officials stated that equipping operational units is a higher priority than  providing equipment to the schools for training, and the Army ensures  that those units receiving the equipment get the training they need upon  fielding the equipment. If the Army does not acquire new equipment  quickly enough, the result could be that soldiers in the Army Cyber School  will be trained on outdated equipment, which they will not use when they  get to the field."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Army Assessed Staffing, Training, and Equipping Risks for Certain Cyber and Electronic Warfare Units, but Its Assessments for Units Activated at an Accelerated Pace Are Incomplete", "paragraphs": ["In the process of creating some new units, the Army assessed the risk of  whether it can meet the units\u2019 staffing, equipping, and training  requirements before the units\u2019 activation date, but it did not do so for  those units activated at an accelerated pace. For example, the Army  conducted risk assessments for some new Electronic Warfare platoons  and Cyber Electromagnetic Activities sections that it plans to begin  activating in fiscal year 2020. Those assessments identified issues and  mitigation strategies for the Army to consider when making fielding and  resource decisions. For example, the risk of finding a sufficient number of  qualified personnel for the Electronic Warfare platoons and Cyber  Electromagnetic Activities sections would be mitigated by spreading the  activations over a minimum of 3 years. The assessment for the Electronic  Warfare platoons also identified some equipping issues that will require  either more senior-level input or extending timeframes for completion.", "In contrast, the Army activated the ICEWS unit and the 915th Cyber  Warfare Support Battalion in an accelerated manner because of the  urgent need to develop these organizations, given the growing  capabilities of potential great-power competitors. However, the Army did  so without completely assessing the staffing, equipping, and training risk  to those units over the long term. For example:", "According to Army officials, the Army did not perform a risk  assessment for the ICEWS unit currently assigned to and participating  in exercises in the Pacific, because the Army initiated the unit as a  pilot, or test, program. According to Army officials, a risk assessment  was unnecessary prior to activating the unit because the Army  expects to refine the unit\u2019s personnel, equipping, and training  requirements during the pilot program. However, the ICEWS unit is  expected to become part of a larger Multi-Domain Task Force in fiscal  year 2020. Until that occurs, the ICEWS unit is attached to another  active Army unit and, according to Army officials, eligible to be  deployed if needed based on its current capabilities. Unless the Army  assesses the staffing, equipping, and training risks of the ICEWS unit,  the unit may be unable to provide the expected capabilities, either  currently or as part of the larger task force to which it will belong.", "The Army performed an initial risk assessment for the 915th Cyber  Warfare Support Battalion before the unit was activated in December  2018. However, Army officials told us that the Army has plans to grow  the unit to as many as 627 personnel by 2024, at which point it would  be considered fully operational. Unless the Army performs a more  complete risk assessment of the 915th Cyber Warfare Support  Battalion\u2019s staffing, equipping, and training requirements prior to  achieving full operational capability, the Army may be poorly  positioned to make decisions about how to use and support the  battalion.", "Army guidance states that the Army should assess its ability to support a  new unit\u2019s staffing, equipping, and training requirements, among other  things, so that senior Army leaders can evaluate proposed organizational  changes. For example, under a force integration functional area  analysis, the Army staff evaluates all proposed organizational changes to  ensure that they meet the intent of senior Army leaders, have the  resources available to accomplish their mission, and that their projected  benefits justify increased resources. These assessments analyze the  proposed organization in nine areas, such as staffing, structuring,  equipping, and training, and are intended to give senior Army leaders an  understanding of whether the organizations are affordable, supportable,  and sustainable. According to Army officials, the force integration  functional area analysis is similar to a risk assessment. In addition,  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government state that  management should identify, analyze, and respond to the risks related to  achieving the defined objective\u2014in this case quickly fielding a cyber force  to deal with current threats.", "Because the Army has not completely assessed the risk of organizing the  ICEWS unit and the 915th Cyber Warfare Support Battalion, senior Army  leaders may be left with an incomplete picture of the challenges in  affording, supporting, and sustaining these units over the long term.  Moreover, senior Army leaders lacked key information needed to  understand the capability and capacity of the units at the time they were  activated. For example, these units currently do not have what they need  in terms of personnel and equipment to conduct their missions  successfully. Further, according to some Army officials, without such an  assessment, the Army does not know whether accelerated activation was  the best course of action; what challenges they may face in staffing,  equipping, and training the units; or how to mitigate challenges that may  arise in other areas, such as deploying and sustainment. Army officials  stated that there is a lot of informal discussion between relevant Army  offices to try to identify and deal with challenges for these units. However,  they also acknowledged the problems inherent in activating a unit by  accelerating timelines.", "Such risk assessments also could inform future Army decisions as it  activates new units for multi-domain operations. Given the Army\u2019s  perception of the threat environment, the Army may decide to activate  other multi-domain operations units in an accelerated manner. For  example, the Army is exploring ideas for creating several new units in  future years to enhance its capability in multi-domain operations, such as  a Theater Space Warfare Battalion. The Army also has been running  wargames to see how they would operate new types of units at the  division, corps, and theater level for commanding and operating long- range missiles and rockets.", "Army officials stated that as these units grow and evolve, it is uncertain  when more comprehensive risk assessments would take place. If the  Army does not perform a risk assessment for the activated ICEWS unit  before it joins the larger Multi-Domain Task Force, or a more complete  risk assessment for the 915th Cyber Warfare Support Battalion as that  unit matures, the Army may end up fielding units that are not capable of  providing the needed capabilities. Moreover, these risk assessments  could provide vital lessons that could inform future Army decisions on the  development, activation, and fielding of other units focused on enhancing  the Army\u2019s capability to conduct multi-domain operations."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The Army Engaged with the Joint Staff and Other Services and Envisions Opportunities for Further Coordination", "paragraphs": ["The Army engaged with the Joint Staff and other services to develop its  Army Operating Concept and envisions opportunities for further  coordination in the future. The Army\u2019s overarching objective is to field a  multi-domain-capable force by 2028, and it considers further engagement  with the Joint Staff and other services as essential to accomplishing that  goal. According to Army plans, the Army needs to finalize the next version  of its Army Operating Concept by the fall of 2019 in order to incorporate  multi-domain operations into all levels of Army leadership, training, and  education by 2020. The Army plans indicate that maintaining this  schedule is important to have a ready, lethal, and modern force for multi- domain operations by 2028.", "From the outset, the Army engaged with the Marine Corps to begin its  concept development. Together the Army and Marine Corps published a  white paper in January 2017 where they unveiled \u201cMulti-Domain Battle\u201d  as a new concept for combat operations against a sophisticated great- power competitor. This white paper highlighted the need for ground  forces to focus on all five warfighting domains and was intended as a first  step toward further multi-domain concept development, wargaming,  experimentation, and capability development.", "Once the white paper was written, the Army engaged with the Joint Staff  and the other services in several ways to refine its concept:", "Joint Staff collaboration. The Army engaged with the Joint Staff on  an Army-led study of recent contingency operations and used the  lessons to refine the Army Operating Concept\u2019s description of the  emerging operational environment. Based on that study, the Army  also refined some solutions for addressing threats posed by great- power competitors. Joint Staff officials reported that the Army  engaged with the Joint Staff through other collaborative events as  well, including tabletop exercises that tested and refined multi-domain  concept ideas.", "Marine Corps collaboration. As the Army moved forward from the  white paper, the Marine Corps\u2019 input informed the concept\u2019s  development in various ways. This included changing the concept\u2019s  title from multi-domain battle to multi-domain operations in April 2018  to better reflect the scope of competition and conflict, as well as the  inherent joint nature of modern warfare. The Marine Corps also  hosted a multi-domain symposium in April 2018 that was attended by  the Army, Air Force, Navy, and Joint Staff.", "Air Force collaboration. The Army initially collaborated with the Air  Force Air Combat Command to inform concept-development efforts,  and more recently began working with the Air Force Warfighting  Integration Capability under Air Force headquarters. Also, the Army  and Air Force collaborated on tabletop exercises focused on  simulating multi-domain operations. Army officials told us that this  helped them refine their thinking on how to enhance the  maneuverability of its land forces by combining Army and Air Force  capabilities across domains.", "Navy collaboration. The Army and Navy principally collaborated by  testing multi-domain capabilities during real-world exercises. For  example, the Army joined the Navy\u2019s 2018 Naval Rim of the Pacific  exercise to demonstrate capabilities for multi-domain operations in a  real world environment.", "While the Army took steps to engage with the Joint Staff and the other  services, it made the decision to move forward with the latest version of  its Army Operating Concept in order to meet its overarching objective to  develop a multi-domain operations-capable force by 2028. Given this  urgency, Army officials told us that they may have missed opportunities to  further refine its Army Operating Concept in 2018 with the perspectives of  the Joint Staff and other military services. Joint Staff officials told us that  by not fully including the Joint Staff in some tabletop exercises, the Army  may have missed the Joint Staff\u2019s perspective on key issues related to  multi-domain operations, such as joint command and control.", "As the Army continues to revise its Army Operating Concept, the Army  recognizes the need to continue to engage with the Joint Staff and other  services. Joint Staff officials told us that the Joint Staff has initiated its  own plans to engage with the services to refine key ideas of multi-domain  operations in joint concepts, including logistics, intelligence, and  command and control. Army officials told us that they recognize the  importance of not getting too far ahead of these efforts, or the efforts of  other services related to multi-domain operations. Army officials told us  that the mechanisms built into the Joint concept-development framework  would provide opportunities to engage the services and Joint Staff as the  Army revises its own concept. Army officials added that beginning in the  fall of 2019 the Army will participate with the Joint Staff in a wargame  designed, in part, to analyze how the Army Operating Concept works with  the other military service operating concepts.

The refinement of the Army\u2019s  Operating Concept is beginning to drive changes across the Army. The  Army is making near-term changes by incorporating multi-domain  operations into its doctrine, organizations, and training, which includes the  accelerated creation of new cyber and electronic warfare units. However,  these units are short of both people and equipment. While Army  leadership believes that the urgency to confront threats justifies its  decision to accelerate the development of those units, the Army did not  assess the risks associated with staffing, equipping, and training its  existing ICEWS unit prior to activation to determine whether it is  affordable, supportable, and sustainable, and officials said it was  uncertain when a more comprehensive assessment would take place.  The Army plans to incorporate this unit into the first Multi-Domain Task  Force by the end of Fiscal Year 2020, but in the meantime the unit could  be deployed if needed. The Army did prepare a preliminary risk  assessment for the 915th Cyber Warfare Support Battalion prior to  activation, but it is unclear whether the Army will perform a more  comprehensive risk assessment as the unit matures and nears full  operational capability. For the units already activated, a risk assessment  could benefit the Army by providing insights about the ability to deploy  and sustain the units. It is important for the Army to assess its efforts  before committing resources to activate new units. By formally assessing  the risk of all new units activated in an accelerated manner, the Army will  have the key information its leaders need for making decisions related to  the activation of those units and other related units going forward."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making the following three recommendations to the Secretary of  the Army.", "The Secretary of the Army should ensure that the Deputy Chief of Staff,  G-3/5/7 assess the risk associated with staffing, equipping, and training  the existing ICEWS unit prior to its incorporation into the first Multi- Domain Task Force in fiscal year 2020.

The Army stated in its  comments that it does not perform force integration functional area  analyses for experimental or pilot organizations, and that because the first  ICEWS was activated as a pilot, no such assessment was performed.  The Army added that it would conduct a risk assessment at the  conclusion of the pilot if and when the Army decides to establish such a  unit. We met with Army officials to discuss their comments, during which  they provided additional information and clarification regarding how they  were assessing risks for the unit. Based on this information, we modified  the report to reflect the Army\u2019s position that a risk assessment was  unnecessary prior to activating the unit because the Army plans on using  the pilot period to determine the staffing, equipping, and training  requirements for the unit. We also incorporated additional information on  the status of the ICEWS unit. As a result, we clarified our  recommendation to state that the Army should assess the risk associated  with staffing, equipping, and training the existing ICEWS unit prior to its  incorporation into the first Multi-Domain Task Force in fiscal year 2020.  Army officials generally agreed with the revised recommendation. Moving  forward, it will be important for the Army to implement this  recommendation to ensure the ICEWS unit, which is active and eligible to  be deployed, will be prepared to carry out its mission effectively.", "The Army partially concurred with the second recommendation for it to  conduct a risk assessment, such as a force integration functional area  analysis, for the 915th Cyber Warfare Support Battalion. The Army stated  in its comments that it does not perform force integration functional area  analyses for force generating units such as the 915th Cyber Warfare  Support Battalion. Instead, it develops a concept plan, which applies rigor  and analysis to determine the most efficient and effective way of fielding a  new unit. We met with Army officials to discuss their comments, during  which they provided additional information related to assessing risks for  the 915th Cyber Warfare Support Battalion. Specifically, Army officials  said that prior to activating the battalion, leadership approved the  battalion\u2019s concept plan, which included an initial risk assessment. We  reviewed the concept plan for the battalion and found that the  assessment only addressed the risk of not having the unit\u2019s capabilities  activated and in the field for operations. We incorporated this additional  information on this initial risk assessment for the 915th Cyber Warfare  Support Battalion into the report. As a result of this additional information,  we clarified our recommendation to state that the Army should conduct a  comprehensive risk assessment associated with staffing, equipping, and  training the 915th Cyber Warfare Support Battalion prior to approving the  expansion of the unit to its full operational capability. Army officials  generally agreed with this. It will be important for the Army to implement  the revised recommendation to ensure the 915th Cyber Warfare Support  Battalion, which is active and performing operations, will be prepared to  carry out its mission effectively.", "The Army concurred with the third recommendation for it to ensure that a  risk assessment is conducted before activating any new organizations it  plans to field in an accelerated manner for the purposes of conducting  multi-domain operations. The Army added that any lessons learned from  the activation of the first ICEWS unit and the 915th Cyber Warfare  Support Battalion will be taken into consideration when assessing the risk  before the activation of these new organizations. It will be important for  the Army to implement the recommendation to ensure that any new  organizations are prepared to carry out their missions, while potentially  avoiding some of the challenges that the ICEWS and 915th Cyber  Warfare Support Battalion have experienced.", "Lastly, the Army also recommended that we change the title of our report;  however, we did not accept the title offered by the Army.
