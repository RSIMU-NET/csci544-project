The three settings include Community Living Centers (CLCs), which are VA-owned and operated; community nursing homes with which VA contracts to provide care for veterans; and state veterans' nursing homes, which are owned and operated by states. Over half (53 percent) of this workload was provided in state veterans' nursing homes, 28 percent in CLCs, and 19 percent in community nursing homes. Nearly 90 percent of total workload was long-stay (91 days or more for residents with chronic conditions), and at least 75 percent of care provided in each of VA's three settings was long-stay.

Of this, about $6.3 billion was spent on  long-term care, including institutional long-term care provided in nursing  homes, and noninstitutional long-term care provided in community  settings. Most of VA\u2019s spending on long-term care was for nursing home  care, which accounted for about 9 percent of total VA health care  spending in fiscal year 2012.

In addition, VA pays for all or part of  the cost of care for veterans in state veterans\u2019 nursing homes, which are  owned and operated by states. VA\u2019s nursing home care is broadly  defined by length of stay\u2014long- and short-stay care. Long-stay care,  which lasts for 91 days or more, is provided to residents who cannot be  cared for at home because of severe chronic physical or mental  limitations. Short-stay care, which lasts 90 days or less, includes more  resource-intensive services, such as postacute care needed for residents  recuperating from a stroke or hip replacement.", "A service-connected disability is an injury or disease that was incurred or aggravated  while on active duty.

In  other areas, however, officials told us that these specialized services  might not be available in a CLC and instead might be available at a  community nursing home. When an individual medical center has more  than one CLC in its service area, each CLC may offer a unique set of  services. Therefore, according to officials, the availability of different types  of services in each nursing home setting depends largely on location.", "VA officials further told us that admissions policies are generally the same  for all CLCs, but may vary for community nursing homes and state  veterans\u2019 nursing homes.

State veterans\u2019 nursing  homes are not required to provide VA with documentation of their  admissions policies. Since these homes are state-owned and operated  entities they are subject to admissions and eligibility criteria that vary from  state to state.

Seventy-one percent ($3.5 billion) of VA\u2019s  total expenditures was spent on care provided in CLCs (see fig. 5),  although CLCs accounted for 28 percent of the total workload.  Conversely, VA spent 16 percent (about $800 million) for nursing home  care in state veterans\u2019 nursing homes, although state veterans\u2019 nursing  homes accounted for 53 percent of VA\u2019s nursing home workload. The  share of VA expenditures in each setting and other expenditure patterns  we examine below remained relatively unchanged between fiscal years  2010-2012.", "Similar to workload, the proportion of VA nursing home expenditures  accounted for by each setting varied widely by network. For example,  nearly 90 percent of VA\u2019s expenditures in VISN 5 (VA Capitol Health Care  Network) were for care provided in CLCs, whereas in VISN 19 (Rocky  Mountain Network) just 48 percent of expenditures were for care provided  in CLCs.

Specifically,  while the per diem expenditure across all settings in fiscal year 2012 was  $370, the per diem expenditure in CLCs was nearly 4 times higher than  for community nursing homes, and about 8 times higher than for state  veterans\u2019 nursing homes\u2014$953 compared to $244 and $113,  respectively. (See table 2.) We also found that the per diem expenditure  for CLCs was substantially higher than the per diem expenditure for  community nursing homes and state veterans\u2019 nursing homes, regardless  of the resident\u2019s length of stay. Although the short-stay per diem  expenditure in CLCs ($1,167) was substantially more than the per diem  expenditure for long stays ($884), both were considerably higher than the  per diem expenditures for community nursing homes and state veterans\u2019  nursing homes.", "VA officials told us that they have not done any studies comparing the  reasons for differences in per diem expenditures across settings because  such expenditures are not comparable. However, VA officials provided us  with a breakdown of the various components of total and per diem  expenditures in CLCs. (See table 3.) VA officials indicated that \u201ccore\u201d  CLC expenditures, which account for about 40 percent of total CLC per  diem expenditures, would be comparable to the care that VA pays for in  community nursing homes and state veterans\u2019 nursing homes. In addition  to these core expenditures, VA\u2019s expenditures for CLCs in fiscal year  2012 included direct care expenditures for physicians and other medical  personnel staffing, indirect care expenditures for education and research,  and overhead expenditures related to VA national programs, among  others. In particular, VA officials noted that CLCs are often located in or  within close proximity to a VA medical center, and that the facility  expenditures alone for CLCs are generally higher than those of  community nursing homes and state veterans\u2019 nursing homes, which are  generally stand-alone facilities. In fiscal year 2012, for example, the per  diem expenditure for CLC facility costs alone was $234, roughly  comparable to the entire per diem that VA paid for veterans to receive  care in community nursing homes that year. VA officials also told us that  while the amount of nursing staff in community nursing homes is similar to  that of CLCs, the skill level may not be as high. For example, CLCs may  hire more licensed and registered nurses due to the needs of the  residents in CLCs. VA officials also told us that expenditures for  emergency medical care would not be included in the community nursing  home per diem expenditures, but that these expenditures are included for  CLC residents. In addition, while the cost of routine medications is  covered under the community nursing home per diem, any high-cost  medications are not, although they are accounted for in the overall  expenditures for operating the community nursing home program.  Officials also noted that per diem expenditures for state veterans\u2019 nursing  homes only represent a portion of the total expenditures for care, with the  remainder being paid for by the state and the veteran."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VA Spent More in All Three Settings on Long-Stay Care than Short-Stay Care", "paragraphs": ["The majority of VA\u2019s spending for nursing home care in fiscal year 2012\u2014 $3.7 billion, or 75 percent\u2014was on long-stay care.

In addition, according to officials, expenditure data on community nursing  homes are especially important from a program perspective since VA  looks at unit costs to help in rate negotiations. However, VA does not  currently include expenditure data disaggregated by length of stay and  resident characteristics in its budget justification, and therefore does not  provide information on unit costs to the maximum extent possible as  encouraged by OMB to justify staffing and other requirements.

Most of VA\u2019s nursing home workload is for discretionary care,  rather than mandatory care, and more care is provided for residents 65 to  84 years of age than for other age groups, though these patterns vary by  setting.
