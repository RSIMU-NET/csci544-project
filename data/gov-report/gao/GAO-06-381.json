This report focuses on conversions of individuals from noncareer to career positions. Federal agencies must use appropriate authorities and follow proper procedures in making these conversions.

The other 18 departments and agencies reported making no conversions during this period. Four agencies accounted for 95, or 66 percent, of the 144 reported conversions: the Departments of Health and Human Services (36), Justice (23), Defense (21), and Treasury (15). Of the 144 reported conversions, almost two-thirds were from Limited Term Senior Executive Service (SES) positions (47) and Schedule C positions (46). Limited Term SES appointments may be made for up to 36 months and can include federal employees who previously held career positions. Schedule C appointments are generally noncompetitive and are for positions graded GS-15 and below that involve determining policy or that require a close confidential relationship with key agency officials. Of these 144 individuals, 64 were converted to career SES positions, 47 to career competitive service positions, and 33 to career excepted service (non-Schedule C) positions. Agencies used appropriate authorities and followed proper procedures in making the majority (93) of the 130 conversions reported at the GS-12 level or higher. However, for 37 of these conversions it appears that agencies did not follow proper procedures or agencies did not provide enough information for us to make an assessment. For 18 of the 37 of these conversions, it appears that agencies did not follow proper procedures. Some of the apparent improper procedures included: selecting former noncareer appointees who appeared to have limited qualifications and experience for career positions, creating career positions specifically for particular individuals, and failing to apply veteran's preference in the selection process. Seven of the 18 conversions were subject to OPM review and approval; 2 because they fell within the presidential election pre-appointment review period as prescribed by OPM and 5 because they were to SES level positions. For the remaining 19 conversions, agencies did not provide enough information for GAO to fully assess the process used by the agency in making the conversion. This was largely attributable to the types of appointments involved. Sixteen of these 19 conversions were to career excepted service (non-Schedule C) positions at the Department of Justice. For appointments to excepted service positions, OPM does not require agencies to follow OPM's competitive hiring provisions or to maintain records of the rating, ranking, and selection process, as it requires for competitive service appointments (although most of these conversions are subject to the merit system principles). These unique hiring procedures and limited documentation requirements for excepted service positions resulted in GAO having insufficient information to reconstruct the Department of Justice's decision-making process to convert these individuals. For the remaining three cases, the Department of Health and Human Services could not locate certain files."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["According to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), a federal  employee conversion occurs whenever an individual changes from one  personnel status or service to another without a break in federal  government service of more than 3 days. There are many types of  conversions. This report focuses on one type of conversion; i.e., converting  individuals from noncareer to career positions. These conversions  represented less than 1 percent of the total number of career conversions  across the government from May 1, 2001, through April 30, 2005. The types  of positions this report covers and a definition of each is listed in the  background section.", "Federal agencies must use appropriate authorities and follow proper  procedures in making the conversions. Most of these authorities and  procedures are found in Title 5 of the U.S. Code. Title 5 of the U.S. Code  includes the merit system principles, which are broad principles governing  federal personnel management, such as that all applicants for federal  employment should receive fair and equitable treatment. Other examples  of statutory requirements include granting of veteran\u2019s preference and the  prohibition on certain personnel practices such as discriminating for or  against an applicant for employment on the basis of political affiliation. In  addition to these statutory requirements, agencies must follow OPM  regulations, which set out required procedures for making appointments to  career positions, such as providing public notice of all vacancies in the  career Senior Executive Service (SES). Agencies are not required to follow  OPM\u2019s competitive service hiring guidance for career excepted service  (non-Schedule C) positions; however, agencies must follow merit system  principles and apply veteran\u2019s preference when making most of these  appointments.", "OPM also has oversight authority to ensure that federal agencies are  following the merit system principles when hiring. As one aspect of  carrying out these duties, OPM has traditionally required agencies to seek  its pre-appointment approval for the conversion of certain noncareer  appointees (Schedule C and Noncareer SES) into certain career positions  (competitive service and career SES) during a presidential election review  period. Schedule C appointments are generally noncompetitive and are  usually for positions graded GS-15 and below that involve determining  policy or that require a close confidential relationship with the agency head  or other key officials of the agency. Noncareer SES appointees are  responsible for formulating, advocating, and directing administration  policies. The specific duration of each presidential election review period  is defined every 4 years by OPM. For the most recent presidential election,  OPM defined the pre-appointment review period from March 18, 2004,  through January 20, 2005. OPM does not include conversions to career  excepted service (non-Schedule C) positions in this pre-appointment  review process. In addition, pursuant to the statutory requirement to  maintain an oversight program over delegated activities, OPM conducts  periodic audits of agencies\u2019 examining and hiring activities to ensure they  are consistent with the merit systems principles and other laws and  regulations.", "This report responds to your request that we determine for departments  and selected agencies (1) the number of all conversions from noncareer to  career positions occurring during the period from May 1, 2001, through  April 30, 2005; and for each of these conversions, the characteristics of the  noncareer positions previously held by these individuals and the career  positions to which they were converted, and (2) whether appropriate  authorities were used and proper procedures followed in making these  conversions at the GS-12 level and above.", "We have regularly reported on conversions from noncareer to career  positions in the past. In our most recent review, we reported on  conversions during the period from October 1998 through April 2001. In  addition, in June 2005, we provided you with information on the number of  individuals who were converted from noncareer to career positions during  the period from May 1, 2001, through December 31, 2003, as reported to us  by departments and selected agencies. We reported that 77 individuals  holding noncareer positions were converted to career positions during that  time frame at 18 of the 41 selected departments and agencies covered in  our review. The remaining 23 departments and selected agencies reported  no conversions during that period. This report expands on that information  to show the total number of conversions reported by the 41 selected  departments and agencies for the entire period of May 1, 2001, through  April 30, 2005, and the results of our review of those conversions at the GS- 12 level and above.", "To address our objectives, we asked 41 departments and selected agencies  to complete a data collection instrument (DCI) and provide official records  (Standard Form 50B) for each conversion to determine the number of  individuals converted from noncareer to career positions. Appendix I lists  the 41 departments and agencies we reviewed and the number of  conversions reported by each. The criteria we used to select the 41  departments and agencies were (1) all 15 departments and (2) 26 agencies  that had oversight or other regular responsibilities for federal workforce  issues, and that were agencies of particular interest to the congressional  requesters. For each conversion at the GS-12 level and above, we reviewed  the merit staffing files, which document promotion and hiring decisions,  and official personnel folders (OPF), which include salary and other  information from individuals\u2019 current and previous appointments, to  ensure that appropriate authorities and proper procedures were followed.  Agencies are not required to follow OPM\u2019s competitive hiring procedures  for career excepted service positions. Instead, they devise their own hiring  procedures for career excepted service (non-Schedule C) positions. We  requested written copies of such procedures from each agency that used  this authority to determine (1) if agency procedures were consistent with  law and regulations, and (2) whether agencies followed their own  procedures. Since most of the conversions to career excepted service  positions were made by the Department of Justice (DOJ), we also met with  DOJ\u2019s Director of Attorney Recruitment and Management to discuss the  process DOJ uses to convert individuals to career excepted service (non- Schedule C) positions.", "We conducted our work in Washington, D.C. from March 2004 through  March 2006 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

Appointees must complete a 1-year  probationary period and a total of 3 years continuous creditable service  to attain a career appointment.", "Career (SES): Appointments are to top-level policy, supervisory, and  managerial positions above grade 15 of the General Schedule. Career  SES positions require a further review and approval of the merit staffing  process by OPM, and the proposed selectee\u2019s executive/managerial  qualifications by an OPM-administered SES Qualifications Review  Board (QRB) which are composed of members of the SES from across  the government.", "Career Excepted Service (Non-Schedule C): Appointments involve  agency positions that are not subject to OPM\u2019s competitive hiring  examination. Agencies have authority to establish their own hiring  procedures to fill excepted service vacancies. Such procedures must  comply with statutory requirements such as merit systems principles  and veteran\u2019s preference, when applicable. Career excepted service  individuals have adverse action appeal rights to the Merit Systems  Protection Board; which is responsible for protecting the federal  government\u2019s merit-based system of employment by hearing and  deciding cases involving certain personnel actions.", "As mentioned previously, the majority of authorities and procedures  governing appointments to career positions are outlined in Title 5 of the  U.S. Code. Merit system principles are one of the fundamental statutory  rules that apply to civil service appointments. These principles require that  agencies provide a selection process that is fair, open, and based on skills,  knowledge, and ability. Another statutory requirement is the prohibition  on certain personnel practices, such as granting any individual a preference  or advantage in the application process, including defining the manner of  competition or requirements for a position to improve the prospects of any  particular applicant, or failing to fulfill veteran\u2019s preference requirements.  In addition to these statutory requirements, agencies must follow OPM\u2019s  regulations in Title 5 of the Code of Federal Regulations, which also outline  required procedures for making appointments to career positions, such as  providing public notice of all vacancies in the career SES. For career  excepted service (non-Schedule C) positions, agencies are not required to  follow OPM\u2019s hiring regulations for the competitive service; however, they  must apply veteran\u2019s preference and follow merit system principles when  making most of these appointments.", "OPM has oversight authority to ensure that agencies are following the merit  system principles when hiring. In accordance with this authority, OPM  has traditionally required agencies to seek its pre-appointment approval for  the conversion of certain noncareer appointees (Schedule C and Noncareer  SES) into certain career positions (competitive service and career SES)  during a presidential election period. OPM defines the specific duration of  this period every 4 years. In a memorandum to department and agency  heads dated March 18, 2004, OPM defined the most recent pre-appointment  review period as beginning on March 18, 2004, and concluding on January  20, 2005, Inauguration Day. In that memorandum, OPM also reminded  agencies of the need to ensure that agency personnel actions remain free of  political influence and meet all relevant civil service laws, rules, and  regulations and that all official personnel records should clearly document  the continued adherence with merit principles and the avoidance of  prohibited personnel practices. OPM also required agencies to seek its  approval before appointing a current or former (within the last 5 years)  Schedule C or Noncareer SES employee to the competitive service or  career SES during this period. As stated previously, OPM does not include  conversions to career excepted service (non-Schedule C) positions in this  pre-appointment review process. Thirty-six of the 144 reported conversions  covered in this review occurred during the most recent presidential  election review period. In addition to conducting pre-appointment reviews  during election years, OPM also reviews all career SES appointments.

OPM has established a process to help ensure that conversions occurring  during presidential election periods and to SES level positions, meet merit  system principles. While this process has in fact helped ensure that some  improper conversions are prevented, questionable conversions can  sometimes still occur. Also, conversions to excepted service positions are  excluded from the presidential election period pre-appointment review  process. While these conversions to excepted service positions are exempt  from the OPM competitive examination process, they are subject to other  statutory requirements, and therefore could involve some of the same  concerns, as demonstrated by our review.
