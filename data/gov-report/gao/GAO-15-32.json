For example, the explanation in DOD's report of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's transfer of authority process did not include sufficient detail to clearly convey the process. DOD's report also did not include details regarding the combatant commands' requirements, nor did it fully describe issues affecting the testing and development of key regional BMD systems (see fig.).

Specifically, we  reviewed the language of section 233 to identify and document the  required reporting elements and subelements; developed, based on the required reporting elements, scoring criteria  to assess the report\u2019s content; assessed the extent to which the report\u2019s content addressed the  required reporting elements by having three analysts independently  compare the report\u2019s content to the scoring criteria; and   compiled scorecard results of the three analysts in an anonymous  format and, with the assistance of a research methodologist, reached  a consensus on the final assigned score for each required reporting  element.", "Based on this review, the team determined whether the report\u2019s content  addressed, partially addressed, or did not address each of the required  reporting elements as follows:", "Addressed: The report contains information relating to the specific  required reporting element and all its subelements.", "Partially addressed: The report contains some, but not all, of the  information required by the specific required reporting element or  includes information on some, but not all, of its subelements.", "Not addressed: The report does not mention any information relating  to the specific required reporting element or any of its subelements.", "We also collected documents and interviewed officials at organizations  that DOD officials told us provided significant contributions to the report,  such as the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, Joint  Staff, MDA, and U.S. Strategic Command, and we interviewed officials  from the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy and Joint  Staff about the process they used to prepare the report and for any other  insights they might have on the content of the report. After we determined  the extent to which the required reporting elements were addressed, we  interviewed DOD officials regarding any elements that we rated as  partially addressed to better understand why DOD reported or did not  report certain information.", "To provide our views on other information, if any, that DOD could have  included in the report to better inform oversight by congressional  committees, we identified information available to DOD as it was  preparing its report. Specifically, we reviewed combatant commands\u2019  integrated priority lists, MDA acquisition and system engineering  documentation, DOD\u2019s Joint Integrated Air and Missile Defense: Vision  2020, the 2012 Ballistic Missile Defense System Warfighter Capability  Acceptance document, and other documentation to determine the  information available to DOD as it was preparing its report. Further, to  help us provide views on other key information, if any, that DOD could  have included in its report, we used generally accepted standards for a  sound, complete, and high-quality defense research study that we  identified in a 2006 GAO report. Specifically, we used the standards we  previously identified that were related to the presentation of results,  because this review focuses on the information contained in DOD\u2019s June  2014 regional BMD report. These specific standards include that the  report address the objectives, that the conclusions be sound and  complete, and that the study results be presented in a clear manner. We  compared these specific standards to the contents of DOD\u2019s June 2014  report and to the other information available to DOD to determine what  details, if any, DOD excluded from its report. We also reviewed relevant  DOD documents to determine examples of other information DOD had on  regional BMD operations, such as the Joint Force Readiness Review, the  2010 Ballistic Missile Defense Review Report, and a briefing on the  employment of BMD assets with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization  (NATO). Furthermore, we interviewed DOD officials who compiled the  report regarding the approach they used to develop the report, including  their rationale for choosing the level of detail that they provided for  particular elements in the report.", "We conducted this performance audit from May 2014 to December 2014  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

In that report, DOD stated it would match  U.S. BMD strategies, policies, and capabilities to the requirements of  current and future threats and use that information to inform BMD  planning, budgeting, and oversight. DOD also noted that phased,  adaptive approaches to BMD would enable a flexible, scalable response  to BMD threats around the world by incorporating new technologies  quickly and cost-effectively, and described the advantages of mobile BMD  assets that can be readily transported from one region to another, over  fixed assets. In addition, DOD indicated that new assets would undergo  testing that enables assessment under realistic operational conditions,  prior to deployment. Finally, DOD emphasized working with regional allies  to strengthen BMD and its deterrent value. The 2010 Ballistic Missile  Defense Review Report indicates that the United States would pursue a  phased, adaptive approach to missile defense within each region that is  tailored to the threats and circumstances unique to each region. An area  of emphasis in the 2010 Ballistic Missile Defense Review Report was on  the EPAA\u2014the U.S. approach to regional BMD in Europe.", "In the 2010 Ballistic Missile Defense Review Report, DOD also discussed  the development of regional phased, adaptive approaches to BMD in the  Asia-Pacific and the Middle East. The 2010 report highlighted differences  among the ballistic missile threat posed to each region, as well as the  differences among the regional defensive arrangements that exist  between the United States and its partners. In an August 2013 report on  regional BMD issues, DOD stated that its process of working with  regional allies and partners was well under way and included the  participation, along with the United States, of some allies and partners in  regional command and control centers that conduct BMD operations. In  the Pacific, DOD noted that cooperation is most robust with Japan, that  other allies and partners participate to varying degrees, and that allies  and partners in the Asia-Pacific region generally have exhibited an  increasing interest in enhanced cooperation with DOD. DOD\u2019s August  2013 report also noted that in the Middle East the United States is  working with a number of Gulf Cooperation Council States on a bilateral  basis, including supporting the purchase of BMD systems through the  Foreign Military Sales program.", "DOD\u2019s regional BMD effort consists of a number of specific weapon  systems or elements that compose the BMD system as a whole. They are  the following:", "Command and Control, Battle Management, and Communications  (C2BMC): a system that integrates individual BMD elements and  allows users to plan BMD operations, maintain situational awareness  and communications, and manage networked sensors.", "Army Navy/Transportable Radar Surveillance and Control Model 2  (AN/TPY-2) X-Band Radar: a sensor that tracks ballistic missiles in  flight.", "Aegis BMD Weapons System: a ship-based weapon system that  consists of a radar, software, and processors to track threat missiles  and cue Aegis Standard Missile-3 (SM-3) interceptors.", "Aegis Ashore: a land-based version of the Aegis BMD interceptor  system, which will employ Aegis BMD Weapons System upgrades  and SM-3 upgrades as they become available.", "Standard Missile-3 (SM-3): a family of defensive missiles that  intercept regional threat missiles of various ranges.", "Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD): a mobile, ground- based missile defense system that includes a fire control and  communications system, a radar, interceptors, and other support  equipment.", "Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3): a mobile defense against  short-range missiles. It is now operated and fielded by the U.S. Army  and may be used in a variety of regional BMD approaches.", "According to DOD, various versions of these weapon systems are being  deployed in Europe, the Asia-Pacific region, and in the Middle East, but  the EPAA is the only regional approach described extensively in the 2010  Ballistic Missile Defense Review Report. To support Phase 1 of the EPAA  for operations in Europe, by December 2011 MDA delivered an AN/TPY-2  X-band radar, an Aegis BMD ship with SM-3 Block IA missiles, and an  upgrade to C2BMC. As we reported in March 2014,the EPAA are intended to provide improved integration and  interoperability among sensors and interceptor systems, which would  expand the area being defended, as well as improve the ability to defend  against attacks involving a larger number of incoming missiles.  Specifically, for Phase 2, MDA plans to deploy improved versions of the  Aegis BMD Weapons System on ships and Aegis Ashore in Romania with  the next generation of SM-3 interceptor, called SM-3 Block IB. MDA also  plans to field improvements to C2BMC, upgrading an existing version in  the 2015 time frame and fielding a new version in 2017. For Phase 3,  MDA is developing further improvements to the Aegis BMD system,  including a new version of the weapons system and new interceptor,  called SM-3 Block IIA, as well as an additional Aegis Ashore installation in  Poland and further improvements to C2BMC for fielding in 2018.

Specifically:  In support of element F, regarding integration of offensive and  defensive capabilities, the report described some plans regarding  implementation of the imperatives suggested in the Joint Integrated  Air and Missile Defense Vision for 2020. We determined that DOD\u2019s  report met the statutory requirement to describe the manner in which  enhanced integration of offensive and defensive capabilities will fit into  regional missile defense planning and force structure assessments.  Although not required, we found the report did not provide  comprehensive information on how DOD will identify and address  potential capability and capacity shortfalls in support of air and missile  defense missions, nor did it provide a description of policies to  increase cooperation among partners and allies, as emphasized by  the Joint Integrated Air and Missile Defense Vision for 2020, which is  information that provides more insight into how DOD manages  regional BMD resources and risks.", "In support of elements G and H, regarding allied contributions to  regional BMD, DOD\u2019s report included some information that did not  relate to regional missile defense and characterized a number of allied  contributions as notional, which could misrepresent the extent to  which particular allies and partners contribute to regional BMD. For  example, the report mentions Denmark hosting an Upgraded Early  Warning Radar in Greenland as an allied contribution to European  missile defense, but that radar is used exclusively for supporting the  homeland defense BMD mission. Additionally, the report did not  include estimates of actual or potential cost savings derived from  taking advantage of economies of scale or a reduced number of U.S.  deployments due to allied capabilities. For instance, Japan\u2019s effort to  develop and deploy the Aegis BMD Weapon System on Japanese  ships is mentioned by the report, but without concrete information on  the effect that may have on U.S. resources. Appendix I highlights U.S.  and allied contributions to regional BMD operations.", "Additionally, we determined that DOD\u2019s report omitted key details  regarding its approach to regional BMD for the three elements that it  partially addressed in the report, regarding the combatant commands\u2019  force structure and deployment options, concepts for operating with  NATO, and the development of EPAA systems.

In EPAA, C2BMC is  necessary to link allied systems, such as NATO\u2019s Active Layered  Theater Ballistic Missile Defense, with the U.S. systems. It also  controls the AN/TPY-2 X-band radar, and integrates Aegis BMD  ships, as well as additional sensors and an Aegis Ashore as they  become available in Phases 2 and 3. As the integrator, C2BMC allows  the BMD system to defend against more missiles simultaneously, to  conserve interceptor inventory, and to defend a larger area than  individual systems operating independently. For Phase 2 of the EPAA,  MDA plans to upgrade the C2BMC system in 2015 to address new  threats and, in 2017, to integrate additional sensors and improve the  ability of Aegis BMD to launch an interceptor before its shipboard  radar acquires a threat missile. In 2018, for Phase 3 of the EPAA,  MDA plans additional C2BMC upgrades, including some that would  enable the Aegis BMD to intercept missiles based on tracks passed  through C2BMC from forward-based AN/TPY-2 X-band radars,  without having to detect the threat with its own radar. However, our  current and previous work indicates that some capability upgrades to  C2BMC for Phase 3 of the EPAA have been deferred indefinitely,  which DOD did not reference in its June 2014 report. For example,  according to our analysis of MDA\u2019s system engineering  documentation, we found that MDA has deferred the delivery of a key  C2BMC capability that would further integrate the BMD system and  improve its management of limited BMD resources by allowing  C2BMC to directly send engagement commands to interceptor  systems. According to the Director, Operational Test and Evaluation,  effective \u201cbattle management\u201d requires C2BMC to not only collect and  process information from sensors and weapons, as it currently does,  but to also determine which threats should be engaged by which  weapon to produce the highest probability of engagement success  and then transmit this information back to the sensors and weapons.", "Aegis BMD Weapon System: DOD\u2019s report did not fully describe the  performance and acquisition risks to the Aegis BMD systems slated  for Phase 2 of the EPAA, which we have identified through our prior  work. Aegis BMD is the primary interceptor system for EPAA. MDA  plans upgrades for Phase 2 of the EPAA that increase the types and  number of threats it can engage. However, in April 2014, we found  that one SM-3 Block 1B failed in flight during an interceptor test in  September 2013, which, according to our current work, could increase  reliability risk. Since then, DOD officials told us that MDA is seeking  to maintain reliability of the interceptor by developing a redesign; it is  unclear when this redesign will be flight-tested. MDA told us that it  plans to ground-test the redesign. Moreover, our reviews of MDA\u2019s  Aegis BMD Baseline Execution Reviews from April 2013, August  2013, and June 2014 indicated that the certification of a new version  of Aegis BMD software called Aegis BMD 4.1, which is needed for  Phase 2, had been delayed at least 3 months past Phase 2  declaration. Additionally, based on our analysis of MDA\u2019s August  2013 and June 2014 Baseline Execution Reviews, MDA continues to  discover software defects faster than it is able to fix them for another  version of Aegis BMD, also planned for Phase 2 of the EPAA.  Furthermore, although DOD officials told us that the Aegis Ashore  program is on track, our review of MDA\u2019s March 2014 test  documentation identified schedule slips that delayed Aegis Ashore\u2019s  participation in key interoperability tests, compressing the time to  rectify issues should they be discovered prior to the planned Phase 2  declaration in 2015.", "DOD officials who developed the June 2014 regional BMD report told us  that they used their best judgment in determining the appropriate level of  detail for the report. The officials added that their goal was to address  each of the required reporting elements concisely. Furthermore, they  explained that they regularly provide more detailed analysis on some of  these topics to congressional defense committees via periodic briefings,  and that they did not want to provide duplicative or unnecessary  information. Although we recognize the need for professional judgment by  DOD officials when preparing the report, our review concluded that  DOD\u2019s report did not include details that we believe could have made the  report more useful to Congress in its oversight of DOD\u2019s regional BMD  programs.
