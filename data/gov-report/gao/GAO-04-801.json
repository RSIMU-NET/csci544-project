The Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS) administers the national regulatory program to ensure safe pipeline transportation.

This study reports on (1) the effectiveness of OPS's enforcement strategy and (2) OPS's actions for assessing monetary sanctions (civil penalties), among other things."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The effectiveness of OPS's enforcement strategy cannot be determined because the agency has not set goals for its enforcement program, fully defined its strategy, or established performance measures linked to goals that would allow an assessment of results. These are key elements of effective management. Without these elements, the agency cannot determine whether recent changes in its strategy are having the desired effects on pipeline safety. Over the past several years, OPS has placed priority on other areas--developing a new risk-based regulatory approach--and it believes these efforts will change the safety culture of the industry. OPS now intends to devote more attention to strengthening the management of the agency's enforcement program. In particular, OPS is developing an enforcement policy that will help define its enforcement strategy and has made some initial steps toward identifying new performance measures. However, OPS does not anticipate finalizing such a policy until sometime during 2005 and lacks a systematic approach for incorporating some of the key practices identified for achieving successful performance measurement systems. OPS has increased both the number and the size of the penalties it has assessed against pipeline operators over the last 4 years (2000 through 2003) following its decision to be \"tough but fair\" in assessing penalties. During this period, OPS assessed an average of 22 penalties per year, compared with an average of 14 per year for the previous 5 years (1995 through 1999), a period of more lenient enforcement. In addition, the average penalty amount increased from $18,000 to $29,000 over the two periods. While civil penalty use and size has increased, it is not clear whether this action will help deter noncompliance with the agency's safety regulations. Stakeholders expressed differing views: some thought that any penalty had a deterrent effect if it kept the pipeline operator in the public eye, while others told us that the penalties were too small to be effective sanctions. About 94 percent of the 216 penalties levied from 1994 through 2003 have been paid. However, OPS lacks effective management controls to assure that penalties are collected. For example, OPS does not routinely inform its collection agent of penalties it has assessed."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["While pipelines are inherently safer to the public than other modes of  freight transportation, the volatile nature of the products they carry means  that pipeline accidents can have serious consequences.

Property and other damages or  losses totaled almost $1 million.", "The Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS), within the Department of  Transportation\u2019s Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA),  administers the national regulatory program to ensure the safe  transportation of natural gas and hazardous liquids by pipeline. The office  attempts to ensure the safe operation of pipelines through regulation,  national consensus standards, and oversight of the industry through  inspections and enforcement actions when safety problems are found. The  office uses a variety of enforcement tools, including some, such as  compliance orders, that require pipeline operators to correct underlying  safety violations. OPS may also impose monetary sanctions (civil penalties)  on pipeline operators for violations of its pipeline safety regulations.", "In May 2000, we reported, among other things, that OPS had reduced its use  of civil penalties and increased its use of administrative actions (such as  warning letters) without assessing the effects of these changes on pipeline  safety compliance. The Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002 directed  that we (1) evaluate the effectiveness of OPS\u2019s enforcement strategy and  (2) examine OPS\u2019s assessment of civil penalties. These topics form the  major focus of this report. To meet other requirements of the act and your  interests, we are also reporting on how OPS enforces pipeline safety and  how its enforcement policies and procedures have changed over time,  whether OPS substitutes civil penalties for another form of enforcement,  and how OPS\u2019s use of civil penalties compares with that of the Federal  Aviation Administration (FAA), which oversees aviation safety. These  issues are discussed in appendix II. Finally, we are reporting on how the  office responded to the recommendations in our May 2000 report and  whether industry and economic trends have influenced OPS\u2019s enforcement  actions. These issues are discussed in appendixes III and IV.", "To evaluate the effectiveness of OPS\u2019s enforcement strategy, we  determined the extent to which the office\u2019s strategy incorporates several  elements that are important for effective program management:  clear  program goals, a well-defined strategy for achieving goals, and  performance measures that are linked to program goals. We identified  elements of effective program management by reviewing our products on  this topic as well as other key literature, such as Office of Management and  Budget guidance, on this subject. We interviewed OPS officials and  reviewed documents about the agency\u2019s activities and plans related to each  of these elements. We interviewed pipeline safety stakeholders, including  industry trade associations, federal agencies, state pipeline agencies and  associations, a local representative from Virginia, and pipeline safety  advocacy groups, to determine their views on the effectiveness of OPS\u2019s  enforcement efforts. To examine OPS\u2019s assessment of civil penalties  against pipeline operators, we analyzed the extent to which OPS proposed  and assessed civil penalties from 1994 through 2003 and pipeline operators  have paid them.  (FAA\u2019s general accounting division collects civil penalties  for OPS.)  We also analyzed data from OPS on its enforcement actions and  from FAA on its collection of civil penalties. We examined OPS\u2019s  procedures and actions to ensure that the safety violations that lead to civil  penalties are remedied. We interviewed stakeholders on whether OPS\u2019s  civil penalties help deter safety violations. As part of our review, we  assessed the internal controls and the reliability of the data elements  needed for this engagement. We determined that the data elements were  sufficiently reliable for our purposes, except for those that would allow us  to determine the timeliness of civil penalty payments. This exception did  not create a major impediment in reporting on OPS\u2019s use of civil penalties.

By one measure, the reduction in accidents overall, the  hazardous liquid pipeline industry has greatly improved its safety record  over the past 10 years. (See fig. 2.)  From 1994 through 2003, accidents on  interstate hazardous liquid pipelines decreased from 245 in 1994 to 126 in  2003, or almost 49 percent. These accidents resulted in an average of 2  fatalities and 8 injuries per year. However, the industry\u2019s safety record has  not improved for accidents with the greatest consequence\u2014those resulting  in a fatality, an injury, or in property damage of $50,000 or more\u2014called  serious accidents in this report. The number of serious accidents stayed  about the same over the 10-year period. The lack of significant change over  time in the number of serious accidents on interstate hazardous liquid  pipelines may be due in part to the relatively small number of these  accidents\u2014about 88 every year. The accident rate\u2014which considers the  amount of product and the distance it is shipped\u2014followed a similar  pattern. The accident rate for hazardous liquid pipelines overall decreased  from about 0.41 accidents per billion ton-miles shipped in 1994 to about  0.25 accidents per billion ton-miles shipped in 2002. The accident rate for  serious interstate hazardous liquid pipeline accidents stayed the same,  averaging about 0.15 accidents per billion ton-miles shipped from 1994  through 2002.", "In contrast to hazardous liquid pipelines, accidents on interstate natural  gas pipelines increased from 81 in 1994 to 97 in 2003, or almost 20 percent.  (See fig. 3.)  These accidents resulted in an average of 3 fatalities and 10  injuries per year. The number of serious accidents on interstate natural gas  pipelines also increased, from 64 in 1994 to 84 in 2003, though they have  fluctuated considerably over this period. Information on accident rates for  natural gas pipelines is not available because of the lack of data on natural  gas shipped through pipelines. As with hazardous liquid pipelines, the lack  of significant change over time in the number of total accidents and serious  accidents on interstate natural gas pipelines may be due in part to the  relatively small number of these accidents\u2014about 65 every year.", "OPS, within RSPA, administers the national regulatory program to ensure  the safe operation of the nation\u2019s natural gas and hazardous liquid  pipelines. OPS has carried out its oversight responsibility by developing  and issuing prescriptive minimum safety standards and enforcing these  standards. Recently, the agency has developed additional standards that  are risk based and focus on improving pipeline operators\u2019 management of  their operations rather than on meeting prescriptive requirements. In 1999,  to reduce the risk of accidents attributable to human error, OPS issued a  new operator qualification regulation requiring pipeline operators to  develop programs for ensuring that individuals working on their pipeline  systems are qualified to do so. In 2000, to better focus on safety risks that  are unique to individual pipelines, OPS issued the first in a series of  integrity management regulations requiring operators to better protect  pipeline segments where a leak or rupture could have a significant effect on  densely populated or environmentally sensitive areas (called high- consequence areas).  Under this new risk-based regulatory approach,  operators must, in addition to meeting minimum safety requirements,  develop comprehensive plans for identifying the range of risks facing these  segments and taking actions to mitigate these risks. According to OPS, it is  devoting a large portion of its resources to implementing the integrity  management program. OPS issued integrity management requirements for  large hazardous liquid pipeline operators (those with 500 or more miles of  pipeline) in December 2000, for small hazardous liquid pipeline operators  in January 2002, and for natural gas transmission pipeline operators in  December 2003. The agency is carrying out inspections of operators\u2019  compliance with these requirements in separate phases, starting with  inspections of large hazardous liquid operators from September 2002  through April 2004. In all, the agency will need to inspect the integrity  management programs of more than 1,000 individual operators of  hazardous liquid and natural gas transmission pipelines.", "To improve pipeline safety, OPS carries out several types of activities. First,  it develops and issues pipeline safety regulations and supports national  consensus standards, which provide additional guidance to pipeline  operators in managing their pipeline systems safely. In addition, OPS  undertakes oversight activities, which include inspections to determine  compliance with its regulations, accident investigations, and enforcement.  Finally, OPS administers other programs\u2014including, for example, research  and development to enhance pipeline safety technologies, data collection  to better define pipeline-related problems and concerns, and education to  prevent excavation-related damage.", "When OPS finds a violation\u2014such as the failure of an operator to inspect  various aspects of its pipeline\u2014during an inspection or an investigation  after an accident, it may take one of several types of enforcement or  administrative actions depending on the nature and severity of the  violation. (See table 1.)  An enforcement action may require the operator to  correct an unsafe condition or practice, or the enforcement action may be a  civil penalty (monetary fine). An administrative action notifies a pipeline  operator of a safety concern that is not serious enough to require an  enforcement action.", "When imposing civil penalties, OPS must by law consider seven factors:  (1)  the nature, circumstances, and gravity of the violation; (2) the degree of the  operator\u2019s culpability; (3) the operator\u2019s history of prior offenses; (4) the  operator\u2019s ability to pay; (5) any good faith shown by the operator in  attempting to achieve compliance; (6) the effect on the operator\u2019s ability to  continue doing business; and (7) other matters as justice may require.  Before OPS imposes a civil penalty, it issues the pipeline operator a notice  of probable violation that documents the alleged violation and identifies  the proposed civil penalty amount. OPS then allows the operator to present  additional evidence either in writing or in an informal hearing. Attorneys  from RSPA\u2019s Office of Chief Counsel preside over these hearings. Evidence  presented by the operator may result in the civil penalty being affirmed,  reduced, or withdrawn. If, after this step, the hearing officer determines  that a violation occurred, OPS\u2019s associate administrator issues a final order  that requires the operator to correct the safety violation (if needed) and pay  the penalty (termed \u201cassessed penalties\u201d in this report). The operator has  20 days after the final order is received to pay the penalty. FAA collects civil  penalties for OPS.", "From 1992 through 2002, federal law allowed OPS to assess up to $25,000  for each day that a violation continued, not to exceed $500,000 for any  related series of violations. In December 2002, the Pipeline Safety  Improvement Act increased these amounts to $100,000 and $1 million,  respectively.", "OPS is a small federal agency. In fiscal year 2003, OPS employed about 150  people\u2014about half of whom were pipeline inspectors. In contrast, the  Federal Railroad Administration, another agency within the Department of  Transportation, employs 855 people, including more than 400 inspectors to  enforce rail safety regulations. In addition, FAA, the agency within the  Department of Transportation responsible for the safety of civil aviation,  employed about 48,500 people in fiscal year 2003. About 4,000 of these  employees were safety inspectors. For fiscal year 2003, OPS received about  $66.8 million in appropriations and about $17.5 million from the Pipeline  Safety Fund.", "OPS retains full responsibility for enforcing regulations on interstate  pipelines, and it certifies states to perform these functions for intrastate  pipelines. Currently, OPS has agreements with 11 states, known as  interstate agents, to help it inspect segments of interstate pipeline within  these states\u2019 boundaries. However, OPS undertakes any enforcement  actions identified through inspections conducted by interstate agents.

Before 2000, the agency had emphasized partnering with the pipeline  industry to improve pipeline safety rather than punishing noncompliance.  In 2000, in response to concerns that its enforcement was weak and  ineffective, the agency decided to institute a \u201ctough but fair\u201d enforcement  approach and committed to making greater use of all its enforcement tools,  including larger civil penalties. In 2001, to further strengthen its  enforcement, the agency began issuing more corrective action orders  requiring operators to address safety problems that led to pipeline  accidents. In 2002, OPS created an Enforcement Office to put more focus  on enforcement and help ensure consistency in enforcement decisions.  However, the agency has not yet filled key positions in this office.", "OPS was making these changes in its enforcement strategy at the same  time that it was significantly changing its overall approach for overseeing  pipeline safety. In particular, in 2000 the agency began implementing its  new integrity management program, which requires operators to  systematically manage risks to their pipelines in areas where an accident  could have the highest consequences. The agency believes that pipeline  accidents in these high-consequence areas will decrease because operators  are required, under this risk-based approach, to identify and repair  significant defects in pipelines located in these areas. Officials have  emphasized that they believe this program is improving the safety culture  of the pipeline industry and has a greater potential to improve safety than  enforcing OPS\u2019s traditional minimum safety standards. According to these  officials, in the last several years, they have placed a priority on developing  and implementing this risk-based regulatory approach and on developing a  sound approach for overseeing pipeline operators\u2019 fulfillment of the  agency\u2019s new requirements. For example, OPS has developed detailed  protocols and guidance for inspecting operators\u2019 identification of risks and  resulting repairs and has developed new information systems for tracking  the status of issues identified in these inspections. OPS has developed a  similar approach for overseeing these companies\u2019 fulfillment of its new  requirements for ensuring that their employees are qualified to operate  pipeline systems. According to OPS officials, the agency plans to use these  new oversight approaches as a model for improving its oversight of  operators\u2019 compliance with its minimum safety requirements. Officials  have emphasized that their efforts to raise safety standards, inspect  pipeline operators against these standards, investigate accidents, and take  enforcement actions collectively represent an overall systematic approach  to improving pipeline safety.", "In 2002, OPS began to enforce its new integrity management and operator  qualification standards, in addition to its minimum safety standards. For  integrity management, the agency has primarily used notices of  amendment, which require improvements in procedures rather than  stronger enforcement actions to give pipeline operators time to learn how  to build programs that meet OPS\u2019s complex standards. OPS has recently  started to make greater use of civil penalties in enforcing these standards.  The agency has also used a mix of enforcement actions in enforcing its  operator qualification standards. OPS\u2019s use of civil penalties, corrective  action orders, and notices of amendment was significantly greater in 2003  than it was in 1999, the year before OPS started changing its enforcement  strategy. (See fig. 4.)", "According to OPS\u2019s associate administrator, the agency has made  significant progress in implementing its integrity management program and  now needs to devote more attention to strengthening the management of  its enforcement program. Consequently, OPS has recently begun to  \u201creengineer\u201d this program. Efforts under way include developing a new  enforcement policy and guidelines, developing a streamlined process for  handling enforcement cases, modernizing and integrating the agency\u2019s  inspection and enforcement databases, meeting with stakeholders to  obtain their views on how to make the enforcement action fit the violation,  and hiring additional staff devoted to enforcement.

A number of other  agency efforts\u2014including the development of new safety standards,  inspections, and initiatives to help communities prevent damage to  pipelines\u2014are also designed to achieve these goals.", "The above performance goals are useful agencywide safety goals because  they identify the end outcomes, or ultimate results, that OPS seeks to  achieve through its various efforts. However, OPS has not established goals  for its enforcement program that identify the intermediate outcomes, or  direct results, the enforcement program seeks to achieve. Intermediate  outcomes show progress toward achieving end outcomes. For example,  enforcement actions can result in improvements in pipeline operators\u2019  safety performance that can subsequently result in reduced pipeline  accidents and spills. OPS managers have told us that the desired direct  results of enforcement actions are deterring noncompliance with safety  standards, reducing repeat violations of specific standards, and influencing  pipeline operators\u2019 safety performance by requiring safety improvements to  correct identified problems. Program outputs, such as enforcement  actions, can lead to such intermediate outcomes, which in turn can result in  the desired end outcomes of reduced accidents and spills.

In addition, although OPS\u2019s  authorizing statutes and regulations provide general guidance on the use of  various types of enforcement actions, the agency does not have up-to-date  detailed internal guidelines on the use of its enforcement actions that  reflect its current strategy. For example, OPS has an enforcement manual  that provides general guidance on the various types of enforcement actions  and how each should be used, but this guidance reflects the agency\u2019s  earlier, more lenient, approach to enforcement and does not specify the  types of situations that may warrant certain types of actions. In addition,  although OPS began enforcing its integrity management standards and  received greater enforcement authority under the Pipeline Safety  Improvement Act in 2002, it does not yet have guidelines in place for  enforcing these standards or implementing the new authority provided by  the act.", "An important internal control practice is to have policies and procedures  for each agency activity.

(See table 3. Also, see the previous section and app. II for a  discussion of changes in OPS\u2019s enforcement approaches.)   From 2000  through 2003, OPS proposed 127 civil penalties (about 32 per year on  average) compared with 94 civil penalties (about 19 per year on average)  from 1995 through 1999. Furthermore, of these proposed civil penalties, 88  were assessed from 2000 through 2003 (22 per year on average), whereas  70 were assessed from 1995 through 1999 (about 14 per year on average).  During the first 5 months of 2004, OPS proposed 38 civil penalties. While  the recent increase in the number and the size of OPS\u2019s civil penalties  occurred under the agency\u2019s new \u201ctough but fair\u201d enforcement approach,  other factors, such as more severe violations, may be contributing factors  as well.", "Overall, OPS does not use civil penalties extensively. Civil penalties  represent about 14 percent (216 out of 1,530) of all enforcement actions  taken over the past 10 years. OPS makes more extensive use of other types  of enforcement actions that require that operators act to correct safety  violations. In contrast, civil penalties do not require a safety improvement,  but represent a monetary sanction for violating safety regulations. Finally,  OPS expects to make greater use of civil penalties for violations identified  during integrity management inspections as it gains more experience with  implementing this safety approach.", "The sizes of the civil penalties have increased. From 1995 through 1999, the  average proposed civil penalty was about $19,000. From 2000 through 2003,  the average proposed civil penalty increased by over 132 percent to about  $45,000. Similarly, although to a lesser degree, assessed penalties  increased. From 1995 through 1999, the average assessed civil penalty was  about $18,000. From 2000 through 2003, the average assessed civil penalty  increased by 62 percent to about $29,000. (All amounts are in current year  dollars. Inflation was low during this period. If the effects of inflation are  considered, the average assessed penalty for 1995 through 1999 would be  $21,000, and the average assessed penalty for 2000 through 2003 would be  $30,000, in 2003 dollars.)", "We excluded two proposed penalties totaling over $5 million resulting from  the Bellingham and Carlsbad incidents from our analysis because both  were extraordinarily large (no other proposed penalty exceeded $674,000),  and OPS, as of mid-July, had not assessed a penalty for the Carlsbad  incident. (RSPA referred the penalty to the Department of Justice for  judicial action.)  Including these proposed penalties would have skewed  our results by making the average penalty appear larger than it actually is.", "For the 216 penalties that were assessed from 1994 through 2003, OPS  assessed the penalty that it proposed 69 percent of the time (150 civil  penalties). (See table 4.)  For the remaining 66 penalties, OPS reduced the  assessments by about 37 percent\u2014from a total of about $2.8 million to  about $1.7 million. However, the dollar difference between the proposed  and the assessed penalties would be over three times as large had our  analysis included the extraordinarily large penalty for the Bellingham,  Washington, incident. For this case, OPS proposed a $3.05 million penalty and had assessed $250,000 as of July 2004. If we include this penalty in our  analysis, then over this period OPS reduced total proposed penalties by  about two-thirds, from a total of about $5.8 million to about $2 million.", "According to an OPS official, the agency reduces penalties, among other  things, when the operator presents evidence that the inspector\u2019s finding is  weak or wrong or when the pipeline\u2019s ownership changes during the period  between the proposed and the assessed penalty. OPS\u2019s database does not  provide summary information on why penalties are reduced. It was not  practical for us to gather information on a large number of penalties that  were reduced because to do so would have required reviewing each penalty  record and discussing each penalty with headquarters and regional  officials. As a result, we are not able to provide information on the most  common reasons why penalties were reduced. To provide examples of  reasons why penalties were reduced, we reviewed several of these  penalties. OPS reduced one of the penalties we reviewed because the  operator provided evidence that OPS inspectors had miscounted the  number of pipeline valves that OPS said the operator had not inspected.  Thus, the violation was not as severe as OPS had stated, and OPS reduced  the proposed penalty from $177,000 to $67,000. OPS reduced another  proposed penalty from $45,000 to $27,000 because the operator took  immediate action to correct the violation. As indicated earlier in this report,  good faith efforts to achieve compliance by operators are one factor that  OPS must, by law, consider in imposing civil penalties. Because we  reviewed only a few instances in which penalties were reduced, we cannot  say whether these examples are typical.", "Our results may be different from the results that OPS reports because of  the way the data are organized. OPS reports an action in the year in which  it occurred. For example, OPS may propose a penalty in one year and  assess it in another year (and possibly collect it in still another year). The  data for this action would show up in multiple years. Thus, OPS\u2019s data  represent the activity that took place in any one year, but this presentation  does not allow users to determine the extent to which the proposed  penalties resulted in assessed penalties or whether the proposed penalty  amounts were reduced, since these actions may be contained in OPS  reports for different years. To better track the disposition of civil penalties,  we associated assessed penalties and penalty amounts with the year in  which they were proposed\u2014even if the assessment occurred in a later year."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Stakeholders Expressed Differing Views on Whether OPS\u2019s Civil Penalties Deter Noncompliance", "paragraphs": ["Although OPS has increased both the number and the size of the civil  penalties it has imposed, the effect of this change, if any, on deterring  noncompliance with safety regulations is not clear. The stakeholders we  spoke with expressed differing views on whether OPS\u2019s civil penalties deter  noncompliance. The pipeline industry officials we contacted said that to a  certain extent OPS\u2019s civil penalties encourage pipeline operators to comply  with pipeline safety regulations. One group of pipeline industry officials  said that pipeline companies want to be on the record as being in  compliance with pipeline safety regulations and therefore try to avoid any  situation that would require OPS to issue an enforcement action. However,  some industry officials said that OPS\u2019s enforcement actions are not the  operators\u2019 primary motivation for safety. Instead, they said that the pipeline  operators are motivated to operate safely because they need to avoid any  type of accident, incident, or OPS enforcement action that impedes the  flow of products through pipelines, hindering operators\u2019 abilities to provide  good service to their customers. Pipeline industry officials also said that  they want to operate safely and avoid pipeline accidents because such  accidents negatively affect the public\u2019s perception of the company. In  addition, other industry officials noted that OPS has other enforcement  actions, such as corrective action orders, that give operators more  incentive to operate safely because corrective action orders can cost  companies much more money than civil penalties. For example, according  to an OPS official, the corrective action order OPS imposed after the 1999  pipeline accident in Bellingham, Washington, cost Olympic Pipeline more  than $100 million. This sum includes about $53 million to repair and replace  needed infrastructure and an estimated $50 million in lost revenue. Finally,  the three pipeline operators with whom we spoke indicated that any  enforcement action would deter noncompliance with pipeline safety  regulations because of the resulting negative publicity and the potential for  costly private litigation against the operator.", "Most of the interstate agents and representatives of their associations,  insurance company officials, and the local representative from one state  expressed views similar to those of the pipeline industry officials. They  said that, to a certain extent, they believe civil penalties deter operators\u2019  noncompliance with regulations. For example, some of the interstate  agents said that civil penalties\u2014no matter what the amount\u2014are a  deterrent because the penalty puts the pipeline operator in the public eye.  However, a few disagreed with this point of view. For example,  representatives of the state associations and the local representative from  one state said that OPS\u2019s civil penalties are too small to be a deterrent and  that other OPS actions and the costs resulting from accidents, including  private litigation, are better deterrents. As discussed earlier, the average  civil penalty that OPS assessed from 2000 through 2003 was about $29,000.", "Pipeline safety advocacy groups that we talked to also believed that the  civil penalty amounts OPS imposes are too small to have any deterrent  effect on pipeline operators. However, a representative from one of the  groups thought that the threat of additional civil penalties from OPS should  influence a pipeline operator to comply with pipeline safety regulations in  the future.", "According to economic literature on deterrence, pipeline operators may be  deterred if they expect a sanction, such as a civil penalty, to exceed any  benefits of noncompliance. Such benefits could, in some cases, be lower  operating costs. The literature also recognizes that the negative  consequences of noncompliance\u2014such as those stemming from lawsuits,  bad publicity, and the value of the products lost from accidents\u2014can deter  noncompliance along with regulatory agency oversight. Thus, for example,  the expected costs of a legal settlement could overshadow the lower  operating costs expected from noncompliance, and noncompliance might  be deterred.", "According to OPS, its policy since 1999 has been to make civil penalty  information available to the public by publishing the final orders for all  enforcement actions and to also publish all administrative actions on its  Web site. We found that from 2000 through 2003 (the period OPS describes  as its \u201ctough but fair\u201d enforcement era), OPS had posted 58 percent of final  orders involving assessed civil penalties on its Web site. An agency official  explained that OPS has not posted the remaining penalties because of high  staff turnover.

In some instances, pipeline  operators pay their penalties based on the proposed\u2014rather than  assessed\u2014amount. Our results do not include an analysis of the number of  penalties paid prior to assessment because FAA\u2019s and OPS\u2019s data lacked  information necessary to complete the analysis.", "We followed up in one of the two instances in which the operator paid less  than the assessed amount. In this instance, the operator requested that OPS  reconsider the civil penalty, and OPS reduced the assessed penalty from  $5,000 to $3,000 because the operator had a history of cooperation and OPS  wanted to encourage future cooperation.", "Neither FAA\u2019s nor OPS\u2019s data show why the 14 unpaid penalties have not  been collected. To learn why, we spoke with both agencies about the status  of these penalties and, based on the information provided, we determined  that OPS closed 2 of the penalty cases without collecting the penalties,  operators are appealing 5 penalties, OPS recently assessed 3 penalties, and  OPS acknowledged that 4 penalties (totaling $45,200) should have been  collected.

We then determined the  extent to which the office\u2019s strategy incorporates these three elements  (clear program goals, a well-defined strategy for achieving goals, and  measures of performance that are linked to program goals). For each  element, we obtained information from OPS on its activities and plans and  compared this information to the published criteria. We also reviewed the  Web sites of selected regulatory agencies to determine how these other  agencies measure enforcement results. As part of this work, we monitored  OPS\u2019s efforts to develop a strategy that applies to all its enforcement  activities and to improve its performance measurement capabilities. We  supplemented these activities by interviewing pipeline safety stakeholders  to obtain their views on the effectiveness of OPS\u2019s enforcement efforts.  These stakeholders included industry trade associations, federal agencies,  state agencies and associations, a local representative from Virginia, and  pipeline safety advocacy groups.

(Since  1993, FAA\u2019s general accounting division has managed the accounts  receivable for OPS\u2019s pipeline safety and RSPA\u2019s hazardous materials  programs.)  We discussed FAA\u2019s collection activities with OPS, RSPA\u2019s  Office of Chief Counsel, and FAA officials.", "In developing information about OPS\u2019s use of civil penalties, we analyzed  civil penalty data from OPS\u2019s enforcement database and FAA\u2019s civil penalty  receivables and collections database. Because neither OPS\u2019s nor FAA\u2019s civil  penalty data were complete, we combined them into a single database. The  data were incomplete in three ways. First, the OPS data set included  penalties that were not in the FAA data set. Second, each data set had fields  (variables) not contained in the other data set. Third, certain fields were  common to both data sets, but the data for a particular enforcement action  were present in one data set and missing in the other data set. For such  variables, we substituted the available data for the missing data when  possible. In addition, OPS and FAA sometimes used different methods for  numbering penalties. We converted all penalty numbers to a standard  format so we could combine the two data sets. When data were  inconsistent with other logically related data, we corrected the data using  our best judgment. For example, if OPS data showed that the assessed  amount was $75,000, but both OPS and FAA data showed that the proposed  amount was $10,500 and FAA data showed that both the final order and  collected amount was $7,500 without any notation for the difference  between $7,500 and $75,000, we assumed that the $75,000 amount was a  data entry error and corrected the assessed amount to be consistent with  the collected amount. When possible, we supplemented data in the two  data sets with data from other sources. For example, if OPS\u2019s Web site  included a final notice with the assessed penalty amount, but this  information was not captured in the data sets, we added the information to  the combined data set. We also discussed our preliminary results with OPS  and FAA, and their comments led to further corrections. For example, the  combined OPS and FAA data suggested that 16 penalties had not been  collected. After we discussed this information with OPS and FAA, they  provided documentation showing that many fewer penalties were  uncollected. For example, as discussed in the body of the report, FAA  reported to us that 2 penalties had been paid recently, which was not  reflected in the information reported to us by OPS. In addition, we  determined that OPS closed 2 of the penalty cases without collecting the  penalties, operators are appealing 5 penalties, OPS recently assessed 3  penalties, and OPS acknowledged that 4 penalties (totaling $45,200) should  have been collected.", "In determining how OPS used its enforcement options to address  noncompliance with pipeline safety regulations, we analyzed enforcement  data for enforcement actions opened between 1994 and 2003 from OPS\u2019s  enforcement database and FAA\u2019s civil penalty database. OPS\u2019s enforcement  database contains information about instances when OPS has taken some  type of enforcement action. OPS officials acknowledged that OPS\u2019s  enforcement database lacked complete information on penalty collections  and indicated that FAA tracks the collection of OPS\u2019s civil penalties. To  assess the reliability of OPS\u2019s and FAA\u2019s data, we (1) performed electronic  testing for obvious errors in accuracy and completeness and (2)  interviewed officials from OPS\u2019s enforcement office and FAA\u2019s general  accounting division who are knowledgeable about the data and how the  data were entered. We consulted regularly with these officials to resolve  the handling of problematic data entries. After these actions, and after  making needed corrections, we determined that the data were sufficiently  reliable for the types of analyses we wanted to pursue for this report except  to determine whether operators paid penalties in a timely manner. In this  instance, the discrepancies between OPS\u2019s and FAA\u2019s data and between  FAA\u2019s data and the case files we reviewed were too great for the data to be  judged reliable. For example, we found that the collection dates in FAA\u2019s  database did not match the hard-copy documentation for about half of 20  cases that we reviewed by hand.", "OPS identifies each enforcement action in its enforcement database with a  unique number. This number identifies the region, the year OPS initiated  the action, the type of operator, and some types of enforcement actions.  OPS\u2019s numbering system had certain characteristics that limited our ability  to analyze the data as fully as we wanted. For example, the system does not  identify enforcement actions where OPS used more than one type of  enforcement, such as those that have both a compliance order and a notice  of amendment, and it does not identify actions that have a compliance  order. Therefore, we asked OPS to provide additional information detailing  the enforcement and administrative actions taken in each instance. We  used these data to divide the enforcement data into four sets of  enforcement actions:  civil penalties, other enforcement actions,  administrative actions, and complex actions.", "As discussed earlier in this report, our reporting of enforcement actions  differs from OPS\u2019s. Whereas we report these actions for the year when OPS  first responded to the related violation, OPS, in its annual enforcement  summary report, reports the enforcement actions it has taken during that  year, regardless of when it first responded to the related violations. The two  reporting methods are not comparable.", "As a means of better understanding OPS\u2019s civil penalty process, we  reviewed 20 civil penalty actions initiated between 1992 through 2003. We  chose penalties that, on their face, appeared large or small, seemed to have  gone unpaid for a long period, may have involved repeat offenders, or  appeared to have been reduced between the assessment and the collection.  We reviewed the case file documentation and discussed the penalty with  headquarters and regional enforcement officials. The number of penalties  we reviewed was not large enough (usually about two to three penalty  actions for each criterion we used) to draw any insights. Reviewing these  files was time consuming, and reviewing a larger number of files, as well as  obtaining any supporting documentation from the regional offices that  initiated them, was not practical.", "In determining whether OPS\u2019s civil penalties deter noncompliance, we  interviewed pipeline safety stakeholders to obtain their views on the  deterrent effect of OPS\u2019s civil penalties.

OPS trained inspectors to complete  inspection forms that covered all operations, but did not differentiate  between high-risk and low-risk requirements. Individual OPS inspectors  primarily conducted inspections on a unit basis. OPS used all  enforcement options.", "Risk management demonstration phase\u2014During this phase, OPS  still focused most of its resources on enforcing minimum safety  standards, but it also began to encourage individual operators to focus  their resources on the greatest risks to their pipeline systems. OPS also  began to use teams of OPS inspectors to evaluate an operator\u2019s entire  pipeline system. The inspection goal was to determine whether the  operator had any systemic safety issues that it needed to address. OPS  emphasized partnering with the pipeline operators to improve pipeline  safety rather than punishing noncompliance. As a result, OPS issued  fewer civil penalties and more administrative actions to address  noncompliance.", "Integrity management phase\u2014In this phase, OPS shifted its focus  from enforcing minimum safety standards to more comprehensive  inspections of pipeline operators, known as the integrity management  program. As a result, OPS conducted fewer inspections because each  inspection took more time and covered more miles of pipeline than a  standard inspection. However, the integrity management inspections  identified more violations than if OPS had continued inspections of the  more established minimum safety standards. OPS concentrated its  enforcement actions on ensuring that operators\u2019 risk identification and  mitigation procedures were sufficient and primarily relied on its notices  of amendment to give operators experience in implementing the  complex regulations. More recently, OPS has begun to propose civil  penalties. OPS is also developing a new enforcement tool\u2014the safety  order\u2014that encourages operators to take action to remedy safety- related conditions. OPS plans to use the safety order to direct the  operator to remedy safety-related conditions that could significantly  change or restrict pipeline operations; however, unlike the conditions  identified in a corrective action order, these would be conditions that  did not pose an immediate threat to life or property. Tremendous  pipeline failures in Bellingham, Washington, in June 1999 and in  Carlsbad, New Mexico, in August 2000, and reports by the Department  of Transportation\u2019s Inspector General and by us led OPS to abandon its  partnering approach in favor of what it termed a \u201ctough but fair\u201d  enforcement approach."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OPS Does Not Substitute Corrective Action Orders for Civil Penalties", "paragraphs": ["According to OPS, the agency does not substitute corrective action orders  for civil penalties because OPS levies corrective action orders and civil  penalties for different reasons. OPS imposes a corrective action order on a  pipeline operator when it finds a situation that presents an imminent  hazard to life or property that needs to be addressed. OPS does not have to  find that the operator has violated its regulations before issuing a  corrective action order. For example, earlier this year, OPS issued a  corrective action order that directed an operator to reduce operating  pressure when OPS could not determine the cause of a pipeline failure. In  contrast, civil penalties are not used to correct the underlying safety  violations. Rather, OPS uses civil penalties as sanctions for violating federal  pipeline safety regulations and uses other enforcement tools, such as  corrective action orders, to correct safety violations. For example, in 2001,  OPS assessed a $37,500 civil penalty against an operator that did not follow  OPS\u2019s procedures during an annual test of the company\u2019s emergency  shutdown system. OPS used the penalty as a sanction and took no further  action. In this case, the operator already had a procedure in place but did  not follow it. If OPS had found that the operator\u2019s procedures were  inadequate, it could have both issued a notice of amendment requiring the  operator to bring its procedures in line with OPS\u2019s regulations and imposed  a civil penalty as a sanction for having inadequate procedures."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OPS and FAA Have Different Regulations and Processes for Using Civil Penalties", "paragraphs": ["Both OPS and FAA, in its oversight of the aviation industry, use civil  penalties, among other enforcement actions, to deter noncompliance with  their safety regulations.

(See table 5.)  The maximum penalties that each agency can impose differ  significantly. OPS may impose penalties for pipeline operators up to a  statutory maximum of $100,000 per day per violation up to a statutory  maximum of $1 million per case, whereas FAA may impose much smaller  penalties for aircraft operators\u2014up to $11,000 per violation of federal  aviation regulations or up to $30,000 per violation of RSPA\u2019s hazardous  materials regulations.

FAA\u2019s guidance lists types of violations with a corresponding range of civil  penalty amounts for each and also lists factors that should be considered in  setting the penalty level. OPS considers broad statutory factors in  determining civil penalty amounts and is developing more detailed  guidance for making these determinations as part of its efforts to develop  an enforcement policy and detailed internal guidelines that reflect its  current enforcement strategy.", "FAA issues many more civil penalties each year than OPS.

In addition, during this period, FAA reduced the civil penalties it  had proposed before assessing them to a much greater degree than did  OPS.
