Since 1998, U.S. personnel working in diplomatic  facilities overseas have faced increasing threats to their safety and  security, including numerous attacks in high-risk locations. On September  11, 2012, U.S. facilities in Benghazi, Libya, came under attack, and four  U.S. officials\u2014including the Ambassador\u2014were killed. In the same  month, a car bomb hit U.S. government vehicles in Pakistan, injuring two  Americans, and protesters in Egypt, Yemen, Sudan, and Tunisia overran  the U.S. embassies\u2019 security defenses and broke into the embassy  compounds. These attacks resulted in close scrutiny of the Department of  State\u2019s (State) security practices overseas. In response to these security  incidents over the years, and in light of its policy to maintain diplomatic  missions in Iraq, Afghanistan, and other increasingly dangerous  environments, State has taken a number of steps to enhance its risk  management and security efforts aimed at protecting U.S. personnel and  facilities at its overseas diplomatic posts.", "State\u2019s Bureau of Diplomatic Security (Diplomatic Security) is responsible  for the protection of people, property, and information at State\u2019s 275  overseas posts and 152 domestic locations.

Salaries for Diplomatic Security  personnel are managed  separately by State\u2019s Bureau of  Budget and Planning.", "Issue  Total funding for Diplomatic Security operations was almost $4.8 billion in  fiscal year 2016. Total funding for Diplomatic Security includes its bureau  managed funds as well as other funding\u2014such as personnel salaries\u2014 managed by other bureaus and offices but necessary for Diplomatic  Security operations. Diplomatic Security\u2019s bureau managed funds ($3.3  billion in fiscal year 2016) are composed of funds received through  annual appropriations, fees collected through visa processing,  reimbursements from other agencies, and appropriated funds carried  over from prior fiscal years. These funds support regular, ongoing  operations and Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) for temporary,  war-related operations. State directed an additional $1.5 billion to  Diplomatic Security and its employees in 2016, through other bureaus  and offices.", "Key Findings  In fiscal year 2016, Diplomatic Security\u2019s bureau managed funds totaled  approximately $3.3 billion. Bureau managed funds have increased in  response to multiple security incidents since the 1998 bombings of the  U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. (Fig. 1 shows that Diplomatic  Security\u2019s bureau managed funds had tremendous growth from 1998  through 2016 in both real and nominal dollars.)", "F Figure 1: Historical Trend in Department of State Bureau of Diplomatic Security Managed Funds, 1998-2016  From 1995 to 1998, Diplomatic Security\u2019s bureau managed funds  averaged about $173 million annually. After the 1998 bombings in Africa,  bureau managed funds grew to $784 million in 1999 as Congress  provided Diplomatic Security with emergency supplemental funding to  address security vulnerabilities at posts worldwide. By fiscal year 2009,  bureau managed funds had grown to about $2.0 billion, largely due to  new security procedures put in place after 1998 as well as the need to  provide security for diplomats in the conflict zones of Iraq and  Afghanistan. Bureau managed funds increased in 2010 to $2.7 billion and  in 2012 to $3.3 billion, as the U.S. military began to withdraw from Iraq  and Diplomatic Security assumed many of the protective and security  functions previously provided by the U.S. military in that country.  Congress appropriated less funding in 2013 to the Worldwide Security  Protection account because, according to Diplomatic Security,  appropriated funds were carried over from prior years. The subsequent  increases in funding for that account in 2014 through 2016 followed the  2012 attack in Benghazi, Libya.", "Since 2012, OCO supplemental funding has made up 34-62 percent of  Diplomatic Security\u2019s bureau managed funds. For example, in fiscal year  2016, OCO funding totaled over $2.0 billion\u2014or 62 percent\u2014of bureau  managed funds for that year. According to a bureau official, State\u2019s OCO  funding was intended to be temporary funding to support operations in  Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan but continues to exist, given the security  situation in those countries, and has expanded beyond those three  countries. Some State officials are concerned that if OCO is discontinued,  State would not have sufficient funding to provide necessary security  services. For fiscal year 2018, the administration is requesting less OCO  funding than the final appropriated amount for fiscal year 2017.", "Funding for Diplomatic Security operations totaled almost $4.8 billion in  fiscal year 2016. This amount includes both bureau managed funds\u2014 which were almost $3.3 billion\u2014and other funding directed to Diplomatic  Security and its employees but managed by other bureaus and offices  within State (personnel salaries, Antiterrorism Assistance funding, guard  services funding, and fraud prevention and detection fees), which totaled  almost $1.5 billion. For example, State\u2019s Bureau of Budget and Planning  manages the salaries of Diplomatic Security personnel. Funding for  Diplomatic Security personnel increased from $12 million in 2000 to $419  million in 2016. In addition, State allocates funding to its Bureau of  Overseas Buildings Operations for security construction at overseas  facilities.", "Point of Contact  For more information, contact:  Michael J.

Its workforce  includes direct-hire personnel,  military support, and contractors.  Posts also engage locally  employed staff.", "Issue  Over the last 2 decades, Diplomatic Security\u2019s mission and activities have  expanded in response to a number of security incidents, which has led to  a dramatic increase in the size of its workforce. The growth in its  responsibilities overseas began with the 1998 attacks in Africa and  continued with the U.S. policy of maintaining a diplomatic presence in war  zones such as Afghanistan and Iraq and other increasingly hostile  environments. In addition, the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks  underscored the importance of enhancing domestic security, including  Diplomatic Security\u2019s investigative capacity, technical programs, and  counterintelligence work. This sustained and at times rapid growth has  taxed Diplomatic Security\u2019s ability to staff positions with the appropriate  level of experience and skills.", "Key Findings  Diplomatic Security\u2019s workforce\u2014numbering over 51,000 direct-hire,  other U.S. government, and contract personnel as of May 2017\u2014has  experienced continued growth in almost all staffing categories. We  previously reported in 2009 that Diplomatic Security\u2019s direct-hire work  force doubled from 1998 to 2008. Since then, it has increased by another  36 percent to 3,488 personnel in 2017. If State\u2019s current hiring freeze is  lifted, Diplomatic Security officials told us that they plan to hire an  additional 384 special agents in 2017 through 2018. The number of other  U.S. government personnel reporting to Diplomatic Security increased by  60 percent, driven largely by the expansion of the Marine Security Guard  program after the 2012 Benghazi attacks. Diplomatic Security increased  its contracted and support staff by 22 percent. (Table 1 provides  information on the increases in Diplomatic Security staff from 2008  through 2017; see app. IV for further staffing details.)", "In response to a Benghazi Accountability Review Board recommendation,  State established a panel to reexamine Diplomatic Security\u2019s organization  and management. In 2013, the panel reported that, in part, Diplomatic  Security had become more focused on its law enforcement and personnel  protection functions. This was not surprising, according to the panel,  given that Diplomatic Security provided security in two war zones and  numerous other high-threat posts. Simultaneously, Diplomatic Security  had experienced an increased demand on its domestic criminal  investigative and dignitary protection programs.", "Nonetheless, the panel noted that Diplomatic Security\u2019s primary mission  is \u201cto provide a secure environment for the conduct of U.S. foreign  policy\u201d and stated that Diplomatic Security should reflect this priority in  its allocation of manpower and other resources. For example, the panel  recommended that Diplomatic Security review personnel allocations  both domestically and abroad. As of June 2017, Diplomatic Security had  completed an initial classified review of its staffing and begun a follow- on study to (1) determine how Diplomatic Security has distributed its  staff relative to its priorities; and (2) develop a methodology to assess  the quantity, mix, and distribution of Diplomatic Security staff worldwide.  According to Diplomatic Security, the second study is expected to result  in two tools that Diplomatic Security can use for evaluating its staffing  levels: one for domestic staffing and one for overseas staffing.", "In fiscal year 2010, we reported that 34 percent of Diplomatic Security\u2019s  positions were filled with officers below the position\u2019s grade. In 2013, the  organization and management panel noted that many Diplomatic  Security regional director positions were filled by officers holding ranks  below the levels established for that position (not including agents  posted to Baghdad, Iraq). The panel recommended that Diplomatic  Security prioritize filling these positions with at-grade personnel. While  State concurred, as of June 2017, it had not identified any new, concrete  actions for implementing this recommendation. Instead, State noted that  it \u201cwill continue to make every effort to place at-grade, experienced, and  highly qualified individuals into these positions.\u201d", "As of December 2016, Diplomatic Security had 422 staffed language- designated positions (LDP), of which 304\u2014or 72 percent\u2014were filled  with special agents who met the language requirement. This is an  improvement since 2009, when we reported that only 47 percent of  Diplomatic Security special agents at LDPs met the requirement.  Officials cited two reasons for this increase in compliance: (1) greater  agency emphasis on the need for agents to have language skills  following the 2012 Benghazi attacks and (2) increased emphasis on  speaking rather than reading skills. As a result, Diplomatic Security has  an increased number of \u201casymmetrical\u201d language requirements, where  the speaking-level requirement is higher than the reading-level  requirement. Diplomatic Security also adopted the \u201cAlert\u201d language  training program, which provides special agents with speaking skills  relevant to their technical work, particularly for languages spoken at  certain high-threat posts. State officials told us that agents can become  proficient in 10 weeks using this program, versus 30 weeks typically  required for traditional methods.", "Michael J.

What steps has Diplomatic Security taken to ensure that its positions  are filled with appropriately experienced staff?  3. What is State doing to further close the gaps in Diplomatic Security\u2019s  LDPs?", "Background  Responsibility for the security of  the Department of State\u2019s (State)  diplomatic facilities falls principally  on State\u2019s Bureaus of Overseas  Buildings Operations (OBO) and  Diplomatic Security (Diplomatic  Security). OBO is responsible for  the design, construction,  acquisition, maintenance, and sale  of U.S. diplomatic property abroad.  Diplomatic Security is responsible  for establishing security and  protective procedures at posts and  developing and implementing the  physical security programs.", "Maintaining the physical security of U.S. diplomatic facilities is a critical  component of ensuring the safety of U.S. personnel, property, and  information. According to OBO, State maintains approximately 1,600  work facilities at 275 diplomatic posts worldwide under chief-of-mission  authority. In addition, State has a limited number of temporary work  facilities, mostly in dangerous locations such as Afghanistan. All facilities  at a post are expected to meet physical security standards set by the  Overseas Security Policy Board. In fiscal years 2009 through 2016, State  allocated about $11.1 billion to the construction of new, secure facilities  and physical security upgrades to existing and acquired facilities. While  Diplomatic Security has a few small programs to provide physical security  upgrades to facilities abroad, OBO managed most of the allocated funds.", "Key Findings  Following the 1998 attacks on U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania,  State determined that diplomatic facilities in over 180 posts\u2014more than  half of U.S. overseas missions\u2014needed to be replaced to meet security  standards. In 1999, State began a new embassy construction program,  administered by OBO, to replace these posts. To expedite the delivery of  new, secure compounds, OBO adopted a standard embassy design  (SED) approach. However, some stakeholders raised concerns about the  aesthetics, quality, location, and functionality of those facilities. For  example, the 10-acre lot specified by the SED sometimes required  situating an embassy far from urban centers, where foreign government  offices and other embassies are located. In response to these concerns,  State established the \u201cExcellence\u201d approach in 2011. (See fig. 3 for a  picture of an embassy built under SED and a rendering of a consulate to  be delivered under the Excellence approach.)", "OBO\u2019s changes under the Excellence approach focus on producing more  innovative, functional, and sustainable embassies that are just as secure  as those built using the SED. However, some stakeholders have raised  concerns that the new approach may result in embassies that take longer  and cost more to build. This would delay getting U.S. personnel into   facilities that meet current security standards. In 2017, we reported that,  while the Excellence approach may result in improvements, it carries  increased risk to cost and schedule\u2014including up to 24 additional months  to develop designs. While OBO is attempting to manage this risk, it does  not have performance measures specific to the Excellence goals and,  therefore, cannot fully assess the merits of the new approach. We made  four recommendations to strengthen performance measures and  reporting, monitoring mechanisms, and data systems. While State  concurred with these recommendations, they remain open.", "When facilities do not or cannot meet certain security standards, State  works to mitigate identified vulnerabilities through various construction  programs and its waivers and exceptions process. However, in 2014, we  reported that the waivers and exceptions process had weaknesses. Of  the 43 facilities we reviewed, none met all applicable security standards  and therefore required waivers, exceptions, or both. However, we found  that neither posts nor headquarters systematically tracked the waivers  and exceptions and that State had no process to reevaluate waivers and  exceptions when the threat or risk changes. Furthermore, posts did not  always request required waivers and exceptions or consistently take  required mitigation steps. We concluded that with such deficiencies, State  cannot be assured it has all the information needed to mitigate facility  vulnerabilities. We made 13 recommendations for State to address gaps  in its security-related activities, standards, and policies. State generally  agreed with our recommendations and, as of June 2017, had addressed  five of them.", "Future State construction in dangerous posts\u2014such as Kabul,  Afghanistan\u2014will likely entail the continued use of temporary office or  residential facilities, especially in conflict areas. However, in 2015, we  found that in Kabul\u2014without security standards or other guidance to  guide temporary facility construction in conflict environments\u2014State  inconsistently applied alternative security measures that resulted in  insufficient and different levels of security for temporary offices and  housing as well as increased costs and extended schedules. We  concluded that without temporary facility security standards or guidance,  future construction in conflict environments could encounter similar  problems. We recommended that State consider establishing security  standards or guidance for temporary facilities in conflict zones. State  partially concurred and subsequently reported that it was developing  additional guidance relating to physical security systems such as  Hardened Alternative Trailer Systems, surface-mounted, antiram barriers,  and anticlimb wall toppings. As of May 2017, State was continuing to  address this recommendation.", "Michael J.

What progress has State made  in creating additional guidance relating to temporary facilities?", "Background  The Secretary of State, in  consultation with the heads of  other federal agencies, is  responsible for protecting U.S.  government personnel on official  duty abroad, along with their  accompanying dependents. At  overseas posts, the Department  of State\u2019s (State) Bureaus of  Diplomatic Security (Diplomatic  Security)\u2014represented by a  Regional Security Officer  (RSO)\u2014and Overseas Buildings  Operations share responsibility  for the security of residences and  other soft targets overseas.", "More than 25,000 U.S. diplomatic personnel live overseas with their  families in an environment that presents myriad security threats and  challenges. While State has taken measures to enhance security at its  embassies and consulates since the 1998 East Africa embassy  bombings, these same actions have given rise to concerns that would-be  attackers may shift their focus to what they perceive as more accessible  targets, such as diplomatic residences, schools, and other places  frequented by U.S. personnel and their families. For example, a 2014  posting on a jihadist website called for attacks on American and other  international schools in the Middle East. (See fig. 4 for examples of  diplomatic residences.)", "Key Findings  State acquires housing for overseas personnel by leasing, purchasing, or  constructing various types of residences, each of which is subject to a set  of security standards. State assesses risks to residences using a range of  activities\u2014including a periodic security survey to identify and address  vulnerabilities. In fiscal years 2010 through 2016, State allocated about  $175 million for residential security upgrades. However, in 2014, we  found that State did not complete all residential surveys as required,  thereby limiting its ability to address vulnerabilities. In addition, we  reviewed 68 overseas diplomatic residences and found that 38 did not  meet all of the applicable standards, potentially placing their occupants at  risk. In instances when a residence does not and cannot meet applicable  security standards, posts are required to either seek other residences or  request exceptions, which identify steps to mitigate vulnerabilities.  However, we found that Diplomatic Security had an exception on file for  only 1 of the 38 residences that did not meet all standards. We concluded  that without documenting the necessary exceptions, State lacked a  complete picture of security vulnerabilities at residences and information  that would enable it to make better risk management decisions. In  addition, more rigorous security standards that went into effect in July  2014 would likely increase posts\u2019 need for exceptions and lead to costs  for upgrades. We made four recommendations regarding the  management of risks to residences. State concurred with all four and, as  of May 2017, had addressed one. (Fig. 5 portrays key security standards  at a notional residence.)", "State has taken a variety of actions to manage risks to schools and other  soft targets. These actions fall into three main categories: (1) funding  security upgrades at K-12 schools with enrolled U.S. government  dependents and off-compound employee association facilities, (2) sharing  threat information and providing advice for mitigating threats at schools  and other soft targets, and (3) conducting security surveys to identify and  manage risks to schools and other soft targets. However, RSOs at most  of the posts we reviewed in 2015 were unaware of some guidance and  tools for securing these facilities\u2014such as a booklet and compact disc  entitled \u201cSecurity Guide for International Schools\u201d aimed at assisting  international schools in designing and implementing a security program.  As a result, we concluded that RSOs may not have been taking full  advantage of State\u2019s programs and resources for managing risks at soft  targets. We recommended that State take steps to ensure that RSOs are  aware of existing guidance and tools regarding the security of soft targets.  In response, State issued a cable to all diplomatic and consular posts  updating policies and procedures for State's Soft Targets Security  Upgrade Program for overseas schools and department-chartered  employee associations, thereby distributing important information to  security personnel who were previously unaware of available guidance  and information.", "Michael J.

To what extent has State adapted its Soft Targets Security Upgrade  Program in light of recent public terrorist attacks?", "Background  To help safeguard and prepare  U.S. personnel to live and work in  some of the most dangerous  overseas locations, the  Department of State\u2019s (State)  Bureau of Diplomatic Security  (Diplomatic Security) provides  training on personal security skills  necessary for recognizing,  avoiding, and responding to  potential terrorism and other  threat situations.  Diplomatic  Security  also provides refresher  briefings on certain topics, as well  as cyber and technical security  training. To consolidate the  hands-on training that Diplomatic  Security provides, State is  constructing a training center in  Fort Pickett, Virginia, which it  expects will be completed in  2019.", "Issue  State has a robust security awareness training program provided by  Diplomatic Security. For example, State requires specified U.S. personnel  traveling for less than 45 days in a calendar year to certain posts to  complete its online High Threat Security Overseas Seminar (HTSOS). If  specified U.S. personnel are traveling for 45 days or more in a calendar  year, State requires that they complete the 5-day Foreign Affairs Counter  Threat (FACT) training before departure. Diplomatic Security designed  the FACT course to address the dangers that U.S. personnel might face  in a number of high-threat, high-risk locations overseas. The course  provides hands-on instruction in topics such as detection of surveillance,  familiarization with firearms, and awareness of improvised explosive  devices (see fig. 6 for examples of other FACT training topics).", "Key Findings  State\u2019s oversight of compliance with the FACT training requirement has  weaknesses that limit its ability to ensure that U.S. personnel are  adequately prepared for work in high-threat environments. We reported in  2011 and 2014 that State did not have the ability to systematically identify  which people required to take the course had not taken it. We made  several recommendations to State to improve its management oversight  of compliance with mandatory FACT training. These included four  recommendations for State to update its policy guidance to reflect  changes made to the FACT training requirement in June 2013 (State had  doubled the number of countries for which it required FACT training) and  to provide clear information on which personnel are required to take  FACT training. State concurred with the recommendations and took steps  to address them. However, our recommendation that State monitor or  evaluate overall levels of compliance with the FACT training requirement  remains open. In May 2015, State officials said they were developing a  plan to utilize various electronic systems to monitor overall levels of  compliance with the FACT training requirement. As of June 2017, State  reported that it continues to work on this issue. This lack of oversight is  particularly concerning given the significant increase in the number of  students taking Diplomatic Security-provided FACT training, from 912 in  fiscal year 2006 to 4,482 in fiscal year 2016 (see fig. 7).", "In addition, in July 2014, State expanded the FACT training requirement  to apply to all posts (not just those in high-threat, high-risk locations) by  2019. The gaps we have previously identified in State oversight may  increase the risk that personnel do not complete FACT training,  potentially placing their own and others\u2019 safety in jeopardy.", "We reported in 2016 that weaknesses exist in State\u2019s guidance on and  management oversight of refresher briefings related to transportation  security, potentially putting U.S. personnel overseas at greater risk. We  found that personnel had difficultly remembering key details covered in  new arrival briefings or described the one-time briefings as inadequate.  We found that State lacked a clear requirement for Diplomatic Security to  provide and track compliance with periodic refresher briefings that could  help reinforce information covered in new arrival briefings. In part, this  may result from State guidance lacking clarity and comprehensiveness on  this matter. Specifically, its guidance states that regional security officers  must conduct refresher briefings \u201cperiodically\u201d at \u201ccertain posts where  personnel live under hostile intelligence or terrorist threats for long  periods\u201d but does not define \u201cperiodically\u201d or \u201clong periods.\u201d Further,  according to Diplomatic Security officials, there is no requirement for  affirming that post personnel have received refresher briefings. We  recommended that State clarify existing guidance on refresher briefings,  such as by delineating how often briefings should be provided at posts  facing  different types and levels of threats, which personnel should  receive them, and how their completion should be documented.  Diplomatic Security headquarters officials stated that most violations of  post travel policies are due to personnel forgetting the information  conveyed in new arrival briefings. Without effective reinforcement of the  information that is covered in new arrival briefings, State cannot ensure  that U.S. personnel and their families overseas have the knowledge they  need to protect themselves from transportation-related security risks."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Point of Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "For more information, contact:", "paragraphs": ["Michael J.

During this period, several  posts\u2014such as Embassy Bujumbura in Burundi and Consulate Adana in  Turkey\u2014evacuated post staff or family members on more than one  occasion. Overseas posts undergoing evacuations generally experience  authorized departure or ordered departure of specific post staff or family  members before leading to suspended operations. To help mitigate risks,  State requires posts to create Emergency Action Plans (EAP), practice  security drills and, if an evacuation is needed, review the event in order to  learn from the experience.", "Key Findings  State requires every post to update its EAP on an annual basis. EAPs  contain information to assist overseas posts in responding to  emergencies, such as checklists of response procedures and decision  points to help determine when to evacuate post staff or family members.  In 2017, we found that, from fiscal years 2013 through 2016, a quarter of  overseas posts, on average, were late completing required annual EAP  updates. While the completion rate improved from 46 percent to 92  percent of posts completing updates on time in fiscal years 2013 and  2016, respectively, our review of a nongeneralizable,  judgmental sample  of EAPs from 20 posts that had been approved by Diplomatic Security  showed that only 2 of 20 had updated all key EAP sections. We also  found that EAPs are viewed as lengthy and cumbersome documents that  are not readily usable in emergency situations, as required by State  policy. We recommended that State take several actions to improve their  EAPs, such as developing a procedure to ensure that overseas posts  complete comprehensive, annual EAP updates on time; develop  a  monitoring and tracking process to ensure EAP updates are reviewed;  and make  the EAP more readily usable during emergency situations.  State agreed with all of our recommendations and reported that it has  started to address them. For example, State is developing a redesigned  EAP that will minimize redundancy, group content according to posts\u2019  planning and response needs, and make the EAP better organized and  more user-friendly.", "Posts are required to conduct nine types of drills each fiscal year to  prepare for crises and evacuations. In 2017, we found that, on average  for fiscal years 2013 through 2016, posts worldwide reported completing  52 percent of required annual drills; posts rated high or critical for political  violence or terrorism reported completing 44 percent of these drills.  Overall, less than 4 percent of posts reported completing all required drills  during fiscal years 2013 through 2016. As shown in figure 8 below, 78  percent of posts reported completing duck-and-cover drills, but only 36  percent of posts reported completing evacuation training drills. We  recommended that State improve the completion and reporting of  required drills. State concurred and is updating the system it uses to  report drills.", "After an authorized or ordered departure has terminated, State\u2019s Foreign  Affairs Handbook requires post staff to transmit an after-action report  listing any lessons learned from the experience to State headquarters. In  2017, we found that, during fiscal years 2013 through 2016, there were  31 evacuations from overseas posts; however, according to State  officials, none of the posts submitted the required lessons learned report.  These reports could have been used to modify the post\u2019s guidance on  how to best respond to an emergency situation. According to State  officials, these reports also could help staff at other posts learn about the  challenges faced by the evacuated posts, identify relevant best practices,  and prepare for potential future evacuations. We recommended that State  take steps to improve the completion and submission of required lessons  learned reports following evacuations from overseas posts.

This support is particularly critical  in times of crisis, such as when  DOD provides security  reinforcements to facilities under  threat or assists with evacuations.  Several entities within DOD and  the Department of State (State)  prepare for and coordinate these  efforts. Memoranda of Agreement  between State and DOD  establish frameworks for  cooperation on scenarios  requiring security augmentation,  crisis response, and evacuation  for U.S. diplomatic and consular  missions overseas.", "The September 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya, and the related wave of  protests and threats to U.S. missions in Africa and the Middle East  prompted a reexamination of how State and DOD collaborate to provide  emergency military protection and other support to overseas posts. The  possibility of similar threats and attacks requiring additional DOD support  at U.S. diplomatic facilities is spread across a large geographic area.  Given the chaos and complexities inherent in such acute crises, and the  possibility that unrest could affect multiple U.S. facilities at one time, the  need for DOD support will likely continue. From 2013 to 2016, 24  overseas posts experienced some level of increased threat resulting in  the evacuation of some or all U.S. personnel. While not all periods of  increased threat warrant additional DOD assistance, many do. For  instance, in 2014 alone, the U.S. military provided support for embassy  reinforcement, military-assisted departures, or evacuations, including in  South Sudan, Libya, and Iraq. (Fig. 9 shows one of the DOD units and  aircraft that may be used in evacuations or other emergencies.)", "Key Findings  As part of the reorganization following the 2012 attacks, DOD\u2014in  coordination with State\u2014increased the military resources provided to  overseas posts. According to State and DOD officials, this represented a  whole-of-government approach to countering threats to U.S. overseas  personnel and facilities. Drawing from existing U.S. Marine Corps and  U.S. Army units, DOD created three dedicated military forces to respond  to crises across Africa and the Middle East: (1) a Special Purpose Marine  Air-Ground Task Force for Crisis Response (SPMAGTF-CR) assigned to  DOD\u2019s U.S. Central Command, which supports U.S. diplomatic missions  in the Middle East; (2) a SPMAGTF-CR assigned to U.S. Africa  Command, which supports U.S. missions in North and West Africa;  and (3) the East Africa Response Force, a U.S. Army force that supports  U.S. diplomatic missions in East Africa. These forces can provide a  variety of functions, from security reinforcement during increased threats,  to military-assisted departures and evacuation support. According to DOD  officials, in 2014, U.S. Africa Command experienced some logistical  challenges associated with covering such a large geographic area, with  particular concern should multiple crises occur simultaneously.", "In 2014, State and DOD announced several changes to the Marine  Security Guard (MSG) program, which deploys units of marines to  provide certain types of security to U.S. overseas missions. Specifically,  in coordination with State\u2019s implementation of the Benghazi Accountability  Review Board recommendations, DOD has since increased the size of  MSG detachments at all posts, with further increases at high-threat posts;  accelerated the deployment of additional detachments to other U.S.  diplomatic facilities; and created a Marine Security Guard Security  Augmentation Unit based in Quantico, Virginia, to provide additional  support on short notice. State and DOD officials reported in June 2017  that they have experienced some challenges associated with deploying  the increased MSG units, including obtaining sufficient numbers of  marines to fill the desired number of units and logistical and other support  at some posts. The agencies continue to work to add certain nonlethal  weapons to the MSG equipment set.", "In 2015, we reported on State and DOD\u2019s post-Benghazi approach to  provide additional military support to U.S. overseas posts. While State  and DOD had updated some guidance to reflect the new approach, we  recommended that the departments more clearly define the roles,  responsibilities, and circumstances under which DOD support would be  provided and that they update related interagency and departmental  guidance. In response to our recommendations, State and DOD have  taken steps to update such interagency guidance. These steps included  interdepartmental exercises and other collaboration, which resulted in a  joint concept paper and a subsequent December 2016 State-DOD  memorandum of agreement outlining common terms, roles,  responsibilities, and scenarios under which DOD assistance may be  requested, among other things. State and DOD officials have indicated  that each department will produce further department-specific guidance in  the form of a forthcoming diplomatic cable; a DOD update to a 2013  military order; and a new, related DOD instruction.

In June 2015, we found that RSOs at some  posts designated critical for terrorism were not complying fully with directions  from the Secretary of State to use terrorist reporting cables to report all  terrorism-related incidents or threats to ensure proper handling and  dissemination of the information. For example, we found that in some cases,  terrorism-related incidents were not reported in required terrorist reporting  cables. We concluded that without comprehensive and accurate reporting,  State may lack assurance that it received complete information about  terrorist threats that could help prevent and mitigate such threats. We  recommended that Diplomatic Security take steps to remind RSOs and posts   of the critical importance of using the proper type of cable to report all  terrorism-related threats. In December 2015, State sent guidance to all  posts specifying that terrorism-related threats must be reported through  terrorist reporting cables to ensure appropriate dissemination of the  information. Further, in January 2017, State provided reporting  instructions to RSOs to help ensure the timely and accurate reporting of  all security-related information through the correct reporting channels.", "Diplomatic Security uses various methods to communicate threat  information to overseas post personnel\u2014both U.S. and locally employed  staff. However, in our 2016 report on transportation security, we reported  that post personnel do not always receive threat information in time to  avoid potential threats. We found that several factors can lead to untimely  receipt of transportation-related threat information. We recommended that  State address these factors. First, some RSOs reported that they send  security notices exclusively to state.gov e-mail addresses; however, not  all post personnel have state.gov e-mail addresses. In one case, this  resulted in post personnel traveling through a prohibited area and an  embassy vehicle being attacked with rocks and seriously damaged.  Second, limited guidance existed for RSOs on how to promote timely  communication of threat information. Third, RSOs and other staff at some  posts mistakenly believed that RSOs cannot share threat information with  the official U.S. community until consular officials received approval from  State to share the same information with the nonofficial U.S. community\u2014 a clearance process that can take as long as 8 hours. State reported that  it is reviewing the option to forward e-mails outside its system. It also  reported that it is developing a two-way emergency notification system  that would provide a redundant method for distributing messages during  crises. In addition, State updated its policy manual to clarify that RSOs\u2019  sharing of threat information should not be delayed by the clearance  process, according to Diplomatic Security officials.", "To ensure that overseas posts can disseminate information to U.S.  citizens in country in the event of an emergency, disaster, or threat, State  requires posts to annually conduct a drill of the consular warden system.

However, we found in 2017 that, on  average between fiscal years 2013 and 2016, 78 percent of overseas  posts did not report the completion of required consular warden system  drills. We concluded that this gap in State\u2019s crisis and evacuation  preparedness creates a risk that U.S. citizens in country may be  insufficiently warned about emergency situations.

The number of information security incidents reported by  federal agencies\u2014including State\u2014increased from 5,503 in fiscal year  2006 to 77,183 in fiscal year 2015. Cyberattacks forced State to shut  down its unclassified e-mail system and parts of its public website in both  2014 and 2015 after finding evidence that its systems had been  breached. Cyber-based threats to federal systems and information come  from unintentional sources, such as natural disasters, coding errors, and  careless employees, or from intentional sources, such as disgruntled  insiders, hackers, or hostile nations. State\u2019s outdated technology makes it  increasingly difficult to ensure security. In addition, State\u2019s information  security program is split between two bureaus, each responsible for  aspects of the program. Further, State makes extensive use of  contractors to perform information security functions such as the  monitoring and assessment of systems.

Consequently, these systems warrant increased security to protect them.  Eighteen of these 24 agencies\u2014including State\u2014identified cyberattacks  originating from nation states as the most serious and frequent threat to  the security of their systems. They identified e-mail cyberattacks as the  most serious and frequent delivery method. We made recommendations  to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to improve security over  federal systems, including those at State.", "State relies on several aging and obsolete technology systems, which  require significant resources to operate and create challenges to ensuring  information security.

This segment of State\u2019s technology budget increased by  approximately $109 million between 2010 and 2015. A State official  stated that the increase is largely due to the cost of maintaining the  infrastructure, including meeting security requirements. For example,  three of State\u2019s visa systems were more than 20 years old. The software  for one of these systems is no longer supported by the vendor, creating   challenges related to information security.
