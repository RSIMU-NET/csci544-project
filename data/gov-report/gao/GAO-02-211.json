We  interviewed OSM officials for their perspective on the results of our review  and analysis of this information.", "To determine whether adequate processes exist to collect CFP debt, we  acquired an understanding of OSM\u2019s CFP debt collection policies and  procedures, as well as applicable federal laws and regulations.  We were  provided access to OSM\u2019s Civil Penalty Accounting Control System  database.  The database contained a universe of 490 cases that had CFP  receivables balances reduced to zero by collection or write-off (closed  cases) during fiscal years 1999 and 2000 or were outstanding (open cases)  CFP receivables balances as of September 30, 2000.  We further stratified  the database into cases representing debts greater than or equal to $100,000  (high-dollar cases) and those representing debts less than $100,000.  We  selected for review all nine high-dollar cases and a random statistical  sample of 175 cases with initial receivable amounts less than $100,000.  We  did not independently verify the completeness or accuracy of financial data  or test information security controls over the systems used to compile  these data because such verification was not necessary for the purposes of  this request.", "OSM was unable to provide documentation of collection specialists\u2019  actions for 120 of the 184 CFP cases selected.  As a result of this scope  limitation, we could not project our findings to the entire universe of cases  nor conclude on the overall adequacy of OSM\u2019s past and present debt  collection processes.  Our findings therefore relate only to the applicable  attributes in the 64 cases for which OSM had documentation of collection  specialists\u2019 actions.  We interviewed OSM officials to obtain explanations  for significant trends we observed and for findings and instances of  noncompliance with its policies and procedures we identified during our  review of the available cases.", "To determine what role, if any, OMB and Treasury play in overseeing and  monitoring the government\u2019s collection of civil debt, we interviewed OMB  and Treasury officials.

Under Titles IV and V of SMCRA, OSM administers and  enforces nationwide surface mining laws.", "Title IV of SMCRA authorizes OSM to collect quarterly Abandoned Mine  Land (AML) reclamation fees.  SMCRA also requires that coal mine  operators obtain permits from OSM or the responsible state regulatory  authority before undertaking any mining activity.  These permits identify  parties that actively mine coal and become the basis for OSM to generate  Coal Reclamation Fee Reports (Form OSM-1), which are used to collect  AML fees.  Title V of SMCRA authorizes OSM to enforce environmental and  reclamation standards for coal mining.  Violations of these standards,  referred to as \u201con the ground\u201d (mine site) violations, typically involve harm  to the environment. Section 518 of SMCRA authorizes OSM to assess CFP  for violations of Titles IV and V.", "OSM is to issue a Notice of Violation to (1) Title IV violators for unpaid  reclamation fees or for not filing a Form OSM-1 and (2) Title V violators for  noncompliance with environmental and reclamation standards.  If the  violation is not corrected within a specified time, OSM is to issue a Failure  to Abate Cessation Order, which requires that mining operations cease and  the violation be abated immediately.", "OSM\u2019s assessment unit is to review each violation cited to determine the  appropriate CFP amount to assess for a violation and bases its  determination on a point system directly related to the cited mine  operator\u2019s history of previous violations, including the seriousness of such  violations, damage caused, negligence involved, and good faith in  attempting to achieve compliance.  Once the assessment amount is  determined, OSM is to issue a Notice of Proposed Assessment (NOPA) to  the mining operator.  The assessment amount in the NOPA becomes the  official CFP assessment when OSM issues a Final Order.  The Final Order is  to be issued within 30 days of the operator\u2019s receipt of the NOPA, unless the  operator appeals.  Under SMCRA, CFP can be assessed only after the cited  mine operator has had an opportunity to have a public hearing, which may  include a potentially lengthy appeals process.", "Since 1995, OSM has recorded proposed assessments as CFP receivables  when (1) payment is made for the full amount of the assessment when the  NOPA is issued, (2) a Final Order (First Demand Letter) is issued, (3) a  payment plan is entered into, or (4) a final appeal decision has been made.   The occurrence of any one of these events is to result in the establishment  of an account receivable.", "If a payment is not made in 15 days after OSM mails the Final Order, OSM is  to issue a Second Demand Letter.  The Second Demand Letter is to be  followed 15 days later by a Final Demand Letter.  Thus, all three demand  letters are to be sent within 30 days.  OSM is to classify CFP debt as  delinquent if payment is not received within 30 days of the Final Order.", "Once a CFP receivable is established, OSM is to enter the CFP debt into the  Civil Penalty Accounting and Control System, and a collection specialist  begins collection activity.  Upon receipt of the Citation File, the collection  specialist is to create a Collection Specialist Case File (CS File), or an  Entity File if the violator has multiple CFP debts, to document collection  actions taken on the CFP debt.  The collection specialist then is to perform  (1) a full compliance check on the entity to identify all outstanding debt or  (2) skip tracing activity to locate the debtor and obtain the mailing address  and telephone numbers of the entity involved.  The collection specialist  also is supposed to call the debtor and document each attempt at contact  with the debtor.", "If a debtor is unable to pay the debt in full, the collection specialist may  offer an installment agreement or, under certain conditions, a compromise  settlement.  For either an installment agreement or a compromise  settlement, the collection specialist is supposed to research the debtor\u2019s  ability to pay, document his or her determination of the debtor\u2019s ability to  pay, and have that determination reviewed and approved by other OSM  staff.", "If the debt remains unpaid, the collection specialist can refer the debt to  the Solicitor if, for example, (1) the debt needs to be consolidated with  debts previously referred to Solicitor, (2) the debtor files for bankruptcy, or  (3) the debtor strongly disputes responsibility for the debt or raises a legal  challenge that will likely result in litigation.  The collection specialist can  also refer the CFP debt to Treasury for collection and offset if (1) the  debtor does not respond to direct collection efforts by paying in full, (2) the  debtor cannot be located, (3) the debtor defaults on a payment agreement  and does not correct the default, or (4) the debt has been delinquent for 180  days or more.", "If CFP debt remains uncollected after referrals to the Solicitor and  Treasury, the Solicitor or Treasury can recommend that the debt be written  off.  The collection specialist would then terminate collection activity on  the debt and write off the receivable.  Reasons for the termination of  collection activity and write-off of the CFP debt include (1) substantial  amounts are uncollected, (2) the debtor cannot be located, (3) the cost of  collection will exceed the amount recoverable, (4) the statue of limitations  has expired, or (5) the case is without merit or there is insufficient  evidence.  The Department of Justice must approve the write-off of any  CFP debt that is greater than or equal to $100,000.  During fiscal year 2000,  OSM began writing off CFP debt referred to the Solicitor that was  delinquent more than 2 years and classifying it as currently not collectible  (CNC).  In January 2000, OSM established formal guidance to write off  such debts.  In March 2001, OSM established formal guidance to write off  other active debt that is referred to Treasury and has been delinquent more  than 2 years.  OSM also is to include all unpaid CFP debt in its Applicant  Violation System to track the debt\u2019s status once the debt becomes  delinquent.", "OSM has a history of low collection rates for its CFP debt.  In 1987, we  reported that the financial quality of OSM\u2019s CFP debts made them difficult  to collect.  We noted that for fiscal year 1986, OSM reported about $158  million in CFP receivables, of which $155 million was reported as  delinquent.  OSM also designated about 52 percent of the CFP receivables  as uncollectible at that time.", "In 1989, we reported that OSM had $38 million in CFP receivables as of  September 30, 1988, after removing about $136 million of CFP receivables  from fiscal years 1986 through 1988 that were deemed uncollectible and for  which collection activities were terminated.  Of this CFP receivables  balance, OSM reported approximately 99 percent as delinquent and  designated about 90 percent as uncollectible.", "After writing off about $10.8 million of CFP debts during fiscal year 2000,  including about $9.3 million, about 86 percent of the $10.8 million, of debts  more than 10 years old, OSM reported a CFP receivables balance of  approximately $1.3 million as of September 30, 2000.  Of this year-end  receivable balance, OSM reported more than 92 percent as delinquent and  designated about 88 percent as uncollectible."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Poor Financial Condition of CFP Debtors Is the Primary Reason for Low Collection Rates and Significant Write-Offs", "paragraphs": ["Our review of OSM\u2019s CFP receivables information revealed that the poor  financial condition of CFP debtors is the primary reason for low collection  rates and significant write-offs.  In 1989, we reported on the poor financial  quality of OSM\u2019s CFP debt and the difficulties the agency faces in collecting  CFP receivables from mining companies that are not financially viable.   Specifically, we reported that OSM might never experience a high rate of  collection for CFP debt because the majority of its CFP receivables were  associated with inactive mine sites or mining operators who were either  bankrupt or no longer mining and the debt had to be written off.  We also  reported that OSM\u2019s overall annual collection rates combined for both  Titles IV and V CFP receivables were approximately 1 percent for the 3  years from fiscal year 1986 through fiscal year 1988, which were about the  same as those for the 4 years from fiscal year 1997 through fiscal year 2000.", "During our fieldwork, OSM officials stated that the collection rates should  not be calculated using the beginning receivables balances because such  balances included a significant amount of old CFP receivables, including  principal assessments and interest, that remained uncollected from prior  years and which OSM eventually wrote off.  Even though we recalculated  OSM\u2019s combined annual collection rates without the beginning balances,  the modified annual collection rates remained low at approximately 5  percent for the 4 years from fiscal year 1997 through fiscal year 2000.   After we recalculated OSM\u2019s collection rates using its modified method for  the 3 years ended in fiscal year 1988, we found that the annual collection  rates were similar to the rates calculated for the 4 years ended in fiscal year  2000.", "We also previously reported in 1987 that most of OSM\u2019s CFP delinquencies  were several years old and therefore difficult to collect.  As industry  statistics show, the likelihood of recovering amounts owed decreases  dramatically as the age of the delinquency increases.  During our review of  the high-dollar debts, for example, we observed that eight out of the nine  high-dollar debts averaged approximately 19 years in total processing  time\u2014from the issuance of the citation to the point at which the debt was  eventually written off.", "Our current analysis of OSM\u2019s information clearly shows that the  conditions we reported in 1987, regarding low collection rates, and in 1989,  regarding older debt not being collected, still exist.  Our analysis also  showed that 77 percent and 95 percent of all CFP debt that was available to  be collected were written off for the 3 years ended in fiscal year 1988 and  the 4 years ended in fiscal year 2000, respectively.  OSM officials stated that  viable companies correct violations before they incur large civil penalties.   Companies that are in weak financial condition often fail to correct the  initial violation and therefore receive cessation orders and incur large  penalties.  As a result, these CFP debts are often deemed uncollectible and  eventually are written off.", "Over the 4 years covering fiscal years 1997 through 2000, OSM:  wrote off about $37.1 million in CFP receivables (plus another $12.6  million in fiscal year 1996);  annually estimated between 88 and 99 percent of its reported CFP   recorded fewer CFP assessments each year, dropping from about $2.8  million in fiscal year 1997 to about $591,000 in fiscal year 2000, of which  the principal portion of new CFP assessments went from $680,320 for  111 new debts in fiscal year 1997 to $180,370 for 22 new debts in fiscal  year 2000; and   collected about $616,000 in CFP receivables.", "As a result of the significant amounts written off, collections received, and  fewer recorded number and dollar value of assessments over the 4 years,  OSM\u2019s reported CFP receivables balance decreased from about $27 million  as of October 1, 1996, to about $1.3 million as of September 30, 2000.   According to OSM\u2019s records for the 4 years from fiscal year 1997 through  fiscal year 2000, approximately $35 million, 94 percent of the $37.1 million  of CFP debt, for which collection activity was terminated and the  receivables were written off, was delinquent more than 2 years.  OSM  records indicated the following reasons that most CFP debts were written  off.  $22.8 million was written off after the Solicitor\u2019s or Treasury\u2019s  recommendation because they were unable to collect, including debt  from companies that had filed for bankruptcy, were bankrupt, or were  no longer mining;  $4.6 million was written off after OSM classified the CFP debt as  currently not collectible after being delinquent more than 2 years;  $3.7 million was written off after compromise settlements were reached  and companies defaulted on the CFP debts; and  $3.4 million was written off after the statute of limitations for the  violation had expired, for which OSM stated that the CFP debt was over  5 years old, a suit was not filed, and the government can no longer file a  suit for collection.", "OSM believes that low CFP collection rates do not fairly indicate the  effectiveness of the CFP program.  OSM\u2019s Strategic Plan states that the  purpose of the CFP program is to maximize compliance with mining laws.   OSM officials said that, although collecting CFP is an important objective,  maximizing revenue from CFP collections is less important to management  than achieving compliance with mining laws.  OSM routinely writes off or  accepts an offer-in-compromise for large dollar amounts of Title IV CFP  debt when the agency has met its enforcement objectives.  For example,  even though its records continue to reflect low collection rates, OSM  officials stated that 72 percent of notices of violations from fiscal years  1997 through 2000 were abated and 99 percent of Title IV reclamation fees  were collected during fiscal year 2000.", "OSM officials also stated that with the decline in the numbers and amounts  of new Title IV and V CFP debts in fiscal year 2000, they expect the number  and amount of new CFP assessments to remain low for the following  reasons.", "OSM now actively works with companies to prevent problems from  occurring.", "Changes in the mining industry have resulted in better mining practices  and fewer violations.", "OSM\u2019s oversight of state regulatory programs now focuses on results  rather than activities, such as issuing citations.", "OSM compliance auditors work with companies to resolve Title IV  SMCRA violations before issuing a citation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Overall Adequacy of CFP Debt Collection Processes Cannot Be Determined, But Such Processes Can Be Strengthened", "paragraphs": ["While the lack of documentation of collection specialist actions prevented  us from determining the overall adequacy of OSM\u2019s past and present CFP  debt collection processes, we did, however, find instances in which OSM  did not follow certain of its debt collection policies and procedures.

During  fiscal years 1994 and 1995, OSM scanned into an optical imaging system the  collection specialists\u2019 case files for which they had completed their  collection actions.  The original documentation was destroyed after OSM  used the scanned documents to archive these records.  In 1998, the  read/write feature of the imaging system broke, and the vendor went out of  business.  OSM officials stated that the system could not be repaired or  replaced and the contents of the scanned documents were no longer  available.", "An OSM official stated that almost all original documentation of collection  specialists\u2019 activities has been maintained since fiscal year 1997 and that  OSM is working on guidance that calls for archiving documents for 5 years  and imaging only key documents.  The testing of the 64 of the 184 CFP  debts with available documentation provided evidence that OSM has  maintained the collection specialists\u2019 documentation for the debts where  collection activity is still ongoing since the imaging problem in 1998.", "In addition to preventing us from determining the extent to which OSM did  or did not follow its CFP debt collection policies and procedures, the lack  of documentation prevented us from appropriately projecting findings to  the universe of CFP debt from the selected cases for which adequate  documentation was available.

Of these 17 CFP debts, 15 were referred to the Treasury and  were not written off as currently not collectible until we brought them  to OSM\u2019s attention in April 2001.  OSM subsequently established  specific formal guidance for writing off such debts that are more than 2  years old and had been referred to the Treasury.", "Of the 32 CFP debts that were delinquent less than 2 years, 4 were  incorrectly written off as currently not collectible.  In response, OSM  stated that the debts were prematurely written off in error even though  the collection actions being pursued by the Solicitor were not affected  for three of the debts and the fourth debt was subsequently  recommended to be written off by the Solicitor since the company was  defunct and the owner was deceased.", "All five CFP debts with installment agreements issued between fiscal  years 1994 and 1997 lacked the required documentation to support  OSM\u2019s determination that the debtor was unable to immediately pay in  full.

Circuit invalidated an OSM  regulation that blocked the issuance of a permit to any surface coal mining  operation owned or controlled by either the applicant or a person who  owns or controls the applicant that is currently in violation of SMCRA  (upstream owners or controllers).  The court ruled that the regulation was  inconsistent with the authority conferred on OSM by section 510(c) of  SMCRA.  This ruling limits OSM\u2019s ability to deny permits to certain  applicants associated with SMCRA violations.", "OSM officials stated that since the court decision, OSM and the states have  issued permits to three applicants who would have been denied permits  under the regulation the court invalidated.  OSM further stated that the  denials would have been based on an upstream owner or controller  violation, when at the time of the applications for new permits, the  upstream owners or controllers were linked to unabated violations.  These  unabated violations included unpaid principal portions of CFP receivables  balances totaling approximately $31,600 and another $122,697 of unpaid  abandoned mine land fees and reclamation costs.", "For example, OSM stated that its Knoxville office issued a new surface  mining permit in December 2000 to an applicant that consisted of three 30- percent shareholders and one 10-percent shareholder.

Although we did state at the exit conference that the instances of  noncompliance may not have affected OSM\u2019s ability to collect the CFP  debts, the fact remains that these instances have resulted in  misstatements of OSM\u2019s reported CFP receivables.  Further and more  importantly, because of the lack of documentation of the collection  specialists\u2019 actions for two-thirds of the sampled cases, we are unable  to assess whether there were material instances of noncompliance with  OSM\u2019s past and present debt collection policies and procedures. 2. The draft briefing slides already discussed the policies and procedures  established by OSM to write-off cases over 2 years old as currently not  collectible and we included OSM\u2019s management approval of payment  agreements and development of an installment agreement worksheet in  the briefing slides.  The steps taken by OSM to address the identified  areas of noncompliance are also discussed in the report.  3. We agree that the primary reason for the low collection rates was the  poor financial condition of certain CFP debtors.  Poor financial quality  of CFP debts is typically caused by the poor financial condition of the  related debtors.  As a result, we revised our report and slides except  where we refer to our 1987 report that described this issue as poor  financial quality. 4. We incorporated several of OSM\u2019s suggested CFP detail related to the  number of debts collected, differentiating between Title IV and V debts,  measuring collection rates by age of debt, and focusing on the current  process into our briefing slides and reports.  However, the other  suggestions were not incorporated because they did not agree with the  detailed information provided to us during our review.  In addition, the  suggestions focused primarily on the principal portion of CFP debts,  which as we stated at the May 17, 2001, exit conference, overstates  OSM\u2019s overall collection rates.  Further, it does not change our  conclusion as to the primary reason for OSM\u2019s low collection rates and  the significant amount of CFP debts that were written off during both  the 3 years ended in fiscal year 1988 and the 4 years ended in fiscal year  2000. 5. OSM modified its calculation method from the one discussed in the  briefing slides.  OSM recalculated its combined annual collection rates  at approximately 11 percent\u20144 percent for Title IV and 17 percent for  Title V\u2014based on only the principal portion of the net assessments  from the CFP receivables for the 4 years ended in fiscal year 2000.  Both  modified calculation methods used by OSM inappropriately overstate  its annual collection rates.  Each method uses only the new CFP net  assessments or just the principal portion of new CFP debts and  inappropriately excludes current CFP debts that are a part of the  beginning receivable balances and earned interest and late charges on  the current debts that were recorded during the 4 years ended in fiscal  year 2000.  Regardless of the method used to calculate collection rates,  the main point remains that each collection rate is low and when the  same method was applied for both the 3 years ended in fiscal year 1988  and the 4 years ended in fiscal year 2000, the collection rates were  similar and did not show any significant increase from one period to the  other.6. The \u201cPrimary Reason\u201d section of the briefing slides and report were  revised and include the changes in the number and amount of the new  CFP principal assessments from fiscal year 1997 to fiscal year 2000. 7. As stated in the \u201cScope and Methodology\u201d section, we selected a total  of 184 open and closed CFP cases from a total of 490 cases.  And as  stated in GAO Comment no. 1, the lack of documentation of the  collection specialists\u2019 actions for two-thirds of the sampled cases  prevented us from determining whether there were material instances  of noncompliance with OSM\u2019s past and present debt collection policies  and procedures. 8.
