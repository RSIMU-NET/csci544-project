Over the last few years, your Committee and others have asked us to study these issues in considerable depth. Today\u2019s testimony focuses on three questions: (1) how much are airports spending on capital development and what are the sources of these funds? (2) if current funding levels continue, how do they compare with airports\u2019 plans for development? and (3) what effect will various proposals to increase or make better use of existing funding have on airports\u2019 ability to fulfill their capital development plans?", "In 1998, we reported that the 3,304 airports that make up the federally supported national airport system obtained about $7 billion from federal and private sources for capital development. More than 90 percent of this funding came from three sources: tax-exempt bonds issued by states and local airport authorities ($4.1 billion), federal grants from the Airport Improvement Program ($1.4 billion), and passenger facility charges paid on airline tickets ($1.1 billion). The magnitude and type of funding varies with airports\u2019 size. The nation\u2019s 71 largest airports accounted for nearly 80 percent of the total funding. As a group, these airports are less dependent on federal grants: They received only about 10 percent of their funding from the Airport Improvement Program. By contrast, the 3,233 smaller airports in the national airport system relied on the Airport Improvement Program for half of their funding.", "Airports planned to spend as much as $10 billion per year for capital development for the years 1997 through 2001, or $3 billion per year more than they were able to fund in 1996. The difference between funding and the costs of planned development is greater for smaller commercial and general aviation airports than for their larger counterparts. Smaller airports\u2019 funding would cover only about half the costs of their planned development, while larger airports\u2019 funding would cover about 4/5 of their planned development. Airports\u2019 planned development can be divided into four main categories based on the funding priorities of the Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s (FAA) Airport Improvement Program. About $1.4 billion per year was planned for safety, security, environmental, and reconstruction projects, FAA\u2019s highest priorities for Airport Improvement Program funding. Another $1.4 billion per year was planned for projects FAA regards as the next highest priority, primarily adding airport capacity. Other projects FAA considers to be lower in priority, such as bringing airports up to FAA\u2019s design standards, add another $3.3 billion per year. Finally, airports anticipated spending another $3.9 billion per year on projects that are not eligible for Airport Improvement Program funding, such as expanding commercial space in terminals and constructing parking garages.", "Several proposals to increase or make better use of existing funding have emerged in recent years, including increasing the amount of Airport Improvement Program funding and raising the maximum amount airports can levy in passenger facility charges. Under current formulas, increasing the amount of Airport Improvement Program funding would help small airports more than larger airports, while raising passenger facility charges would help larger airports more. Other initiatives for making better use of existing funding, such as Airport Improvement Program block grants to states, have had varied success, but none appears to offer a major breakthrough in reducing the shortfall between funding and airports\u2019 plans for development."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Airports are a linchpin in the nation\u2019s air transportation system.

Funding is also needed to mitigate the noise and other negative environmental effects of airports on nearby communities.", "Airports provide important economic benefits to the nation and their communities. Air transportation accounted for $63.2 billion, or 0.8 percent, of U.S. Gross Domestic Product in 1996, according to the Department of Transportation\u2019s statistics. 1.6 million people are employed at airports in 1998, according to the Airports Council International-North America.

The nation\u2019s 71 largest airports (classified by FAA as large hubs and medium hubs), which accounted for almost 90 percent of all passenger traffic, received more than $5.5 billion in funding in 1996, while the 3,233 other national system airports received about $1.5 billion. As shown in figure 1, large and medium hub airports rely most heavily on private airport bonds, which account for roughly 62 percent of their total funding. By contrast, the 3,233 smaller national system airports obtained just 14 percent of their funding from bonds.

FAA does not maintain information on whether eligible projects that do not receive AIP funding are funded from other sources, deferred, or canceled. We were not successful in developing an estimate from other information sources, mainly because comprehensive data are not kept on the uses to which airport and special facility bonds are put. But even if the entire bond financing available to smaller airports were spent on AIP-eligible projects, these airports would have, at a minimum, about $945 million a year in AIP-eligible projects that are not funded. Conversely, if none of the financing from bonds were applied to AIP-eligible projects, then the full $3 billion funding shortfall would apply to these projects."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Funding Difference at Smaller Airports Is More Significant Than at Larger Airports", "paragraphs": ["The difference between current and planned funding for development is bigger, in percentage terms, for smaller airports than for larger ones. Funding for the 3,233 smaller airports in 1996 was a little over half of the estimated cost of their planned development, producing a difference of about $1.4 billion (see fig. 3). This difference would be even greater if it were not for $250 million in special facility bonding for a single cargo/general aviation airport. For this group of airports, the $782 million in 1996 AIP funding exceeds the annual estimate of $750 million for FAA\u2019s highest-priority projects\u2014those involving reconstruction, noise mitigation, and compliance with federal mandates. However, there is no guarantee that the full amount of AIP funding will go only to the highest-priority projects, because one-third of AIP funds are awarded to airports on the basis of the number of passengers boarding commercial flights and not necessarily on the basis of projects\u2019 priority.", "Planned development 1997  through 2001 (annualized)", "As a proportion of total funding, the potential funding difference between 1996 funding and planned development for the 71 large and medium hub airports is comparatively less than for their smaller counterparts (see fig. 3 and fig. 4). Larger airports potential shortfall of $1.5 billion represents 21 percent of their planned development costs, while smaller airports\u2019 potential shortfall of $1.4 billion represents 48 percent of their development costs. Therefore, while larger and smaller airports\u2019 respective shortfalls are similar in size, the greater scale of larger airports\u2019 planned development causes them to differ considerably in proportion.

For example, increasing AIP funding would help smaller airports more because current funding formulas would channel an increasing proportion of AIP to smaller airports. Conversely, any increase in PFC funding would help larger airports almost exclusively because they handle more passengers and are more likely to have a PFC in place. Changes to the current design of AIP or PFCs could, however, lessen the concentration of benefits to one group of airports.

So far, these mechanisms have had mixed success."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Increasing AIP Would Help Smaller Airports Most", "paragraphs": ["Under the existing distribution formula, increasing total AIP funding would proportionately help smaller airports more than large and medium hub airports. Appropriated AIP funding for fiscal year 1998 was $1.7 billion; large and medium hub airports received nearly 40 percent and all other airports about 60 percent of the total. We calculated how much funding each group would receive under the existing formula, at funding levels of $2 billion and $2.347 billion. We chose these funding levels because the National Civil Aviation Review Commission and the Air Transport Association (ATA), the commercial airline trade association, have recommended that future AIP funding levels be stabilized at a minimum of $2 billion annually, while two airport trade groups\u2014the American Association of Airport Executives and the Airports Council International-North America\u2014have recommended a higher funding level, such as AIP\u2019s authorized funding level of $2.347 billion for fiscal year 1998.

First, large and medium hub airports, which accounted for nearly 90 percent of all passengers in 1996, have the greatest opportunity to levy PFCs. Second, such airports are more likely than smaller airports to have an approved PFC in place. Finally, large and medium hub airports would forego little AIP funding if the PFC ceiling were raised or eliminated. Most of these airports already return the maximum amount that must be turned back for redistribution to smaller airports in exchange for the opportunity to levy PFCs.", "If the airports currently charging PFCs were permitted to increase them beyond the current $3 ceiling, total collections would increase from the $1.35 billion that FAA estimates was collected during 1998. Most of the additional collections would go to larger airports. For every $1 increase in the PFC ceiling, we estimate that large and medium hub airports would collect an additional $432 million, while smaller airports would collect an additional $46 million (see fig. 5). In total, a $4 PFC ceiling would yield $1.9 billion, a $5 PFC would yield $2.4 billion, and a $6 PFC would yield $2.8 billion in total estimated collections.", "Increased PFC funding is likely to be applied to different types of projects than would increased AIP funding.

Airports may also be able to receive more favorable interest rates on bonds that are sold to finance a project if the federal government has indicated its support for the project in a letter of intent. For a period, FAA stopped issuing letters of intent, but since January 1997, it has issued 10 letters with a total funding commitment of $717.5 million.

Five projects tested the benefits of the first innovative use of AIP funding\u2014allowing local contributions in excess of standard matching amount, which for most airports and projects is otherwise fixed at 10 percent of the AIP grant. FAA and state aviation representatives generally support the concept of flexible matching because it allows projects to begin that otherwise might be postponed for lack of sufficient FAA funding; in addition, flexible funding may ultimately increase funding to airports.
