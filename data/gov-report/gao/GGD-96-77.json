The second way is for a thief to obtain an apparently valid title for the car and then sell it to a third party. Finally, the third way is for a thief to export the vehicles for sale abroad.", "The 1992 Act contains several approaches for dealing with these criminal activities. Title I directed the establishment of, among other things, a task force to study problems that may affect motor vehicle theft and created a new federal crime for armed car jacking. The task force was to be made up of representatives of related federal and state agencies and associations.", "Title II called for establishment of the National Motor Vehicle Title Information System to enable state departments of motor vehicles to check the validity of out-of-state titles before issuing new titles.

The program was intended to reduce the selling of stolen parts. Major component parts of designated passenger motor vehicles are to be marked with identification numbers so that stolen parts can be identified. Title III also required the Attorney General to develop and maintain a national information system, known as the National Stolen Passenger Motor Vehicle Information System (NSPMVIS), that is to contain the identification numbers of stolen passenger motor vehicles and stolen passenger motor vehicle component parts.

The task force recommended, among other things, (1) the passage of federal legislation that would require uniform definitions for terms such as salvage vehicles and uniform methods for titling vehicles, (2) possible funding sources to pay for and maintain the titling system, and (3) penalties to enforce compliance by the participating states. The recommendations are detailed in appendix I. According to the task force chairman, the recommendations would have to be implemented to achieve the uniformity needed to ensure that the titling system would operate as envisioned. In October 1994, Transportation accepted most of the task force\u2019s recommendations (see app. I regarding Transportation\u2019s views on the task force recommendations).", "NHTSA contracted with AAMVA to identify the states\u2019 costs for a titling system. AAMVA surveyed the 50 states and the District of Columbia to obtain their estimated costs for implementing the titling system. On January 31, 1994, NHTSA\u2019s survey report stated that for the 37 states that provided cost estimates, the cost ranged from zero (1 state) to $12.2 million. For example, some states would have to modify their existing titling systems. In March 1996, AAMVA officials estimated that about $19 million in federal grants would be needed to fund states\u2019 implementation costs. NHTSA officials said that since 13 states and the District of Columbia did not provide a cost estimate, they did not believe that the total costs to the states could be accurately determined. AAMVA pointed out that about 80 percent of the nation\u2019s motor vehicle population is in the states that responded to the survey.", "In May 1994, Transportation sent proposed legislation to Congress to allow the Secretary of Transportation to extend the target date (from January 1996 to October 1997) for implementation of the national title information system. According to NHTSA officials, the proposed legislation was not introduced in Congress. Transportation requested the authority to extend the implementation date for the titling system because it understood that AAMVA was planning a pilot study of a titling information system, using only state and private sector funds and resources, and Transportation wanted to evaluate the study results. Subsequently, AAMVA requested funding from NHTSA for the pilot. In December 1994, NHTSA denied AAMVA\u2019s request for funds to conduct a pilot study because, in NHTSA\u2019s view, such a study would have been premature without first having uniformity in state titling laws and regulations. However, Congress provided $890,000 for a pilot study by NHTSA as part of Transportation\u2019s fiscal year 1996 appropriation. NHTSA officials said that AAMVA would have responsibility for the pilot.", "According to AAMVA officials, as of January 1996, they were in the process of acquiring contractors to conduct the pilot, using AAMVA\u2019s commercial driver\u2019s license information system as the pilot\u2019s model. According to NHTSA, the pilot should assist in determining the feasibility of a national titling system and identifying any needed uniform titling requirements for an efficient and cost-effective system. In addition, NHTSA expects the pilot to assist in determining the estimated costs for full implementation, the time frame to implement a nationwide system, the current status of titling information exchange between states, and possible barriers, in particular the absence of uniform system definitions, that could impede the states from participating in a national system. NHTSA said that the pilot study may not be able to identify all costs associated with a national titling system. It also said the complexity of implementing a titling system on a nationwide basis may call for additional resources above those identified in the pilot.", "NHTSA prepared legislation in response to the task force\u2019s recommendations. Its Office of Safety Assurance submitted a legislative proposal to NHTSA\u2019s Office of Chief Counsel in October 1994. The NHTSA Administrator approved the draft legislation for review by Transportation in May 1995. According to NHTSA, the draft legislative package contains two bills. One bill would provide (1) uniform definitions for categories of severely damaged passenger cars and their titles and (2) titling requirements for rebuilt salvage passenger vehicles. The other bill would remove the January 1996 implementation date and instead make the system contingent upon uniformity in state laws regarding the titling and control of severely damaged passenger vehicles. As of February 1, 1996, the bills were being reviewed by Transportation officials.", "Legislation (H.R. 2803, Anti-Car Theft Improvements Act of 1995), introduced in December 1995 by the Chairman and the Ranking Minority Member of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and others would, among other things, (1) transfer Transportation\u2019s responsibilities for the titling area to Justice, (2) extend the implementation date of the titling system from January 31, 1996, to October 1, 1997, and (3) provide immunity for those participants (e.g., system operators, insurers, and salvagers) who make good faith efforts to comply with the 1992 Act\u2019s titling requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Potential Issues Affecting the 1992 Act\u2019s Implementation or Effectiveness", "paragraphs": ["On the basis of discussions with NHTSA and AAMVA officials, issues that may affect the 1992 Act\u2019s implementation or effectiveness are concerns about the size and scope of the pilot study, uniformity, funding for the states, responsibility for the titling system, and other factors, including states\u2019 willingness to participate and the complexity of the titling system.", "NHTSA officials said that the pilot study needs to develop information on the ability to establish a national system and operate the system. For example, NHTSA and AAMVA officials told us that the congressionally authorized pilot may demonstrate whether the titling system can be implemented without the uniformity recommended by the task force. However, NHTSA officials noted that the size and scope of the pilot study could limit the amount of information the pilot will be able to provide. The size and scope are to be determined by the number of participating states and system operators. Therefore, the study may not enable NHTSA to identify or resolve all barriers or problems that would arise in creating and operating a national system. NHTSA said that it will have to ensure to the best of its ability that the lessons learned will enable it to develop a national system that meets the 1992 Act\u2019s requirements. NHTSA and AAMVA officials also stated that the pilot study could provide more information on other possible impediments to full implementation of the national title information system.", "According to NHTSA officials, the task force recommendations have not been implemented. NHTSA officials said that a national titling system should not be implemented until uniformity existed among the states. NHTSA added that the titling system would be inherently defective without uniformity in titling definitions and titling control procedures. Also, according to NHTSA, uniform definitions and motor vehicle titling procedures need to be addressed by all states before a national titling system could function effectively. AAMVA and NICB, however, said that uniformity among the states is not necessary to implement the titling system. AAMVA officials said that a titling system can be 85 to 90 percent effective without the existence of uniform definitions and motor vehicle titling procedures. AAMVA also said that the existence of a titling system would cause states to implement uniform definitions and motor vehicle titling procedures. AAMVA officials added that they have experience dealing with systems containing nonuniform data, including the commercial driver\u2019s license information system upon which the pilot is to be based.", "NHTSA and AAMVA officials identified lack of federal and state funding as an impediment to full implementation of the titling information system. The 1992 Act placed a $300,000 limit on federal funds that could be granted to each state for start-up costs for the new titling system. H.R. 2803 would eliminate this limit and allow the Attorney General to make \u201cnecessary and reasonable\u201d grants to the states that implement the system. However, according to NHTSA officials, no funds had been provided by the federal government to the states for implementing the titling system. NHTSA added that federal resources for system development, start up, and ongoing operations are harder to find each year.", "NHTSA officials told us that they are proceeding with the 1992 Act\u2019s implementation, even though the responsibility for the titling area may be transferred to Justice. However, they pointed out that the question of responsibility for the 1992 Act could be an emerging issue regarding its implementation. As of January 1996, neither Transportation nor Justice had adopted an official position on the transfer of responsibilities.", "Other issues that may affect the 1992 Act\u2019s implementation or effectiveness are as follows:", "Prosecution Immunity: NHTSA said concern outside Transportation has been raised about providing immunity to those individuals (e.g., system operators, insurers, and salvagers) acting in good faith to comply with the 1992 Act. H.R. 2803 could grant such immunity. AAMVA emphasized that the immunity language was intended for system operators, not participants such as salvagers. AAMVA told us that the need for immunity would not be an issue unless it affected a state\u2019s decision to participate in the system. NICB officials stated that immunity is needed for all participants who will participate in any activities related to the database.", "Major Vehicle Damage Disclosure: Consumer groups may not support implementation of the titling system if the system, besides disclosing whether a vehicle had been previously junked or salvaged, does not identify vehicles that have sustained major damage. NHTSA said that the titling task force did not address this issue other than to note further study was needed.", "States\u2019 Participation: Presently, the 1992 Act does not mandate the participation of the states. In NHTSA\u2019s view, all states need to participate in the system to ensure the 1992 Act\u2019s effectiveness in preventing title fraud. NHTSA noted that the uniformity needs of the system would require many states to enact legislation at a time when they have strongly opposed federal \u201cmandates\u201d and \u201cburdens.\u201d AAMVA officials said that it does not believe that states will need to pass new legislation to implement a titling system.", "Technological Challenges: According to NHTSA officials, the system envisioned by the 1992 Act would be extraordinarily complex. They said that the technology required to implement a large-scale system, which provides instantaneous response to inquiries, may take additional time or call for additional resources beyond those currently estimated. AAMVA officials said they recognize the complexity of the system but said that, by modeling the pilot after the commercial driver\u2019s license information system, many potential concerns would be lessened. They said that the pilot will identify the necessary requirements, technology, and costs to process the anticipated larger volume of transactions of the national titling system in a timely manner. NICB officials pointed out that proven technology exists to develop and implement the system.

NHTSA could exempt some lines from marking if the vehicles included antitheft devices that NHTSA determined were likely to be as effective as marking in deterring thefts.", "The 1992 Act broadened and extended the 1984 Act\u2019s marking provisions. Specifically, the 1992 Act broadened the definition of the types of passenger motor vehicles to be marked to include any multipurpose vehicle and light duty trucks rated at 6,000 pounds (gross vehicle weight) or less. It extended the marking requirement to designated vehicles, except for light duty trucks, regardless of their theft rate. However, the trucks could be subject to marking if the major parts were interchangeable with high-theft passenger vehicles. No limit was placed on the number of parts that NHTSA could require to be marked, except that the marking costs are not to exceed $15 per vehicle (in 1984 dollars). According to an NHTSA official, local law enforcement officials look for markings when investigating stolen vehicles and parts.", "The additional marking of passenger vehicles was to be done in two phases. By October 25, 1994, NHTSA was to issue regulations governing the marking for half of these additional passenger motor vehicles (excluding the light duty trucks), and by October 25, 1997, for the remaining additional vehicles. These regulations were to be issued provided the Attorney General did not determine that further marking would not be effective (i.e., would not substantially inhibit chop shop operations and motor vehicle thefts). Justice\u2019s National Institute of Justice will be responsible for conducting the required study upon which the Attorney General will make the determination concerning effectiveness. Like the earlier legislation, the 1992 Act also permitted exemptions from marking.", "The 1992 Act required a number of additional evaluations.
