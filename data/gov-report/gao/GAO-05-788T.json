In addition, many agencies engage in assistance activities, such as providing training for foreign officials. Finally, a small number of agencies carry out law enforcement actions, such as criminal investigations and seizures of counterfeit merchandise. Agencies use several mechanisms to coordinate their efforts, although the mechanisms' usefulness varies. The National Intellectual Property Law Enforcement Coordination Council, established in 1999 to coordinate domestic and international intellectual property law enforcement, has struggled to find a clear mission, has undertaken few activities, and is generally viewed as having little impact despite recent congressional action to strengthen the council. The Congress's action included establishing the role of Coordinator, but the position has not yet been filled (although the selection process is underway). The Administration's October 2004 Strategy Targeting Organized Piracy (STOP!) is intended to strengthen U.S. efforts to combat piracy and counterfeiting. Thus far, the initiative has resulted in some new actions and emphasized other ongoing efforts. U.S. efforts have contributed to strengthened intellectual property legislation overseas, but enforcement in many countries remains weak, and further U.S. efforts face significant challenges. For example, competing U.S. policy objectives such as national security interests take precedence over protecting intellectual property in certain regions. Further, other countries' domestic policy objectives can affect their \"political will\" to address U.S. concerns.

USTR identifies these countries  with substantial assistance from industry and U.S. agencies and publishes  the results of its reviews in an annual report. Once a pool of such  countries has been determined, the USTR, in coordination with other  agencies, is required to decide which, if any, of these countries should be  designated as a Priority Foreign Country (PFC). If a trading partner is  identified as a PFC, USTR must decide within 30 days whether to initiate  an investigation of those acts, policies, and practices that were the basis  for identifying the country as a PFC. Such an investigation can lead to  actions such as negotiating separate intellectual property understandings  or agreements between the United States and the PFC or implementing  trade sanctions against the PFC if no satisfactory outcome is reached.", "Between 1994 and 2005, the U.S. government designated three countries as  PFCs\u2014China, Paraguay, and Ukraine\u2014as a result of intellectual property  reviews. The U.S. government negotiated separate bilateral intellectual  property agreements with China and Paraguay to address IPR problems.  These agreements are subject to annual monitoring, with progress cited in  each year\u2019s Special 301 report. Ukraine, where optical media piracy was  prevalent, was designated a PFC in 2001.

This review concluded that infringement levels remain  unacceptably high throughout China, despite the country\u2019s efforts to  reduce them. The U.S. government identified several actions it intends to  take, including working with U.S. industry with an eye toward utilizing  World Trade Organization (WTO) procedures to bring China into  compliance with its WTO intellectual property obligations (particularly  those relating to transparency and criminal enforcement) and securing  new, specific commitments concerning actions China will take to improve  IPR protection and enforcement.", "By virtue of membership in the WTO, the United States and other  countries commit themselves not to take WTO-inconsistent unilateral  action against possible trade violations involving IPR protections covered  by the WTO but to instead seek recourse under the WTO\u2019s dispute  settlement system and its rules and procedures. This may impact any U.S.  government decision regarding whether to retaliate against WTO members  unilaterally with sanctions under the Special 301 process when those  countries\u2019 IPR problems are viewed as serious.

Further, Justice has been involved with  international investigation and prosecution efforts and, according to a  Justice official, has become more aggressive in recent years. For instance,  Justice and the FBI coordinated an undercover IPR investigation, with the  involvement of several foreign law enforcement agencies. The  investigation focused on individuals and organizations, known as \u201cwarez\u201d  release groups, which specialize in the Internet distribution of pirated  materials. In April 2004, these investigations resulted in 120 simultaneous  searches worldwide (80 in the United States) by law enforcement entities  from 10 foreign countries and the United States in an effort known as  \u201cOperation Fastlink.\u201d", "In addition, in March 2004, the Department of Justice created an  intellectual property task force to examine all of Justice\u2019s intellectual  property enforcement efforts and explore methods for the department to  strengthen its protection of IPR. A report issued by the task force in  October 2004 provided recommendations for improvements in criminal  enforcement, international cooperation, civil and antitrust enforcement,  legislation, and prevention of intellectual property crime. Some of these  recommendations have been implemented, while others have not. For  example, Justice has implemented a recommendation to create five  additional Computer Hacking and Intellectual Property (CHIP) units to  prosecute IPR crimes. Additionally, Justice has designated a CHIP  coordinator in every U.S. Attorney\u2019s office in the country, thereby  implementing a report recommendation that such action be taken.  However, an FBI official told us the FBI has not been able to implement  recommendations such as posting additional personnel to the U.S.  consulate in Hong Kong and the U.S. embassy in Budapest, Hungary for  budgetary reasons; Justice has not yet implemented a similar  recommendation to deploy federal prosecutors to these same regions and  designate them as Intellectual Property Law Enforcement Coordinators.", "Fully implementing some of the report\u2019s recommendations will require a  sustained, long-term effort by Justice. For example, to address a  recommendation to develop a national education program to prevent  intellectual property crime, Justice held two day-long events in  Washington, D.C. and Los Angeles with high school students listening to  creative artists, victim representatives, the Attorney General, and a  convicted intellectual property offender, among others, about the harm  caused by intellectual property piracy. The events were filmed by Court  TV and produced into a 30 minute show aired on cable television.  Further,  to enhance intellectual property training programs for foreign prosecutors  and law enforcement officials, as recommended in the report, Justice  worked with the Mexican government to provide a three-day seminar for  intellectual property prosecutors and customs officials in December 2004.  Such actions are initial efforts to address recommendations that can be  further implemented over time.", "The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) tracks seizures of goods that  violate IPR and reports seizures that totaled almost $140 million resulting  from over 7,200 seizures in fiscal year 2004. In fiscal year 2004, goods from  China (including Hong Kong) accounted for almost 70 percent of the value  of all IPR seizures, many of which were shipments of cigarettes and  apparel. Other seized goods were shipped from, among other places,  Russia and South Africa. A DHS official pointed out that providing  protection against IPR-infringing imported goods for some U.S.  companies\u2014particularly entertainment companies\u2014can be difficult,  because companies often fail to record their trademarks and copyrights  with DHS. DHS and Commerce officials told us that they believe this  situation could be ameliorated if, contrary to current practice, companies  could simultaneously have their trademarks and copyrights recorded with  DHS when they are provided their intellectual property right by USPTO or  the Copyright Office.", "To identify shipments of IPR-infringing merchandise and prevent their  entry into the United States, DHS is developing an IPR risk-assessment  computer model. The model uses weighted criteria to assign risk scores to  individual imports. The methodology is based on both historical risk-based  trade data and qualitative rankings. The historical data are comprised of  seizure information and cargo examination results, while qualitative  rankings are based on information such as whether a shipment is arriving  from a high-risk country identified by USTR\u2019s annual Special 301 report.  According to DHS officials, the model has been piloted, and several issues  have been identified which must be addressed before it is fully  implemented.", "DHS officials also told us that problems in identifying and seizing IPR- infringing goods frequently arise where the department\u2019s in-bond system is  involved. The in-bond system allows cargo to be transported from the  original U.S. port of arrival (such as Los Angeles) to another U.S. port  (such as Cleveland) for formal entry into U.S. commerce or for export to a  foreign country. We previously reported that weak internal controls in this  system enable cargo to be illegally diverted from the supposed  destination. The tracking of in-bond cargo is hindered by a lack of  automation for tracking in-bond cargo, inconsistencies in targeting and  examining cargo, in-bond practices that allow shipments\u2019 destinations to  be changed without notifying DHS and extensive time intervals to reach  their final destination, and inadequate verification of exports to Mexico.  DHS inspectors we spoke with during the course of our previous work  cited in-bond cargo as a high-risk category of shipment because it is the  least inspected and in-bond shipments have been increasing. We made  recommendations to DHS regarding ways to improve monitoring of in- bond cargo.

For example, Commerce officials  told us that while they had been working on having the OECD conduct a  study of the extent and impact of counterfeiting and piracy, STOP!  provided additional momentum to succeed in their efforts. They said that  the OECD has now agreed to conduct a comprehensive study on the  extent and effect of international counterfeiting and piracy in tangible  goods, with a study addressing the digital arena to follow. In addition, in  March 2005, Justice announced the continuation of work by its intellectual  property task force, which had been rolled into STOP!.

U.S. efforts are more likely to  be effective in encouraging government action or achieving impact in a  foreign country where support for intellectual property protection exists.  It is difficult for the U.S. government to achieve impact in locations where  foreign governments lack the \u201cpolitical will\u201d to enact IPR protections.", "Many economic factors complicate and challenge U.S. and foreign  governments\u2019 efforts, even in countries with the political will to protect  intellectual property. These factors include low barriers to entering the  counterfeiting and piracy business and potentially high profits for  producers. In addition, the low prices of counterfeit products are  attractive to consumers. The economic incentives can be especially acute  in countries where people have limited income. Technological advances  allowing for high-quality inexpensive and accessible reproduction and  distribution in some industries have exacerbated the problem. Moreover,  many government and industry officials believe that the chances of getting  caught for counterfeiting and piracy, as well as the penalties when caught,  are too low. The increasing involvement of organized crime in the  production and distribution of pirated products further complicates  enforcement efforts. Federal and foreign law enforcement officials have  linked intellectual property crime to national and transnational organized  criminal operations. Further, like other criminals, terrorists can trade any  commodity in an illegal fashion, as evidenced by their reported  involvement in trading a variety of counterfeit and other goods.", "Many of these challenges are evident in the optical media industry, which  includes music, movies, software, and games. Even in countries where  interests exist to protect domestic industries, such as the domestic music  industry in Brazil or the domestic movie industry in China, economic and  law enforcement challenges can be difficult to overcome. For example, the  cost of reproduction technology and copying digital media is low, making  piracy an attractive employment opportunity, especially in a country  where formal employment is hard to obtain. The huge price differentials  between pirated CDs and legitimate copies also create incentives on the  consumer side. For example, when we visited a market in Brazil, we  observed that the price for a legitimate DVD was approximately ten times  the price for a pirated DVD. Even if consumers are willing to pay extra to  purchase the legitimate product, they may not do so if the price  differences are too great for similar products. Further, the potentially high  profit makes optical media piracy an attractive venture for organized  criminal groups. Industry and government officials have noted criminal  involvement in optical media piracy and the resulting law enforcement  challenges. Recent technological advances have also exacerbated optical  media piracy. The mobility of the equipment makes it easy to transport it  to another location, further complicating enforcement efforts. Likewise,  the Internet provides a means to transmit and sell illegal software or music  on a global scale. According to an industry representative, the ability of  Internet pirates to hide their identities or operate from remote  jurisdictions often makes it difficult for IPR holders to find them and hold  them accountable."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Industry Concerns", "paragraphs": ["Despite improvements such as strengthened foreign IPR legislation,  international IPR protection may be worsening overall for some  intellectual property sectors. For example, according to copyright industry  estimates, losses due to piracy grew markedly in recent years. The  entertainment and business software sectors, for example, which are very  supportive of USTR and other agencies, face an environment in which  their optical media products are increasingly easy to reproduce, and  digitized products can be distributed around the world quickly and easily  via the Internet. According to an intellectual property association  representative, counterfeiting trademarks has also become more pervasive  in recent years. Counterfeiting affects more than just luxury goods; it also  affects various industrial goods.  An industry representative noted that  U.S. manufacturers of all sizes are now being adversely affected by  counterfeit imports.", "An industry representative also added that there is a need for additional  enforcement activity by the U.S. government at the border. However, he  recognized that limited resources and other significant priorities for DHS  heighten the need to use existing resources more effectively to interdict  more counterfeit and pirated goods."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. government has demonstrated a commitment to addressing IPR  issues in foreign countries using multiple agencies. However, law  enforcement actions are more restricted than other U.S. activities, owing  to factors such as a lack of jurisdiction overseas to enforce U.S. law.  Several IPR coordination mechanisms exist, with the interagency  coordination that occurs during the Special 301 process standing out as  the most significant and active. Efforts under STOP! appear to have  strengthened the U.S. government\u2019s focus on addressing IPR enforcement  problems in a more coordinated manner. Conversely, NIPLECC, the  mechanism for coordinating intellectual property law enforcement, has  accomplished little that is concrete and its ineffectiveness continues  despite recent congressional action to provide funding, staffing, and  clearer guidance regarding its international objectives. In addition,  NIPLECC does not include the FBI, a primary law enforcement agency.  Members, including NIPLECC leadership, have repeatedly acknowledged  that the group continues to struggle to find an appropriate mission.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes my prepared statement.
