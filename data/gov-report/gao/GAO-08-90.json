The Indian Health Service (IHS), located within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), provides health care services, including HIV/AIDS treatment, to eligible American Indians and Alaska Natives. IHS patients with HIV/AIDS may also receive care through other sources depending on their access to private health insurance or their eligibility for other federal health care programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. GAO examined the extent to which IHS provided (1) HIV/AIDS prevention services and (2) HIV/AIDS treatment services. GAO also examined (3) what other HIV/AIDS-related initiatives IHS has undertaken. GAO reviewed documents and interviewed officials from IHS headquarters, area offices, and IHS-funded facilities, as well as advocacy groups. We also conducted site visits in two IHS areas."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["HIV/AIDS prevention services were generally available from IHS, but these services varied across the 12 IHS areas. HIV/AIDS education was provided in all areas in a variety of settings, such as IHS-funded facilities, schools, and health fairs. In addition to education, IHS offered HIV testing services in all areas; however, the type and extent of services varied. In addition, some IHS officials described other services that were provided as part of their HIV/AIDS prevention activities, such as condom distribution. According to IHS officials, HIV/AIDS treatment services, while offered at some IHS facilities, were generally received outside of IHS. Five IHS-funded hospitals, such as the Phoenix Indian Medical Center in Arizona, regularly treated patients. Although some other IHS facilities provided limited treatment services, most relied on outside providers. For example, IHS patients with HIV/AIDS might see a specialist outside of IHS every 3 months for their HIV/AIDS treatment services and an IHS provider for other routine care. IHS officials reported that most IHS facilities did not provide treatment services because they had few American Indian or Alaska Native patients known to have HIV/AIDS, had limited resources, focused on other health concerns, or their providers had limited training or experience treating the disease. Additionally, some patients may not access or continue treatment from IHS or outside providers due to concerns about confidentiality and lack of transportation to distant facilities. IHS has undertaken outreach and planning, capacity building, and surveillance initiatives related to HIV/AIDS. These initiatives are overseen by national and area-level IHS officials. The outreach and planning initiatives include an HIV/AIDS Web site and the development of a national HIV/AIDS administrative work plan. IHS has also undertaken several initiatives aimed at building the capacity of providers to offer HIV/AIDS-related prevention and treatment services, such as training of health care providers and implementation of an HIV/AIDS-related data system that can send providers reminders when patients with HIV/AIDS need care. Finally, IHS has undertaken initiatives related to improving the surveillance of HIV/AIDS in the American Indian and Alaska Native population by developing a prenatal HIV screening measure and an early detection surveillance system. GAO received written comments from HHS on a draft of this report. HHS substantially agreed with the findings of this report. HHS also offered technical comments to provide additional information or clarify specific findings, which we incorporated as appropriate."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Although they represent less than 1 percent of all HIV/AIDS reported  cases, American Indians and Alaska Natives had the third highest rate of  HIV/AIDS diagnosis in the United States after blacks and Hispanics in  2005. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),  an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS),  since the beginning of the epidemic through 2005, a cumulative total of  3,238 American Indians and Alaska Natives have been diagnosed with  AIDS. But this estimate may be understated because American Indians  and Alaska Natives, particularly those living in rural areas, may be less  likely to be tested. They may also be less likely to seek testing because of  concerns about confidentiality when living in close-knit communities.  Additionally, CDC and others have reported that American Indians and  Alaska Natives are more likely to receive treatment at later stages of the  disease and have shorter life spans compared to most other population  groups with HIV/AIDS. Furthermore, American Indians and Alaska Natives  experience disproportionately high rates of risk factors for HIV/AIDS, such  as sexually transmitted infections, substance abuse, and poor  socioeconomic conditions. For example, individuals who are under the  influence of alcohol or drugs are more likely to engage in high-risk  behavior that can put them at greater risk for contracting or spreading  HIV/AIDS.", "The Indian Health Service (IHS), part of HHS, provides or arranges health  care services, including HIV/AIDS treatment, to eligible American Indians  and Alaska Natives. It provided or arranged services for a projected   1.5 million American Indians and Alaska Natives in fiscal year 2007, across  12 federally designated areas that cover all or part of 35 states. Services  are provided through IHS-funded facilities, including those operated by  IHS, those operated by tribes, and Urban Indian Health Program (UIHP)  facilities or through contracts with outside providers. Our prior work  found gaps in the health care services IHS provided for American Indians  and Alaska Natives that, in some cases, hindered American Indians and  Alaska Natives from obtaining needed services. In addition to IHS,  American Indians and Alaska Natives with HIV/AIDS may also receive care  through other sources depending on their access to private health  insurance; their eligibility for other federal health care programs, such as  Medicare and Medicaid; or their eligibility for services provided by entities  funded through Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency  (CARE) Act of 1990 grants.", "Because access to HIV/AIDS prevention services can affect the number of  American Indians and Alaska Natives who have the disease and there may  be variation in the availability of treatment services, you asked us to  examine IHS\u2019s efforts related to HIV/AIDS. Specifically, we examined the  extent to which IHS provides (1) HIV/AIDS prevention services and   (2) HIV/AIDS treatment services. We also examined (3) what other  HIV/AIDS-related initiatives IHS has undertaken.", "To examine the extent to which IHS provides HIV/AIDS prevention  services, we interviewed the officials identified by IHS as the most  knowledgeable about HIV/AIDS services in each of the 12 area offices. The  area officials provided varying levels of detail about the IHS-funded  HIV/AIDS prevention services provided by the tribes in their area,  including those provided at tribally operated facilities. For example,   3 areas included officials from tribal organizations in these interviews,  while other area officials said they had limited knowledge of the HIV/AIDS  prevention services that were provided at tribally operated facilities. In  addition to the interviews, we also reviewed available IHS documentation  and interviewed relevant IHS officials about IHS\u2019s budget, data systems,  and HIV/AIDS prevention services. In addition, we reviewed data from  CDC and HHS\u2019s Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA)  relevant to American Indians and Alaska Natives with HIV/AIDS. Finally,  we interviewed representatives from advocacy organizations, such as the  National Alliance of State & Territorial AIDS Directors, the National  Council of Urban Indian Health, the National Indian Health Board, and the  National Native American AIDS Prevention Center. We also visited 2 IHS  areas, Phoenix and Tucson, to interview officials from IHS-funded  facilities, tribal health departments, and Ryan White-funded facilities that  served American Indians and Alaska Natives. We selected the Phoenix  area in order to interview officials at the Phoenix Indian Medical Center,  which has the IHS HIV Center of Excellence. In addition, the state of  Arizona has the third largest population of American Indians and Alaska  Natives and the Phoenix area has the second highest number of American  Indians and Alaska Natives living with HIV/AIDS. Because of the Tucson  area\u2019s close proximity to the Phoenix area and the expectation that there  would be some variation in the availability of HIV/AIDS services for  American Indians and Alaska Natives in the same state, we also visited  Tucson.", "To examine the extent to which IHS provides HIV/AIDS treatment  services, we generally conducted the same activities that we used to  examine prevention services. Most of the area officials were able to  provide detailed information about the HIV/AIDS services for American  Indians and Alaska Natives in their area. We conducted additional  interviews with HIV/AIDS service providers both within and outside of IHS  in three areas: Albuquerque, in order to gain additional information about  the HIV/AIDS services in Colorado; Nashville, because the area provides  services in parts of 14 states; and Phoenix, in order to gain additional  information about HIV/AIDS services in Nevada. For example, we  interviewed IHS physicians with experience treating patients with  HIV/AIDS and staff at IHS-funded facilities and Ryan White-funded  facilities that treated American Indians and Alaska Natives patients with  HIV/AIDS. IHS officials and representatives from the National Native  American AIDS Prevention Center helped us to identify these providers. In  addition, we used data from HRSA, which administers the Ryan White  program, in order to identify Ryan White-funded facilities that provided  services to American Indians and Alaska Natives.", "To examine what other HIV/AIDS-related initiatives IHS has undertaken,  we reviewed relevant IHS documents and data on HIV/AIDS. We also  interviewed IHS headquarters officials and those in the area offices  knowledgeable about IHS\u2019s HIV/AIDS-related initiatives.", "The information presented in this report is intended to provide a general  description of HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment services available to  American Indians and Alaska Natives through IHS. IHS does not routinely  collect data or create reports on HIV/AIDS and generally cannot track  spending or services provided specifically for HIV/AIDS. Moreover, tribes  generally are not required to report detailed information to IHS about the  health services they provide or facilities they operate using IHS funds.  Due to these data limitations, we relied on interviews with the area offices.  For each interview, we used a 21-item question set that contained open- ended questions. The area officials we interviewed provided varying levels  of detail to answer our questions, with six conducting brief surveys of  some of the facilities in their areas to provide information for GAO, while  others relied on their general knowledge. Because our questions were  open-ended, we cannot be sure that officials provided a complete list of all  services or activities they provide. Thus our information from these  interviews is illustrative only. We did not independently validate the  information provided by the area offices or contained in documents  obtained from IHS officials. However, we discussed any questions we had  about the information we received with the officials. We conducted our  work from September 2006 through November 2007 in accordance with  generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["For fiscal year 2007, IHS projected a user population of about 1.5 million  individuals, or about 35 percent of the population who identified  themselves as American Indian or Alaska Native in the 2000 U.S. Census.", "Not all persons self-identifying as American Indians and Alaska Natives in  the U.S. Census are members of federally recognized tribes or descendents  of such members; therefore they are not all eligible for IHS services.  However, more than half of the federally recognized American Indian and  Alaska Native population does not permanently reside on a reservation  and therefore may have limited or no access to IHS services because of  their distance from IHS-funded facilities.", "In addition to its headquarters in Rockville, Maryland, IHS consists of a  system of IHS-funded facilities organized into 12 geographic areas of  various sizes and containing different types of facilities. Each of the   12 areas has an area office, an administrative body that may include an  area director, a chief medical officer, and other staff who oversee the  area\u2019s budget and programs. See figure 1 for a map of the counties  included in the 12 IHS areas. These facilities are IHS-operated, tribally  operated, or overseen by the UIHP. IHS areas include more than 650 of  these IHS-funded health care facilities, including hospitals, health centers,  health stations, and UIHP facilities. These facilities mainly offer primary  care to small, rural populations, with a limited number of larger health  care facilities providing specialty care, such as treatment of HIV/AIDS. The  types of facilities in each area vary. For example, the California area has  no IHS-funded hospitals, while the Aberdeen area has nine small hospitals.  The estimated IHS user population in each of the 12 areas ranges from  about 24,000 to about 310,000 (see table 1).", "For fiscal year 2006, Congress appropriated approximately $2.7 billion to  IHS to primarily provide direct care at IHS-funded facilities and to  purchase care outside of IHS through contracts. From this appropriation,  IHS also funds public health nursing, health education, and other  functions. In addition, in fiscal year 2006, IHS received reimbursements of  $681 million from Medicare, Medicaid, and private health insurance, with  Medicare and Medicaid contributing almost 90 percent of those  reimbursements. These reimbursements were for treatment at IHS-funded  facilities of patients who were eligible for Medicare and Medicaid, in  addition to IHS health care. More than 50 percent of IHS\u2019s budget  supports tribally operated facilities and around 1 percent supports UIHP  facilities. Out of the total appropriated for services, approximately   $500 million was designated for contract health services. For services  that IHS-funded facilities cannot provide, the contract health services  funding is used to purchase care for eligible American Indians and Alaska  Natives through contracts with outside providers. For example, contract  health services money has been used to purchase specialty care that may  not be available at a patient\u2019s local IHS-funded facility, such as behavioral  health care. While IHS tracks the overall costs of providing health services,  it does not itemize those costs by disease; therefore the agency does not  track the cost for its facilities to provide HIV/AIDS prevention and  treatment services."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "HIV/AIDS Prevention Strategies", "paragraphs": ["According to HHS, efforts are under way\u2014primarily by CDC\u2014to fund  prevention programs to educate people at highest risk, as well as the  general public, about HIV/AIDS and preventing or reducing their risk. CDC  reports that HIV prevention programs can include strategies such as the  following.", "HIV testing and counseling. According to CDC, individuals at risk for  HIV should be offered testing and counseling so that they can be aware of  their status and take steps to protect their own health and that of their  partners. Testing is a key HIV prevention strategy because, as CDC  estimates, more than half of HIV infections are transmitted by individuals  who are unaware of their infection. Recently available HIV rapid test  results are available the same day, in contrast to traditional lab-based  testing that can take up to 2 weeks to provide results. Thus rapid testing  can help ensure that individuals receive their test result. Moreover,  because rapid tests do not require lab facilities or highly trained staff, this  type of test can expand access to testing in both clinical and nonclinical  settings; however, rapid tests are more expensive than lab-based tests. In  addition to testing, counseling services offer patients ways to eliminate or  reduce their risk for HIV infection.", "Partner notification. Sexual or needle-sharing partners of HIV-positive  individuals have been exposed to HIV and may be infected. Partner  notification services attempt to locate these individuals based on  information provided by the patient to provide counseling, education, and  other services to prevent infection or, if the individual is infected, provide  referrals to care.", "Health education and risk reduction. Health education provides  individuals with the skills and information necessary to avoid or reduce  behaviors that put them at risk for HIV infection. Health education  services can include individual, group, school, and community  interventions, as well as outreach to HIV-positive individuals and HIV- negative individuals at high risk. These services can also include health  communication and public information programs for individuals at high  risk and the general public. Risk reduction activities can include condom  distribution and needle exchange programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HIV/AIDS Treatment Strategies and Barriers to Care", "paragraphs": ["HHS issues guidelines for the medical management of HIV and issues  surrounding HIV infection. The guideline documents are periodically  reviewed and updated by panels of HIV experts, because concepts relevant  to management of HIV change rapidly. The recommended treatment for  HIV is a combination of three or more drugs, called Highly Active  Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART). HAART is used to slow the progression  of HIV/AIDS and has reduced the number of HIV/AIDS deaths, but it may  have side effects and requires adherence to complicated drug regimens.  Additionally, although these drugs can treat HIV infection, HIV cannot be  cured. A 2004 Kaiser Family Foundation report estimated the annual cost  for providing these drugs was between $10,000 and $12,000 per patient.", "Beyond drug regimens, patients with HIV/AIDS may require additional  specialized care. According to CDC, proper management of HIV/AIDS  involves a complex array of behavioral, psychosocial, and medical  services, and therefore referral to a health care provider or facility  experienced in caring for HIV-infected patients is advised. Treatment must  be tailored to the patient\u2019s needs and may include mental health services,  substance abuse services, and medical case management, including  treatment adherence services. Patients with HIV/AIDS may also require  support services, such as housing or transportation assistance.", "Patients with HIV/AIDS may face barriers to care. A 1998 study reported  that patients with HIV/AIDS in both rural and urban areas experienced  barriers to treatment services including a lack of knowledge about the  disease, insufficient financial resources, and a lack of employment  opportunities. Moreover, the study found that patients with HIV/AIDS in  rural areas\u2014compared to their urban counterparts\u2014reported significantly  greater need to travel long distances to medical facilities and personnel; a  shortage of adequately trained medical and mental health professionals; a  lack of personal or public transportation; and community stigma toward  people living with HIV."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "American Indians and Alaska Natives and HIV/AIDS", "paragraphs": ["American Indians and Alaska Natives suffer from HIV/AIDS at higher rates  than whites and from a range of other medical conditions at higher rates  than the general population.

Some of the  major health concerns facing the population include diabetes; heart, liver,  and cardiovascular diseases; cancer; unintentional injuries; obesity;  substance abuse; and suicide. Given these numerous health concerns, as  well as challenges related to poverty and unemployment, the National  Alliance of State & Territorial AIDS Directors report that making HIV/AIDS  a priority is often difficult for many American Indian and Alaska Native  communities.", "Although HIV/AIDS is not among the major health concerns for the  population, American Indians and Alaska Natives experience high rates of  risk factors for HIV infection, such as sexually transmitted diseases and  poverty-related conditions. According to 2005 CDC surveillance data by  race or ethnicity, American Indians and Alaska Natives had the second  highest rates of gonorrhea and chlamydia and the third highest rate of  syphilis. CDC notes that these rates suggest that the sexual behaviors that  facilitate the spread of HIV are relatively common among American  Indians and Alaska Natives. In addition to sexually transmitted diseases,  alcohol and drug abuse\u2014which are prevalent in the American Indian and  Alaska Native community\u2014are risk factors for HIV transmission.  Moreover, conditions related to poverty, such as lower levels of education  and poorer access to health care, may increase the risk for HIV infection.  During 2002 through 2004, approximately one quarter of American Indians  and Alaska Natives\u2015about twice the national average\u2015were living in  poverty. American Indians and Alaska Natives also have poorer access to  health care than other racial and ethnic groups, with 21 percent of  American Indians and Alaska Natives lacking a usual source of medical  care, compared to 18 percent of whites in 2004.", "Furthermore, American Indians and Alaska Natives may be less likely to  be tested for HIV than persons of other racial and ethnic groups because  of location and confidentiality concerns. For example, those who live in  rural areas may be less likely to be tested for HIV because of limited  access to testing. While access to preventive services, such as testing, is a  problem for rural populations in general, more American Indians and  Alaska Natives, compared with persons of other races and ethnicities,  resided in rural areas at the time of their AIDS diagnosis.

In addition, IHS officials noted that American Indians and  Alaska Natives may receive HIV/AIDS treatment services from local  hospitals or from physicians in private practice. Some patients who  receive HIV/AIDS treatment outside of IHS may continue to receive other  types of health care from IHS-funded facilities. For example, one IHS  official reported that these patients might see a specialist quarterly or once  a year for their HIV/AIDS treatment services and an IHS provider for  routine care. An official for another area reported that of those patients  referred to other providers for HIV/AIDS services, most stay with their  IHS-funded facility for their other health care services.", "IHS area officials noted several reasons why IHS-funded facilities in their  areas did not provide HIV/AIDS treatment services.", "Too few patients and limited experience. Officials for six areas\u2014 Albuquerque, Bemidji, California, Nashville, Oklahoma City, and  Portland\u2014reported that some facilities did not provide treatment because  they did not have any patients known to have the disease. Officials for  eight areas\u2014Aberdeen, Albuquerque, Bemidji, Billings, Oklahoma City,  Phoenix, Portland, and Tucson\u2014reported that providers\u2019 lack of training  or experience related to HIV/AIDS were reasons why HIV/AIDS treatment  was not provided at some facilities. Chief medical officers from four of the  eight areas cited frequently changing HIV/AIDS treatment protocols as a  reason why providers might not feel comfortable treating the disease.", "Allocation of limited resources. Officials for 10 areas\u2014Aberdeen,  Albuquerque, Bemidji, Billings, California, Nashville, Oklahoma City,  Phoenix, Portland, and Tucson\u2014cited limited IHS resources, such as  funding or staff, as a reason for referring patients outside IHS. Officials for  4 of the 10 areas said that, given IHS\u2019s limited resources, including limited  staff, and the availability of HIV/AIDS services outside of IHS, they  preferred to refer patients to outside providers rather than provide  HIV/AIDS treatment services in-house. In addition, officials in 4 of the 10  areas reported that their pharmacies do not provide HAART because of  the high cost of the HIV/AIDS drugs or because too few patients seek  those drugs from IHS.", "Other health concerns. Officials in six areas\u2014Alaska, Bemidji, Billings,  Oklahoma City, Portland, and Tucson\u2014mentioned that their areas have  other health concerns that take precedence over HIV/AIDS. Among the  other more prevalent health concerns mentioned were unintentional  injuries and diabetes. Moreover, while area officials listed diabetes,  accidents, and heart disease as some of the 10 leading causes of death in  their area, only the California area officials listed HIV/AIDS as one of the  10 leading causes of death in their area.

Officials from 7 areas\u2014Aberdeen, Alaska, Bemidji, California,  Navajo, Oklahoma City, and Portland\u2014reported that some patients with  HIV/AIDS were concerned that their friends or relatives who work or  access services at IHS would learn about their HIV status. For example, an  official for one rural area said that in villages many people are related to  IHS community health aides and other service providers, which increases  patients\u2019 reluctance to disclose their HIV status and seek HIV/AIDS  treatment services. Officials in 7 areas\u2014Alaska, Albuquerque, Bemidji,  Billings, Oklahoma City, Phoenix, and Tucson\u2014mentioned that distance to  HIV/AIDS treatment services or lack of transportation may affect  American Indians\u2019 and Alaska Natives\u2019 ability to access care. Officials in  one area reported knowing of an isolated region in one state in the area  that had \u201cclear unmet needs\u201d because it was located 300 miles from any  facilities\u2014IHS or otherwise\u2014with HIV/AIDS treatment services. In one  urban area, an official reported that relying on public transportation was a  barrier to treatment because it can be unreliable and unaffordable for  many clients. Area officials in Albuquerque, Phoenix, and Navajo said that  patients may not access treatment because of cultural reasons. One  official noted that traditional healing practices may take priority over  western medicine. In addition, this official noted that, in some  communities, family obligations may also take priority over treatment. For  example, he said that a patient may miss an appointment because he or  she chose to be with a sick family member in another state.", "Some area officials reported that there were other factors that could affect  a patient\u2019s continuation of HIV/AIDS treatment, such as alcohol or drug  abuse or lack of housing. Officials for five areas\u2014Alaska, Albuquerque,  Navajo, Phoenix, and Tucson\u2014cited concerns with patients with  HIV/AIDS adhering to their treatment programs, partly due to substance  abuse. In addition, officials for two IHS-funded facilities noted that  housing can be of concern. For example, one of the facility officials said  that an HIV-positive patient from a small community moved to a nearby  city because the patient\u2019s home lacked both heat and water, compromising  the patient\u2019s health.
