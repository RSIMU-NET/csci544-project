The Army does not have reasonable assurance that NLAC collects complete and accurate data from service systems because it does not have checks and controls that federal internal control standards recommend to ensure source data is reliable. Without steps to ensure the quality of the data that flows into NLAC, DOD officials risk making decisions based on inaccurate and incomplete inventory information, or ammunition offices may have to devote extra staff and time to obtain accurate data of DOD-wide inventory.", "To identify inventory owned by one service that may be available to meet the requirements of another service, the military services have a process for collecting and sharing ammunition data. Through a stratification and redistribution process, the services assess whether inventory can meet stated requirements and then may transfer available inventory, including inventory in excess of one service's requirement, to another service. This redistribution offsets procurements of ammunition items. To facilitate this process, each service develops and shares ammunition inventory data in annual reports. The Army's annual report, however, does not include information on certain missiles. Also, the Army's report does not include information on all available, usable ammunition that in a prior year was unclaimed by another service and placed in storage for disposal; DOD guidance does not require that such inventory be included in the reports.

For example, the service systems routinely exchange  data with the Army\u2019s Logistics Modernization Program (LMP), an  information system that is used to manage operations at ammunition  depots and other Army industrial activities. The military services rely on  Army data in LMP to help them maintain accountability of items, including  ammunition, they own that are stored and managed at the Army\u2019s depots.  In addition to the services\u2019 systems, the Army has a data repository called  the National Level Ammunition Capability (NLAC).

For example, Joint Staff and Marine Corps ammunition officials  stated that, rather than relying solely on NLAC, they preferred to take the  extra step of phoning or e-mailing their counterparts in the other services  to obtain information on specific items.", "NLAC does not have checks and controls that federal internal controls  recommend to ensure that data from source systems are reliable. As a  result, errors in the originating data also will appear in NLAC. In addition  to being subject to inaccuracies from source systems, NLAC may not  receive complete data transmissions from source systems into NLAC. For  example, NLAC is not receiving all serial numbers for serialized items,  even where these exist in LMP. Joint Munitions Command officials have  submitted a request to NLAC for assistance to determine why the  transmission from LMP to NLAC is not taking place, but the issue has not  yet been addressed and officials have not received a timetable for  resolution. Also, data available in NLAC on the services\u2019 ammunition data  may differ from data found in the services\u2019 accountable records because  of different business processes among the military services. For example,  the Air Force\u2014unlike the Army\u2014accounts for ammunition items that have  been shipped to another location by retaining the amount to be delivered  at the originating location until receipt has been confirmed at the  destination.

For example, according to program officials, they have  monitored incoming data to ensure that updates occurred, such as  whether the repository received the expected volume of information.  Furthermore, they receive some data elements, such as the weight of the  explosive component of the ammunition, directly from other sources even  if these exist in LMP, because of known issues with LMP accuracy. They  also conduct logic checks of incoming data; for example, they can detect  and correct if a data field is supposed to contain an alphabetic character  but the incoming file actually has a numeric character. However, they do  not check whether the correct alphabetic characters appear.
