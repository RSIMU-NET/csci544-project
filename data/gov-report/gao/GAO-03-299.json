Of the more than $2 trillion in tax receipts that IRS collected in fiscal year 2002, lockbox banks processed approximately $268 billion. The findings of GAO's study include the following: (1)Nothing inherent in the lockbox contractual agreements would necessarily contribute to mishandling of tax receipts. Although a desire to avoid negative consequences, such as financial or other penalties allowed for by the agreements, could motivate bank employees to make poor decisions, penalty provisions are necessary to help the government address inadequate performance. The results of an ongoing investigation of the 2001 incident may help IRS and FMS determine whether new provisions or modifications to existing provisions are needed. (2) Although IRS and FMS have significantly increased their presence at lockbox sites, oversight of lockbox banks during fiscal year 2002 was not fully effective to ensure that taxpayer data and receipts were adequately safeguarded and properly processed. Inadequate oversight resulted mainly from a lack of clear oversight directives and policies; failure to perform key oversight functions; and conflicting roles and responsibilities of IRS personnel responsible for day-to-day oversight of lockbox banks. (3) Internal controls, including physical security controls, need to be strengthened at IRS lockbox locations. In addition, the processing guidelines under which IRS lockbox banks operate need to be revised to improve receipt-processing controls, employment screening, and courier security. (4) IRS and FMS have not performed a comprehensive study of the costs and benefits of using lockbox banks. The most recent study, in 1999, omitted some costs that may have affected the result. For example, the study did not consider opportunity costs--benefits foregone that might have resulted from alternative uses of the money. Because of these omissions and several changes that have affected costs and benefits, a new study will be needed before lockbox contracts expire in 2007."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Honorable Charles E.

The Department of the  Treasury\u2019s Financial Management Service (FMS) has contractual  agreements with four lockbox banks, which operate 11 lockbox sites at  nine locations on IRS\u2019s behalf. The intent of the lockbox program is to  accelerate the deposit of tax receipts and increase interest savings, thus  enhancing the efficiency of government cash management. Lockbox banks  have been used since 1984 for this purpose.", "Instances of fraud, waste, and abuse have occurred at IRS lockbox banks  over the years. In 2001, approximately 78,000 federal tax receipts, valued at  more than $1.2 billion, were lost or destroyed at a lockbox bank operated  by the Mellon Financial Corporation in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Instances  of employees stealing and cashing taxpayer receipts have also occurred at  lockbox banks.

The  receipts processed were limited to tax receipts for estimated tax payments,  which are typically paid by taxpayers on a quarterly basis. The bank was  compensated from the interest it earned on a compensating balance\u2014 funds placed in the bank\u2019s account by FMS. Since that time, the IRS  lockbox program has expanded to cover taxpayers in all states and receipts  for individual income tax returns, employment tax returns, and other  miscellaneous types of taxes. Most of the returns are received during the  April peak processing period and the smaller peak periods during January,  June, and September. Certain taxpayers who owe money and are making  payments are instructed to mail returns and payments to post office boxes  maintained by the lockbox banks. The lockbox sites deposit the receipts to  an account with Treasury and send processed documents (tax return forms  and payment vouchers), computer tapes containing taxpayer data, and  unprocessable receipts to IRS Submission Processing Centers for further  processing and recording in the taxpayer accounts (see fig. 1).", "FMS formalized the lockbox processing arrangements in 1993 by  establishing contractual agreements with commercial banks to process tax  receipts on behalf of IRS. In 2002, new, but similar, agreements were  established. Like the 1993 agreements, the 2002 agreements are 5-year  agreements with two 1-year extension options. The current lockbox  network consists of four banks, three of which operate multiple sites that support the 10 IRS Submission Processing Centers across the country. The  agreements with FMS require that these banks operate their sites according  to IRS\u2019s Lockbox Processing Guidelines (LPG). The LPGs provide the  detailed procedures the banks are required to follow in providing lockbox  services for IRS and are updated as needed. Both FMS and IRS monitor  lockbox bank compliance with the agreements and the LPGs, and each  lockbox site has an IRS employee who serves as a lockbox coordinator.  For fiscal year 2002, IRS lockbox banks processed more than 66 million  receipts, totaling about $268 billion, which accounted for approximately 13  percent of total tax receipts in dollars and 32 percent in volume.", "The intent of the lockbox program is to enhance federal cash management  by accelerating the deposit of tax receipts, which would increase interest  float savings (or interest cost avoidance) to the government and reduce the  amount Treasury would have to borrow to pay government obligations. The  estimate of interest float savings resulting from IRS\u2019s use of lockbox banks  has varied throughout the years. In calculating interest float savings, IRS  and FMS assumed, based on a 1988 joint IRS/FMS study, that lockbox  banks could process receipts and deposit the funds to a Treasury account 3  days faster than IRS. However, in a 1998 report, the Treasury Office of  Inspector General (OIG) questioned the validity of this assumption and  recommended that IRS acquire relevant and reliable comparative cost data on all aspects of the lockbox program to identify the most cost-effective  option to use for processing and depositing tax receipts.", "In response to the Treasury OIG report, IRS and FMS hired a contractor to  compare lockbox bank processing to IRS processing for individual tax  (Form 1040) receipts. The contractor reported in July 1998 that lockbox  banks could make funds available to the federal government an average of  2 days faster than IRS. In 1999, IRS and FMS formed a taskforce to study  the costs and benefits of continuing to use lockbox banks for processing  Form 1040 receipts. Based on its study, the IRS/FMS taskforce  recommended that such processing remain with the lockbox banks rather  than be returned to IRS for fiscal years 2001-2007."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To accomplish our work, we reviewed reports relevant to oversight and  management of the lockbox program, including reports prepared by FMS,  IRS, GAO, the Treasury OIG, TIGTA, and internal and external auditors  from several lockbox banks.

As agreed with your office, we did not review the incident involving the  loss and destruction of taxpayer receipts and data at the Pittsburgh  lockbox, since an ongoing investigation was in process. The following  procedures were also performed for each of the objectives:   To determine if new contractual agreements address previously  identified problems and correct provisions that could contribute to  improper handling of taxpayer returns, we reviewed and analyzed the  provisions in the 1993 and 2002 lockbox bank contractual agreements.  We also compared the agreements to determine whether changes had  been made.", "To determine the adequacy of FMS\u2019s and IRS\u2019s oversight of lockbox  banks, we reviewed FMS and IRS policies, guidelines, checklists,  schedules of site visits, and reports from oversight reviews. We  performed site visits at two IRS Submission Processing Centers to  observe IRS reviews of documentation received from the lockbox  banks. At each Submission Processing Center, we interviewed relevant  management and staff concerning lockbox bank oversight policies,  procedures, and practices.", "To determine if lockbox banks\u2019 security and internal controls to  safeguard taxpayer receipts and returns are sound and properly  implemented, we observed physical security and internal controls and  interviewed lockbox personnel at all nine lockbox locations during the  April 2002 peak processing period and at two lockbox sites during the  June 2002 peak processing period. At each site, we also reviewed  lockbox bank employee personnel records for a nonrepresentative  selection of permanent and temporary lockbox employees. In addition,  we compared the 2001 and 2002 LPGs for changes related to  safeguarding tax receipts and data, receipt processing, employee  screening, and courier requirements. We also compared IRS\u2019s Internal  Revenue Manual (IRM) and other directives, which are IRS\u2019s detailed  policies, with the 2002 LPGs.", "To determine whether the costs and benefits of processing tax receipts  through lockbox banks instead of processing them at IRS were  considered, we reviewed federal guidance and economic literature on  cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness analyses of federal programs and  policies. In addition, we analyzed prior FMS and IRS studies and the  support for the data, assumptions, and methodology used in the 1999  report to estimate the costs and benefits of processing tax receipts  through lockbox banks versus processing them at IRS.", "We performed our work from April 2002 through November 2002 in  accordance with U.S. generally accepted government auditing standards.

The agreements contain penalty  provisions that can result in negative consequences if banks do not perform  work that meets quality standards or do not perform work within required  time frames. The consequences range from financial penalties to  termination of the lockbox agreement. Although a desire to avoid negative  consequences could motivate lockbox bank employees to make poor  decisions in their handling of taxpayer receipts, the penalty and  termination provisions are necessary to help the federal government  address inadequate contractor performance on the two performance  dimensions\u2014quality and timeliness\u2014deemed critical by IRS and FMS.", "FMS and IRS made some enhancements to the 2002 agreements, such as  the addition of a new performance penalty and clarification of other  provisions. Because TIGTA\u2019s investigation of the incident involving the loss  and destruction of tax receipts by employees at the Pittsburgh lockbox site  during the 2001 April peak processing period is still ongoing, it is unclear  whether any provisions in the lockbox agreements may have contributed to  the mishandling incident.

Contracts often contain specific standards for  acceptable performance as well as provisions for rewarding or penalizing  contractors according to their performance in these areas. Such provisions  may inadvertently encourage contractors to focus their efforts on one area  to the detriment of their performance in other areas. For example, if a  contract\u2019s provisions reward timely performance more than they reward  high-quality performance, contractors may be encouraged to take shortcuts  that improve timeliness but detract from quality of work. As a result, it is  important that contract incentives be appropriately designed and balanced  to obtain acceptable levels of performance in all relevant areas. To ensure  that contract provisions are operating as intended, effective oversight of  contractors is essential.", "The lockbox banks are paid a fixed price for each item they process, and  their total compensation depends on the number of each type of receipt  they process. Lockbox banks have no direct influence over the volume of  receipts. The compensation paid is therefore not a factor in measuring IRS  lockbox performance, and the lockbox contractual agreements contain no  direct incentives, positive or negative, related to cost. Lockbox bank  performance is measured on timeliness and quality factors, specifically  focusing on expediting the flow of funds to Treasury and ensuring that  receipts are accurately processed.", "Because the basis for using lockbox banks was IRS\u2019s and FMS\u2019s belief that  the banks could process tax receipts faster than IRS could, timeliness is a  key measure of lockbox bank performance. Except during peak processing  periods, the agreements require that lockbox banks deposit receipts within  24 hours of their receipt at the lockbox bank. During peak processing  periods, all receipts must be processed and ready for deposit by the  assigned program completion date (PCD). According to the terms of the  lockbox contractual agreements, FMS may assess banks penalties or  terminate their contractual agreements if they fail to meet these deadlines.  The agreements also provide that the amount of any penalty assessed for  late deposit of tax receipts shall be based on the amount of interest  Treasury lost because of the delay. FMS imposed financial penalties on two  lockbox banks for not meeting the PCD during the April 1997 peak  processing period.", "Meeting quality standards is another critical aspect of IRS lockbox banks\u2019  performance. Processing errors can place unnecessary burdens on  taxpayers and delay processing of tax receipts. For example, a processing  error might cause a lockbox bank to withdraw more funds from a  taxpayer\u2019s account than the amount actually written on the check. If the  taxpayer\u2019s account contained inadequate funds to cover the incorrect  withdrawal amount, the taxpayer\u2019s bank could assess penalties for  insufficient funds. If the error caused the bank to withdraw less than the  amount owed, IRS might erroneously assess the taxpayer interest and  penalties for an incomplete payment. The lockbox agreement provisions  allow FMS to assess lockbox banks financial penalties or to terminate an  agreement for poor performance. FMS added a new provision to the 2002  lockbox agreements that is designed to facilitate reimbursement to IRS and  FMS for costs they incur due to specific failures in performance, such as  costs resulting from lockbox banks\u2019 errors in processing tax receipts. In  addition, the 2002 agreements clarified certain existing penalty provisions.", "We found nothing inherent in the 1993 or 2002 lockbox contractual  agreements that would necessarily contribute to mishandling of taxpayer  receipts.

The site had a history of performance problems for  which the bank had been assessed financial and other penalties. In 1997,  FMS assessed the bank that operated the Pittsburgh site more than $1.4  million in penalties for failing to meet the assigned PCD and therefore  delaying availability of funds to the Treasury. In September 2000, FMS  placed the site on probation because of numerous uncorrected security  violations, including commingling of corporate and other government  agency processing with IRS processing. FMS, with IRS\u2019s concurrence,  removed the site from probationary status 2 \u00bd months later, after a site  review conducted during the probationary period indicated that bank  management had corrected all but one of the security violations. A  subsequent, unannounced review by FMS and IRS 3 \u00bd months after the site  was taken off probation also found that past violations of security  requirements had not recurred and that the site was, for the most part, in  compliance with security requirements. Nevertheless, approximately 2  months after this review, the Pittsburgh site was found to have lost or  destroyed tens of thousands of tax returns, and, as a result, FMS  terminated its contractual agreement for the site. As of September 30, 2002,  IRS had spent over $4 million to obtain duplicate receipts and returns from  the affected taxpayers, and the federal government had lost an estimated  $13.5 million in interest as a result of the incident.", "In October 2002, Mellon Bank agreed to pay the government $18.1 million  to cover administrative costs and expenses associated with the incident.

According to IRS and FMS officials,  their focus historically has been on monitoring a lockbox site\u2019s ability to  meet the overall April peak processing period\u2019s PCD. IRS and FMS found  that this approach presented problems because lockbox banks tended to  address production problems during the peak processing period only when  meeting the PCD was questionable. The solution employed by the banks  was to bring in additional temporary staff near the end of the peak period  to be able to meet the PCD.

However, IRS  took 5 months to officially sign half of the waivers. According to IRS  officials, this delay resulted from a misunderstanding on the part of some  IRS officials about whether IRS had to complete the waiver forms if IRS  had already orally informed FMS of its decision. FMS postponed notifying  the banks of a decision on their requests because it was waiting to receive a  formal written decision from IRS for each request. However, 4 months after  FMS received the requests for waivers and with no official decision from  IRS, FMS decided to inform the lockbox sites of its unilateral disapproval  of the banks\u2019 waiver requests to mitigate the risk of loss to the government  from lockbox sites not operating in compliance with the LPGs.", "Although most of the waiver requests were not related to critical  requirements, one lockbox waiver pertained to a critical LPG security  requirement. Under this requirement, temporary employees must provide  photo identifications to the guards in exchange for badges allowing them  access to the processing area. This control procedure was designed to  validate the identity of individuals claiming to be employees before they  enter the processing area. Bank management at one lockbox bank believed  that its automated entry system provided adequate compensating controls  against unauthorized access to tax data and receipts and that the manual  verification of each employee\u2019s identity was unnecessary. The bank  therefore did not perform the procedure. FMS and IRS eventually denied  the request, stating that the lockbox bank\u2019s compensating controls did not  provide sufficient protection against unauthorized entry. However, because  of the breakdown in the joint waiver assessment process and the resulting  delay in notifying the bank of the agencies\u2019 decision, tax receipts and data  were unnecessarily exposed to an increased risk of theft. Bank  management had informally requested a waiver for the same issue in  August 2001, before FMS and IRS established their formal waiver process  in April 2002. IRS officials indicated that they had already orally informed  the bank that its initial request for a waiver was denied and had also  informed FMS during a meeting that the subsequent request submitted on  the official waiver request form in April 2002 was denied. Therefore, IRS  officials concluded that it was not necessary to review the April 2002  formal waiver request. FMS postponed notifying the banks of the decision  because it was waiting for IRS\u2019s decision in writing. After FMS decided to  inform banks of its unilateral decisions on their formal waiver requests, it  notified this site of its decision to deny the waiver request in mid-August  2002. As a result, the site operated in noncompliance with this security  requirement for over 7 months, from January through August 2002. This  period included the April 2002 peak period, when the bank operated in  three shifts with as many as 300 employees per shift.

More  advanced machines slit envelopes on three sides and extract the contents.  The method used to open the envelopes determines how the envelopes  should be candled. The LPGs provide guidance on candling procedures and  require all envelopes to be candled twice before destruction. Envelopes  opened with the assistance of a mail extraction machine are considered to  have gone through the first candling. After processing, employees are  required to review each envelope through a source of light, such as a  candling table, to determine if any contents remain in the envelope.

Employees manually opened the envelopes, completely bypassing the  first candling step to be performed by the machines. These envelopes  were then candled only once on the candling table.

Therefore,  they concluded that no further candling was required. However, an IRS  official subsequently explained that envelopes opened by these types of  machines should be subject to a second candling until IRS performs a  study to determine their effectiveness. The fact that we found a $3,300  check that had not been detected by one of these advanced machines,  located in another site, indicates that they can also malfunction and  result in the destruction of taxpayer data and receipts. As a result,  candling procedures did not effectively reduce the risk of accidental  destruction of tax receipts and data.", "Accounting for Items Found During Candling Was Insufficient Lockbox guidelines require lockbox employees to account for each item  found during candling. Some lockbox locations use two forms to record  items found--an internal candling log and a Form 9535 or equivalent,  which is required to be submitted to the lockbox coordinator each month  for IRS review. Employees prepare the internal log while candling and later  transfer the data onto the Form 9535. Since all items found during candling  must be reported to IRS, the Form 9535 should record the same number  and amounts of checks found as noted on the internal log being maintained  as processing is occurring. However, the lockbox guidelines do not require  a reconciliation of one set of records to the other, nor do they require a  reconciliation of items found during candling to their candling records.", "During our review, we found that lockbox banks did not always have  procedures to ensure that all items found were accurately recorded on both  sets of logs and that bank managers could not properly account for all  items found. At one location, the two sets of logs that bank management  provided to us could not be reconciled. For example, a check was recorded  on the internal log but not on the Form 9535. Management could not  provide an adequate explanation or documentation to explain the  discrepancy. At this location, we also noted delays of up to 6 days in  transferring records of items found from the internal log to the Form 9535.  Lockbox management explained that because of the volume of work during  the April peak, the Form 9535 could not always be completed or the checks  could not always be processed the same day they were found during  candling. Another location\u2019s internal log only recorded tallies of the  quantity of items found, which did not match the number of items listed on  the log provided to IRS. Because there was not enough information on the  internal log, we could not determine whether items, such as checks,  recorded on the internal log but not on the Form 9535, were ever processed  and credited to the taxpayers\u2019 accounts. We identified this same issue  during a visit to this location in October 2001 as part of our audit of IRS\u2019s  fiscal year 2001 financial statements. After this visit, lockbox management  and IRS agreed to address this problem. However, as of April 2002, this  problem had not been corrected. IRS indicated that it plans to address this  issue in the January 2003 revisions to LPGs. At two other locations, we also  found that no reconciliation occurred between items found during candling  and the candling log.

However, at four locations, we found that lockbox managers, who  indicated they had performed these reviews, failed to document or clearly  document the results. At two additional locations, managers stated that  they did not sample candled envelopes. The manager at one of these  locations believed that her frequent observation of the candling process  was sufficient to ensure that the envelopes were properly candled.

When we  reviewed the two sets of logs we found that the dates, amounts, item  counts, and taxpayer identification information in the logs did not agree,  and bank managers could not reconcile some of the discrepancies. For  example, at one location, five items on the safe log were not on the IRS log.  One of the items was a $140 cash receipt. Because the safe log did not  record taxpayer information for any of the receipts, we could not verify  whether the receipt was ever posted to the taxpayer\u2019s account. There is  currently no requirement in the LPGs for bank managers to reconcile their  internal cash logs to the cash log sent to IRS. Such reconciliation could  have quickly detected the discrepancies we noted. Bank management  attributed some of these discrepancies to human error, inexperienced staff,  and staff failure to take the accounting for cash seriously because the  amounts found are typically small. However, individual taxpayers have  made cash payments totaling hundreds of dollars. Failure to properly  secure and account for cash receipts could result in theft, the untimely  detection of theft, inaccurate posting of tax receipts, and unnecessary  burden on taxpayers whose cash receipts are lost or incorrectly posted.

If lockbox employees  determine that the receipt is timely (i.e., the postmark is prior to the return  or payment due date), the envelope need not be retained. However,  beginning with the first day of the month following the month the payment  is due, lockbox guidelines require lockbox employees to use the date the  mail is received as the transaction date to be recorded in the taxpayer\u2019s  account as the payment date. Furthermore, the lockbox guidelines do not  require lockbox employees to review and retain the envelopes in which the  tax receipts were enclosed.", "At one lockbox location we visited, we observed that on May 1, 2002,  lockbox employees received and extracted tax receipts from two  envelopes postmarked prior to or on the April 15 payment due date.  Because it was already past the period during which lockbox employees  were required to examine postmarks and retain envelopes, lockbox  employees processed the payments as delinquent and would have  discarded the envelopes even though they were aware that the envelopes  were postmarked on or before the payment due date. When we brought  these two transactions to the lockbox coordinator\u2019s attention, the lockbox  coordinator concluded that, in these instances, the taxpayers had made  timely payments. The lockbox coordinator subsequently adjusted the  taxpayers\u2019 accounts to reflect these as timely payments. We recognize that  careful examination of postmarks on envelopes for all receipts received  after the payment due dates slows down the payment processing and we  recognize the need to establish reasonable cut-off dates for this review  process. However, lockbox employees should immediately seek processing  guidance from the lockbox coordinator when incidents such as the ones  noted above come to their attention to avoid burdening taxpayers with  erroneous penalties and interest for late payments.

At one location, we found that 4 out of a  nonrepresentative selection of 25 permanent employees whose personnel  files we reviewed began working at the lockbox location before bank  management received their fingerprint check results. Bank management  and IRS personnel explained that this situation occurred because IRS had  verbally waived compliance with the screening requirements due to the  fact that the bank was experiencing delays in obtaining timely responses on  fingerprint checks at the beginning of 2002. At the second location, weak  controls to ensure that all employees successfully complete FBI fingerprint  checks allowed a permanent bank employee to process receipts and  taxpayer data for 3 months before lockbox managers discovered that the  employee had not undergone a fingerprint check.

Other results of  background investigations may indicate that an arrest or conviction was  found during a criminal records check but not the basis for the arrest or  how recently or frequently the offense occurred.

Because some banks subject their  permanent employees to less scrutiny when performing background  investigations than other banks, IRS may not be aware of critical  information that could have been uncovered by a more thorough  background investigation, such as recent criminal records not yet reported  to the FBI, which might cause IRS to deny them access to taxpayer data."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FBI Checks May Be Inadequate for Lockbox Employees Who Have Recently Established Residency in the United States", "paragraphs": ["TIGTA auditors recently reported that lockbox banks often employ non- U.S. citizens with lawful permanent residence to process IRS tax  payments.

However, this hiring  practice may pose unnecessary risks to IRS materials because the FBI  fingerprint check, which is national in scope, may have very little  information to disclose if these individuals lived in this country for only a  short period of time. The Department of State and the Immigration and  Naturalization Service perform some background checks before issuing  visas to nonresidents or upgrading visas that may allow individuals to  achieve lawful permanent resident status.
