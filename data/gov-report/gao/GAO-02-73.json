For example, the 2000 Defense Authorization Act eliminated the program\u2019s 365-day benefit limit. This converted the program from one of temporary assistance while qualifying patients transitioned to other care resources, including Medicaid, to permanent assistance of potentially unlimited duration. The 2000 Defense Authorization Act made ICMP-PEC primary payer to Medicaid. This changed the program from one that relied on Medicaid and other public resources before providing services into a qualifying beneficiary\u2019s first resort for care. These changes had the potential for increasing ICMP-PEC\u2019s costs.", "In an effort to explain the new changes and how the program should operate, in March and November 1999 and March and April 2000, TMA issued informal guidance to regional program managers. However, DOD regional and MCSC officials told us that the successively changing guidance did not adequately address the program\u2019s lack of clear eligibility criteria and benefits or issues that the legislative changes had raised, such as the effects of transforming the program into a long-term benefit. Eliminating the 365-day benefit limit, for example, potentially opened the program to unlimited care for those among the over-age-65 population who would qualify under TFL. MCSC officials also told us that they viewed the guidance as nonbinding because it was not the subject of a formal contract modification. According to regional program managers, the net effect of the program changes and unclear guidance is general confusion about the program\u2019s fundamental purpose. In seeking to provide further guidance on how legislative changes to the program are to be implemented, TMA\u2019s proposed rule sets forth, among other things, that ICMP-PEC\u2019s purpose is not to provide long-term care, thus reiterating TMA\u2019s interim guidance. But, under the proposed rule, ICMP-PEC\u2019s per- patient benefit would remain potentially unlimited and ICMP-PEC would remain first payer to Medicaid. Thus, the program would appear to continue to provide a potentially long-term care benefit contrary to the proposed rule\u2019s statement about ICMP-PEC\u2019s purpose.

For the most part, ICMP- PEC\u2019s custodial care definition is DOD\u2019s way of screening from TRICARE Basic, patients with high-cost, prolonged, nonremedial, disabling conditions. The definition generally requires that a patient must have a severe mental or physical disability and that the disability must be prolonged. Also, the patient must require assistance to support the essentials of daily living and not be under active medical, surgical, or psychiatric treatment that would reduce the disability such that the patient could function outside a protective, monitored, and controlled environment. Each case must be separately and comprehensively reviewed before care-level and duration decisions can be made. Some program managers told us that because the criteria are subjective and open to interpretation there is resulting confusion about which cases may qualify. Coupled with the multistep application reviews, this confusion may result in an ICMP-PEC caseload that is lower than the actual numbers of eligible patients.", "Regional case managers also cited many instances in which TMA would approve cases for the program but then deny similar cases with no clear justification for the decisions. The TMA West officials responsible for approving and denying cases told us they agreed that the ICMP-PEC criteria are too vague and need more specificity and that as a result their decision-making has been impeded.", "Regional program managers also told us ICMP-PEC\u2019s benefits have not been clearly defined or set forth. They told us that, as a result, decisions about each eligible patient\u2019s services appear arbitrary. Decisions to assign different hours of skilled nursing care or to approve or deny other in-home services for apparently similar cases without reference to some commonly understood benefit criteria confuse regional program managers and beneficiaries about ICMP-PEC\u2019s case-by-case coverage. For example, a 1- year-old patient requiring 24-hour ventilator-related care was denied ICMP-PEC coverage by TMA West because the care was viewed as potentially temporary (meaning the patient likely would improve) because it would be needed for an estimated 5 to 10 years. In contrast, a 4-year-old patient requiring the same services was approved for 16 hours a day by TMA West, later increased to 24 hours, 2 days a month. The services were approved despite similar expectations that the patient would no longer need ventilator care after about 3 years.", "Also, regional program officials told us that due to ICMP-PEC\u2019s eligibility and benefit ambiguities, they are unable to adequately explain its coverage to potential beneficiaries. Some officials questioned why they would attempt to inform potential clients about the program if they cannot answer their clients\u2019 most basic questions about it. As a result, they told us, ICMP-PEC is not well known to potential beneficiaries nor to their service providers. In this regard, TMA\u2019s proposed rule reiterates ICMP- PEC\u2019s custodial definition and, for the most part, reiterates the interim guidance with respect to eligibility criteria so that the current problems may persist.

After these reviews, TMA makes its separate review followed by a full, independent review by a peer-review organization. This review may be and has been, overturned by TMA upon its final case review. While acknowledging the importance of an effective eligibility process, some regional MCSC medical directors and case managers questioned the need for so many reviews, pointing to their redundancy and questioning their cost effectiveness and the value added to the process.

In this regard, case managers told us they need to do a better job and formalize their communications with other region\u2019s MCSC case managers when PFPWD cases leave and enter their jurisdictions.

Effective April 2001, active duty beneficiary copayments are no longer required under TRICARE Prime but still are under PFPWD. PFPWD\u2019s caseload may be reduced to only ADFMs needing services that are only obtainable under PFPWD and not TRICARE Prime such as hearing aids, assistive services such as interpreters for the deaf, and special education services for disabled patients (see appendix IV).", "To illustrate, if a $6,000 wheelchair were obtained under PFPWD, the participant would have a cost-share ranging from $25 to $250, depending on the active duty member\u2019s rank. An E-5, for example, would pay $25 a month for the 6 months over which the $6,000 cost could be prorated.Prior to April 2001, obtaining the same wheelchair under TRICARE Prime would have cost the family a 15 percent cost-share, or $900. Today, obtaining the wheelchair under TRICARE Prime would cost the family nothing. Thus, PFPWD patients who can obtain the services and equipment they need through TRICARE Prime\u2014about 70 percent of PFPWD\u2019s caseload\u2014will likely do so at no cost."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Questions Remain About the Adequacy of PFPWD\u2019s Monthly Maximum", "paragraphs": ["PFPWD has had a monthly benefit limit that has not changed materially in the last 15 years. Data are not available, however, on how many PFPWD participants are affected by the program\u2019s $1,000 monthly benefit limit. Regional program managers we spoke with had differing views about whether the limit was keeping beneficiaries from obtaining needed services and thus should be increased. Some officials told us that the limit was not reflective of current higher medical service and equipment costs so that some beneficiaries may be reaching the limit. Other officials told us that the recent copayment changes to TRICARE Prime will reduce PFPWD caseload costs and may obviate the need to raise the limit. Still other regional program officials told us that they can schedule services and buy equipment to spread costs over several months so that the $1,000 monthly limit is rarely an obstacle.", "At issue in weighing the adequacy of PFPWD\u2019s monthly benefit are the questions\u2014to what extent are participants incurring costs at or in excess of the monthly limit; to what extent are they using Medicaid and or other means to obtain services that exceed the limit; and how many otherwise eligible beneficiaries exclusively use Medicaid to avoid the $1,000 benefit limit? Data to address such questions are currently unavailable.", "When first established in 1967, the program\u2019s monthly benefit limit was $350. In 1985, the limit was increased to $1,000, where it has remained to this day. Some regional program officials told us that the limit has not kept pace with the rising medical goods and services costs. Such costs have increased by about 130 percent over the same period, which if applied to the current PFPWD monthly limit would increase it to about $2,300.", "Regional program managers told us that the elimination of TRICARE Prime copayments enables PFPWD participants to obtain many of their needed services and equipment under TRICARE Prime at no cost to themselves. For this reason, the managers said that the $1,000 monthly limit may be sufficient to cover the services and equipment that are now obtainable only under PFPWD. However, they were unable to provide data to support that position.", "Some regional program managers told us they have worked with the $1,000 cap for many years and have become experienced in planning and scheduling services and equipment purchases so that needed care is delivered and the monthly cap is not exceeded. Because PFPWD equipment costs can be prorated at $500 per month over the months needed to amortize the costs, the patient can use up to $500 per month for other services such as therapies. For example, an $8,000 wheelchair can be prorated over 16 months, leaving $500 per month over that period for other services. A case manager told us that to ensure that costs were kept within a family\u2019s monthly cap, she could negotiate lower costs with the local providers, search for alternative providers, or consider purchasing the services under TRICARE Prime\u2014which if done before April 1, 2001, would have entailed added beneficiary copayments. Currently, however, the example wheelchair and other services can likely be obtained under TRICARE Prime at no cost. As a result, none of the program managers we spoke with could provide examples of PFPWD cases whose services were interrupted or who otherwise were adversely affected by the monthly limit.", "Further experience with the effects of eliminating TRICARE Prime\u2019s copayments on PFPWD costs and caseloads may suggest that the services and equipment exclusively obtained under PFPWD could as appropriately be obtained under TRICARE Prime.

And, while the state Medicaid programs we compared provide unlimited coverage for under-age-21 patients, older patients\u2019 benefits have varying limits. The FEHBP plans we reviewed had home care and SNF benefits that also have more limitations, but patients with special medical needs may qualify for extended coverage determined through individual case-by- case assessments. PFPWD services are comparable to those available under Medicare and to Medicaid services for patients under age 21 in the states reviewed. Unlike PFPWD and one of the state Medicaid programs, two state Medicaid programs limit services for patients over age 21.

And, for the first 20 SNF care days, Medicare pays all the costs, but for the 21st through the 100th day, the patient is responsible for a daily copayment that currently equals about $99. Even if ICMP-PEC patients were qualified for Medicare, which is the case under TFL beginning October 2001, their Medicare coverage would end after 100 days\u2014while their ICMP-PEC SNF coverage would be unlimited.", "Medicaid program benefits vary among states with respect to service type, duration, and limits, and the family\u2019s income and resources are taken into account in determining eligibility. Generally, Medicaid programs cover all necessary services for persons under age 21 and certain federally required services and state-selected options for persons over age 21. All Medicaid programs provide children a special entitlement to needed services through the provision of Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic and Treatment (EPSDT) services. Established in 1967, EPSDT mandates that states cover any service or item medically needed to ameliorate a child\u2019s condition, regardless of whether the service or item is otherwise covered under the state Medicaid program.", "ICMP-PEC\u2019s in-home skilled nursing benefit appears equal to or better than the three state Medicaid programs\u2014California, Maryland, and Alabama\u2014with which we compared it. California\u2019s Medicaid program includes two Home and Community Based Services (HCBS) waivers that provide in-home skilled nursing services to medically fragile children and adults who would otherwise be receiving care in a licensed health care facility. In our view\u2014and California Medicaid officials generally agreed\u2014 these patients were categorically most like ICMP-PEC patients. Qualifying pediatric patients may receive from 16 hours to 22 hours and adult patients up to 16 hours per day of licensed-nurse care in the home. Patients and providers can decide to take fewer than the available number of skilled nursing hours and apply the difference to such supplementary services as respite care or home health aides.", "Since 1985, Maryland has had a Model HCBS waiver that targets medically fragile individuals including technology-dependent individuals who, before age 22, would otherwise be hospitalized and are certified as needing a hospital or nursing-home level of care. Under the waiver all medically needed services including up to 24 hours of skilled nursing care can be provided to enable medically fragile children to live and be cared for at home rather than in a hospital. Model waiver services include private duty nursing, home health aide assistance, and medical equipment and supplies. For persons over age 21 who meet the income, asset, and other criteria, ICMP-PEC patients would likely qualify for Maryland\u2019s Rare and Expensive Case Management Program (REM). REM patients also receive all the medically necessary care they need either at home or in a community setting but not in an SNF. Thus, Maryland\u2019s Medicaid program and ICMP-PEC services are the same in what they offer in each age group.", "The Alabama Medicaid program does not have an HCBS waiver for a population similar to the ICMP-PEC cases. However, like ICMP-PEC, all medically necessary in-home skilled nursing services up to 24 hours per day would be provided through the Private Duty Nursing benefit for individuals under the age of 21. Unlike ICMP-PEC, however, patients over age 21 needing skilled nursing services would have to be admitted to a nursing facility for their care.", "According to the three selected FEHBP plans\u2019 representatives and the documents they provided, patients with conditions like those of ICMP- PEC patients may receive in-home or SNF benefits, but such benefits are limited. For example, one plan reported that for qualified beneficiaries the plan would cover intermittent home health care and pay 100 percent of the first 30 visits. Subsequent visits would be covered with the patient\u2019s paying $20 per visit. Also, a patient would be eligible for 100 days of SNF care per calendar year. Thus, ICMP-PEC\u2019s benefit is more extensive.", "Each of the plans also has an extended benefit or case management option for caring for patients with unusual medical and condition-related needs. Under such an option, the plans generally   determine the most effective way to provide services;   may identify medically appropriate alternatives to traditional care and coordinate other benefits as a less costly alternative;   conduct an ongoing review of granted alternative benefits;   may withdraw an alternative at any time and resume regular contract   offer or withdraw alternative benefits without OPM review under the normal disputed claims process.", "Plan representatives told us that qualifying patients could be referred to case management for individual assessments of the most appropriate service venues, supplies; equipment; skill needs, if any; and coverage authorization. However, without complete case information and examination by a plan physician, the plan representatives could not elaborate on the extent nor on the duration of possible coverage referring to the need for case-by-case assessments.", "Most PFPWD-type services, including therapies and equipment, are available under Medicare. Medicare does not cover hearing aids, however, and for DME, such as wheelchairs, it requires a 20 percent patient cost- share. Under PFPWD the cost-share would likely be less and the item\u2019s cost could be spread over a period of months, depending on its cost, to manage the purchase within PFPWD\u2019s monthly benefit cap.", "In general, most states\u2019 Medicaid programs offer an array of services needed by children with special health care needs similar to those covered by PFPWD. Medicaid services in the three states we reviewed are comparable to PFPWD\u2019s services for patients under the age of 21. Such services offered at the states\u2019 option can include private duty nursing; case management; physical, occupational, or speech therapies; and prosthetic devices including hearing aids and DME.

This is because many of the medical services and much of the equipment bought under PFPWD with a cost-share and a $1,000-per-month benefit limit can now be gotten for free under TRICARE Prime\u2014which may lead to questions about the need for PFPWD.
