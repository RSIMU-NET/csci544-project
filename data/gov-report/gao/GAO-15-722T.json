The majority of the total projected cost increase for ISS is attributable to commercial crew and cargo transportation. The budget for ISS cargo and crew transportation is currently planned to increase by over $700 million from fiscal year 2016 to fiscal year 2020\u2014or over 55 percent of the total ISS budget\u2014which includes the purchase of six Russian Soyuz seats in 2018 and commercial crew missions beginning in fiscal year 2019.

NASA and CASIS officials told GAO that the ISS will be challenged to meet an expected increase in demand for crew time and certain research facilities. Securing cargo transportation has also presented challenges. CASIS-sponsored researchers have experienced cost increases of almost $500,000 because of a cargo resupply launch failure in October 2014 and delays to other cargo resupply missions. GAO found that absorbing the increased cost has been a challenge for CASIS given its limited research budget and it could be faced with additional cost increases given the June 2015 launch failure of another cargo resupply mission.", "In April 2015, GAO found that CASIS had taken steps to manage and promote research activities on the ISS National Laboratory, but that CASIS and NASA could do more to objectively define, assess, and report progress toward increased utilization. While CASIS had established annual metrics, it did not establish measurable targets for these metrics. GAO has previously reported that performance metrics should have quantifiable targets to help assess whether overall goals are achieved. Consequently, GAO recommended that the ISS program and CASIS develop measurable targets for CASIS's metrics for fiscal year 2016 and beyond. NASA concurred with this recommendation and indicated that these targets should be established by the end of 2015. GAO's April 2015 report also found that while NASA performs an annual assessment of CASIS's performance, the assessment is not documented. This type of documented information can support future assessments of return on investment. GAO recommended that NASA document the annual program assessment of CASIS performance. NASA concurred with this recommendation and plans to take action in response to CASIS's 2015 annual report. Because CASIS is allocated at least 50 percent of ISS research capacity, ensuring that CASIS continues to make progress promoting research activities and achieving its goal to increase utilization of ISS is essential to demonstrate a return on investment for the tens of billions of dollars already invested and that will continued to be invested in ISS."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for the opportunity to discuss our work on the National  Aeronautics and Space Administration\u2019s (NASA) management of the  International Space Station (ISS).

The goal of this program is to enable the government to  buy both cargo and crew commercial transportation services at a  reasonable price. NASA is procuring cargo transportation to the ISS  through a commercial resupply services contract that was signed with  Orbital Sciences Corporation (Orbital) and Space Exploration  Technologies Corporation (SpaceX) in 2008. As of April 2015, SpaceX  has launched six successful resupply missions and Orbital has launched  two successful resupply missions. Orbital and SpaceX are scheduled to  provide 8 and 15 resupply flights, respectively, through December 2017,  although the number of Orbital flights may be modified. Orbital resupply  flights to the ISS were deferred pending a review of a launch failure that  occurred during a resupply launch in October 2014, which resulted in the  loss of that mission. According to NASA officials, both Orbital and NASA  are still reviewing the mishap and have not provided final reports as of  June 2015. The ISS program anticipates that Orbital will resume missions  by the end of 2015; however, the flight will use an Atlas rocket to launch a  Cygnus spacecraft instead of Orbital\u2019s Antares launch vehicle. In late  June 2015, SpaceX experienced a launch failure during a cargo resupply  launch that resulted in the loss of that mission. NASA is currently  evaluating the impact this recent launch failure will have on the ISS  program. In September 2014, NASA released a request for proposals for  its Commercial Resupply Services 2 (CRS2) requirements, which would  result in a follow on contract to the Commercial Resupply Services  contracts that were awarded to SpaceX and Orbital in December 2008.  NASA expects to award CRS2 contracts in September 2015 for cargo  transportation services beginning in 2018, about 4 months later than  anticipated.", "NASA has relied upon Russia to provide crew transportation to and from  the ISS since the retirement of the Space Shuttle in 2011.

The ISS operations costs decreased  $500 million\u2014or 30 percent\u2014from a peak in fiscal year 2011 through  fiscal year 2015. Operations costs are expected, however, to increase by  approximately $130 million from fiscal year 2017 through fiscal year 2020,  which NASA officials attribute in part to inflation and the addition of the  fourth crew member. Our past work on Department of Defense (DOD)  aircraft systems similarly found that operations costs can increase over  time. There may be other factors that could increase operations costs for  the ISS over time such as the need for additional spare parts and  mitigations needed for structural issues. The ISS program has  implemented a number of initiatives that have yielded cost savings or  containment. For example, NASA reduced operations costs by scaling  back ISS program and contractor workforce levels and by combining  several contracts. The NASA Inspector General currently has ongoing  work assessing NASA\u2019s efforts to combine and consolidate ISS contracts  for operations and maintenance.", "NASA also projects that the cost for the ISS Research account will remain  stable through fiscal year 2020, when research costs are expected to be  about 9 percent of total ISS projected costs. Within this account, NASA  provides limited funding to CASIS\u2014$15 million per year\u2014of which a  minimum of $3 million is to be used to sponsor non-NASA research  aboard the ISS by commercial, academic, and other government agency  users. Although NASA research costs are projected to remain stable,  CASIS sponsored research is not limited to this $3 million minimum. For  example, our analysis of CASIS information shows that CASIS has  averaged more than $4.3 million in grants paid out to researchers each  fiscal year since 2012 and has paid over $15 million to its grantees  through March 2015."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NASA and CASIS Face Challenges to Increase Utilization and Sustain the ISS Which Could Affect Return on Investment", "paragraphs": ["As we reported in April 2015, NASA and CASIS must overcome several  challenges to increase utilization and sustain the ISS until 2024 and  achieve a better return on the investment. According to NASA and CASIS  officials, as CASIS increases the number of experiments for the ISS  National Laboratory, the demand for crew time and certain research  facilities aboard the ISS is expected to increase and officials project the  ISS National Laboratory will be challenged to meet that demand. NASA  officials told us that while the demand for crew time is currently  manageable, it remains allocated at or near 100 percent, as the three  crew members on the U.S. segment of the ISS utilize most of the 35  hours scheduled per week to conduct research. Crew time for research is  expected to double on the ISS National Laboratory once the crew  increases from three to four astronauts in fiscal year 2018 because,  according to NASA officials, the additional crew member will devote most  of his or her time to research. NASA\u2019s ability to support increased  utilization through an additional crew member, however, is reliant on  commercial crew providers providing the promised capability and NASA\u2019s  ability to fund the effort. Both Boeing and SpaceX plan to hold  demonstration flights to the ISS in 2017, but risks remain for both  contractors.", "According to CASIS officials, they have been challenged to raise  additional funding from external sources to supplement the amount of  funding provided by NASA. CASIS officials attributed this challenge to the  fact that CASIS is a new non-profit entity and the value of performing  research aboard the ISS has not been fully demonstrated. Although  CASIS\u2019s business development team is actively identifying partnerships  and funding opportunities with commercial and non-profit granting  organizations, CASIS officials said that it takes time to identify, develop,  and mature these partnerships to result in funding support. Through  December 2014, CASIS reported that it had received funding  commitments from external sources of approximately $12 million to  support its research mission. However, according to CASIS\u2019s fiscal year  2014 annual report, published in December 2014, CASIS received  contributions totaling only $9,193 in 2014. NASA officials stated that  doing research aboard the ISS National Laboratory can take upwards of 2  to 3 years to plan and execute, timelines that are generally not acceptable  to commercial companies that desire a more rapid return on their  investments. CASIS and NASA officials also told us that the value of  doing research aboard the ISS National Laboratory has to be further  demonstrated so commercial industries can be convinced it is worth the  high investment.", "We also reported in April 2015 that the ability to secure cargo  transportation for selected research investigations to the ISS is outside of  CASIS\u2019s control and has presented challenges. NASA provides launch  services to the ISS National Laboratory through its commercial resupply  services contracts and CASIS receives cargo allocations for its sponsored  research. Budget shortfalls due in part to the effects of sequestration and  the Orbital launch failure have resulted NASA cancelling 4 of 46 planned  cargo flights through 2020. In January 2015, NASA\u2019s Aerospace Safety  Advisory Panel noted that both commercial cargo launch providers had  struggled to meet desired launch dates and that the schedule  performance must significantly improve to enable consistent scientific  research on the ISS. The panel added that there will be additional  pressure on cargo logistics while Orbital works through its plan to resume  cargo missions. This pressure will likely be increased because of the  June 2015 launch failure of a SpaceX cargo resupply mission. We found  that such launch failures and delays have resulted in cost increases for  CASIS-sponsored researchers. For example, the rocket launch failure to  the ISS in October 2014 resulted in the loss of several CASIS-sponsored  research investigations at a total cost of almost $175,000 which includes  hardware and materials, labor consulting, and grants. In addition, launch  delays for another cargo resupply mission resulted in over $300,000 in  cost increases for several researchers. This included costs for additional  materials and samples such as biological payloads that have a limited  viability or very specific requirements associated with the timing of the  payload flight and often require consumables such as gas and water that  must be replenished when a launch is delayed. Absorbing the increased  cost has been a challenge for CASIS given its limited research budget,  but it is addressing the cost increases due to delays by asking  researchers that have biological payloads to identify the impact and  associated costs for launch delays in their budgets so it can plan for  budget reserves, as necessary.", "To extend the ISS service life to 2024 or beyond, NASA must ensure that  spare parts are sufficient and available when needed and that the  structures are sound. In December 2011, we found that NASA had a  reasonable approach to determine, obtain, and deliver necessary spare  parts to the ISS through 2020. At that time, we found that NASA had  given equal weight to manufacturers\u2019 predictions and actual performance.  However, because NASA has generally found failure rates for  replacement units to be lower than manufacturers\u2019 predictions, over time  the resulting estimates could prove to be overly conservative. More  recently, the ISS program reported that one part was failing at rates  greater than projected and that spares were not available as a result. In  December 2011, we recommended that NASA should reassess the  relative weight given to original reliability estimates of spares\u2019 life  expectancies as performance data accumulates. NASA concurred with  this recommendation and the ISS program has taken action to revisit to  the methods it uses to calculate the need for spare parts for the ISS.  NASA performs an annual assessment of the spare parts, which has  resulted in the procurement of spare parts based in part on actual  hardware performance. In our December 2011 report, we also found that  NASA is using reasonable analytical tools to assess structural health and  determine whether ISS hardware can operate safely through 2020. On  the basis of prior analysis of structural life usage through 2015 and the  robust design of the ISS structures, NASA anticipated that\u2014with some  mitigation\u2014the ISS will remain structurally sound for continued operations  through 2020. At the time of our 2011 review, NASA had assessed only  40 percent, by weight, of the assembled ISS because most of the ISS  structures have not been on orbit long enough to accumulate the data  needed for analysis. NASA expected to complete ISS structural  assessments in early 2016. These are positive steps; however, continued  efforts such as this will be important to ensure that processes NASA uses  to evaluate the need for spare parts are adequate to operate and sustain  the ISS for at least an additional 4 years."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Objective Assessment of Progress Needed to Demonstrate Return on Investment", "paragraphs": ["Despite these challenges, in April 2015, we reported that CASIS had  taken steps to carry out its responsibilities to manage and promote  research activities on the ISS National Laboratory as outlined in its  cooperative agreement. For example, CASIS had identified key  research areas and released seven requests for proposals to solicit  interest for research projects. While we noted this progress, we found that  CASIS and NASA could do more to objectively define, assess, and report  progress toward increased utilization. Specifically, we found that while  CASIS had established annual metrics that met most of the key attributes  of successful performance measures, it did not establish measurable  targets or goals for either fiscal year 2014 or 2015 metrics. We have  previously reported that performance metrics should have quantifiable,  numerical targets or other measurable values, which help assess whether  overall goals and objectives were achieved. We concluded that without  these targets, NASA and CASIS cannot conduct assessments of CASIS\u2019s  efforts to increase ISS utilization that are objective, measurable, or  conclusive. To enable such assessments, in April 2015 we recommended  that the ISS program manager work with CASIS to collectively develop  and approve measurable targets for CASIS\u2019s metrics for fiscal year 2016  and beyond. NASA concurred with this recommendation and indicated  that these targets should be established by December 31, 2015.", "Also in our April 2015 report, we found that while NASA performs an  annual assessment of CASIS\u2019s performance, the assessment is not  documented. Federal standards for internal control call for information to  be recorded and communicated to management and others who need it  to carry out their responsibilities. This type of documented information is  important to support decision making and to support future assessments  of return on investment. However, without definitive and documented  assessment factors, NASA will also be challenged to take action in  response to CASIS performance. According to the cooperative agreement  between NASA and CASIS, continued funding of CASIS is contingent on  the scientific progress of the project and that NASA will assess such  progress in fiscal year 2020 to make a determination about whether to  extend or terminate the cooperative agreement. We concluded that without documentation based on objective measures of performance,  NASA lacks support to make such a decision. We therefore  recommended that the ISS program manager document the annual  program assessment of CASIS performance in order to provide CASIS  management actionable information to better fulfill its responsibilities.  NASA concurred with the recommendation and stated that officials would  begin documenting the agency\u2019s annual program assessment in response  to CASIS\u2019s 2015 annual report. It will be important that NASA and CASIS  follow through on their commitments to have objective measures that will  enable NASA to measure CASIS\u2019s progress to increase utilization and  demonstrate the return on the investment of the ISS.", "In conclusion, the ISS offers the potential for scientific breakthroughs, a  unique test bed for new technologies and applications, and a platform for  increased commercial and academic research and NASA has made an  important commitment to the future of research aboard ISS by proposing  to extend operations to 2024. Key to supporting this commitment is  effectively managing the challenges that could affect efforts to maximize  the return on investment for the tens of billions of dollars that have been  spent on the ISS. Achieving greater utilization of the ISS and its unique  capabilities, showing the benefit of commercial and academic research,  and demonstrating success to generate increased interest from potential  users could help NASA demonstrate such a return. Because CASIS is  allocated at least 50 percent of ISS research capacity, ensuring that  CASIS continues to make progress promoting research activities and  achieving its goal to increase utilization of the ISS is essential. Even with  an extension of operations to 2024, CASIS has limited time to  demonstrate that the research and technology development performed  aboard the ISS National Laboratory benefits Earth and commercial  markets can be sustained in low-Earth orbit. By NASA and CASIS  working together in the coming years to address challenges that could  negatively affect increased utilization of this unique research facility and  to identify and document objective measures of success to demonstrate a  return on investment, such a return might be realized.", "Chairman Babin, Ranking Member Edwards, and Members of the  Subcommittee, this completes my prepared statement.
