For example, as part of its headquarters renovation, the General Services Administration (GSA) is making use of open, collaborative work environments and implementing a hoteling program for all employees. In addition, the Department of Agriculture set agency-wide goals for increasing the number of its employees with approved telework agreements as well as its overall telework participation rates for fiscal year 2013. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has taken steps to reduce its space needs as a result of increased workforce mobility for more than a decade, and there are indications that USPTO has avoided real estate costs as a result of its efforts. However, GAO was unable to obtain sufficient information to determine the accuracy and validity of USPTO's estimated cost savings. Beyond USPTO, the agencies GAO reviewed have not yet realized space reductions or cost savings because their efforts are too new. In addition, officials at the selected agencies pointed out that increasing telework participation or implementing a hoteling program may not be appropriate in all instances, such as for employees who work with sensitive or classified documents or who interact with members of the public.", "GSA offers general guidance as well as customized programs to help guide agencies' space-planning efforts in an environment of increased workforce mobility. In this guidance, GSA has shown that agencies can achieve space efficiencies by reconfiguring the layout of existing workstations and implementing various alternative work arrangements. While agencies may take steps on their own to address their changing space needs, GSA has offered two customized programs since 2011 to assist agencies. These programs are designed to help agencies explore mobility and achieve space efficiencies; however, GSA's client agencies determine whether to act on GSA's recommendations, and it may take years to realize savings due to factors such as the timing of leases and the cost of reconfiguration.", "GAO's discussions with officials from the selected agencies and private sector organizations identified two factors--acquiring information about the current utilization of office space, and gaining the support of management and employees--that were frequently viewed as important for an organization to achieve space efficiencies in an environment of increased workforce mobility. By measuring how existing space is being used, organizations are better positioned to determine their future space needs. Similarly, by taking steps to obtain the support of leadership and employees, organizations can help facilitate the acceptance of mobility initiatives. Officials described the loss of dedicated workspace resulting from increased mobility as a significant change in the workplace and indicated that organizations that try to impose such changes are less likely to succeed than those that build organizational support."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO makes no recommendations in this report.

GSA has been reporting since the  late 1990s that federal agencies could do more to reduce their space  needs and achieve savings by recognizing that many of their employees  are able to perform their work either outside the office or in smaller  workspaces. GSA has noted that mobility can improve employees\u2019 work- life balance, such as by giving employees greater control over their  schedule, and can reduce employees\u2019 commuting time. GSA has also  noted that federal agencies have not yet widely embraced mobility, but  trends in the private sector, workforce demographics, and technology  suggest that agencies could do so in the future.", "Organizing the workplace around mobility can reduce the size and  number of dedicated individual workspaces and accommodate the same  number of employees in less total physical space.

Some employees, for example, may not want  to telework for personal reasons or be unable to telework due to the  requirements of their work\u2014these include employees who work with  sensitive or classified documents, or who interact with members of the  public as part of the jobs.", "With respect to the agencies we reviewed:  USPTO has been taking steps to reduce its space needs as a result  of increased workforce mobility for more than a decade. For example,  under USPTO\u2019s Patent Hoteling Program, more than 4,000 full-time  employees\u2014or about 36 percent of its workforce\u2014telework 4 to 5  days per week. These full-time teleworking employees do not have a  personal workspace in the office; instead, they use an automated  system to reserve a workspace for times when they need to be in the  office. According to USPTO officials, most of their employees are  patent examiners who perform solitary, independent work, which  makes them good candidates for teleworking. USPTO officials told  us their Patent Hoteling Program has enabled USPTO to  accommodate new hires without having to increase its space needs.  Further, we note that there are indications that USPTO has avoided  real estate costs as a result of its efforts. For example, in 2012, the  Department of Commerce reported, that as a result of USPTO\u2019s  Patent Hoteling Program, USPTO has avoided almost $17 million in   In  real estate costs annually since 2006 when the program started.addition, an analysis of the costs and benefits of USPTO\u2019s Patent  Hoteling Program that USPTO conducted for fiscal year 2012  indicates that USPTO\u2019s estimated savings could be larger. However,  while we reviewed documentation provided by USPTO regarding its  estimated cost savings, we could not verify USPTO\u2019s estimates as  some key assumptions\u2014such as rental costs per square feet\u2014were  not supported.  In designing its headquarters renovation, GSA officials told us they  made extensive use of open, collaborative work environments;  eliminated private offices for most employees, including senior-level  employees; established a target ratio of one workstation for every two  employees; and implemented a hoteling program for all employees.  GSA also eliminated cubicles in favor of a workbench configuration of  space, as shown in figure 2. GSA estimates that its renovation,  scheduled to be complete before the end of 2013, will allow it to  eliminate the need for additional leased space at four locations in the  Washington D.C. area, resulting in projected savings of approximately  $25 million in annual lease payments, and about a 38 percent  reduction in needed office space. However, this estimate does not  include the costs of GSA\u2019s renovation, which has not been completed.", "The IRS implemented new space standards in October 2012 that  reflect changes in the mobility of its workforce and is applying these  new standards as part of its space-planning efforts. Under the IRS\u2019s  new space standards, employees who work out of the office an  average of 80 hours or more per month no longer have a dedicated  workstation and must hotel with other employees who are also out of  the office an average of 80 hours or more per month.", "USDA set agency-wide goals for increasing the number of its  employees with approved telework agreements as well as its overall  telework participation rates for fiscal year 2013. Officials told us they  believe that the increased use of telework could allow the department  to reduce its real estate needs. In addition, officials of the Forest  Service, an agency within USDA, told us that the Forest Service plans  to increase telework participation, utilize hoteling, and decrease the  size of individual workstations as part of its headquarters renovation.  The renovated space, which formerly provided space for 420  employees, is expected to provide workspace for approximately 760  employees. Forest Service officials said the agency estimates saving  at least $5 million in annual rent as a result of these efforts. However,  this estimate does not include the costs for its headquarters  renovation, which has not yet been completed.", "ATF officials told us they are developing a workstation-sharing policy  for those employees who telework 3 or more days per week.

These reports have  highlighted the variety of actions that agencies can take to achieve space  efficiencies and help ensure that workspaces adequately support their  agencies\u2019 missions. GSA\u2019s research on how public and private sector  organizations use office space shows that office space in general, and  federal office space specifically, is often underutilized as employees work  elsewhere. For example, in 2006, GSA reported that its surveys of federal  workspaces indicate that employees are typically seated at their desks  less than one-third of the average work day because they are often  working elsewhere\u2014collaborating with team members, working off-site, or  in meetings\u2014the rest of the time.

An  official at the Forest Service\u2019s headquarters told us the Forest Service  worked with GSA to measure utilization of its leased office space in the  Washington D.C. area. According to the official, working with GSA helped  provide the Forest Service with information on how its space was being  used, and helped the Forest Service determine that it could reduce its  office space needs by 25 percent.", "In late 2011, GSA established a Workplace Program Management Office  designed to help agencies explore and implement mobility initiatives.  GSA helps agencies explore mobility as part of a broader approach to  space planning as well as engaging workplace strategists in developing  solutions focused on mission, people, and space opportunities. For  example, since 2011 GSA has offered two customized programs known  as Client Portfolio Planning and National Engagements for Workplace  Services. In part, these programs are designed to help agencies explore  mobility and achieve space efficiencies and also determine the type of  workplace configuration that best supports the accomplishment of the  agency\u2019s mission. According to GSA officials, these programs also offer  additional benefits, such as increased employee satisfaction. GSA  officials stressed that customized programs work better because each  agency has a unique mission and culture.", "GSA officials describe the Client Portfolio Planning program as one that  will help an agency find ways to increase energy efficiency and mobility,  potentially allowing an agency to reduce its need for office space. GSA  collects information about the client agency\u2019s space use and needs  through various instruments, including employee surveys. GSA  subsequently works with the agency to identify potential opportunities and  develops recommendations. According to GSA officials, having a client  agency actively participate in this process is a key factor to achieving  success in implementing GSA recommendations. If an agency chooses to  act upon GSA\u2019s recommendations, it could take years to realize savings  due to factors such as the timing of leases, the cost of reconfiguration,  and negotiation with employee organizations. GSA officials told us that  they work with three new agencies each year and currently have nine  departments or agencies participating in this program.", "Unlike the Client Portfolio Planning program, GSA\u2019s National  Engagements for Workplace Services program is designed to help  agencies examine their operations and identify new ways of working that  leverage technology and furniture solutions. According to GSA, the  information obtained by participating in this program can help guide an  agency\u2019s space-planning efforts and mobility initiatives and provide a  business case for making changes. GSA funds initial services, such as  performing space utilization studies, evaluating existing workplace  conditions, developing alternative work arrangement standards, and  implementing pilot programs. The client agency funds subsequent  services, such as implementing developed programs and evaluating the  results. To date, GSA has completed national engagements with two  agencies\u2014the Defense Contract Audit Agency and USPTO\u2014and is in  various stages of working with eight other departments or agencies. Of  the agencies we reviewed, USPTO has worked with GSA under both  programs. According to USPTO officials, as a result of working with GSA,  USPTO set a goal of releasing space when leases expire and is exploring  opportunities to consolidate additional personnel within its headquarters  building.", "Several factors can affect what strategies or recommendations, if any,  GSA\u2019s clients may decide to implement as a result of these programs.  These include an agency\u2019s culture, mission, funding sources, and the  flexibility it has within its existing leases. For example, USPTO stated that  while it concurs with the goal of releasing space when leases expired, its  future staffing projections need to be considered when evaluating any  proposals. In addition, USPTO noted that it was in ongoing discussions  with its employee organization over changes affecting employee  workspaces. Also, not all of GSA\u2019s client agencies may complete these  programs. For example, GSA officials told us that because one agency  did not actively participate during the planning processes of the Client  Portfolio Planning program, GSA opted to refocus its efforts on another  agency that it perceived was more willing to collaborate in the planning  process.", "GSA officials also noted that because these programs are relatively new,  they involve an iterative and ongoing learning process, including the  development of tools to help agencies explore the benefits of mobility. For  example, GSA is in the process of developing an additional Excel-based  tool aimed at helping agencies quantify the benefits and costs of  increased telework participation and implementing other alternative work  arrangements, such as hoteling. According to GSA officials, this tool will  be available to agencies later this year. GSA is also developing tools to  help agencies measure the extent to which their office space is being  used on a daily basis. For example, GSA is exploring how using mobile  devices such as cell phones could provide information electronically on  which offices are occupied. According to GSA officials, such tools would  allow agencies to collect such information without the need to rely on  manually observing the workspace."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Accurate Data and Organizational Support Were Viewed as Important to Achieving Space Efficiencies in an Environment of Increased Workforce Mobility", "paragraphs": ["Our discussions with officials from the five selected agencies and five  private sector organizations identified two factors as particularly important  to achieving space efficiencies in an environment of increased workforce  mobility: acquiring information about how office space is currently used  and gaining management and employee support.

Officials at the other two agencies told us  they take similar steps. For example, Forest Service officials told us that  when planning to consolidate space in the Washington, D.C., area, they  performed head counts twice a day for several weeks to determine the  feasibility of implementing hoteling.

Representatives from the private sector told us  their organizations took similar steps. For example, a representative of  one organization told us that his organization advises clients to ensure,  when downsizing offices, that employees understand the link between  reducing real estate costs and budgetary sustainability. A representative  from another organization told us that when his organization provides  space-planning services for clients, it always ensures that employee  organizations are consulted.
