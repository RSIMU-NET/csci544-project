Tangible progress has been made during the year in several areas, including requirements and technology. Such progress warrants recognition, but confidence that the program can deliver as promised depends on high levels of demonstrated knowledge, which are yet to come. Following the preliminary design review in 2009, there should be enough knowledge to demonstrate the soundness of the FCS business case. If significant doubts remain about the program's executability at that time, DOD will have to consider alternatives to proceeding with the program. Currently, GAO sees the FCS business case as follows. Requirements--Progress has been made in defining requirements and making some difficult trade-offs, but key assumptions about the performance of immature technologies and other technical risks remain to be proven. Technology--The Army has made progress in maturing technologies, but it will take several more years to reach full maturity. All key technologies should have been mature in 2003 when the program began. FCS software has doubled in size compared to original estimates and faces significant risks. The Army is attempting a disciplined approach to managing software development. Acquisition Strategy--The FCS acquisition strategy is compressed. Key testing to demonstrate FCS performance will not be completed, and maturity of design and production will not be demonstrated until after the production decision. Program Costs--New estimates place FCS costs significantly above the current estimate of $163.7 billion. The Army has recently proposed a plan to buy fewer systems and slow production rates. This recent program adjustment will affect program costs, but details are not yet available."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["As the centerpiece of the Army\u2019s transformation to a lighter, more agile,  and more capable combat force, the Future Combat System (FCS)  program\u2014which comprises 14 integrated weapon systems and an  advanced information network needed for a brigade combat team\u2014is  considered to be, according to the Army, the greatest technology and  integration challenge it has ever undertaken. The Army started its FCS  program in May 2003 without fulfilling the basic elements of a business  case\u2014that is, determining if the program\u2019s requirements and concept were  valid and that the concept could be successfully developed with existing  resources including proven technologies, stable design, adequate funding,  and adequate time. The Army projects the FCS program will cost   $163.7 billion, which has been adjusted for inflation, but does not include  key complementary programs. As a result, the program is recognized as  being high risk and in need of special oversight and review. In 2006,  Congress mandated that the Department of Defense (DOD) hold an FCS  milestone review, essentially a \u201cgo/no-go\u201d decision, following its  preliminary design review, which is now scheduled for early 2009.", "Given its cost, scope, and technical challenges, section 211 of the National  Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006 requires GAO to report  annually on the FCS program.

We reviewed documents pertaining to the FCS program, attended  meetings at which DOD and Army officials reviewed program progress,  and held discussions with key DOD and Army officials on various aspects  of the program. Officials from DOD and the Army have provided us access  to sufficient information to make informed judgments on the matters in  this report. In addition, we drew from our body of past work on weapon  systems acquisition practices. We performed our work from March 2006 to  March 2007 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Appendix I further discusses our scope and methodology."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The FCS concept is designed to be part of the Army\u2019s Future Force, which  is intended to transform the Army into a more rapidly deployable and  responsive force that differs substantially from the large division-centric  structure of the past. The Army is reorganizing its current forces into  modular brigade combat teams, each of which is expected to be highly  survivable and the most lethal brigade-sized unit the Army has ever  fielded. The Army expects FCS-equipped brigade combat teams to provide  significant warfighting capabilities to DOD\u2019s overall joint military  operations. The Army is implementing its transformation plans at a time  when current U.S. ground forces continue to play a critical role in the  ongoing conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Army has instituted plans to  spin out selected FCS technologies and systems to current Army forces  throughout the program\u2019s system development and demonstration phase.", "As we were preparing this report, the Army made a number of adjustments  to its plans for the FCS program. The revised program will no longer  include all 18 systems as originally planned. The FCS family of weapons is  now expected to include 14 manned and unmanned ground vehicles, air  vehicles, sensors, and munitions that will be linked by an advanced  information network. The systems include    eight new types of manned ground vehicles to replace current  tanks, infantry carriers, and self-propelled howitzers;  two classes of unmanned aerial vehicles;    several unmanned ground vehicles; and    an attack missile.", "Fundamentally, the FCS concept is to replace mass with superior  information\u2014allowing soldiers to see and hit the enemy first rather than  to rely on heavy armor to withstand a hit. This solution attempts to  address a mismatch that has posed a dilemma to the Army for decades: the  Army\u2019s heavy forces had the necessary firepower needed to win but  required extensive support and too much time to deploy while its light  forces could deploy rapidly but lacked firepower. If the Future Force  becomes a reality, then the Army would be better organized, staffed,  equipped, and trained for prompt and sustained land combat, qualities  intended to ensure that it would dominate over evolving, sophisticated  threats. The Future Force is to be offensively oriented and will employ  revolutionary concepts of operations, enabled by new technology. The  Army envisions a new way of fighting that depends on networking the  force, which involves linking people, platforms, weapons, and sensors  seamlessly together in a system-of-systems.", "If successful, the FCS system-of-systems concept will integrate individual  capabilities of weapons and platforms, thus facilitating interoperability  and open system designs. This would represent significant improvement  over the traditional approach of building superior individual weapons that  must be retrofitted and netted together after the fact. This transformation,  in terms of both operations and equipment, is under way with the full  cooperation of the Army warfighter community. In fact, the development  and acquisition of FCS is being accomplished using a uniquely  collaborative relationship among the Army\u2019s developers, the participating  contractors, and the warfighter community.", "The Army has employed a management approach for FCS that centers on a  lead systems integrator to provide significant management services to help  the Army define and develop FCS and reach across traditional Army  mission areas. Because of its partner-like relationship with the Army, the  lead systems integrator\u2019s responsibilities include requirements  development, design, and selection of major system and subsystem  subcontractors. The team of Boeing and Science Applications  International Corporation is the lead systems integrator for the FCS  system development and demonstration phase of acquisition, which is  expected to extend until 2017. The FCS lead systems integrator acts on  behalf of the Army to optimize the FCS capability, maximize competition,  ensure interoperability, and maintain commonality in order to reduce life- cycle costs. Boeing also acts as an FCS supplier in that it is responsible for  developing two important software subsystems. The Army advised us that  it did not believe it had the resources or flexibility to use its traditional  acquisition process to field a program as complex as FCS under the  aggressive timeline established by the then-Army Chief of Staff. The Army  will maintain oversight and final approval of the lead systems integrator\u2019s  subcontracting and competition plans. The FCS lead systems integrator  originally operated under a contractual instrument called an \u201cother  transaction agreement.\u201d In 2006, the Army completed the conversion of  that instrument to a more typical contract based on the Federal  Acquisition Regulation. As required by section 115 of the John Warner  National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007, we are reviewing  the contractual relationship between the Army and the lead systems  integrator and will be reporting on that work separately."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Elements of a Business Case", "paragraphs": ["We have frequently reported on the wisdom of using a solid, executable  business case before committing resources to a new product development  effort. In the case of DOD, a business case should be based on DOD  acquisition policy and lessons learned from leading commercial firms and  successful DOD programs. The business case in its simplest form is  demonstrated evidence that (1) the warfighter\u2019s needs are valid and that  they can best be met with the chosen concept, and (2) the chosen concept  can be developed and produced within existing resources\u2014that is, proven  technologies, design knowledge, adequate funding, adequate time, and  management capacity to deliver the product when it is needed. A program  should not go forward into product development unless a sound business  case can be made. If the business case measures up, the organization  commits to the product development, including making the financial  investment.", "At the heart of a business case is a knowledge-based approach to product  development that is both a best practice among leading commercial firms  and the approach preferred by DOD in its acquisition policies. For a  program to deliver a successful product within available resources,  managers should demonstrate high levels of knowledge before significant  commitments are made. In essence, knowledge supplants risk over time.  This building of knowledge can be described as three levels or points that  should be attained over the course of a program.", "First, at program start, the customer\u2019s needs should match the  developer\u2019s available resources\u2014mature technologies, time,  funding, and management capacity. An indication of this match is  the demonstrated maturity of the technologies needed to meet  customer needs. The ability of the government acquisition  workforce to properly manage the effort should also be an  important consideration at program start.", "Second, about midway through development, the product\u2019s design  should be stable and demonstrate that it is capable of meeting  performance requirements. The critical design review is the vehicle  for making this determination and generally signifies the point at  which the program is ready to start building production- representative prototypes.", "Third, by the time of the production decision, the product must be  shown able to be manufactured within cost, schedule, and quality  targets and have demonstrated its reliability. It is also the point at  which the design must demonstrate that it performs as expected  through realistic system-level testing.", "A delay in attaining any one of these levels delays the points that follow. If  the technologies needed to meet requirements are not mature, design and  production maturity will be delayed. In successful commercial and  defense programs that we have reviewed, managers were careful to  develop technology separately from and ahead of the development of the  product. For this reason, the first knowledge level is the most important  for improving the chances of developing a weapon system within cost and  schedule estimates. DOD\u2019s acquisition policy has adopted the knowledge- based approach to acquisitions. DOD policy requires program managers to  demonstrate knowledge about key aspects of a system at key points in the  acquisition process. Program managers are also required to reduce  integration risk and demonstrate product design prior to the design  readiness review and to reduce manufacturing risk and demonstrate  producibility prior to full-rate production.", "The FCS program is about one-third of the way into its scheduled product  development. At this stage, the program should have attained knowledge  point one, with a strategy for attaining knowledge points two and three.  Accordingly, we analyzed the FCS business case first as it pertains to  firming requirements and maturing technologies, which indicate progress  against the first knowledge point. We then analyzed FCS\u2019s strategy for  attaining design and production maturity. Finally, we analyzed the costs  and funding estimates made to execute the FCS business case."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency and Congressional Actions Since Our Last Report", "paragraphs": ["In our previous report on the FCS program, released in March 2006, we  reported that the program entered the development phase in 2003 without  reaching the level of knowledge it should have attained in the pre- development phase.

We concluded that in order for the FCS program to be  successful, an improved business case was needed.", "The Defense Acquisition Board met in May 2006 to review the FCS  program. That review approved the Army approach to spin out certain  FCS technologies to current Army forces in 2008 and directed the Army to  continue with yearly in-process reviews and a Defense Acquisition Board  meeting in the late 2008 timeframe. Performance expectations were also  established for the review. During the meeting, it was noted that  significant cost and schedule risk remains for the program and that  reductions in scope and more flexibility in schedule are needed to stay  within current funding constraints.", "Also in 2006, Congress mandated that the Secretary of Defense conduct a  milestone review for the FCS program, following the preliminary design  review scheduled for early 2009. Congress stated that the review should  include an assessment of whether (1) the needs are valid and can be best  met with the FCS concept, (2) the FCS program can be developed and  produced within existing resources, and (3) the program should continue  as currently structured, be restructured, or be terminated. The Congress  required the Secretary of Defense to review specific aspects of the  program, including the maturity of critical technologies, program risks,  demonstrations of the FCS concept and software, and a cost estimate and  affordability assessment and to submit a report of the findings and  conclusions of the review to Congress. Additionally, Congress has required  the Secretary of Defense to provide an independent cost estimate that will  encompass costs related to the FCS program and a report on the estimate.  The Institute for Defense Analyses is expected to deliver this analysis to  Congress by April 2007.", "Finally, in response to concerns over funding shortfalls and other resource  issues for fiscal years 2008 to 2013, the Army has recently made a number  of changes to its plans for the FCS program.

The feasibility of FCS requirements still  depends on a number of key assumptions about immature technologies,  costs, and other performance characteristics like the reliability of the  network and other systems.

In August 2005, the Army and the lead  systems integrator translated the warfighter requirements into 11,500 more  specific system-of-systems level requirements, established the functional  baseline for the program, and allocated requirements to individual FCS  systems. Since then, the contractors have clarified their design concepts  and provided feedback on the technical feasibility and affordability of the  requirements.", "In an August 2006 review, the Army and its lead systems integrator  reduced the number of warfighter requirements to 544, but increased the  system-of-systems requirements to 11,697. Of the system-of-system  requirements, 289 have \u201cto be determined\u201d items and 819 have open issues  to be resolved. At this review, the FCS requirements were translated  further down to the individual system level, totaling about 90,000. The  system level requirements provide the specificity needed for the  contractors to fully develop detailed designs for their individual systems.

The \u201cto-be- determined\u201d items generally involve the need for the user community and  the developers to come to an understanding on a way to better specify or  quantify the requirement. A common issue to be resolved involves the  need for compromise between the users and developers when the design  solution may not be able to fully meet the initially allocated requirement.

One key trade-off came in the area of the projected  weight of the manned ground vehicles and their transportability by  aircraft. Originally, the manned ground vehicles were to weigh less than   20 tons so they could be carried on the C-130 aircraft. These vehicles were  to be lightly armored at 19 tons and with add-on armor bringing the total  vehicle weight up to about 24 tons. However, the Army and its contractor  team found that this design did not provide sufficient ballistic protection.  Currently, the vehicle designs with improved ballistic protection are  estimated to weigh between 27 and 29 tons. At this weight, it is practically  impossible to transport the vehicles on the C-130s, and they are now being  designed to be transported by the larger C-17 aircraft. Illustrative of the  FCS design challenges, the added weight of the vehicles could have ripple  effects for the designs of the engine, suspension, band track, and other  subsystems. The Army still wants vehicles to be transportable by the C-130  when stripped of armor and other equipment, so that C-130 cargo size and  weight limits will still serve to constrain the design of the manned ground  vehicles. As these are primarily paper and simulated designs, the potential  for future trade-offs is high.", "Another example involves the requirement that the manned ground  vehicles be able to operate for several hours on battery power and without  the engine running. Based on the analyses to date, it has been determined  that current battery technologies would permit less than one hour of this  \u201csilent watch\u201d capability. The Army, lead systems integrator, and the FCS  subcontractors are continuing their assessments, as is the user  community, which is re-evaluating which internal manned ground vehicle  subsystems may need to operate in these situations. With less demand for  power, the batteries are expected to last somewhat longer. As that work  concludes, the Army will be able to determine the specific level of silent  watch capability it can expect for the manned ground vehicles and how  best to change the operational requirements document.

However, as the design concepts and  technologies mature, their actual performance does not necessarily match  expectations, and trade-offs have to be made. To date, the Army has had to  make a number of requirements and design changes that recognize the  physical constraints of the designs and the limits of technology. Ideally,  these trade-offs are made before a program begins. Because many  technologies are not yet fully mature, significant trade-offs have been  made and will continue to be necessary. The technical feasibility of FCS  requirements still depends on a number of key assumptions about the  performance of immature technologies, thus more trade-offs are likely as  knowledge replaces assumptions. The challenge in making additional  changes to requirements is at least two-fold: first is assessing the potential  ripple effect of changing a requirement for one system on the thousands of  other system requirements; the second is assessing the cumulative effect  of numerous system level requirements changes on the overall  characteristics of survivability, lethality, responsiveness, and  supportability."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Technical Feasibility Dependent on Addressing Some High Level Risks", "paragraphs": ["The Army has identified numerous known technical risks, about 70 of  which are considered to be at a medium or high level.

There is hardly any aspect of FCS functionality that is not  predicated on the network, and for many key functions, the network is  essential. However, the FCS program manager has stated that the Army  still has a lot yet to learn on how to successfully build such an advanced  information network. Some of the network medium and high level risks  include:    End-to-end quality of service on mobile ad-hoc networks. The  probability is high that the FCS network will not be able to ensure  that the information with the highest value is delivered to the  recipients. Failure to support the warfighter in defining and  implementing command intent for information management will  result in substantially reduced force effectiveness, in a force that  trades information for armor.", "Wideband waveform availability. The current Joint Tactical Radio  System Ground Mobile Radio program continues to pose risks  because its schedule is not yet synchronized with the schedule for  the core FCS program or FCS spin-outs. Any schedule slip in this  area could lead to further delays.

The soldier radio waveform  provides functional capabilities that are needed to support many  FCS systems but may not be completed in time to support FCS  development. These functional capabilities facilitate interoperability  and gateway functions between the FCS family of systems. These  systems are critical to FCS performance and delays of these  functional capabilities will negatively impact the FCS schedule.", "Spectrum availability and usage. There is a high likelihood that  more frequency spectrum is required for all of the communications  needs than will be available given current design assumptions.

The Army recognizes the risk that FCS will not be able to  adequately verify and test compliance with this parameter as it  relates to the Global Information Grid. FCS is expected to have  extensive connectivity with other services and agencies via the  Grid. The risk is due to, among other things, the many yet-to-be- defined critical or enterprise interfaces which are being delivered in  parallel. Failure to meet the net-ready testability requirements could  result in, among other things, fielding delays and cost and schedule  overruns.", "All of the unmanned and manned ground vehicles and several other FCS  systems are expected to have difficulty meeting their assigned weight  targets.

This progress, however,  does need to be put in a broader context. The business case for a program  following best practices in a knowledge-based approach is to have all of its  critical technologies mature to TRL 7 (fully functional prototype in an  operational environment) at the start of product development. For the  FCS, this would mean having had all technologies at TRL 7 by May 2003.

Rather, they  maintain they only need to mature technologies to a TRL 6 by the time of  the critical design review which is now scheduled for 2011. According to  the Army\u2019s engineers, once a technology achieves TRL 6, they are no  longer required to track the technology\u2019s progress. They maintain that  anything beyond a TRL 6 is a system integration matter and not necessarily  technology development. Integration often involves adapting the  technologies to the space, weight, and power demands of their intended  environment. To a large extent, this is what it means to achieve a TRL 7.  This is work that needs to be accomplished before the critical design  reviews and is likely to pose additional trade-offs the Army will have to  make to reconcile its requirements with what is possible from a  technology and engineering standpoint. Accordingly, the FCS program has  singled out several critical technologies that have been assessed at TRL 6  but yet continue to have moderate or high risk that could have dire  consequences for meeting program requirements if they are not  successfully dealt with. Examples include:    High density packaged power. Current battery technology may not  meet the performance levels needed to support the initial  production of FCS. Among other things, calendar life, cost, cooling  methods, safety, and thermal management have not been  demonstrated. The potential impacts of this risk could affect not  only vehicle propulsion but also lethality and supportability.", "High power density engine.

The mitigation  strategy includes engine testing to identify and correct potential  engine design issues as soon as possible.", "Hull anti-tank mine blast protection. The Army recognizes that there  is a probability, given the weight constraints on FCS platforms and  evolving blast mitigation technology, that the FCS hull and crew  restraints will not protect the crew from life threatening injury due  to anti-tank blast mines equal to (or greater than) the threshold  requirement. The potential consequence is that the mobility and  survivability of the brigade combat team will be affected.

Independent test officials noted that it is unclear what the Army expects  from the network. With the network identified as a major risk element of  the program, as well as a major risk, test officials noted that the Army  needs to set benchmarks for what will be demonstrated over time.  Independent testing officials have also told us that the FCS test schedule is  very tight and may not allow adequate time for \u201ctest-fix-test\u201d testing. The  test and evaluation master plan recognizes this possibility by noting that  within each integration phase there is only time to test and fix minor  issues. More substantial problems would have to be fixed in a succeeding  integration phase.

Testing the large number  of FCS sensors and the network\u2019s ability to process the information will  not be effective since test capabilities, methodologies, and expertise  needed to test a tactical network of this magnitude are incomplete and  insufficient. The first major test of the network and FCS together with a  majority of prototypes will not take place until 2012, the year before low- rate production is now expected to begin.", "The FCS program is thus susceptible to late-cycle churn, that is, the effort  required to fix a significant problem that is discovered late in a product\u2019s  development. In particular, churn refers to the additional\u2014and  unanticipated\u2014time, money, and effort that must be invested to overcome  problems discovered through testing. Problems are most serious when  they delay product delivery, increase product cost, or escape to the  customer. The discovery of problems through testing conducted late in  development is a fairly common occurrence on DOD programs, as is the  attendant late-cycle churn. Often, tests of a full system, such as launching  a missile or flying an aircraft, become the vehicles for discovering  problems that could have been found earlier and corrected less  expensively. When significant problems are revealed late in a weapon  system\u2019s development, the reaction\u2014or churn\u2014can take several forms:  extending schedules to increase the investment in more prototypes and  testing, terminating the program, or redesigning and modifying weapons  that have already made it to the field. While DOD has accepted such  problems over the years, FCS offers particular challenges, given the  magnitude of its cost in an increasingly competitive environment for  investment funds.

This restructuring was expected to  benefit the current forces as well as provide early demonstrations that  would benefit the core FCS program. Known as spin-outs, the Army plans  to begin limited low-rate production of the systems planned for Spin-Out   1 in 2009 and field those systems to current Army forces 2 years later.  Leading up to the production decision in 2009 will be system development  tests and a limited user test. Additional spin-outs are now planned to occur  in 2010 and 2012. Using this method, the Army plans to deliver significant  capabilities to the current force earlier than previously planned. Over the  long-term, these capabilities include enhanced battle command  capabilities and a variety of manned and unmanned ground and air  platforms that are intended to improve current force survivability and  operations.", "Currently, FCS Spin-Out 1 involves the non-line-of sight launch system and  unmanned ground sensors as well as early versions of the System-of-  Systems Common Operating Environment and Battle Command software  subsystems. Also included are the kits needed to interface with current  force vehicles. These capabilities will be tested and validated using the  Evaluation Brigade Combat Team, which will provide feedback to help  refine the FCS doctrine and other matters. These systems are expected to  be fielded to operational units starting in 2010, although it is unclear yet if  these elements of FCS will provide significant capability to the current  forces at a reasonable cost.", "There are two test-related concerns with spin-outs. One is that spin-outs  have complicated the FCS acquisition strategy because they focus early  testing and test resources on a few mature systems that will be spun out to  current Army forces. FCS program test officials told us that the primary  focus of the program\u2019s first integration phase will be on events supporting  systems in that spin-out. It is unclear if subsequent integration phases will  be similarly configured. If that were to occur, fewer overall FCS systems  would be looked at and tested in each phase, and testing to evaluate how  the FCS system-of-systems and concept of operations could come later  than originally planned. A program official has noted that the schedule to  deliver the needed hardware and software to the evaluation brigade  combat team is ambitious and the schedule for tests leading up to a  production decision for Spin-Out 1 is compressed. Some individual  systems developmental and other testing began in 2006, but key user and  operational tests will not occur until 2008, just prior to the production  decision for systems in Spin-Out 1. Independent test officials have  expressed concern not only over whether there will be enough time to  test, fix and test again during these key tests but also whether there will be  enough time to \u201creset\u201d or refurbish the equipment being used from one test  to another. For example, the technical field test, force development test  and evaluation and pilot test, and the limited user tests for Spin-Out 1 are  to be conducted back-to-back over a several month period just before the  production decision. In addition, key tests including a limited user test for  the non-line-of-sight launch system will take place after the Spin-Out   1 production decision. FCS program test officials have told us, however,  that the program does not plan to fix and test again any problems  discovered in a particular integration phase until the next integration  phase.

The Army faces  a number of key challenges as it proceeds to and beyond the preliminary  design review including    completing requirements definition and technology maturity (at  least to TRL 6) to be able to complete the final preliminary design  review;    clearly demonstrating spinout capabilities prior to committing to  their initial production and fielding;    completing system integration and releasing at least 90 percent of  engineering drawings by the critical design review in 2011;    allocating sufficient time, as needed, for test, fix and retest  throughout the FCS test program; and    allocating sufficient time to thoroughly demonstrate each FCS  system, the information network, and the FCS concept prior to  committing to low rate initial production in 2013."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Likely Growth of FCS Costs Increases Tension between Program Scope and Available Funds", "paragraphs": ["Last year, we reported that FCS program acquisition costs had increased  to $160.7 billion\u201476 percent\u2014since the Army\u2019s original estimate (figures  have been adjusted for inflation.)

Our  work on a broad base of DOD weapon system programs shows that most  developmental cost increases occur after the critical design review, which  will now be in 2011 for the FCS.

Further, the  Army has not yet fully estimated the cost of essential complementary  programs and the procurement of spin-out items to the current force. The  Army is cognizant of these resource tensions and has adopted measures in  an attempt to control FCS costs.

The  independent estimate reflected several additional years and additional  staffing beyond the Army\u2019s estimate to achieve initial operational  capability. The difference in estimates is also attributable to the Cost  Analysis Improvement Group\u2019s assessment that FCS software  development would require more time and effort to complete than the  Army had estimated. The independent estimate also provided for  additional risks regarding the availability of key systems to support the  FCS network, such as the JTRS radios. Neither the Army nor the Defense  Acquisition Board has accepted the independent estimate. Program  officials believe the independent estimate of research and development  costs is too high because it is too conservative regarding risks.", "The higher estimates of procurement costs reflect additional quantities of  individual systems needed to provide full capabilities to the Brigade  Combat Team. Neither the Army nor independent estimate reflects the  recent decision to reduce the number of FCS systems and slow down the  production rate. Prior to that decision, the Army had actually been  contemplating expanding the scope of FCS to include additional Class IV  unmanned aerial vehicles, additional unattended ground sensors,  intelligent munitions systems, and test assets for the Army user  community, as well as two new systems\u2014a centralized controller device  and a rearming module for the manned ground vehicles.

The program\u2019s estimate would be based much more on  demonstrated knowledge and actual cost versus assumptions. Instead, the  current FCS estimates are built on a knowledge base without mature  technologies, a preliminary design that is at least 2 years away, and a  critical design review that is 3 to 4 years away. The Army must, therefore,  make significant assumptions about how knowledge will develop. As  experience has shown, in many DOD weapon systems, assumptions  generally prove optimistic and result in underestimated costs.", "As it is currently structured, the Army is planning to make substantial  financial investments in the FCS program before key knowledge is gained  on requirements, technologies, system designs, and system performance.

In our 2006 assessment of selected major weapon systems, we found that  development costs for the programs with mature technologies increased  by a modest average of 4.8 percent over the first full estimate, whereas the  development costs for the programs with immature technologies increased  by a much higher average of 34.9 percent. Similarly, program acquisition  unit costs for the programs with mature technologies increased by less  than 1 percent, whereas the programs that started development with  immature technologies experienced an average program acquisition unit  cost increase of nearly 27 percent over the first full estimate.

However, this approach would reduce capabilities, and a  lesser set of FCS capabilities may not be adequate to meet the user\u2019s  expectations. Also, the Army is focusing on reducing the average unit  production cost of the FCS brigade combat teams, which currently exceed  the amount at which each brigade combat team is budgeted. The Army has  established a glide path to reduce the unit costs; however, program  officials have said they are struggling to further reduce the unit costs in  many cases, particularly as a result of challenges with the manned ground  vehicles.

Each  year, the government and lead systems integrator will identify a prioritized  list of candidates for capabilities that can be partially or completely  deleted and its associated budget re-directed to the new work scope or to  offset a cost overrun.", "The Army and lead systems integrator monitor the performance of the FCS  program through an earned value management system, which allows  program management to monitor the technical, schedule, and cost  performance of the program.

According to earned value data, the FCS is  currently tracking fairly closely with cost and schedule expectations.  However, it is too early in the program for the data at this point to be  conclusive. Historically, the majority of cost growth on a development  program occurs after the critical design review. Further, according to  program officials, due to the size and complexity of the program, coupled  with an uncertain budget from year to year, detailed planning packages are  only planned about 3 to 6 months in advance.

Specifically, if the FCS is able to demonstrate the level of knowledge that  should be expected at a preliminary design review, it will be about at the  point when it should be ready to begin system development and  demonstration. Instead, by that time, FCS will be halfway through that  phase, with only 4 years left to demonstrate that the system-of-systems  design works before the planned production commitment is made. For  that reason, decision makers will have to assess the complete business  case for FCS.
