Because of their high-bandwidth connections and the concentration  of large groups of young, computer-literate users, college and university  networks are particularly vulnerable to adverse impacts from the use of  file-sharing applications. In 2002, a committee of representatives from  education and the entertainment industry\u2014the Joint Committee of Higher  Education and Entertainment Communities\u2014was convened to discuss and  address matters of mutual concern, including the misuse of university  networks for copyright infringement. In addition, the Recording Industry  Association of America has conducted searches for copyrighted material  being illegally shared on peer-to-peer networks and has sent more than  30,000 notices to colleges and universities regarding files that are being  shared on systems connected to university networks.", "Congress has moved to address piracy issues that have been raised by  developments in computer and Internet technology. With regard to the  widespread unauthorized distribution of copyrighted material on peer-to- peer systems, the crime of felony copyright infringement has four essential  elements:  1.  A copyright exists;  2.  The copyright was infringed by the defendant, specifically by  reproduction or distribution of the copyrighted work, including by  electronic means;  3.  The defendant acted \u201cwillfully.\u201d Under the law, evidence of  reproduction or distribution of a copyrighted work, by itself, is not  sufficient to establish willful infringement; and  4.

In addition to the United States, searches were executed in  Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Israel, the Netherlands,  Singapore, Sweden, Great Britain, and Northern Ireland. As a result, more  than 100 individuals believed to be engaged in online piracy have been  identified, many of them high-level members or leaders of online piracy  release groups that specialize in distributing high-quality pirated movies,  music, games, and software over the Internet. More than 200 computers  were seized worldwide, including more than 30 computer servers that  function as storage and distribution hubs for the online piracy groups  targeted by this operation.", "Operation Buccaneer was an international investigation and prosecution  operation led by the U.S. Customs Service and Justice. The operation  resulted in the seizure of tens of thousands of pirated copies of software,  music, and computer games worth millions of dollars and led to 30  convictions worldwide. Operation Buccaneer targeted a number of highly  organized and sophisticated international criminal piracy groups that had  cracked the copyright protection on thousands of software, movie, and  music files and distributed those files over the Internet.", "As part of Operation Buccaneer, on December 11, 2001, the U.S. Customs  Service and law enforcement officials from Australia, Finland, Norway,  Sweden, and the United Kingdom simultaneously executed approximately  70 search warrants worldwide. Approximately 40 search warrants were  executed in 27 cities across the United States, including several at  universities. Pursuant to the search warrants, law enforcement seized 10  computer \u201carchive sites\u201d that contained tens of thousands of pirated  copies of software, movies, music, and computer games worth millions of  dollars. According to the Deputy Chief for Intellectual Property Computer  Crime and Intellectual Property Section, as of April 1, 2004, 27 defendants  had been convicted in the United States, with 2 awaiting sentencing and 1  other under indictment. Internationally, six defendants have been  convicted in Finland and the United Kingdom, with four additional  defendants scheduled to go to trial in the United Kingdom in the fall of  2004.", "According to DHS officials, the Cyber Crime Center of the U.S.  Immigration and Customs Enforcement does target individual violators  who are involved in cyber intellectual property piracy on a profit or  commercial basis. The officials noted that the center does not pursue  investigations of individual peer-to-peer file violators due to the statutory  dollar-value threshold limits and lack of a profit motive.", "According to these officials, the statutory dollar-value threshold is very  difficult to meet in peer-to-peer cases, since most peer-to-peer  infringement is based on the sharing of music, and the major record labels  have set $0.80 as the dollar value of each copy of a song (the officials  noted that most successful prosecutions are based on copyright  infringement of software applications, because these tend to have a higher  dollar value than songs). Proving criminal intent is also often a problem in  these cases, since file sharing is a passive act, and in most cases there is  no profit motive.", "According to Justice officials, federal intellectual property protection  efforts do not focus on investigation and prosecution of individual  copyright infringers on peer-to-peer networks, but instead they focus on  organizations or individuals engaged in massive distribution or  reproduction of copyrighted materials. According to these officials, this  focus exists because:    Federal law enforcement is best suited to focus on large-scale or  sophisticated infringers, including organized groups, large-scale  infringers, infringers operating out of numerous jurisdictions and foreign  countries, and infringers using sophisticated technology to avoid  detection, identification, and apprehension. By and large, individual  copyright holders do not have the tools or ability to pursue these types of  targets.", "Copyright holders do not have the legal tools or ability to tackle the  organized criminal syndicates and most sophisticated infringers, but  they have the tools and ability to target the individual infringer. While  federal law enforcement has the tools, ability, expertise, and will to tackle  the most sophisticated infringers, including those operating overseas who  are part of a large syndicate and those using sophisticated technology to  avoid detection, individual copyright holders have the tools to pursue  individual infringers. Congress has provided for civil enforcement actions.  Individual copyright holders, mostly through industry associations, have  been very active in their pursuit of individual infringers using peer-to-peer  applications.", "Focusing law enforcement and industry on their respective strengths  results in maximum impact. By using both the criminal and civil tools  given to law enforcement and industry by Congress, Justice can achieve a  more significant impact.", "Technological limitations pose a challenge. Given the technology  involved, it is challenging to gather the necessary evidence for a successful  criminal prosecution of individuals using peer-to-peer applications. For  example, it may be possible to prove that someone is offering copyrighted  material for download through a peer-to-peer application; but, according  to law enforcement officials, it is usually difficult or impossible to  determine the number of times files were downloaded.", "Burden of proof in criminal prosecutions is more onerous. The criminal  statute at issue requires proof of a willful intent and requires that each  element of the offense be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The willful  intent is a higher burden than is found in most criminal statutes. By  contrast, the intent element and overall burden of proof is significantly  less onerous in civil enforcement.", "Statutory thresholds favor a federal criminal enforcement focus on the  more significant targets. The thresholds require a retail value of $2,500 or  more for the goods pirated by the infringer. With a valuation of $0.80 per  song that is traded on a peer-to-peer application, federal criminal law  enforcement could not be used to target individuals downloading fewer  than 3,100 music files, for example. The technological limitations  mentioned earlier, combined with the heightened burden of proof, make it  challenging to show criminal violations for each of the more than 3,100  downloads.", "The need for efficient use of resources suggests a focus on large-scale  sophisticated targets. The need for law enforcement to use resources  efficiently suggests that federal law enforcement should focus their efforts  in a way that yields the greatest impact. For many of the reasons detailed  above, federal law enforcement has determined that they can make the  biggest impact by focusing on the larger-scale, more sophisticated targets.", "According to Justice officials, the recently created Intellectual Property  Task Force\u2014headed by the Deputy Chief of Staff and Counselor to the  Attorney General, and comprised of several of the highest-ranking  department employees who have a variety of subject matter expertise\u2014is  charged with examining all aspects of how Justice handles intellectual  property issues and with developing recommendations for legislative  changes and future activities.

A client is defined as a requester of services,  and a server is defined as the provider of services. Unlike the client/server  model, the peer-to-peer model enables consenting users\u2014or peers\u2014to  directly interact and share information with each other\u2019s computer  without the intervention of a server. A common characteristic of peer-to- peer programs is that they build virtual networks with their own  mechanisms for routing message traffic.", "The ability of peer-to-peer networks to provide services and connect users  directly has resulted in a large number of powerful applications being  built around this model. Among the uses of peer-to-peer technology are  the following:    File sharing, which includes applications such as Napster and KaZaA,  along with commercial applications such as NextPage.

When user C submits a  request for a file, the server/broker creates a list of files matching the  search request by checking the request with its database of files belonging  to registered users currently connected to the network. The broker then  displays that list to user C, who can then select the desired file from the  list and open a direct link with user D\u2019s computer, which currently has the  file. The download of the actual file takes place directly from user D to  user C.", "The broker model was used by Napster, the original peer-to-peer network;  it facilitated mass sharing of copyrighted material by combining the file  names held by thousands of users into a searchable directory that enabled  users to connect with each other and download MP3 encoded music files.", "The broker model made Napster vulnerable to legal challenges and  eventually led to its demise in September 2002.", "Although Napster was litigated out of existence and its users fragmented  among many alternative peer-to-peer services, most current-generation  peer-to-peer networks are not dependent on the server/broker that was the  central feature of the Napster services, so, according to Gartner, these  networks are less vulnerable to litigation from copyright owners.", "In the decentralized model, no brokers keep track of users and their files.  To share files using the decentralized model, user A starts with a  networked computer equipped with a Gnutella file-sharing program, such  as KaZaA or BearShare. User A connects to user B, user B to user C, user  C to user D, and so on. Once user A\u2019s computer has announced that it is  \u201calive\u201d to the various members of the peer network, it can search the  contents of the shared directories of the peer network members. The  search request is sent to all members of the network, starting with user B,  who will each, in turn, send the request to the computers to which they are  connected, and so on. If one of the computers in the peer network (for  example, user D) has a file that matches the request, it transmits the file  information (name, size, type, etc.) back through all the computers in the  pathway toward user A, where a list of files matching the search request  appears on user A\u2019s computer through the file-sharing program. User A  will then be able to open a connection with user D and download the file  directly from user D\u2019s computer.", "One of the key features of Napster and the current generation of  decentralized peer-to-peer technologies is their use of a virtual name  space. A virtual name space dynamically associates user-created names  with the Internet address of whatever Internet-connected computer users  happen to be using when they log on. The virtual name space facilitates  point-to-point interaction between individuals, because it removes the  need for users and their computers to know the addresses and locations of  other users; the virtual name space can, to a certain extent, preserve users\u2019  anonymity and provide information on whether a user is or is not  connected to the Internet at a given moment.", "The file-sharing networks that result from the use of peer-to-peer  technology are both extensive and complex.
