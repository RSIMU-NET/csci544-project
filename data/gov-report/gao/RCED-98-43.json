Utilities (primarily investor-owned utilities\u2014IOU) build power plants and power lines to provide all of the electricity needed by all existing and future customers in their exclusive service areas. Regulators in the states allow utilities to charge electricity rates that give them a regulated, specified level of return on these investments.", "IOUs were initially reluctant to provide electricity to rural areas, mostly because the sparse population made it difficult for them to recover their costs and to earn a profit. The federal government has played an important role in the traditional market by selling power to rural America. The Department of the Interior\u2019s Bureau of Reclamation (the Bureau) and the Department of the Army\u2019s Corps of Engineers (the Corps) generate electricity at hydropower plants located at major federal water projects. The Department of Energy\u2019s (DOE) power marketing administrations (PMA) generally sell this power in wholesale markets, mostly to publicly and cooperatively owned utilities that, in turn, sell power to end-use (retail) consumers. The PMAs repay the federal investment in the government\u2019s power plants, power lines, and related assets through the revenues they earn by selling power. The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), a federal corporation, generates and markets power throughout Tennessee and parts of six other southeastern states. Moreover, the Department of Agriculture\u2019s Rural Utilities Service (RUS) makes and guarantees loans to rural utilities to finance the construction and development of electric power systems. Although critics question the federal government\u2019s role in providing power or in financing improvements to rural utility systems as markets restructure, the activities continue.", "However, the traditional structure of the electricity industry has begun to change. Legislation and new generating technologies have introduced increased competition into the market, changing the environment in which the PMAs must operate successfully if they are to repay the federal investment in the power program."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Structure of the Electric Power Industry", "paragraphs": ["Federal and state agencies regulate the activities of electric utilities. Traditionally, electricity service was viewed as a \u201cnatural monopoly\u201d: A central source of power was seen as the most efficient way of generating, transmitting, and distributing electricity at a reasonable cost. Under the traditional regulatory compact between electric utilities and their state regulators, electric utilities were guaranteed monopolies within their exclusive service areas and regulated rates of return on their capital investments. In return, these utilities built generating and other facilities to provide all of the electricity needed by all current and future customers in their service areas. Under traditional \u201ccost-of-service\u201d regulation, electricity rates approved by state regulators reflected the utilities\u2019 costs of building new generating plants and operating the power system. As shown in table 1.1, IOUs dominate the electricity markets: Although they account for only about 8 percent of the nation\u2019s almost 3,200 electric utilities, they have over 75 percent of utility sales to ultimate customers and over 77 percent of total utility power generation. Most IOUs sell power at retail rates to several different classes of consumers and at wholesale rates to other utilities, including other IOUs; federal, state, and local government utilities; public utility districts; and rural electric cooperatives.", "The traditional regulatory role of the federal and state governments was established under the Constitution and developed by federal law. Specifically, the Federal Power Act (formerly the Federal Water Power Act), which was enacted in 1920, and the Public Utility Holding Company Act established a regime of regulating electric utilities that gave specific and separate powers to the states and the federal government. State regulatory commissions (generally called \u201cpublic utility\u201d or \u201cpublic service commissions\u201d) regulate utilities\u2019 activities within state boundaries, including the setting of wholesale and retail electric rates. At the federal level, the Securities and Exchange Commission regulates interstate electric utility holding companies by requiring them to register and divest holdings so that each company becomes a single consolidated system serving a specific geographic area. In addition, the Commission regulates how the holding companies issue and acquire securities. Under the Federal Power Act, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), formerly the Federal Power Commission, regulates interstate aspects of the electric utility industry, including financial transactions, wholesale rates, and interconnection and transmission arrangements.", "In addition to IOUs, 932 customer-owned rural electric cooperatives and 2,014 publicly owned utilities provided power in 1996. Most rural electric cooperatives, usually formed and owned by residents of rural areas, distribute electricity only to their members. Operating throughout the nation except for Connecticut, Hawaii, and Rhode Island, cooperatives constituted 29 percent of all the nation\u2019s electric utilities in 1996. Publicly owned electric utilities are nonprofit state and local government agencies, such as municipal utilities, state authorities, public power districts, and irrigation districts. DOE views publicly owned power as providing competition for IOUs and as charging power rates against which the power rates of IOUs can be compared. In 1996, almost 63 percent of all electric utilities in the nation were publicly owned utilities. Cooperatives and publicly owned utilities buy power from wholesale providers for sale to retail customers. However, some cooperatives and publicly owned utilities also generate their own power and transmit it to other utilities or distribute it to their own retail customers. The generation and share of the national energy supply for these types of utilities are provided in table 1.1."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Role of the Federal Government in Traditional Electricity Markets", "paragraphs": ["The federal government has played a significant role in the development of electricity markets. Because it was too expensive for IOUs to serve rural areas, federal power agencies provided power to those areas. In addition, the government provided financing to rural utilities to assist them in building and maintaining electricity distribution systems that provide electricity to rural users. In 1996, federal utilities provided almost one-tenth of the nation\u2019s power. As a result of these activities, the federal agencies that generate and/or market electricity and that make or guarantee loans to finance improvements to rural electric systems had incurred a debt of over $84 billion as of September 30, 1996. This debt, it should be noted, can be classified as direct and indirect. The direct debt, totaling over $53 billion, is owed directly to the federal government\u2014for example, RUS\u2019 borrowers owe about $32 billion. The indirect debt, over $31 billion, is owed by the federal agencies to nonfederal parties\u2014for example, TVA owed about $24 billion to nonfederal bondholders."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Federal Agencies Generate and Market Electricity", "paragraphs": ["Federal entities that generate and/or market electricity\u2014primarily the Bureau, the Corps, the PMAs, and TVA\u2014provided about 10 percent of the nation\u2019s electricity supply in 1996. The Bureau and the Corps generate hydropower at about 130 federally owned power plants located at federal water projects. Because these projects are managed for multiple purposes (for example, providing water for irrigation, water supplies, navigation, flood control, and recreation), the amount of power generated and marketed is affected by the availability and use of water for these other purposes.", "Power generated by the Bureau and the Corps is marketed by four of DOE\u2019s five PMAs: the Bonneville Power Administration (Bonneville), plus the three that are the focus of this report: the Southeastern Power Administration (Southeastern), the Southwestern Power Administration (Southwestern), and the Western Area Power Administration (Western). The fifth PMA, the Alaska Power Administration, differs from the others in that it operates its own power plants and distributes power directly to end-use (retail) customers. The PMAs in 1996 provided about 5 percent of the nation\u2019s power.", "The PMAs\u2019 mission is to market federal hydropower at the lowest possible rates that are consistent with sound business practices. The power the PMAs market is the power that remains after it has been consumed for project purposes\u2014for example, to pump water to fields that are being irrigated. By law, the PMAs are to give priority in the sale of power to \u201cpreference customers\u201d\u2014public bodies (such as municipal utilities, irrigation districts, military installations, and other federal agencies) and cooperatives. Each PMA has its own specific geographic boundaries, federal water projects from which it markets power, statutory responsibilities, and operation and maintenance responsibilities. Except for the Alaska Power Administration, the PMAs generally do not own, operate, or control the facilities that generate electric power; the generating facilities are controlled by the operating agencies\u2014most often the Bureau and the Corps. The PMAs, except for Southeastern, do own and operate transmission facilities. Southeastern relies on the transmission services of other utilities to transmit the power it sells to its customers.", "The PMAs are generally required to recover all costs incurred as a result of producing, transmitting, and marketing power, including repayment of the federal investment in the power generating facilities and other debt, with interest. Certain nonpower costs are also allocated to power revenues for repayment. For example, under the concept of aid-to-irrigation, revenues earned from the sale of power repay the federal investment in irrigation facilities that the Secretary of the Interior deems is beyond the ability of irrigators to repay. According to Bureau officials, power revenues are ultimately expected to cover about 70 percent of the federal investment in completed irrigation facilities. As of September 30, 1996, the PMAs and TVA had an outstanding debt of about $52 billion related to financing the construction and operation of power plants, transmission lines, and related electricity assets, as well as other costs that are allocated to be repaid through revenues earned from the sale of electricity. TVA owed about $28 billion; Bonneville owed about $17 billion; and Southeastern, Southwestern, and Western owed the balance\u2014about $7 billion.", "Together, DOE\u2019s five PMAs and TVA market power within 34 states. They do not serve Hawaii and states in the Northeast and upper Midwest. Figure 1.1 shows the service areas of the PMAs.", "The Congress established the first PMA, Bonneville, by passing the Bonneville Project Act of 1937 to market federal power in the Pacific Northwest. (See app. III for a more detailed discussion of Bonneville.) In 1943, the Secretary of the Interior established Southwestern under the President\u2019s war powers. The Flood Control Act of 1944 provided the authority to create PMAs and also gave the Secretary of the Interior jurisdiction over the Corps\u2019 electric power sales. The Secretary of the Interior established Southeastern in 1950 and Alaska in 1967. The last PMA, Western, was authorized by the Department of Energy Organization Act of 1977, when the four existing PMAs were transferred from the Department of the Interior to DOE.", "The largest individual federal power producer, however, is TVA, which by some measures is the largest utility in the nation. Providing about 5 percent of the nation\u2019s power, TVA generates its own power and markets it in wholesale markets, as well as directly to large industrial customers. TVA also approves the retail rates charged by the 159 municipal and cooperative utilities that are its primary customers. In 1933, the Congress created TVA as a multipurpose, independent federal corporation to develop the resources of the economically depressed Tennessee River Valley: TVA was to improve navigation, promote regional agricultural and economic development, and control the flood waters of the Tennessee River. To those ends, TVA erected dams and hydroelectric power facilities on the Tennessee River and its tributaries. Today, the power program is by far TVA\u2019s largest activity, with about $5.7 billion in annual operating revenues in fiscal year 1996. TVA\u2019s hydroelectric facilities, coal-fired power plants, nuclear generating plants, and other power facilities\u2014with a total generating capacity of over 28,000 megawatts (MW)\u2014provide electricity to nearly 8 million people in Tennessee and parts of Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, and Virginia.

As a result, in 1935, scarcely 1 in 10 farm households in the United States had electricity. The Rural Electrification Act of 1936 authorized the Rural Electrification Administration (now RUS) to provide loans and credit assistance to organizations that generate, transmit, and/or distribute electricity to small rural communities and farms. From fiscal years 1992 through 1996, RUS made or guaranteed 880 loans to rural utilities, some of which buy power from the PMAs.

For decades, they were able to meet increasing demand at decreasing prices because they achieved economies of scale through capacity additions and technological advances. During much of this period, demand for electricity grew at a faster rate than the gross national product. However, in 1976, electricity growth did not exceed overall economic growth, and in 1982 electricity consumption declined. These adverse trends for the electric utility industry were caused by such events as (1) the Northeast power blackout of 1965, which raised concerns about reliability; (2) the Arab oil embargoes of the 1970s, which resulted in increases in fossil fuel prices; and (3) the passage of the Clean Air Act of 1970 and its 1977 amendments, which required utilities to reduce pollutant emissions. Because of the decline in the rate of growth in demand for electricity, utilities could no longer assume that prior patterns in demand-growth would continue into the future. How to satisfy the future demand for power became an increasingly uncertain issue.", "In addition, since the late 1970s, statutory and technological changes have created a climate for change in traditional electricity markets. In general, electricity markets are starting to evolve from domination by large, monopolistic IOUs to competition among IOUs, nonutility generators, power marketers, and others. In the future, electricity markets may evolve into ones in which electricity is a commodity. In addition, states are taking action to ensure that retail consumers will be able buy power from a variety of competing sources."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Federal Laws Encourage Competition", "paragraphs": ["In 1978, the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act and the Fuel Use Act encouraged the growth of a nonutility sector of the electricity business. These laws were passed to lessen the nation\u2019s dependence on foreign oil and encourage alternative sources of power. The Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act required commercial utilities to buy power from nonutility generators, called \u201cqualifying facilities.\u201d These entities had to meet certain criteria specified by FERC for such matters as their ownership and operating efficiency. In addition, the act introduced the pricing of electricity on a competitive basis: As more nonutility generators entered the market, FERC began approving certain wholesale transactions that had rates that resulted from a competitive bidding process. Many of the qualifying facilities generated power in nontraditional ways\u2014for instance, by using small hydropower plants, cogeneration, or renewable sources. Under the Fuel Use Act, electric utilities could not use natural gas to fuel new generating technology; however, these \u201cqualifying facilities\u201d could. They were able to take advantage of new generating technologies, such as combined-cycle gas turbine generation that can be built with less capital than larger power plants. Although the Fuel Use Act was repealed in 1987, qualifying facilities and small power producers had already gained a portion of the total electricity supply. For instance, according to the association of IOUs, in 1995 nonutility generators built about 60 percent of the nation\u2019s new electric generating capacity.", "The Energy Policy Act of 1992 was perhaps the most significant legislative catalyst for increased competition. It expanded nonutility markets by creating a new category of power producers\u2014\u201cexempt wholesale generators.\u201d Like qualifying facilities, exempt wholesale generators do not sell their power in retail markets and own only very limited transmission facilities. Although FERC does not regulate exempt wholesale generators under the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act, it regulates most of them as public utilities under the Federal Power Act. Under FERC\u2019s regulations, exempt wholesale generators may charge market-based rates if they and their affiliates lack market power. Unlike the requirement under the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act that utilities purchase power sold by qualifying facilities, there is no federal mandate that utilities buy exempt wholesale generators\u2019 power. The Energy Policy Act also allows FERC, upon application, to order wholesale wheeling of electricity if such an order does not, among other things, unreasonably impair reliability. It is now possible for a municipal utility that is served by an IOU to seek cheaper power from a neighboring utility. The Energy Policy Act also authorized FERC to set transmission rates at levels that permit the utilities to recover all of the costs incurred in providing transmission services, including legitimate, verifiable, and economic costs.", "In April 1996, pursuant to its authorities under the Federal Power Act, FERC issued a ruling on transmission access. Order 888 requires public utilities that own, control, or operate facilities that transmit electricity in interstate commerce to offer both point-to-point and network transmission services under terms and conditions that are comparable to those that they provide for themselves. Public utilities must offer those services through open-access, nondiscriminatory transmission tariffs containing minimum terms and conditions. In addition, Order 888 allows utilities the opportunity to seek recovery of certain stranded costs from those customers wishing to leave their current supply arrangements. However, according to the Deputy Director, FERC\u2019s Office of Electric Power Regulation, the open-access provisions of Order 888 do not apply to the PMAs, among other entities. Therefore, FERC cannot order the PMAs to provide open transmission services on a general basis. Operating under its authority under the Federal Power Act, FERC can order the PMAs to provide transmission only on a case-by-case basis. However, to facilitate a unified national approach to open-access transmission, DOE directed its PMAs that have transmission facilities to publish generally applicable open-access transmission tariffs, including ancillary services, in a manner comparable to the service tariffs and other measures required of transmission owners and operators that are regulated under FERC\u2019s final rule. In December 1997, Southwestern and Western filed open-access transmission service tariffs with FERC, pursuant to Order 888. The tariffs are to govern future access to available electric transmission and, according to DOE, are consistent with the tariffs of other wholesale transmission providers. Bonneville had filed its tariffs earlier."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Utilities Respond to Increased Competition", "paragraphs": ["In response to the uncertainties about how the electricity market will change and how fast, utilities have begun to implement new strategies to compete. Some are acquiring other utilities or merging with them. After years of virtually no mergers, many mergers have been completed or proposed since the Energy Policy Act was enacted in October 1992. For example, for IOUs alone, from October 1992 to January 1998, over 40 mergers had been proposed and 17 had been completed, according to the Edison Electric Institute\u2014the national trade association for IOUs. Utilities are also restructuring themselves and decreasing their operating costs through reorganizations and layoffs. Some utilities are changing how they plan to satisfy future demand for electricity and changing the types of resources they acquire. Because of uncertainty about market conditions, instead of continuing to plan to meet long-term load forecasts, utilities are focusing more on meeting more immediate demand for power. Thus, utilities are now tending to buy resources that are flexible and allow them to adapt quickly to changing market conditions, such as smaller natural gas-fired power plants and purchased power. Utilities are also retiring power plants if they believe those plants may become uneconomic after the industry is restructured.", "In responding to competitive challenges, utilities are trying to compete for the business of other utilities\u2019 wholesale customers and defending their business with existing customers. For example, as cited in our 1995 TVA report, Virginia Power cut one wholesale customer\u2019s rates by 5 percent to fend off the marketing efforts of a neighboring utility.", "Federal power suppliers have also taken actions to become more competitive. For example, after the departure of half of its industrial load, TVA froze its rates from 1986 through 1997, although a rate increase was approved for 1998. Moreover, Western recently announced a decrease of over 20 percent, effective October 1, 1997, in the composite rates of power it markets from hydropower plants in the Central Valley Project in California. In addition, according to DOE\u2019s Power Marketing Liaison Office, Western began a process in fiscal year 1995 to restructure itself. The goals of this program included reducing federal and contractor staff from fiscal year 1994 levels by 24 percent, saving $25 million in costs annually, and reducing Western\u2019s organizational units.

IOUs erected large amounts of nuclear generating capacity and entered into long-term purchased power contracts to serve existing and future loads. Under the traditional covenants between IOUs and their regulators, the capital and operating costs associated with those assets were recovered through rates. Now, with power generation costs dropping and prospects that competition will affect market prices, these high-cost plants are becoming uneconomical and the costs associated with them may be \u201cstranded.\u201d Estimates of the investment in such assets nationwide range from $10 billion to $500 billion.", "The issue of how to recover stranded costs\u2014that is, who should pay\u2014is being debated. In addressing the recovery of stranded costs in the context of retail competition, some states have proposed \u201csharing the pain\u201d: Utilities could recover or offset the stranded costs by taking mitigating actions (for example, by implementing accelerated depreciation of generating assets, writing off the book value of stranded assets, adjusting dividends to investors, or decreasing operating expenses); ratepayers could pay through rate increases that regulators hope will be temporary; or bonds could be sold to the public to pay off the stranded costs and to avoid rate increases. However, some consumer groups believe that since utilities incurred the costs, they should bear the burden of repayment. For example, an attempt to securitize the costs of a nuclear power plant failed in Connecticut\u2019s legislature because opponents, including consumer groups, believed the issuance of bonds amounted to a \u201cbailout\u201d of the utility. Staffs of state public utility commissions have argued that because IOUs incurred stranded costs under the old regulatory compact, IOUs should be allowed to recover at least some of these costs before they must charge market prices for power. How stranded costs are divided between utilities and their ratepayers, the period of time allowed for their recovery, and how much the recovery of stranded costs affects rates will determine when retail markets become competitive and to what degree."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Transmitting Power in Competitive Markets", "paragraphs": ["To promote competition, new methods must be found to transmit power. Under current transmission arrangements, wholesale customers frequently do not find it economical to buy power from a distant utility because it must be transmitted over the power lines of intervening utilities, each of which adds a transmission or wheeling tariff to the price of the power. For example, in 1995 during our review of the financial viability of TVA, we found that although an IOU in the Southeast offered power that was competitively priced, transmitting it to TVA\u2019s customers through one intervening utility might increase the price by about 10 percent, rendering its delivered price uncompetitive. In addition, according to DOE officials, some of the power transmitted is lost over distances.", "To facilitate competitive transmission of power, many state regulators and FERC are advocating the establishment of \u201cindependent system operators\u201d (ISO). Utilities in a given geographic area would transfer the operation of their transmission assets to an independent party that would transmit electricity reliably, safely, and efficiently in a nondiscriminatory fashion. For example, California has established an Independent System Operation Restructuring Trust to award funding to parties that will assist in establishing an ISO to begin providing service in 1998. The PMAs are also participating in the formation of ISOs. For example, Western is negotiating with other utilities in the Southwest to establish the Desert Southwest Transmission and Reliability Operator (an ISO) as well as to participate in the California ISO. Concerns exist that such arrangements may be problematic from legal and constitutional viewpoints. According to Western officials, however, in Western\u2019s agreements with other utilities pertaining to the ISO, Western is taking care to ensure that its obligations under federal law and its contractual agreements with preference customers are protected. For example, Western officials believe that, under language provided by the PMA and accepted by FERC on Western\u2019s participation in the California ISO, nothing in the ISO\u2019s tariff shall compel any person or federal entity to violate federal statutes or regulations or compel any federal agency to exceed its statutory authority as defined in applicable federal statutes, regulations, or orders lawfully promulgated thereunder. These provisions also state that if any provision of the tariff requires any person or federal entity to give an indemnity or impose a sanction that is unenforceable against a federal entity, the ISO shall submit to the Secretary of Energy or DOE official a report of the situation.

In California, the power pool will publish prices every hour or half hour, to be viewed by electric customers, investors, and power marketers.

Regulators in these states hope that industrial, commercial, and ultimately residential consumers will be able to choose their power supplier, rather than being tied to one utility. These states hope to establish retail choice at all levels by 1998 at the earliest and 2005 at the latest. Supporters of retail competition hope that it will nearly complete the restructuring process for electricity markets and foster competitive pricing throughout the nation.", "At the time we completed our review, states such as Montana, New Hampshire, and New York had asked utilities to implement pilot retail choice programs so that broad issues that could affect widespread competition later could be identified. Several states, such as Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island, were implementing retail competition in phases\u2014for instance, extending it first to industrial and commercial customers and then to residential customers. As mentioned previously, some states were addressing the issue of stranded cost recovery. In addition, at least 8 of these 17 states were also encouraging utilities to continue their \u201csocial\u201d programs\u2014such as energy efficiency and conservation programs, use of renewable sources of power, and low-income energy assistance programs. These programs can be funded by charging consumers a nonbypassable fee or by instituting a tax or surcharge on all energy services.

They could then decide which supplier to buy from during specific times to minimize costs. They may be able to negotiate directly with a supplier or use the services of an energy marketer or broker. In Maine, it is envisioned that consumers that are unwilling to shop for alternative suppliers will be able to adopt the \u201cstandard service option\u201d from their existing utility. The existing utility will use a competitive bidding process in order to buy power for its ratepayers at prices that are comparable to today\u2019s prices. Other options envisioned for Maine\u2019s ratepayers include signing contracts with power marketers or aggregators that are short term, thus enabling them to buy power at a low price but with a risk of rate hikes or rate instability. They will also be able to buy power under longer term contracts at more expensive but more stable rates. Ratepayers will also be able to purchase \u201cgreen power\u201d (i.e., power from nonpolluting sources such as renewable sources). \u201cThose states that are aggressively pursuing competitive restructuring are invariably high-cost states with little to lose. On the other hand, as a lower-cost state, Virginia may have little to gain and much to lose by being on the leading. . .edge of this restructuring movement. We should also take note of the slow pace of those mostly low-cost states surrounding Virginia\u2014North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, West Virginia, and Maryland. Consequently, Virginia should pursue a cautious and measured approach to adopting competitive initiatives, fully exploiting non-painful learning opportunities through observing the successes and failures of retail experiments and restructuring efforts in the more aggressive states.\u201d", "Furthermore, in Nebraska, a state where all electric power is provided by public entities and where power rates are among the nation\u2019s lowest, the state\u2019s largest electric utility has asked a federal appeals court to overturn FERC Orders 888 and 889.

Thus, they cannot enter into contracts that obligate them to pay for goods or services unless sufficient funds are available to cover the costs in full. Therefore, agencies must budget for the full costs of contracts up front. Agencies cannot enter into a contract unless it is authorized by law and an appropriation covers the contract\u2019s cost. Moreover, fixed spending limits, or caps, apply to all discretionary spending through 1998, including spending for capital items.

This risk stems from several factors, two of which have been addressed already in this report. First, the large net costs of the federal hydropower program will continue if action is not taken to recover all of the costs of operating the program. Second, the degraded availability of the generating assets contributes to this risk of nonrecovery because it decreases the marketability of federal power. Other factors also add to the risk of nonrecovery. One factor is that the onset of market competition puts pressure on suppliers to keep their electric rates low or to decrease them. At the same time, the PMAs are being pressured to raise some rates because of the costs at certain projects for mitigating the damage to fish and wildlife habitat from hydropower generation.

This decrease has been caused by factors that include declining fuel prices, an increasing number of fully depreciated power plants, more efficient power generation, and competition from nonutility generators. According to various industry analysts, the restructuring of electricity markets will cause market rates to continue to decline. In addition, according to the Energy Information Administration, retail rates nationwide in 2014 may be about 6 percent to 19 percent below the levels they would have been if competition had not begun. In some cases, wholesale power is available today at about 2 cents per kWh. For example, according to the customer group of the Colorado River Storage Project, in May 1997 one Western customer signed a 20-year contract with an IOU to purchase firm power at a rate not to exceed 1.8 cents per kWh. In contrast, Western\u2019s composite rate for power from the project was about 2 cents per kWh. If the PMAs\u2019 customers can buy less expensive power from sources other than the PMA, the fixed costs associated with the federal government\u2019s power assets will need to be recovered from a decreasing number of customers, placing increased pressure on the PMA to increase its rates.

In addition, although the PMAs\u2019 power is very competitively priced, this advantage may not last. Specifically, competition is expected to cause market rates to fall. At the same time, the PMAs\u2019 rates need to cover the costs of environmental impacts downstream.

As the industry becomes less regulated and more competitive at both the wholesale and retail levels, nonfederal utilities and power suppliers have taken important steps to become competitive to survive. Federal power agencies also face the challenge of moving to a more competitive environment. The entities to whom the PMAs sell power, aware that they need to supply the cheapest available power to their own retail customers, have begun to pressure the PMAs, the Bureau, and the Corps to adopt business practices that are better suited to the new era. Furthermore, and perhaps most important, these agencies are under pressure to adapt to the new markets to reduce the risk that the multibillion-dollar federal investment in hydropower and other associated programs will not be repaid if federal power ultimately proves to be too unreliable and overpriced to be competitive.

For example, according to an official of an association of Western\u2019s municipal power customers, the preference customers should purchase the federal generating and transmission assets of the Colorado River Storage Project in order to avoid the sharp rate increases that characterized Western\u2019s rates from the project since the late 1980s. It is important to note, however, that other preference customers continue to support continued federal ownership of the dams, reservoirs, and hydropower assets. These customers believe that, although some changes in the PMAs\u2019 current practices could lower operating costs and improve efficiencies, as a whole the PMAs have offered high-quality, low-cost services while balancing the diverse needs of the beneficiaries of the federal multi-use projects.", "Moreover, representatives of investor-owned utilities or proponents of divestiture have questioned why the federal government continues to provide power in restructuring markets. First, electrifying rural areas was an important goal of the federal power program; however, this goal has been largely satisfied. Therefore, the need for the federal government\u2019s involvement is questionable. Second, competition likely would enable wholesale and retail customers to choose from among competing power suppliers. This possibility again questions the need for the federal government to sell power. Third, the issue of providing low-cost PMA power to portions of 34 states in the South and West where the preference customers of the PMAs are located, but not to other areas, is debatable. And fourth, IOUs and other critics of PMA power state that, as federal agencies, the PMAs have advantages that IOUs do not have and therefore would compete with their nonfederal parties on an uneven basis. For example, our work has shown that the PMAs have rates that do not recover all of the costs of generating, transmitting, and marketing power. Also, as federal agencies, the PMAs are not subject to income taxes or state regulatory oversight and have more flexible repayment and rate-setting methodologies. Fifth, the status quo continues the existing risk of nonrepayment of the federal investment.", "Because of the stakes involved in changing the management and ownership of federal water projects and hydropower plants, maintaining the status quo affords policymakers the opportunity to make careful decisions about how to proceed. The federal government\u2019s role in balancing the multiple uses of water is important. It affects such things as how much water will be available to accommodate the expansion of metropolitan areas, how much water will be used to protect endangered species, and how much water will be needed to protect the harvesting of shellfish in the Apalachicola Bay, Florida. The Bureau and the Corps generate power while balancing these impacts. Any decisions that federal policymakers reach about changing how power is generated or how the water projects will be managed or owned will need to consider the impacts of the decisions on the uses of the water and the beneficiaries of the water projects. An advantage of the status quo is that it continues the federal role in balancing the multiple uses of the water and allows policymakers time to study these issues before they change the operations and/or ownership of the water and the power assets. Also, by preserving the existing multiple uses of the water projects and the projects\u2019 beneficiaries, the status quo avoids the debate that is likely to occur if the Congress reexamines the agreements reached decades ago on federal involvement in power. For example, the status quo continues federal power\u2019s role in helping promote the economies of rural areas, especially by providing inexpensive power to these areas for homes, businesses, municipalities, and irrigation. Many of the cooperatives that currently receive PMA power also have received direct loans or guarantees from RUS. According to Western officials, these cooperatives\u2019 financial health depends in part on the availability of low-cost PMA power. This is of significant interest to the Treasury because of its need to recoup the balance these PMA customers owe in RUS\u2019 loans or loan guarantees.", "Under the status quo, the PMAs\u2019 revenues are to repay billions of dollars of the costs associated with joint and nonpower benefits for purposes such as irrigation and fish and wildlife protection. Because such benefits likely would not cease to exist if power revenues stopped paying for them, other sources of revenues would have to be located to fund them. In order to avoid increasing the federal deficit, one possible means of paying for these benefits would be for the Congress to fund them from increased tax receipts. However, if federal taxes and revenues could not be increased, then the Congress would need to offset the spending increase for the benefits by decreasing federal spending for other purposes. Alternatively, some costs could be allocated to categories that are not reimbursable through power rates or user fees\u2014to flood control at the Pick-Sloan Program, for example. However, in such a case, additional revenues (such as new taxes or new user fees) would be needed to pay for the costs or offsetting budget cuts to avoid increasing the budget deficit.

Therefore, it gives priority to routine, ongoing maintenance and performs reactive, short-term repairs when its power plants experience unplanned outages. The federal budgeting process does not lend itself to funding extensive repairs and rehabilitations; when these actions eventually become essential, the Corps\u2019 budgeting process requires extensive justifications that can take a year or longer to complete.", "During the early 1990s, the Corps was beginning to address its planning and budgeting needs, for instance, by beginning to rank proposed repair and rehabilitation projects. This effort was suspended in fiscal year 1995, but the Corps\u2019 responsible headquarters official planned to direct the field locations to undertake the effort in time to be considered for the fiscal year 1998 budget. Moreover, in recognition of the need to spend more to repair and rehabilitate its hydropower plants, the Corps in fiscal years 1993 through 1997 requested appropriations for major rehabilitations of some of its hydropower plants. Ten major rehabilitation projects have been approved for funding during fiscal years 1993 to 2007, with a total cost of about $450 million.

Under federal budget statutes, such funding must be ensured before work on a project can be started. For example, Western\u2019s customers are providing advance funding to renovate the generating units at the Bureau\u2019s Shasta power plant in the Central Valley Project. Under an agreement between the Bureau, Western, and the preference customers, the customers may finance up to $21 million and deposit the funds in an escrow account to pay for the work.

In the case of the Shasta power plant, the customers who contributed funds will be issued credits on their monthly power bills from Western; those that did not contribute funds will not be issued credits. According to the Bureau, this arrangement ensures that all customers contribute. When completed, the entire repair cost will have been expensed throughout the construction period with advance funding from PMA customers.", "Under another form of alternative financing, referred to as \u201cnet billing,\u201d invoice amounts are netted out among parties who perform work or provide services for each other, resulting in the issuance of one check instead of multiple checks. Net billing has been used for purchased power and wheeling for several projects\u2014Central Valley, Loveland Area, and Pick-Sloan, according to Western officials. Western estimates that the use of net billing has reduced appropriation requirements by between $40 million to $50 million annually.", "Under a variation of net billing, referred to as \u201cbill crediting,\u201d a customer agrees to pay one or more of the PMA\u2019s bills in exchange for an equivalent credit on the customer\u2019s power bill. Bill crediting has the same uses as net billing. Western estimates that bill crediting has reduced appropriations\u2019 requirements by between $45 million to $60 million annually, mostly in the Central Valley Project, and that increased use for the Loveland and Pick-Sloan projects could reduce the appropriations\u2019 requirements by between an additional $2 million to $7 million annually.", "Supporters of alternative financing, among them officials from the Bureau, the Corps, the PMAs, and the PMAs\u2019 customers, note that its use allows repairs and improvements to be made more expeditiously and predictably than through the federal appropriations process. They believe that alternative financing could provide more certainty in funding repairs and help address problems such as deferred maintenance at Corps-operated plants that provide power marketed by Southeastern. Alternative financing would also move certain costs out of the budget cycle, decreasing the need for appropriations that must be repaid through the PMAs\u2019 power revenues. For example, as of January 1998, Bonneville had entered into long-term agreements with the Bureau and the Corps that will allow Bonneville to directly fund about $150 million dollars in capital improvements and operations and maintenance of the federal hydropower assets in the Pacific Northwest. According to Bonneville, these arrangements will shorten the time needed to secure funding for repairs and maintenance and will remove maintenance as a funding item that must compete with other federal budget priorities. The agreements also promote coordination between Bonneville, the Bureau, and the Corps in budgeting for future maintenance and repairs. Bonneville estimates that this closer coordination will produce operating efficiencies that can reduce costs by up to about $48 million per year.", "However, Corps and DOE officials cautioned that expanded use of alternative financing may not be prudent because, depending on how it is implemented, oversight by the Congress and the Office of Management and Budget may decrease.

For example, Bureau officials believe that to provide for oversight, the agencies could be required to submit data on expenditures to the Office of Management and Budget and to the Congress.", "Expanded use of alternative financing may require legislative action, especially for the projects operated by the Army\u2019s Corps of Engineers. In a July 1996 memorandum, the Army\u2019s Office of the General Counsel concluded that although the Army has some existing authority to accept funds from outside parties to finance replacements, improvements, and other work at the Corps\u2019 hydropower facilities, the use of these funds must be reviewed case by case and is limited to funds from states and their subdivisions. According to the memorandum, the Congress may have to enact more specific legislation to (1) clarify the terms under which such funds may be accepted, including the kind of work that they could pay for, and (2) establish the framework under which the Army, the PMAs, and the customers should proceed with such alternative financing."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Establish Additional Revolving Funds", "paragraphs": ["The Congress could expand the use of revolving funds.

The Congress has authorized the use of these funds at such projects as the Colorado River Storage and Fort Peck projects to fund operation, maintenance, and replacement costs.", "Proponents of revolving funds, including some officials of Western, the Bureau, and a PMA customer group, note that the funds allow repairs and improvements to be financed more expeditiously and predictably than the federal appropriations process does. Like alternative financing, revolving funds remove some costs from the budget cycle, thereby decreasing the need for reimbursable appropriations. Thus, revolving funds enable the federal power-related operations to be self-financing and also offer customers more opportunities to consult with the agencies on how to spend funds to repair and maintain the hydropower assets.", "However, officials of PMA customer groups and the Office of Management and Budget also stated that the use of revolving funds could reduce oversight by external parties such as the Congress and the Office of Management and Budget and/or may allow repayment obligations to be incurred that are not routinely approved by these entities. However, the Congress could be kept informed of the operating agencies\u2019 and the PMAs\u2019 spending plans through the annual appropriations process. For example, the PMAs could be required to submit their annual operations and maintenance budgets to the congressional oversight committees. A 1993 DOE legislative proposal, which was not enacted, would have provided for separate accounts established in the U.S. Treasury to be funded from all sources, including sales of power and other services as well as other collections by, contributions to, and appropriations for Southeastern, Southwestern, and Western. These PMAs, the Bureau, and the Corps would use these accounts to pay for the operations, maintenance, and rehabilitation of their power assets. The PMAs would have submitted their annual operations and maintenance (O&M) budgets to their budget committees, including estimates of the PMAs\u2019 and the operating agencies\u2019 O&M spending, project by project. Officials of the Bureau, Western, and a PMA customer group voiced concerns that revolving funds increase the likelihood that nonpower costs, such as environmental initiatives and repayment of obligations to Native Americans, will be added to the revenue requirements base, with rate impacts that are not fully apparent until later. For example, under bills proposed in both the House and the Senate, a potential future cost of up to about $4.5 million would be financed with payments from the Upper Colorado River Basin Fund to divest the lands, structures (including homes), and community infrastructure of the Bureau\u2019s Dutch John, Utah, community that the Secretaries of Agriculture and of the Interior identify as unnecessary.

The Energy Policy Act of 1992, for example, authorizes Bonneville to directly fund such activities at Bureau and Corps\u2019 hydropower projects in the Pacific Northwest. If the Congress authorizes other PMAs to directly fund hydropower assets of their operating agencies, the PMAs\u2019 access to nonappropriated funds, such as those provided to Bonneville, would be one way to pay for the projects.

Such cost recovery is generally required by the Reclamation Project Act of 1939 and the Flood Control Act of 1944. DOE\u2019s cost recovery order (Order RA 6120.2), however, excludes certain costs associated with facilities that are not operational and is not specific about the recovery of other costs. The PMAs have consequently interpreted the order to exclude certain costs from their rates. In addition, the nonrepayment of some federal investments in hydropower capacity and other assets (most importantly, irrigation facilities) assigned to power for repayment raises the issue of whether these investments will be recovered under the current repayment methods.

When repaying principal investment, the PMAs generally must repay their highest interest-bearing debt first rather than the oldest debt. These provisions establish some of the financing flexibility the PMAs need because their revenue reflects the year-to-year variability of water flows and hydropower generation; however, they also result in rates that are lower than they otherwise would be, slower repayment of the federal investment, and a net cost to the Treasury because interest rates on the outstanding federal investment are substantially below the rates Treasury incurs to provide funding to the PMAs and other federal programs.

The government anticipated that entities corporatized under this act would be subject to the same regulation, antitrust, tax, and company law as private enterprise. The restructuring of the electricity industry commenced with the corporatization of the government\u2019s generation and transmission capacity in 1987, corporatization of the retail power companies in 1993, full deregulation of the retail sector in 1993 and 1994, and establishment of a competitive wholesale electricity market in 1996.

Cross subsidies between customer classes are reported to be greatly reduced. Over a longer term, inflation-adjusted retail domestic (residential) rates increased by about 5 percent to 15 percent from 1985 through 1997 and from about 16 percent to 20 percent from 1990 through 1997, according to the New Zealand Ministry of Commerce.

Each agency has it own priorities, which do not always favor maximizing power revenues. For example, the Congress may provide funds to the Corps to upgrade a failing generator, but if a key lock in the Corps\u2019 navigation system were disabled, the Corps might divert the funds intended for the generator to the lock. This could prolong an outage at the power plant and cause the government to lose revenue. Although a Corps headquarters official stated that this scenario occurred infrequently, he said that a repair project may be deferred because of conflicting priorities. At the same time, if the power generating activities of the Corps and the Bureau were consolidated within the PMAs, the PMAs, which have a primary mission of marketing power, may inadequately consider the other purposes of the water projects when operating the power plants.

Although many of the study\u2019s recommendations are administrative in nature, Western identified opportunities to improve its performance that ranged from a few thousand dollars to millions of dollars. For example, the report on the study recommends that Western request an exemption from DOE\u2019s requirement to report quarterly on safety. Western contends the report is of no value, but exempting it from this requirement could save Western $6,630 annually. In another example, Western estimated that if it used a credit card to purchase supplies and services instead of purchase orders, it could save over $500,000 annually. In an example that would require legislative action, exempting Western from the statutory requirements in the Federal Acquisition Regulations about taking sealed bids for procurements could save the agency $115,600 annually. Of more consequence, the Congress could allow Western to pay prevailing local area wages instead of those required by the Service Contract Act of 1965.

Collectively, they suggested that some of the hydropower plants at the Bureau\u2019s Collbran, Dolores, Loveland Area, and Rio Grande projects as candidates for disposal. According to Bureau officials, some of these projects associated with the Colorado River Storage Project produce power at costs ranging from about 3.5 to 6 cents per kWh, whereas Western sells power at a composite firm rate of about 2 cents per kWh for the Colorado River Storage Project. According to a Corps official, one obvious problem with this option is finding a willing buyer for these inefficient units. Also, to the extent that power revenues cease to pay for some of the federal investment in constructing these units, the taxpayers would assume a larger burden.

As we concluded in our March 1997 report, divesting the federal hydropower assets, while possible, would be complicated for several reasons. Any divestiture of hydropower-related assets would need to balance the multiple purposes of the water projects that limit and define how water is released through the turbines, how and when electricity can be generated, and in what quantities. These federal responsibilities would not necessarily terminate after a divestiture. Other factors would also have to be accommodated. These factors include the types of assets being divested, the conditions attached to the sale and the use of the assets after the divestiture, the operating conditions of the assets, the sales mechanism used, and the impact of the divestiture on regional economies, including the impact on regional electricity prices. Of particular note, the impact of a divestiture on the future rates of the preference customers would have to be considered. If the PMAs were privatized, rates would likely increase to varying degrees for most of the current preference customers. Together, these factors complicate the sale of federal hydropower assets and at the same time could affect the willingness of potential buyers to bid on the federal hydropower assets and the price the government could obtain for them. It should be noted that customers themselves have proposed defederalization of the federal hydropower assets. For example, in 1995, 37 of Western\u2019s preference customers advocated an arrangement whereby they would purchase, lease, or obtain other rights to the federal hydropower generating assets within the Boulder Canyon and Parker-Davis projects, as well as certain transmission projects. According to a representative of these customers, this proposal was made to prevent an investor-owned utility from acquiring the federal power resources and was also a reaction against other privatization proposals that were being presented at that time."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Accommodating Multiple Purposes and Other Public Policy Factors", "paragraphs": ["With very few exceptions, federal hydropower projects have multiple purposes specified in their authorizing legislation. For example, the Corps\u2019 Fort Peck project on the Missouri River in Montana has hydropower as a purpose as well as providing for fish and wildlife habitat, flood control, irrigation, navigation, recreation, water quality, and water supply. Multiple purposes are often complementary but are sometimes at odds. For example, water is stored in and released from a reservoir to provide for recreation, but its release through the turbines could be scheduled in a way that is intended to maximize revenue. In contrast, Western\u2019s Billings, Montana, office forecasts decreases in power revenues in the long-term because water, which would otherwise be used to generate electricity, will be increasingly used for irrigation and for other purposes. In its fiscal year 1995 repayment study, Western predicted that revenues from the sale of hydropower would decrease from about $253 million in 2001 to about $213 million (in constant 1995 dollars) in fiscal year 2080 for the Pick-Sloan Program.", "At the Bureau\u2019s and the Corps\u2019 water projects, power generation is defined and constrained by the requirement to manage the water for other purposes. The Bureau, for instance, at some projects has restricted releases through the turbines to mitigate environmental impacts downstream. The need to manage water for multiple purposes and to generate hydropower in a way that balances other purposes would have to be accommodated even after a divestiture occurs, absent congressional action.", "In addition, the water rights of Native Americans and of states would need to be accommodated in the event of a divestiture. According to Bureau officials, Native Americans\u2019 rights to water at some federal water projects are the earliest and thus supersede the use of water for other purposes, including hydropower generation. As an example, Bureau officials cited a legal settlement with tribal entities of the Fort Peck Reservation in Montana that includes the right to about 1 million acre-feet of water from the Missouri River. In addition, according to DOE\u2019s Power Marketing Liaison Office, a divestiture may have to address how to transfer out of federal ownership the transmission lines and rights-of-way that traverse tribal lands. The tribes may be concerned about the transfer or sale of such lines to private parties.", "States also have water rights, and the Bureau and the Corps are increasingly arbitrating between the claims of various states.

In general, divesting only the PMAs and the hydropower generating assets would be less complicated than divesting the balance of the projects because the first two alternatives retain the Bureau and the Corps in their role of managing how water is used and in balancing the projects\u2019 multiple purposes. The kinds of assets divested will influence the regulatory issues accompanying a divestiture.", "Many options for regulating the operations of divested hydropower assets exist, including regulatory regimes that could be established by federal, state, or regional authorities. FERC, which currently licenses the operation of nonfederal hydropower assets, primarily regulates the reasonableness of wholesale rates charged by the PMAs but does not provide more detailed oversight. According to FERC officials, FERC has experience regulating the multipurpose aspects of water development at over 1,600 projects nationwide pursuant to much the same multiple-use standards as apply to federal projects. FERC, however, does not have complete authority to set regulatory requirements. Other federal and state agencies, through FERC\u2019s regulatory process, may impose mandatory conditions on FERC\u2019s licenses, which complicate FERC\u2019s licensing process.", "If only the PMAs (including their rights to sell power and any transmission lines) were divested, then the Bureau and the Corps would continue to operate the hydropower plants, dams, and reservoirs in accordance with existing plans, guidelines, and regulations. In such a case, the buyer would not need a FERC-issued license; the Bureau and the Corps would continue to manage the water as in the past, the existing restrictions would be likely to remain in effect, and the buyer would market the power subject to the same conditions as the former PMA. According to FERC officials, they prefer to license all of a project\u2019s features that have a role in power production.", "However, if the power plants were divested as well, the new owner would be required to obtain an operating license from FERC, unless this requirement was specifically exempted by law. Licensing a divested plant could take a long time. We reported, for example, that the median processing time for 111 projects applying for relicensing between January 1982 and May 1992 was 2.5 years. Some had taken as long as 10 to 15 years. In January 1998, a FERC official told us that the median time to relicense over 150 projects whose licenses expired in 1993\u2014the most recent data FERC had analyzed\u2014was about 30 months.", "If a divestiture involves a PMA, the power plants, and the balance of the water projects (most importantly, the dams and reservoirs), the Bureau and the Corps would no longer fill the role of specifying the operating conditions of the project. Instead, safeguards for the multiple uses of the water would primarily be contained in the conditions FERC would attach to the operating license pursuant to the Federal Power Act. In such an event, in licensing the hydropower plant, FERC would be required to weigh the plant\u2019s impact on such aspects as the environment and recreation. Licensing would therefore be complicated by the need to complete a number of studies on the power plant\u2019s impact on fish, plant, and wildlife species; water use and quality; and any nearby cultural and archeological resources. Moreover, the government of each affected state would have the opportunity to issue a water quality certification.", "FERC officials also cautioned that if power plants, dams, and reservoirs were sold, then FERC\u2019s licensing process could revisit the management and uses of the water pursuant to the Federal Power Act and possibly change the operation of the project, potentially affecting power generation. In connection with this issue, the executive director of the National Hydropower Association stated that nonfederal hydropower plants are losing generating capacity because of environmental restrictions or mitigations that are attached as conditions to their operating licenses as FERC relicenses those plants. Moreover, according to a September 1997 report by DOE\u2019s Idaho National Engineering Laboratory, at the time of relicensing, 96 percent of the peaking projects relicensed since 1987 have had their ability to meet peak demand reduced. Of the 52 projects that were relicensed from 1987 to 1996, FERC added capacity to only 4 projects, but the remaining 48 projects had their ability to meet peak demand reduced by from 0.4 to 54.3 percent of their previous capacity: the average reduction was 6 percent. Also, FERC\u2019s review of over 130 projects licensed from the 157 applications filed in 1991 shows that while generating capacity had a very small increase, actual electricity generation had a very small decrease\u2014less than 1 percent."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Trade-Offs Exist Between the Conditions Attached to the Sale and Use of Assets and the Bids Received", "paragraphs": ["The explicit and implicit liabilities borne by the government and which of those liabilities would transfer to a buyer would also affect the price obtained for the federal power assets. Sales of some or all of the hydropower assets\u2014at prices that exceed the value to the government\u2014would produce budgetary savings in the long run, according to a November 1997 report by the Congressional Budget Office. The report estimates that the combined assets of the three PMAs may be worth between about $8 billion and $11 billion. A sale could also result in a future stream of tax payments to the Treasury, also depending on the divestiture\u2019s terms and conditions. However, the report states that losses are possible, depending on the terms and conditions of the sale. In addition, as a matter of general principle, policymakers would need to take into consideration the fact that assets that are sold with many or relatively onerous restrictions (from the viewpoint of a prospective purchaser) or uncertainties about future operations are correspondingly less attractive and are likely to sell for less. While the government may still choose to place restrictions or to assign or retain certain liabilities, the financial consequences in terms of the sale price should be assessed.", "If the government\u2019s objective is to obtain the maximum possible price for its assets, the government could retain certain liabilities that could reduce risks to potential buyers. In some cases, the federal government could be in a better position than the buyer to bear certain risks. For instance, in the proposed divestiture of the U.S. Enrichment Corporation, the government would retain liability for the environmental cleanup associated with the prior production of enriched uranium. According to a contractor\u2019s report, decontamination and decommissioning activities at uranium enrichment plants could cost as much as $17.4 billion in 1994 constant dollars. At some hydropower projects, available generating capacity has been diminished by up to one-third because of the need to mitigate environmental impacts downstream. Buyers may discount any prices they offer because of the loss of available generating capacity unless the government assumes the liability for mitigating environmental impacts. In addition, in the case of the federal hydropower assets, uncertainty about future operating conditions because of potential environmental liabilities may discourage bidding or result in lower prices than if the federal government assumes some of the liabilities. For instance, one provision of the Central Valley Project Improvement Act directs the Secretary of the Interior to manage annually 800,000 acre-feet of water for environmental purposes authorized by the act. According to the Bureau, an analysis of the environmental impacts indicates that hydropower generation may be reduced by about 5 percent. Were the government to divest the project\u2019s assets, it might agree to limit the effect of water use restrictions on potential buyers for a specific period and to specify changes in water use restrictions over time to reduce the uncertainty the buyer would face.", "If the government\u2019s objective is to expedite the divestiture on terms that would less adversely affect the projects\u2019 beneficiaries, getting the highest possible price for the assets might be a secondary consideration. For example, although a decision to limit bidders on particular assets to certain geographic areas would foster a goal of local or regional control of those assets and expedite a transfer, it could reduce the proceeds from the sale if other potentially interested buyers were precluded from making offers. In the ongoing divestiture of the Alaska Power Administration, an overriding concern is to protect that PMA\u2019s ratepayers from increases in electricity rates. Decisionmakers therefore restricted the eligibility of bidders to only nonfederal entities from within the state of Alaska. It also accepted a sale price approximating the present value of future principal and interest payments that the Treasury would have received instead of establishing the price by selling the assets in an open, more competitive fashion to the highest bidder."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Trade-Offs Between Assets\u2019 Operating Conditions and the Need to Improve Them Must Be Considered in the Event of a Divestiture", "paragraphs": ["Assets that are in better operating condition are more likely to attract higher bids than assets in poor condition.

If these hydropower assets were to be sold without reducing the current backlog of necessary maintenance, bids would be lower. However, a 1995 World Bank review of international experience with divestitures found that in preparing a government enterprise for divestiture, a government should generally refrain from making new investments to expand or improve that enterprise because any increase in sales proceeds is not likely to exceed the value of those investments. DOE\u2019s Power Marketing Liaison Office noted that the statement of the World Bank should not be interpreted to imply that federal facilities should be allowed to decay without proper maintenance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Specific Sales Mechanism and Process Need to Be Determined", "paragraphs": ["The objectives underlying a divestiture help determine the most appropriate sales method. For example, if a divestiture is largely motivated by fiscal considerations, an appropriate sales mechanism would involve some form of competitive bidding and tend to place few restrictions on the number or identity of bidders. For example, the Congress, in the 1996 National Defense Authorization Act, directed DOE to sell its Naval Petroleum Reserve No. 1 (Elk Hills) by February 1998 and to do so in a manner that would obtain the maximum proceeds to the government.The government has been producing and selling oil and gas from the field for the past 20 years. According to DOE, the reserve\u2019s sale is part of an effort to remove the federal government from nonfederal functions. In October 1997, DOE announced that it had executed agreements preparing for the reserve\u2019s sale for $3.65 billion in cash as a result of a competition designed to allow all qualified bidders to compete. Before the final selection, DOE had contacted more than 200 companies and received 22 bona fide offers, according to DOE. This sale, which was finalized on February 5, 1998, is the largest divestiture in U.S. government history, according to DOE. In general, we have supported the principle that the federal government should receive full market value in selling its assets.Alternatively, if the major motivation of a divestiture is to transfer operations to the private sector, the government could choose to negotiate a sales price with a selected buyer.", "In practice, the size of the assets to be sold, in terms of value and scale of enterprise, has influenced the type of sales process used. Trade sales and public stock offerings are general processes; trade sales are used more often to sell smaller enterprises or assets and public offerings to sell larger ones. Sales can be organized using competitive bidding methods or negotiations with either type of sale. A brief description of these processes follows: \u201cTrade sales\u201d draw on the idea that an existing set of businesses competing in the relevant line of business (or trade) are likely to offer more and higher bids for the assets. Three key attributes of the PMAs and the electricity industry may lend themselves to a trade sale: (1) the PMAs and related hydropower assets are part of an established industry with capital market connections experienced in the valuation, grouping, and sale of electricity-generating assets; (2) sales of significant electricity-generating assets are not unusual; (3) several bidders are likely for at least large portions of the PMAs and their related assets, depending on how those assets are grouped for sale. A trade sale can be a negotiated sales process between the government and a buyer or can be accomplished using an auction to determine both the sales price of the assets as well as buyers.", "Stock offerings have been used domestically, most recently in the sale of Conrail in 1987, as well as internationally to divest large public enterprises. This method of sale would most likely require creating a government corporation or corporations out of the PMAs and their associated assets. Some of these assets could be grouped for sale, and some could be excluded from the sale, depending on the policy trade-offs discussed. In the case of some federal water projects, for example, the government could decide to retain control of the dam and reservoir to satisfy increasingly significant restrictions on the use of water because of concerns about the environment or endangered species. The stock of the government corporation would be subsequently sold through standard financial market methods, such as a private placement through negotiations between particular investors and the government or through a sale to the general public by using competitive bidding.", "In cases where auction methods may be used to sell government assets, recent government experience indicates the importance of carefully choosing the specific format for an auction. That is, a policy decision to choose a competitive auction format requires making many subsequent decisions to define the specific rules leading to an appropriate operational auction. For example, the Federal Communications Commission chose to auction the leases of electromagnetic spectrum licenses for use in mobile communications. While generating a large amount of revenue was a less important objective than achieving an efficient geographic allocation of spectrum licenses to communications firms, the auctions generated more revenue than some potential bidders had predicted, according to auction analysts. In large part, in structuring these auctions, the government carefully considered the auction format and the identification of particular problematic features of auctions of similar assets in other nations.", "Most domestic and international divestitures have relied on private capital market firms as consultants and managers because of their frequent experience with complicated and high-valued transactions governing the transfer of assets in the private sector. Particularly in the case of public offerings but also for trade sales, the government would be likely to incur substantial costs to prepare its assets for sale or to pay for services performed by its financial advisers. For example, in the sale of Conrail, the government employed a variety of financial advisers and a prominent law firm with expertise in a variety of fields, including tax and employment law. Also, legislation authorizing the sale of DOE\u2019s Elk Hills Naval Petroleum Reserve required DOE to use an investment adviser to administer the sale.", "If the government\u2019s objective is to perpetuate the social and public policy compacts concerning public power, it could transfer or sell its hydropower assets to the preference customers. The assets could be sold free of the debt associated with them. Although such a transaction would provide some revenue to the Treasury, it would probably provide less of a return to the Treasury than a sale to parties that would be willing to pay the highest bid possible for the assets. A debt-free transfer is also harmful to the Treasury because it would incur the debt associated with the hydropower assets, including perhaps any associated debt previously repaid by power revenues\u2014for example, the federal investment in irrigation projects beyond the ability of irrigators to repay. A variation of this suboption is contained in a bill now before House committees. According to the bill\u2019s sponsor, this proposal is designed to avoid the fight over elimination of preference by issuing warrants entitling the existing preference customers to purchase, by a pre-set date and at a stipulated price, a fixed number of shares (based on recent electricity purchases) in the PMA from which they purchase power. The stipulated price would be set somewhat below the expected market price value of the shares. The warrants would be fully negotiable so that the preference customers could sell them if they so chose. The actual sale of the shares would be made to individuals, which could be IOUs or investment bankers, holding the warrants on the specified day of sale."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Impact of a Divestiture on Preference Customers\u2019 Rates Should Be Considered", "paragraphs": ["How a divestiture could affect preference customers\u2019 rates needs to be considered. Some of Southeastern\u2019s, Southwestern\u2019s, and Western\u2019s customers are concerned that a sale would significantly raise their rates. From 1990 through 1995, the three PMAs received less than 2 cents per kWh for their power\u2014at least 40 percent less than what the nonfederal utilities received per kWh during the same period. However, proponents of divestiture contend that competition in the wholesale market would be likely to moderate rate increases. For example, representatives of the Edison Electric Institute (the trade association for IOUs) maintain that because the wholesale market is competitive, very few preference customers will lack access to alternate power suppliers following a divestiture. They believe that, after a PMA is divested, some preference customers who relied heavily on that PMA will be able to purchase power from independent power producers, energy brokers, or energy marketers at competitive rates. In addition, as we noted earlier in this report, many states are moving toward deregulating both wholesale and retail markets.", "Representatives of PMAs and their customers believe that having access to alternate supplies of electricity is not enough. They note that even in cases in which preference customers may buy most of their electricity from alternate sources, these customers often rely on the PMA for power during hours of peak demand, particularly in areas where Southeastern and Southwestern sell power. Having access to inexpensive power during times of peak demand is important to these customers because, typically, power sold to meet this demand is more expensive than power sold at other times. In response, Edison Electric Institute officials maintain that preference customers will be able to purchase power even during peak periods at competitive prices.", "To address these concerns, we estimated how much preference customers\u2019 rates might increase if the PMAs were divested. We examined only the potential rate impacts of divesting the PMAs and excluded other factors that are currently volatile and difficult to project. In our analysis, we assumed, among other things, that (1) immediately after a divestiture, the buyer of the PMA would raise each preference customer\u2019s rates to the level the customer paid for non-PMA power in 1995 and (2) the preference customers do not change the quantity of electricity they purchased in 1995. Because of a lack of data, we did not assess how increasing competition in the wholesale market may affect the rate changes from divestiture. Also, we did not project whether the emergence of competition in retail markets would affect rates in the wholesale market. It is important to note that our methodology yields conservative results. If prices for wholesale power decline in the future, as many industry analysts believe they will, preference customers\u2019 actual rate changes from divestiture will be smaller than our estimates.", "Our analysis shows that most preference customers will experience relatively small rate increases after a divestiture of the PMAs. As shown in figure 3.1, we estimate that more than two-thirds of preference customers may see rate increases of 25 percent or less, or up to 0.5 cents per kWh. If the preference customers passed these costs directly on to their end-users, the average residential end-users\u2019 electricity bills would increase by no more than $4.17 per month. However, we also estimate that some preference customers, mainly those that purchase a large portion of their power from the PMA, may see their rates increase more. About 13 percent of preference customers may see rate increases that exceed 75 percent. Expressed in kWh, about 16 percent of preference customers may see their rates increase by more than 1.5 cents per kWh. If costs are passed directly, the average residential end-users served by about 25 percent of preference customers would see their electricity bills increase by more than $8.33 per month.", "Preference customers who currently purchase a small portion of their total power from Southeastern, Southwestern, or Western generally may experience smaller rate increases after a divestiture. For example, in fiscal year 1995, 99 percent of Southeastern\u2019s preference customers received less than a quarter of their power from the PMA. Correspondingly, as illustrated in figure 3.2, we calculated that almost all (98 percent) of Southeastern\u2019s preference customers may experience rate increases of 0.5 cents per kWh or less, and 99 percent would see their rates increase by one-quarter or less. Moreover, we estimated that about 27 percent (or 72) of these customers may see their rates decline if they purchased all of their power at 1995 wholesale market rates. Some of these customers currently may have access to less expensive power; however, for various reasons, these customers have opted not to buy from these sources.", "In contrast, preference customers who currently purchase most or all of their power from the PMA may experience much greater rate increases. For example, in 1995, about 38 percent of Western\u2019s preference customers purchased more than half of their electricity from the PMA. As shown in figure 3.3, we estimated that about one-fifth of Western\u2019s customers may see their rates increase by more than 75 percent. About 27 percent of preference customers may see rate increases greater than 1.5 cents per kWh. If preference customers pass the higher rates on to those they serve, the average residential end-users served by about 16 percent of Western\u2019s preference customers may see their electricity bills increase by at least $16.67 per month.", "Similarly, almost one-third of Southwestern\u2019s preference customers purchase more than 75 percent of their electricity from the PMA. As shown in figure 3.4, although most of Southwestern\u2019s preference customers will experience relatively small rate changes, about 25 percent may see their rates more than double. If these preference customers pass these increases on to those they serve, the average residential end-users may see their rates increase by at least $16.67 per month.", "It is important to remember that, although some preference customers may initially experience significant rate increases, government may mitigate these rate increases through various mechanisms, such as rate caps. In addition, these customers currently pay rates that, on average, are 40 to 50 percent below what neighboring utilities pay that do not have access to PMA power. After the divestiture, these preference customers will be paying the same market rates as those utilities.", "Finally, smaller-sized preference customers may experience larger rate increases after divestiture. As illustrated in figure 3.5, we estimated that about one-fifth of Southeastern\u2019s, Southwestern\u2019s, and Western\u2019s small preference customers will experience rate increases exceeding 75 percent. About 30 percent of small customers will see their rates rise by more than 1.5 cents per kWh. In contrast, 2 percent of medium-sized preference customers and 3 percent of large preference customers may see rate increases exceeding 75 percent. However, in all three size categories, a majority of preference customers may experience rate increases of 25 percent or less or 0.5 cents per kWh or less. We believe smaller customers may experience larger rate increases after divestiture because they generally purchase a larger portion of their power from the PMAs than medium-sized and large preference customers."], "subsections": []}]}]}]}], "fastfact": []}
