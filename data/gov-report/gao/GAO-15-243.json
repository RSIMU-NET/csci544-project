However, with the exception of the Army, the military services and their component commands are not generally collecting OCS issues to develop lessons learned. Officials from the Air Force, Marine Corps, and Navy stated that the lack of OCS awareness caused by not having (1) service-wide guidance on collecting OCS issues and (2) an OCS training requirement for senior leaders hinders their ability to develop lessons learned. Without guidance and a training requirement for senior leaders to improve OCS awareness, it will be difficult for DOD to ensure consistent collection of OCS issues and build on efficiencies that the services have identified to adequately plan for the use of contractor support.", "DOD has made progress resolving some OCS issues, but does not have a focal point for integrating OCS issues identified through the Joint Lessons Learned Program (JLLP). The combatant commands and services are to use the JLLP to develop lessons learned related to joint capabilities from operations and exercises to improve areas such as doctrine and training. Currently, there are multiple organizations across DOD that are working on separate and sometimes disjointed OCS lessons-learned efforts. DOD has undertaken initial efforts to assign an OCS joint proponent with lessons-learned responsibilities. A joint proponent is an entity intended to lead collaborative development and integration of joint capability. However, DOD has not determined whether the joint proponent will be responsible for providing formal oversight and integration of OCS issues from the JLLP. As it develops the joint proponent, including such roles and responsibilities will help better position DOD to integrate all OCS issues from the JLLP, thereby addressing any gaps in its efforts.", "DOD organizations do not consistently use the Joint Lessons Learned Information System (JLLIS) to share OCS issues and lessons learned due to the system's limited functionality. JLLIS is the JLLP's system of record and is to facilitate the DOD-wide collection and sharing of lessons learned. However, GAO found that geographic combatant commands and the Army use JLLIS to varying degrees. Further, DOD is generally not sharing OCS lessons learned in JLLIS because the system is not functional for users searching OCS issues due to, among other reasons, not having an OCS label and not having a designated location for sharing OCS lessons learned. JLLIS's limited functionality impedes information sharing department-wide. Until DOD improves the functionality of JLLIS, it will be difficult for users to search for OCS issues, and DOD runs the risk of not being able to systematically track and share OCS lessons learned department-wide, which could negatively affect joint force development and readiness."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends, among other things, that DOD and the services (1) issue service-wide OCS lessons-learned guidance; (2) establish an OCS training requirement for senior leaders; (3) ensure the planned OCS joint proponent's roles and responsibilities include integrating OCS issues from the JLLP; and (4) improve JLLIS's functionality.

For instance, in the area of  transition planning, the command found that OCS planning in Iraq was  not fully integrated into the overall joint task force drawdown or transition  plans. Therefore, the command recommended that OCS planners be  sourced and embedded with the operations directorate 2 years prior to a  transition so that contract support requirements between DOD and the  Department of State could be properly identified. In Afghanistan, senior  U.S. Central Command and U.S. Forces Afghanistan officials provided  observations and insights about the OCS Integration Cell (formerly the  OCS Drawdown Cell) and reported having several issues that could be  used to inform contractor management and OCS planning.

In Afghanistan, officials recommended changing the OCS  Integration Cell\u2019s organization and physical location, codifying in doctrine  the OCS Integration Cell authorities prior to a contingency, improving  sharing of OCS-related information with stakeholders, and combining  OCS and operational-contracting functions to improve OCS planning and  execution, among other things.", "Smaller-scale operations have also provided the geographic combatant  commands with opportunities to collect OCS issues that affect their  command. For example, U.S. Pacific Command officials observed OCS  issues during Operation Tomodachi in 2011, following the earthquake and  tsunami near Japan. Specifically, an observation at U.S. Pacific  Command recommended that the command establish a Joint Theater  Support Contracting Command to coordinate contracting during the  disaster, which subsequently led the command to develop an instruction  that includes considerations and procedures for establishing a Joint  Theater Support Contracting Command and to hold a rehearsal-of- concept drill. In another smaller-scale operation, Operation Unified  Response in Haiti, U.S. Southern Command identified several OCS  issues. Specifically, the command identified the need to improve its  Synchronized Predeployment and Operational Tracker policy, develop more OCS capabilities at the military service component commands, and  establish operational frameworks to enable cross-service OCS  collaboration within the context of theater security cooperation efforts.", "Additionally, the geographic combatant commands are improving efforts  to collect OCS issues during exercises. The geographic combatant  commands are to use DOD\u2019s Joint Training System in planning,  executing, and assessing joint training, like exercises. The Joint  Training System provides an integrated, requirements-based method for  aligning joint training programs with assigned missions consistent with  command priorities, capabilities, and available resources. We have  previously reported that evaluating lessons learned and identifying issues  for corrective actions are fundamental components of DOD\u2019s training and  exercise process. We recommended that DOD develop guidance with  specific criteria for postexercise documentation, particularly to allow the  results and lessons learned from exercises to be easily reviewed and  compared. DOD agreed that such information should be provided in a  standardized format that can be easily accessed and understood by  authorized organizations that might benefit from such knowledge.  However, DOD cautioned that any actions taken in response to this  recommendation must accommodate constraints regarding classified  information. As of December 2014, four of the six geographic combatant  commands\u2014U.S. Africa Command, U.S. Central Command, U.S.  Northern Command, and U.S. Southern Command\u2014have identified OCS  as a critical capability in their joint training plans and have integrated it  into the planning, execution, and assessment of training events.

Prior to  the inclusion of OCS as a critical capability in its joint training plans, the  command included prescripted OCS-related events or master-scenario  events intended to guide exercises toward specific outcomes. According  to U.S. European Command officials, they have included OCS-related  master-scenario events as part of their exercises since 2008. While a  training proficiency assessment of these events is not typically performed  by the geographic combatant commands, master-scenario events can  provide command staff the opportunity to perform some OCS-related  tasks and familiarize themselves with OCS processes, among other  things.

At U.S. Army South, the command provides its OCS  issues through U.S. Southern Command\u2019s after-action review process,  but does not enter them into the lessons-learned system of record.  However, other Army component commands such as U.S. Army Europe  and U.S. Army Pacific have not collected OCS issues of their own. For  example, U.S. Army Europe relies on the 409th Contracting Support  Brigade to gather OCS issues, but these lessons have been primarily  contracting-related. As discussed later in the report, Army service  component commands are collecting OCS issues to varying degrees  because of a lack of awareness of OCS roles and responsibilities.", "In contrast to the Army, the Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force\u2014and their  component commands\u2014are generally not collecting OCS issues. For  example, officials from the Navy and all the component commands we  interviewed stated that they are not collecting OCS issues or are doing so  to a limited degree. Furthermore, the Marine Corps does not  systematically collect OCS issues. For example, at Marine Corps  headquarters, the official responsible for OCS told us that the Marine  Corps does not systematically collect OCS issues, but that sometimes he  receives e-mails with OCS issues that he tries to resolve based on  experiences he gathered while deployed in Afghanistan. Additionally,  three of the six Marine Corps component commands, including Marine  Corps Forces Central Command, have identified some OCS-related  issues from exercises like Eager Lion in Jordan. six Air Force component commands we interviewed provided us with  examples of contracting issues; however, according to officials, few if any  noncontracting OCS issues had been collected.", "Exercise Eager Lion is a multilateral exercise held annually since 2011 where coalition  forces conduct a live-fire, counterattack operation at a range near Jebel Petra, Jordan.

According to these officials, this decision was made because  of a lack of awareness of OCS issues. Furthermore, U.S. Army South  officials noted that part of the challenge of collecting OCS issues from  exercises comes from a lack of understanding of OCS.", "In June 2014, a DOD task force on contractor logistics in support of  contingency operations found that strategic leadership across the  department did not recognize OCS as a critical component of combat  readiness. One reason for the general lack of awareness of OCS issues  stems from not having DOD-level guidance that establishes military  service and component command roles and responsibilities regarding  collection of OCS issues. While existing lessons-learned guidance\u2014like  Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction 3150.25E\u2014identifies the  importance of enhancing capabilities by collecting issues in broad terms,  it does not list any specific capabilities such as OCS.

As previously discussed, in addition to the JLLP, the services  also have established service-specific lessons-learned programs and  processes in support of the JLLP. However, according to officials from Air  Force and Marine Corps component commands in Europe and Africa, the  lack of service-specific guidance on OCS affects the commands\u2019  understanding of OCS roles and responsibilities, to include their collection  of OCS issues as part of lessons-learned processes.", "In February 2013, based on our finding that the Navy, Marine Corps, and  Air Force lacked comprehensive OCS guidance, we recommended that  they develop guidance, which would include the requirement to plan for  OCS. DOD concurred with our recommendation and has tasked the  military services with issuing OCS guidance by the second quarter of  fiscal year 2015. The Army developed OCS guidance in 2010 and 2011.  Additionally, the Marine Corps has developed draft OCS guidance that is  in the review process and is expected to be issued in the spring 2015.  According to Navy officials, the Navy expects to issue its OCS guidance  by the first quarter of fiscal year 2016. However, Air Force officials have  not indicated whether the Air Force will meet DOD\u2019s deadline as it  continues to work to identify a lead to integrate and synchronize OCS  issues. While we continue to believe that comprehensive service-wide  guidance for these services is needed to further the integration of OCS  into all of the services\u2019 planning, our prior recommendation did not  address the issue of the services\u2019 roles and responsibilities for the  collection of OCS issues as part of a lessons-learned process.  Furthermore, according to DOD officials, it is unclear whether future OCS  service-wide guidance from the Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force will  include roles and responsibilities for the collection of OCS issues. By not  including the services\u2019 roles and responsibilities to collect OCS issues in  comprehensive service-specific guidance, the services and the service  component commands may not fully understand the importance of their  roles in collecting OCS issues as part of their specific service\u2019s lessons- learned processes. As a result, commanders may be unable to build on  efficiencies that their services have identified by collecting OCS issues  and may be unable to adequately plan for the use of contractor support.", "According to DOD officials, another reason that the military services and  their component commands lack awareness of OCS and therefore the  importance of collecting OCS issues is that senior service members\u2014that  is, commanders and senior leaders\u2014do not have an OCS training  requirement. According to DOD\u2019s Joint Concept for OCS, developing a  skilled cadre of multidisciplinary military and civilian personnel with  specialized OCS training and experience is one part of a holistic solution  required to achieve a cultural change to integrate OCS throughout  institutional and operational processes. However, according to senior  service officials there is a lack of awareness of OCS at the leadership  level within their services or component commands, which can be  attributed to inadequate OCS training. According to these officials, OCS  training can help improve commanders\u2019 and senior leaders\u2019 awareness of  OCS issues. For example, service members who attended the Joint  Staff\u2019s Joint OCS Planning and Execution Course generally praised it,  noting that prior to attending the course they had a limited understanding  of OCS issues. However, while the Joint Staff offers the Joint OCS  Planning and Execution Course as an opportunity to educate senior  service members from the geographic combatant commands, military  services, and service component command on OCS, according to senior  Joint Staff officials, the course attendance of senior service members  outside of the logistics functional area has been limited. According to a  senior Joint Staff official, the initial approach for the Joint OCS Planning  and Execution Course was to reach a broad audience as well as to  provide OCS training to those that needed it the most. However, the  official added that DOD needs to find a more-permanent training solution  for OCS. The department also offers several online courses about OCS,  but they are also electives, and none of the services has an OCS training  requirement to take any of these existing courses.

It also  provides guidance on matters such as OCS organization command and  control. For example, the new version of Joint Publication 4-10  recommends the establishment of a permanent OCS integration cell at  each geographic combatant command to perform contract-support  integration and to provide oversight of any subordinate joint force  command contract-integration cell when formed. The development of  this concept, according to Joint Publication 4-10, was a direct outgrowth  from experiences in Afghanistan.

The joint course, which is targeted at  officers, senior noncommissioned officers, and government civilians  focuses primarily on operational-level OCS staff responsibilities and tasks  during military operations. Moreover, based on information from a  Reverse Collection and Analysis Team, the Army identified that it lacked  personnel that could provide primarily tactical-level OCS capabilities for  units.

The October 2013 OCS Joint Concept  outlined a plan to designate a proponent that would, among things,  manage the OCS lessons-learned process to ensure the latest lessons  and best practices from the field are recorded to ensure that capability  requirements and content across DOD\u2019s institutional processes are  consistent. According to the plan, this proponent would establish and  maintain the OCS joint lessons-learned process to collect, catalog, and  validate observations, insights, and lessons from operations and  exercises. Furthermore, the services, geographic combatant commands,  and the combat service agencies would work collaboratively with the  proponent to ensure issues and lessons learned are entered into the  process. Additionally, a June 2014 report from the Defense Science  Board also recommended that the department establish a 3-star- equivalent, director-level proponent that would coordinate OCS efforts  across the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the Joint Staff, the military  departments, and the defense agencies, and support efforts to resource  critical OCS-related requirements across these organizations. The  report recommended that this proponent oversee the creation of a visible  and transparent knowledge-management system for OCS that links  planning, requirements, contracting, and audit functions.", "Several officials we spoke with expressed support for an OCS joint  proponent with lessons-learned responsibilities.

Additionally, Joint Staff (J-4)  officials noted that the OCS lessons-learned process has many owners  and lacks a singular point of focus. They added that OCS in general can  become compartmentalized among the defense agencies, military  services, and combatant commands. However, according to officials,  since the community is relatively small currently, they prefer to talk and  share relevant information informally rather than through the JLLP  process. Army lessons-learned officials stated that the OCS lessons- learned community is disjointed and lacks synchronization, and stated  that a joint proponent with lessons-learned responsibilities is the next  logical step in institutionalizing OCS in the department.

In August  2012, U.S. Pacific Command officials used this issue and others to inform  the development of U.S. Pacific Command Instruction 0601.7 on OCS,  which included planning considerations and procedures for establishing a  Joint Theater Support Contracting Command, and a month later,  cohosted a rehearsal-of-concept drill with the Joint Staff (J-4). The  objectives of the rehearsal-of-concept drill included testing and adjusting  tactics, techniques, and procedures developed by the Joint Staff (J-4) and  the methodology for establishing and manning a Joint Theater Support  Contracting Command.

As a result, U.S.  Pacific Command\u2019s resolution involving the development and issuance of  U.S. Pacific Command Instruction 0601.7 was neither entered into JLLIS  nor shared through JLLIS so that other geographic combatant commands  encountering similar challenges could view it. Similarly, U.S. Southern  Command entered issues collected from exercises and operations into  JLLIS, but used processes outside of JLLIS to resolve OCS issues. As  the JLLP\u2019s system of record, JLLIS facilitates the collaborative resolution  of lessons learned to improve the development and readiness of the joint  force. For instance, the lessons-learned process provides DOD  organizations with a joint lesson memorandum, a tool that may be used  by organizations\u2019 leadership to inform the Joint Staff of lessons requiring  their analysis and resolution. However, U.S. Southern Command officials  stated that they have used means such as the Program Budget Review  process, or even phone calls to communicate OCS issues and shortfalls  to the Joint Staff, but that no issues have been forwarded to the Joint  Staff through the formal issue-resolution process.", "The geographic combatant commands also enter OCS issues into JLLIS  at different rates.

As a result, the Army\u2019s Acquisition, Logistics and Technology- Integration Office developed and currently administers an OCS lessons- learned portal on the Army Lessons Learned Information System to  create a primary system to input OCS issues and ensure that OCS  lessons learned are shared within the system. However, the Navy, Marine  Corps, and Air Force are not generally collecting OCS issues, and  therefore, not generally sharing OCS issues in JLLIS.

This report  examines the extent to which (1) the geographic combatant commands  and the services collect OCS issues to develop lessons learned; (2) DOD  has a focal point for integrating OCS issues from the Joint Lessons  Learned Program (JLLP); and (3) DOD organizations use the Joint  Lessons Learned Information System (JLLIS) to share OCS issues and  lessons learned. To address these objectives, we excluded OCS issues  and lessons learned from the acquisition community\u2014for example,  contracting officers. According to Joint Publication 4-10, the Director of  Defense Procurement and Acquisition Policy is responsible for developing  and implementing a DOD-wide contingency contracting\u2013related lessons- learned program and ensuring validated lessons from this program are  disseminated and incorporated into relevant Defense Acquisition  University instruction.", "To determine the extent to which the geographic combatant commands  and the services collect OCS issues to develop lessons learned, we  reviewed guidance to understand the roles and responsibilities of these  DOD entities regarding the collection of OCS issues and compared them  with the information we collected during our interviews to identify the  extent to which the geographic combatant commands and the services  collect OCS issues. Specifically, we reviewed the relevant provisions in  part 158 of Title 32 of the Code of Federal Regulations and DOD  Instruction 3020.41, which establish policy, assign responsibilities, and  provide procedures for OCS, including OCS program management,  contract support integration, and integration of defense contractor   We  personnel into contingency operations outside the United States. also reviewed Joint Publication 4-10, which provides joint doctrine for  planning, executing, and managing OCS in all phases of joint operations.", "32 C.F.R. pt. 158; Department of Defense Instruction 3020.41, Operational Contract  Support (OCS) (Dec. 20, 2011).", "Additionally, we reviewed Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction  3150.25E, which establishes policy, guidance, and responsibilities for the  JLLP, to understand the established lessons-learned process.  Furthermore, to understand how OCS should be integrated into the  geographic combatant commands\u2019 training systems and plans, we  reviewed joint training guidance, such as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of  Staff Instruction 3500.01H and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  Notice 3500.01. Additionally, we reviewed the Joint Concept for OCS,  which is intended to guide OCS capability development for the Joint  Force 2020. In addition to joint guidance, we reviewed military department  and service guidance, such as Army Regulation 11-33, Air Force  Instruction 90-1601, Office of the Chief of Naval Operations Instruction  3500.37C, and Marine Corps Order 3504.1, to identify any military  department- or service-specific policies, guidance, and responsibilities for  the collection of issues. We also interviewed OCS and lessons-learned  officials from all six geographic combatant commands, all of the  associated military service component commands, and the Army, the  Navy, the Air Force, and the Marine Corps to discuss their roles and  responsibilities regarding the collection of OCS issues. We visited all six  geographic combatant commands to conduct our interviews with them.", "To determine the extent to which DOD has a focal point for integrating  OCS issues learned from the JLLP, we reviewed related GAO reports on  OCS, as well as related reports issued by the Office of the Under  Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics, OCS  Functional Capabilities Integration Board, and the Center for Army  Lessons Learned. Furthermore, we reviewed the Joint Contingency  Acquisition Support Office\u2019s (JCASO) OCS issue collection documents\u2014 presentation and reports\u2014to understand the scope of its efforts to  integrate OCS lessons learned into doctrine, policy, training, and  education. We compared guidance, such as relevant provisions in part  158 of Title 32 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Chairman of the Joint  Chiefs of Staff Instruction 3150.25E, DOD Instruction 3020.41, Joint  Publication 4-10, and charters for the OCS Functional Capabilities  Integration Board, with DOD\u2019s process for the integration of OCS lessons  learned. Additionally, we interviewed officials from the Joint Staff and  JCASO, which participate in the process of integrating OCS lessons  learned in doctrine, policy, training, and education and informing OCS  policy and recommending solutions, respectively. We also interviewed  officials specifically focused on integrating OCS department-wide, such  as officials from the Operational Contract Support Functional Capabilities  Integration Board, to obtain their perspective on the progress the  department has made in integrating OCS. In addition to these officials, we  interviewed officials from each of the services\u2014Army, Navy, Air Force,  and Marine Corps\u2014to gain an understanding of how each service has  integrated OCS lessons learned from the JLLP. We compared this  information to federal internal-control standards that state a good internal- control environment requires that the agency\u2019s organizational structure  clearly define key areas of authority and responsibility and establish  appropriate lines of reporting.", "To determine the extent to which DOD organizations have used JLLIS to  share OCS issues and lessons learned, we collected and analyzed  documentation, such as guidance related to the dissemination of OCS  issues and lessons learned. Specifically, we reviewed Chairman of the  Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction 3150.25E, which establishes policy,  guidance, and responsibilities for the JLLP, to identify the roles and  responsibilities of commanders to share OCS issues and lessons learned  and identify the JLLP system of record for sharing those issues and  lessons learned. Additionally, we participated in a demonstration of JLLIS  led by the Joint Staff (J-7) to understand and observe JLLIS\u2019s function as  an information-sharing system, specifically its search and cataloging  capabilities. Due to the OCS responsibilities identified in DOD guidance,  we also interviewed officials from the Joint Staff (J-4), geographic  combatant commands, each of the services, and their respective service  component commands to obtain their perspective on JLLIS for sharing  OCS issues and lessons learned. To determine the extent to which DOD  organizations have used JLLIS to share OCS issues and lessons learned,  we interviewed officials from the aforementioned organizations to gain an  understanding of how each organization shares OCS issues and lessons  learned.
