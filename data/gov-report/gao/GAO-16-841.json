The military services have reported persistently low readiness levels, which they have attributed to emerging and continued demands on their forces, reduced force structure, and increased frequency and length of deployments. For example, the Air Force experienced a 58 percent decrease in the number of fighter and bomber squadrons from 1991 to 2015 while maintaining a persistent level of demand from the combatant commands for the use of its forces. In addition, the Navy has experienced an 18 percent decrease in its fleet of ships since 1998 and an increase in demand, resulting in the deployment lengths for many ships increasing from 7 months to a less sustainable 9 months. DOD officials have indicated that overall demand has been decreasing since 2013, but the department has reported that the ability to rebuild capability and capacity is hindered by continued demand for some forces. To mitigate the impact of continued deployments on readiness, the Joint Staff has focused on balancing the distribution of forces for high-priority missions with the need to rebuild the readiness of the force. Efforts include revising major plans to better reflect what the current and planned force is expected to achieve and improving the management of DOD's process for sourcing global demands by, among other things, balancing the supply of forces with the minimum required to meet global demands. However, it is too soon to tell what impact implementation of these initiatives will have on DOD's readiness recovery efforts because the department is still working to complete implementation.", "DOD has stated that readiness rebuilding is a priority, but implementation and oversight of department-wide readiness rebuilding efforts have not fully included key elements of sound planning, putting the rebuilding efforts at risk. Key elements of sound planning for results-oriented outcomes include a mission statement supported by long-term goals, strategies for achieving the goals, metrics, and an evaluation plan to determine the appropriateness of the goals and effectiveness of implemented strategies. In 2014, DOD tasked the military services to develop plans for rebuilding readiness. Each service developed a plan based on the force elements that were experiencing a high pace of deployments or facing challenges in achieving readiness recovery. In 2015, the services reported their readiness rebuilding plans to DOD, which identified readiness goals and timeframes for achieving them, but these goals were incomplete and some of the timeframes have been extended. GAO found that the services have also not defined comprehensive strategies, with the resources required for achieving the identified goals, nor have they fully assessed the effect of external factors such as maintenance and training on readiness rebuilding goals. Moreover, the services have not fully established metrics that the department can use to oversee readiness rebuilding efforts and evaluate progress towards achieving the identified goals.

Consequently, DOD has made rebuilding the  readiness of the military force one of the department\u2019s priorities and has  outlined this priority in a key strategic guidance document. Specifically,  the Guidance for the Employment of the Force states that it is an  overarching priority of the department to recover service readiness to  preserve the long-term health of the force. In addition, the 2015 National  Military Strategy suggests that DOD has consumed readiness as quickly  as it has been generated for nearly a generation and that the department  is taking action to better balance achieving immediate operational goals  with improving readiness for potential future contingencies.", "The high pace of operations has created challenges for the all-volunteer  force in its ability to respond to current demands. The global security  environment will likely continue to require significant reliance on U.S.  military forces to respond to a range of demands even as the department  faces a period of budget constraints including across-the-board spending  reductions through sequestration and force structure reductions.

These time frames were selected to maximize  available and reliable data and to determine meaningful trends. In  addition, we interviewed officials from the Joint Staff and the six  geographic combatant commands to discuss global demand, and we  obtained and analyzed data on the global demand for forces from the  Joint Staff. We assessed the reliability of readiness data and global  demand data through the use of standard questionnaires, reviews of  service and department-level documentation, and through discussions  with service-level officials on data collection processes and Joint Staff  officials on global demand reform efforts.

We evaluated the extent to which the services face  challenges in meeting their stated readiness recovery goals within the  time frames identified by analyzing service documents and interviewing  service officials and operational units. We selected several key force  elements from each service to complete a more detailed, though non- generalizable, case study assessment on plans for rebuilding readiness  of specific force elements. We interviewed Office of the Secretary of  Defense and Joint Staff officials to discuss DOD\u2019s role in the readiness  rebuilding effort and changes being implemented to allow the services to  better focus on rebuilding their readiness.

Even as the Army has brought forces back from  Afghanistan, the Army faces increasing emergent demands that strain  existing capacity, such as the deployment of the 101st Airborne  Division in Africa to respond to the Ebola crisis. In addition, other  factors contribute to readiness challenges, including a lack of  familiarity among leaders and units with the ability to conduct  collective training towards core competencies because the Army  focused on counterinsurgency for many years. Finally, the Army is  downsizing to an end strength of 980,000\u2014about a 12 percent  reduction in size. Army leadership testified in March 2015 that any  end strength reductions below this level would reduce the Army\u2019s  capability to support missions identified in defense guidance.", "The Navy attributes its persistently low readiness level to increased  lengths of deployments for aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers, and  amphibious ships, which has created significant maintenance  challenges. The Navy currently has 272 ships, a decrease from 333  ships in 1998\u2014an 18 percent decrease. Even as the number of Navy  ships has decreased, the number of ships deployed overseas has  remained roughly constant at about 100 ships. Consequently, each  ship is being deployed more to maintain the same level of presence.  In addition, the Navy has had to shorten, eliminate, or defer training  and maintenance periods to support high deployment rates.", "The Air Force attributes its decline in readiness to continued demands  and a reduced force structure.

DOD uses the assignment of forces to provide the combatant  commanders a base set of forces in support of both enduring and  emergent requirements, thereby potentially mitigating risk.

For example, the Navy included ballistic missile submarines,  carrier strike groups, amphibious ready groups, large surface combatants,  attack submarines, and patrol aircraft. As part of their initial effort, the  services had set goals and time frames for achieving readiness recovery.  However, by the time of our review, many of the goals had been changed  and time frames had been extended. Table 2 outlines the key force  elements that the services\u2019 readiness recovery plans are based on and  the goals and time frames for the plans.", "Inconsistencies exist in the individual service readiness recovery goals  and in the time frames for achieving them because of DOD\u2019s decision to  direct the services to develop their own respective readiness recovery  plans without validating them to ensure that they are complete,  comprehensive, and reflect the department\u2019s priorities. For example, the  services established readiness recovery goals, but these goals are only  for portions of the force in each service. For instance, the Army  established specific readiness recovery goals for five force elements  (Brigade Combat Teams, Combat Aviation Brigades, Division  Headquarters, Patriot Battalions, and Terminal High Altitude Area  Defense Batteries). Also, the Army set readiness recovery goals for a  large portion of its overall active component non-brigade Combat Team  force and segments of its active-duty and Army National Guard Brigade  Combat Teams, but these goals do not capture the entirety of the force.  Moreover, the time frames that the services identified for achieving  readiness recovery goals have been extended by some services since  the plans were initially established in 2015; services extended the goals  primarily because of the services\u2019 inability to achieve initially identified  goals with the strategies they outlined.", "Additionally, each service has either established or is working to establish  strategies for helping achieve readiness recovery goals, but we found that  some strategies are not comprehensive or complete. For example:", "Readiness recovery for the Navy is premised on successful  implementation of the Optimized Fleet Response Plan. This plan  seeks to provide a more sustainable force-generation model for Navy  ships, as it reduces deployment lengths and injects more predictability  for maintenance and training into ship schedules. According to Navy  policy, this framework establishes a readiness-generation cycle that  operationally and administratively aligns forces while aligning and  stabilizing manning, maintenance and modernization, logistics,  inspections and evaluations, and training. As of April 2016, the Navy  had established optimized schedules for five of the six elements of the  fleet and had plans to complete the remaining schedule for  Amphibious Ready Groups before the end of May 2016.", "The Army\u2019s strategy to achieve readiness goals is evolving, but as  yet, incomplete. A key aspect of this strategy is to develop and  implement a new force generation model called \u201csustainable  readiness,\u201d which the Army expects to implement in fiscal year 2017.  The Army expects this model will provide increased predictability and  visibility to optimize unit rotations and sustain readiness when units  are not deployed. Additionally, the Army expects the model to  generate more combat power and enabling capability given available  resources, as well as to help define readiness goals.", "The Air Force strategy to rebuild readiness is predicated on conditions  of consistent funding and decreasing operational demand. Without  these two conditions being met, the Air Force has stated that  readiness will not improve significantly. For example, the Air Force  identified five influencers of future readiness, which are (1) operational  tempos, as reflected in the ratio of deployment-to-dwell; (2) flying hour  program; (3) critical skills availability, or having the right personnel for  each position; (4) weapons system sustainment; and (5) training  resource availability. Each of these influencers is affected by  operational demand or consistent funding. The Air Force regularly  measures its ability to increase its readiness using the five  influencers. The Air Force found that while problems with any one  area could lead to serious readiness problems, improvement required  balanced efforts across all five areas.", "The Marine Corps does not yet have a measurable readiness goal  with an analytical basis, or a specific strategy to meet its current  overall readiness goal. The Marine Corps focuses on five institutional  pillars of readiness, which include high quality people, unit readiness,  capacity to meet combatant commander needs, infrastructure  sustainment, and equipment modernization. In addition, the Marine  Corps has established specific strategies to achieve goals developed  for certain communities, such as aviation. For example, the Marine  Corps issued the Ready Basic Aircraft Recovery Plan and 2016  Marine Aviation Plan in an effort to mitigate current readiness  challenges and recover future readiness for the aviation community."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Service Readiness Recovery Plans Do Not Fully Consider Resources Needed to Achieve Goals", "paragraphs": ["In overseeing readiness rebuilding efforts, neither the Office of the Under  Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness nor the Readiness  DMAG has required that the services fully identify the resources required  to support achievement of service-identified goals. A viable readiness  recovery effort will require both DOD and the services to develop and  agree on goals that can guide the efforts of the joint force, and clearly  establish strategies that will result in the achievement of the goals. DOD  has acknowledged challenges with funding, accepting that it is a  constrained resource. However, the department has not identified the  resources needed to fully implement readiness rebuilding efforts, and  thus does not know what achieving readiness recovery will cost.", "In addition, adding funding may not help the services recover the  readiness of their forces in some cases. For example, the Air Force\u2019s  Guardian Angel Weapon System, within the Personnel Recovery service  core function area, is lacking experienced active-duty pararescue jumpers  to meet combatant commander demand. To mitigate this problem, the  Air Force continues to recruit new pararescue jumpers, but currently the  least experienced personnel are filled well over authorized amounts, while  mid-career personnel, who are required on all deployments and are  needed to mentor and train new personnel, are filled at about half of their  authorized amounts. Additional funding is not going to help the rebuilding  efforts in the near term, as the units need time\u2014about 7 years\u2014to  develop the least experienced personnel into mid-career and most  experienced personnel, according to Air Force officials. In addition, the  Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Vice Chief of Naval Operations,  and the Assistant Commandant of the Marine Corps have all testified that  DOD will not be able to address readiness problems with money alone,  but that factors such as operational requirements and time must also be  considered.", "For each service, the resource requirements needed to fully implement  readiness recovery will vary by force element. For some force elements,  the services understand the barriers to rebuilding readiness and in some  cases have estimated portions of the expected costs. For example, we  found that the Navy has estimated that total ordnance shortfalls across its  aircraft carrier, cruiser, and destroyer force amount to at least $3.3 billion  for items such as torpedoes and guided missiles, which are needed to  fully achieve readiness recovery. In some cases, however, the services  have not quantified or budgeted for the full costs of achieving identified  readiness goals for specific segments of the force because readiness  recovery goals have not been established. For example, lacking clearly  established readiness recovery goals for the non-Brigade Combat Team  portion of the National Guard and for the entirety of the Army Reserve,  the Army is unable to identify the resources that would be required to  achieve such goals. In addition, the Marine Corps has not articulated a  measurable readiness recovery goal with any analytical basis, and as  such, is not able to identify the resources needed to achieve that goal."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "External Factors: Service Readiness Recovery Plans Are Based on Assumptions That Have Not Fully Considered the Impact of External Factors", "paragraphs": ["Another key element of sound planning is understanding key factors that  are external and beyond agency control that could significantly affect  achievement of long-term goals.

Based on our work, we found assumptions in three  areas that are also questionable: (1) availability of funding, (2) ability to  complete maintenance on time, and (3) whether operational tempo and  other factors will allow sufficient time for training."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Uncertainty About Funding", "paragraphs": ["DOD has reported that time and sufficient, consistent, and predictable  resourcing are needed to allow the services to rebuild readiness. In an  effort to help the services improve their readiness, Congress appropriated  $1 billion in overseas contingency operations funds in 2016 that were  designated for use in readiness improvement efforts. Like the rest of the  federal government, however, DOD faces across-the-board spending  reductions through sequestration. We previously examined the effects  of sequestration on DOD, noting that the department placed an emphasis  on preserving readiness when implementing spending reductions, but still  expected sequestration to affect plans to improve military readiness by  either delaying or cancelling activities. For example, we found that the Air  Force cancelled or reduced participation in most of its planned large-scale  fiscal year 2013 training events. Moreover, like much of the government,  DOD has been funded through continuing resolutions, which create  uncertainty about both when they will receive their final appropriation and  what level of funding ultimately will be available. Recognizing these  challenges, the Air Force cited funding levels for modernization and  recapitalization as a risk to achieving readiness recovery within identified  time frames, the Army noted that if sequestration were to return without a  commensurate change to DOD\u2019s strategy, the impact would be  devastating to Army readiness, and the Navy noted that stable and  consistent funding is key to implementing the Optimized Fleet Response  Plan, which is the Navy\u2019s plan to rebuild readiness."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Inability to Meet Maintenance Time Frames", "paragraphs": ["Readiness recovery is premised on the services being able to meet  maintenance time frames, but most of the services expect continued  challenges in doing so. For example, over the last 5 years, shipyards  have not completed the majority of required maintenance on time,  primarily because high deployment rates have led to shortened,  eliminated, or deferred maintenance periods and a growth in maintenance  backlogs. In May 2016, we found that from fiscal years 2011 through  2014, 89 percent of aircraft carrier maintenance periods took more time  than scheduled, which also increased the costs. Recognizing these  challenges, the Navy implemented the Optimized Fleet Response Plan in  2014 in order to provide a more sustainable schedule for ships,  introducing more predictability for maintenance and training. The Navy\u2019s  readiness recovery goal of 2020 assumes successful implementation of  the Optimized Fleet Response Plan. With only a portion of the fleet  having entered this optimized cycle, it is too early to assess its  effectiveness, but as we previously found, the first three aircraft carriers  have not completed maintenance tasks on time, and of the 83 cruisers  and destroyers, only 15 have completed a Chief of Naval Operations  maintenance availability under the Optimized Fleet Response Plan.

However, the high pace of  deployments, reduced time at home station, and reduced funding for  conducting full-spectrum training has had an effect on individual units\u2019  ability to train and fully recover readiness. For example, the Army has  stated that one of its greatest challenges inhibiting readiness recovery is  difficulty maintaining collective training proficiency in its core  competencies due to a lack of personnel depth and experience. Because  the Army converted almost all Combat Training Center rotations between  2003 and 2012 to focus on counterinsurgency, opportunities to train  thousands of company commanders, field grade officers, and battalion  commanders on their unit\u2019s core competency missions were lost. A key  part of the Army\u2019s plan is to ensure that these soldiers have repeated full  spectrum training experience at combat training centers over the next  several years. However, the Army projects increasing emergent demand  that may jeopardize the Army\u2019s ability to achieve this. In addition, high  deployment rates for Air Force units have resulted in less time for units to  complete their full training requirements. According to Air Force officials,  high deployment rates mean there are fewer aircraft available to train on  at home stations, and often the most experienced personnel are  disproportionally deployed, leaving fewer experienced personnel available  to train less experienced personnel at home stations. Moreover, the Air  Force reported that the availability of training ranges, munitions for  training, and training simulators, among others, were key factors for  readiness rebuilding. The service has reported that while the training  resource availability is relatively healthy in terms of operation and  maintenance funding, substantial funding is required to address long-term  investment shortfalls."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Metrics and Evaluating Progress: DOD and the Services Track Readiness Trends, but Most of the Services Have Not Established Metrics and DOD Has Not Developed a Method to Evaluate Progress Toward Achieving Readiness Recovery", "paragraphs": ["An element of sound planning is developing a set of metrics that will be  applied to gauge progress toward attainment of the plan\u2019s long-term  goals.

Rather, officials told us that the Army planned to use its process for  regularly tracking, reporting, and projecting readiness to measure  progress towards achieving readiness recovery, which includes  periodic reports on readiness. Part of the process includes regularly  monitoring the percentage of Brigade Combat Team and non-Brigade  Combat Team units reporting the highest levels of readiness.  However, the Army\u2019s process does not set interim benchmarks for  readiness recovery.
