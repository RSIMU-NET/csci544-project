No. 111-139 requires GAO to conduct routine investigations to identify programs, agencies, offices, and initiatives with duplicative goals and activities. In that context, GAO reviewed (1) the extent to which the Department of Transportation\u0092s (DOT) and Department of Energy\u0092s (DOE) assessment process helps ensure advisory group efforts are not duplicative and what challenges, if any, exist in assessing potential duplication, and (2) to what extent DOT and DOE advisory groups are useful in assisting their respective agencies in carrying out their missions and how the groups\u0092 usefulness could be enhanced.

However, GAO found that DOT and DOE\u0092s processes for assessing duplication are often informal, and neither agency has specific steps identified for making such an assessment. Using an informal approach without specific steps makes it more likely that agency assessments for duplication will be inconsistent or incomplete. In addition, while basic information about the 15 DOT and 21 DOE fiscal year 2010 FACA advisory groups is publicly available in the FACA database, including designated points of contact and the objectives of the groups, no such information is readily available for non-FACA advisory groups. This limits the agencies\u0092 ability to fully assess the universe of advisory groups for particular topic areas. DOT and DOE officials faced some challenges identifying and collecting information for the 19 DOT and 33 DOE non-FACA advisory groups GAO reviewed, relying on various sources and Internet searches to gather basic information, since neither agency maintains an inventory of its non-FACA advisory groups and their activities. In addition, advisory groups often address complex and highly technical issues that span across agencies. For example, one advisory group GAO identified focused on experimental and theoretical research in nuclear physics. Agency officials familiar with these types of technical topic areas and other potential stakeholders covering these same topics are best positioned to assess the potential for unnecessary duplication and would be even better positioned to do so if the departments develop specific assessment steps and enhance the visibility of non-FACA advisory groups.", "DOT and DOE advisory groups can be effective tools for agencies to gather input on topics of interest by informing agency leaders about issues of importance to the agencies\u0092 missions, consolidating input from multiple sources, and providing input at a relatively low cost. To further review the usefulness of advisory groups, GAO conducted case studies on five DOT and DOE FACA and non-FACA advisory groups and identified several practices that could enhance the usefulness of these advisory groups and, in some cases, also help avoid duplication. These practices include the following:", "securing clear agency commitment,", "finding a balance between responsiveness to the agency and independence,", "leveraging resources through collaboration with similar groups, and", "evaluating the group\u0092s usefulness to identify future directions for the group or actions to improve its usefulness.", "The practices identified can help agencies leverage the advice produced by advisory groups to more efficiently and effectively address topics of importance to the agencies.

There are more than 1,000 advisory groups established  under the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA advisory groups) and  an unknown number of other advisory groups not subject to FACA (non- FACA advisory groups) among the miscellaneous bodies that agencies  routinely use to obtain input and recommendations from diverse  perspectives on a wide range of issues. Congress mandated that GAO  conduct routine investigations to identify programs, agencies, offices, and  initiatives with duplicative goals and activities. Such duplication can  waste scarce federal resources and result in less efficient and effective  federal efforts. In fiscal year 2010, there were 1,046 FACA advisory  groups governmentwide, with agency-reported, annual, direct costs of  approximately $387 million. While the full costs of FACA and non-FACA  advisory group activities are unknown and may not be large compared  with other agency expenditures, the wide use of these advisory groups\u2014 which may examine related topics\u2014raises the potential for duplication  among these groups\u2019 efforts. Agency officials devote time and resources  to manage, participate in, and respond to advisory group activities and  recommendations, and it is important that advisory groups are used  efficiently and effectively, particularly given continuing fiscal pressures.", "In light of these issues, we examined (1) the extent to which the  Department of Transportation\u2019s (DOT) and Department of Energy\u2019s (DOE)  assessment process helps ensure advisory group efforts are not  duplicative and what challenges, if any, exist in assessing potential  duplication, and (2) to what extent DOT and DOE advisory groups are  useful in assisting their respective agencies in carrying out their missions  and how the groups\u2019 usefulness could be enhanced.", "To address our objectives, we selected two agencies\u2014DOT and DOE\u2014 and developed and applied a methodology to better understand how their  advisory groups function. We selected DOT and DOE based on  knowledge of these agencies\u2019 advisory groups and because they  represented two federal agencies working on a range of issues and topics  with a similar number of FACA advisory groups. To identify DOT and  DOE FACA advisory groups, agency officials verified the active fiscal year   To assess  2010 FACA advisory groups identified in the FACA database.the reliability of the FACA database, we reviewed existing documentation  and database use protocols and interviewed knowledgeable agency  officials about the data. FACA groups are any advisory groups, with  limited exceptions, that are established or utilized by a federal agency  and that have at least one member who is not a federal employee.  Because there is no single uniform definition of non-FACA advisory  groups, we developed a definition to identify these groups and relied on  DOT and DOE officials to identify groups that met the definition. For our  work, non-FACA advisory groups are defined as: \u201cgroups active in fiscal  year 2010 that serve primarily an advisory function and provide input to  the agency and/or component agency offices on areas related to the  agency or office\u2019s mission. These groups may have a mix of federal and  non-federal members, and are established to provide advice or  recommendations on issues or policies pertaining to the agency or its  components.\u201d Non-FACA advisory groups are not subject to FACA for a  variety of reasons, including statutory language that excludes a group or  membership consisting entirely of federal government employees. To  assess the extent to which DOT\u2019s and DOE\u2019s assessment process helps  ensure advisory group efforts are not duplicative, and to determine what  challenges may exist in assessing potential duplication, we identified and  gathered information for the 88 DOT and DOE advisory groups active in  fiscal year 2010 and reviewed 47 for potential duplication, overlap, and  fragmentation. Specifically, we selected these 47 groups by focusing on  the most common advisory group issue areas for DOT and DOE, which  were aviation and energy, respectively. For these groups, we reviewed  charters and other agency-provided documentation to help determine with  more specificity the types of issues or topics the groups cover. We then  selected those groups that focus on common issues or topic areas for  further analysis and interviewed agency officials involved in the selected  groups with potential overlap or fragmentation in these broad areas to  better understand whether in fact the groups\u2019 efforts were potentially  duplicative. In addition, we collected information from DOT and DOE to  determine any internal agency processes used to determine duplication,  overlap, or fragmentation and the extent to which there was an  awareness of other FACA or non-FACA advisory groups within the  agency or governmentwide that focused on the same issues as their  groups. To review the usefulness of DOT and DOE advisory groups in  assisting their respective agencies in carrying out their mission, and to  identify practices to enhance their usefulness or help avoid duplication,  we conducted case studies on three FACA and two non-FACA advisory  groups. We judgmentally selected these advisory groups to obtain a mix  of characteristics, including the agency they advise, how the group was  established, and whether they generated reports or recommendations.  For each case study, we reviewed relevant documentation and  interviewed agency officials, advisory group members, and third party or  industry stakeholders to obtain perspectives on the group\u2019s usefulness.  For example, we asked about how helpful the group was at assisting the  agency in carrying out its mission, the impact the group or its products  had on the agency, and the value added by the group. To understand the  extent to which advisory groups provided input on topics of importance to  their respective agencies\u2019 missions, we developed criteria and gathered  information on a selection of FACA and non-FACA advisory groups by  reviewing information from the FACA database for the 36 actively  chartered DOT and DOE FACA advisory groups and interviewing agency  officials for both FACA and non-FACA advisory groups.", "We conducted this performance audit from January 2011 to March 2012  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

Agencies are not required to implement the advice or  recommendations of advisory groups because they are by design  advisory. While an advisory group\u2019s input or recommendations may form  the basis for a federal agency\u2019s decisions or policies, other factors may  play a role in determining what action an agency ultimately takes.  However, both types of advisory groups serve as a mechanism for federal  agencies to obtain input from internal and external stakeholders such as  academics, industry associations, or other agencies.", "FACA was enacted in 1972 in response to concerns that federal advisory  groups were proliferating without adequate review, oversight, or  accountability. The General Services Administration (GSA) Committee  Management Secretariat oversees each federal agency\u2019s management of  FACA advisory groups, develops guidelines and regulations, and  conducts an annual review of FACA advisory groups governmentwide.  For example, GSA provides guidance to federal agencies sponsoring  FACA advisory groups and is involved in the process to establish new  and oversee the management of existing FACA advisory groups. GSA  collects and makes available governmentwide FACA advisory group  information that agencies\u2014including DOT and DOE\u2014are required to  provide through a publicly accessible database each fiscal year. In  addition, each agency also develops its own policies and procedures for  following FACA requirements. For example, DOT and DOE each have  policy manuals governing the management of their FACA advisory  groups. Each agency sponsoring FACA advisory groups appoints a  Committee Management Officer responsible for overseeing compliance  with FACA requirements, and appoints to each FACA advisory group a  Designated Federal Official (DFO) responsible for attending meetings,  approving agendas, and maintaining records on costs and membership,  among other duties. Decisions regarding the establishment of new FACA  advisory groups and recommendations to terminate or continue existing  groups are made by the head of each agency based on  recommendations made by the Committee Management Officer, the DFO  assigned to each group, or other agency officials.", "FACA sets forth requirements for FACA advisory groups\u2019 formation, their  operations, and how they provide advice and recommendations to the  federal government. To help avoid duplication of resources, FACA  regulations require that the process to establish, renew, or reestablish  discretionary FACA advisory groups\u2014those established under agency  authority or authorized by statute\u2014must include an explanation stating  why the group\u2019s functions cannot be performed by the agency, another  existing group, or other means. FACA also articulates broad  requirements for balance, transparency, and independence. For example,  for transparency, a range of information is to be reported in the FACA  database, and meeting minutes and reports are to be made available to  the public. The act also requires that all FACA advisory groups have a  charter containing specific information, including the group\u2019s scope and  objectives, a description of duties, and the period of time necessary to  carry out its purposes. Charters\u2014and thus the FACA advisory groups\u2014  generally expire at the end of 2 years unless renewed by the agency, the  Congress, or executive order. This requirement was intended to  encourage agencies to periodically reexamine their need for FACA  advisory groups.", "As previously noted, not every advisory group that provides advice or  recommendations to an agency is subject to the FACA requirements. An  advisory group may not be subject to FACA for a variety of reasons,  including statutory language that may exempt a group from FACA.", "Further, certain types of groups are also exempt from FACA, including  groups not managed or controlled by the executive branch, groups with  membership consisting entirely of federal government officials, or  intergovernmental groups. Non-FACA advisory groups are generally less  formal than those established under and subject to the requirements of  FACA. Because they are not subject to FACA, non-FACA advisory  groups are not required to follow FACA requirements to hold public  meetings or to make meeting minutes and reports publicly available.  Similarly, agencies are not required to collect or report information  identifying non-FACA advisory groups, and GSA does not have any  oversight responsibilities pertaining to non-FACA advisory groups. While  there is no specific entity or office that oversees non-FACA advisory  groups, general guidance for the management of some of these groups\u2014 such as federal interagency groups\u2014may be included within the agency\u2019s  committee management policy manuals.

GSA relies on federal  agencies to follow the FACA requirement to check for duplication prior to  filing a charter to establish a new, or renew an existing, FACA advisory  group under agency authority. Furthermore, guidance for our two selected  agencies requires officials to determine whether the objectives or duties  of a proposed FACA advisory group could be achieved by an existing  entity, committee, or organization within the agency or governmentwide.  Some DOT and DOE officials told us they use the FACA database to  check for potentially duplicative advisory groups. This may be a good first  step to identifying FACA groups working on similar issues; however, it  does not necessarily provide an adequate assessment for duplication.  While the FACA database contains information on advisory group issue  areas, it is limited in its ability to directly identify related groups. For  example, a search of the FACA database in the issue area of \u201csurface  and vehicular transportation\u201d yielded approximately 60 FACA advisory  groups working across 10 federal agencies. Further, issue areas are self- identified by agency officials and may not be consistently defined across  agencies.", "We found that several agency officials were not aware of a process to  determine whether the objectives or duties of an advisory group could be  achieved by an existing entity, committee, or organization. In cases  where officials indicated they were aware of a process, when asked to  describe the process, a number described informal approaches for  checking for duplication and did not articulate consistent steps taken to  make these determinations. Several DOE officials reported that the  agency\u2019s Committee Management Office is involved and engages each  FACA advisory group\u2019s DFO to be aware of any existing entity or  committee that could achieve the objectives being proposed, but they did  not provide additional detail outlining formal steps taken to identify these  groups. DOT and DOE officials also indicated that agency officials  working in a program or issue area are generally able to identify groups  that may be addressing similar topics using their existing knowledge of  agency offices and programs. For example, some DOT officials noted that  high-level program officials are likely to be aware of other groups dealing  with an area of possible duplication and that this approach can serve as  an informal mechanism to help identify relevant advisory groups working  on related issues. However, without a process with specific steps to  check for duplication (such as reaching out to key contacts of relevant  advisory groups) assessment results may be inconsistent or incomplete.", "In contrast, one of the DOT agency offices we reviewed, the Federal  Aviation Administration (FAA) Office of Rulemaking, has a policy that  outlines specific steps agency officials should take prior to establishing a  new advisory group. This policy is specific to aviation rulemaking advisory  groups, covers both FACA and non-FACA advisory groups, and clearly  lays out the process used to determine the need for and how to establish  a new group. For instance, when an FAA office identifies an issue on  which it would be helpful to obtain advice from industry, officials decide  whether to request the standing Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee  to accept the task or to charter a new aviation rulemaking committee  based on the best fit given the specific topic or activity. The Aviation  Rulemaking Advisory Committee is a formal, standing FACA advisory  group; aviation rulemaking committees are non-FACA advisory groups  formed on an ad hoc basis, for a specific purpose, and are typically of  limited duration. One FAA official involved in these rulemaking advisory  groups noted that this guidance offers those offices establishing advisory  groups a process they can use to establish and manage their advisory  groups, a useful tool because Congress often directs FAA to use these  types of advisory groups to conduct rulemakings."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Information on DOT and DOE Non-FACA Advisory Groups Is Not Readily Available", "paragraphs": ["While readily available information on FACA advisory groups\u2014such as a  designated point of contact and description of objectives\u2014is accessible  through a centralized database managed by GSA, similar information is  not available for non-FACA advisory groups.

According to DOT officials, challenges in compiling the requested  information included identifying the agency point of contact and  locating additional descriptive information pertaining to non-FACA  advisory group activities. For example, one agency official we spoke  with relied on an Internet search engine to locate relevant information  about some of the non-FACA advisory groups. Another DOT official  was able to identify a few advisory groups based on indirect  involvement and knowledge of agency activities and programs. Of the  four DOT agency components that identified non-FACA advisory  groups for this review, only one identified these groups based on a  readily available roster. In this case, Maritime Administration officials  identified five non-FACA advisory groups using a committee roster the  agency maintains for internal purposes. This roster identifies the  names of both FACA and non-FACA groups, any subcommittees, and  primary and secondary points of contact.", "DOE officials coordinated with each of their program offices to identify  their non-FACA advisory groups based on the agreed-upon definition.  The officials told us there was some difficulty in trying to identify the  non-FACA advisory groups because basic information pertaining to  these groups is not readily available as it is for FACA advisory groups.  DOE officials told us that they had to coordinate the efforts of multiple  program offices to compile the information and noted the process was  time-consuming because there is no existing source for non-FACA  advisory group information. As a result, the program officers had to  cull much of the information for these groups from various Internet  websites.", "Because there is no way to readily identify non-FACA advisory groups  providing advice to the agencies, there is no formal source of information  enabling agency officials to conduct a comprehensive check for  potentially duplicative groups. For example, DOT officials told us that,  because they are only able to check whether a FACA advisory group  overlaps or duplicates the work of existing FACA advisory groups, they  would not necessarily be aware of potential overlap with advisory groups  not subject to FACA. DOT officials also pointed out that, given the time  and resources required to establish and manage an advisory group, there  is no incentive to maintain a FACA advisory group that duplicates the  activities of another group. However, with limited visibility over the  universe of non-FACA advisory groups, there is no assurance that  agency officials checking for duplication would know where to look or  whom to contact for additional information necessary to assess  duplication vis-\u00e0-vis those groups. This raises the risk that new advisory  groups may be created or existing groups retained that are unnecessarily  duplicative and therefore not an efficient use of agency resources.

We reviewed information on 36 DOE and DOT FACA  advisory groups and found that these groups all provided some form of  input to agencies about topics related to the agency\u2019s mission. For  example, each of the 36 FACA advisory groups had goals and topics that  were aligned with their respective agency\u2019s missions or strategic goals,  and each was engaged in activities that could help it produce advice,  such as producing reports and making formal recommendations.", "To further review the usefulness of advisory groups, we conducted case  studies on five DOT and DOE FACA and non-FACA advisory groups and  identified several practices that helped enhance the usefulness of some  of these advisory groups and, in some cases, also helped avoid  duplication (see table 1 below).

According to some EAC members, agency officials generally  identified the topic to be covered while members determined how EAC  would address the topic and sometimes identified additional topics to  cover. Officials found EAC members to be responsive to DOE needs. For  example, at DOE\u2019s suggestion, EAC began developing \u201cquick response\u201d  products to react to agency requests for information and input in lieu of  lengthier reports.

Some advisory  group members indicated that some situations may challenge members\u2019  efforts to maintain independence. For example, in one instance, members  of MTSNAC said that their sponsoring agency drafted recommendations  and asked the group to endorse them, which the group declined. The  members believed that the consensus-based recommendations they  developed were valid even if they were not the recommendations that the  agency wanted to hear. When asked for their perspectives on the group\u2019s  usefulness in general, DOT officials stated that they implemented some of  MTSNAC\u2019s recommendations and, while they did not always agree with  other recommendations, members\u2019 diverse and varied perspectives could  be useful.", "Leveraging resources through collaboration: Collaboration between an  advisory group and other groups focusing on similar topics can help  agencies spend resources efficiently, prevent unnecessary duplication,  and enhance the group\u2019s usefulness.

SGTF is a statutorily mandated non-FACA group created  primarily for the federal agencies involved in smart grid activities to  coordinate projects and priorities, and the group\u2019s members are  representatives of the relevant agencies. According to one agency  official and a third party stakeholder, SGTF\u2019s coordinating function is  useful in part because member agencies can become more aware of  ongoing or proposed activities in the federal government that may affect  their agency. Further, an agency official explained that members  contributed to the body of knowledge about smart grid activities, for  example, by collaboratively identifying common challenges for smart grid  implementation. DOE also benefits from SGTF reaching out beyond the  federal government\u2014involving states and other entities\u2014to accomplish  its purpose. For example, SGTF members are statutorily required to  coordinate with members of EAC\u2019s smart grid subcommittee, who are  nonfederal parties with interests or expertise in the smart grid. According  to DOE agency officials, SGTF and EAC members meet every few  months to discuss smart grid technological changes and developments.

For example, officials (1) collected information on  the group\u2019s accomplishments\u2014identifying the number of issues  addressed over a number of years, (2) gathered members\u2019 perspectives  on the relevance and continuation of the group, and (3) informally  considered whether the group\u2019s costs outweigh its benefits. Based on the  information gathered on ATPAC\u2019s accomplishments, officials determined  that the group\u2019s workload had decreased. For example, while the  committee resolved an average of about 16 issues per year over its first  29 years, over the last 6 years, ATPAC resolved approximately 6 issues  per year. According to agency officials, FAA and ATPAC have responded  to the change in workload by decreasing the frequency of meetings from  about four to three times a year.

However, the  advisory group environment is fluid, and the potential for duplication  exists both within and outside the agency as advisory groups are routinely  established and used, taking on new issues in response to emerging  agency needs. Therefore, assessments of whether existing advisory  groups continue to be needed or whether another body or entity may be  better suited to carry out advisory functions are important to help prevent  unnecessary duplication and inefficient use of government resources.", "FACA requirements direct agencies to check for duplication among  advisory groups, and DOT and DOE guidance incorporates these  requirements. However, neither agency\u2019s guidance includes specific  steps for assessing duplication, resulting in an informal process that is not  always comprehensive. These issues are further exacerbated by the lack  of visibility over non-FACA groups, which often address the same or  similar issues as FACA advisory groups. Advisory groups addressing  similar issues may also be housed in different agencies across  government, further complicating any assessment for duplication. While  agencies are not required to track their non-FACA advisory groups,  having available at least minimal information about non-FACA advisory  groups, as well as specific assessment steps, would help ensure more  comprehensive assessments of whether new advisory groups should be  created and existing groups should be retained.

Specifically, we reviewed the 47 groups focusing on those interest areas  most relevant to DOT and DOE\u2014using the interest area identification in  the FACA database and assigning these same interest areas to the non- FACA advisory groups\u2014ultimately identifying aviation and energy as the  most common advisory group interest areas for DOT and DOE,  respectively. We also formulated definitions for duplication, overlap, and  fragmentation using the broad definitions provided in GAO\u2019s recent work.For the FACA advisory groups, we reviewed information within the FACA  database performance measures section, their charters, and other  agency documentation; for the non-FACA advisory groups, we reviewed  agency provided descriptions and other agency documentation to help  determine with more specificity the types of issues or topics the groups  covered. We reviewed responses to a brief questionnaire sent to agency  points of contact for the 47 selected DOT and DOE groups asking the  respondents to identify, among other items, (1) any internal agency  processes used to determine duplication, overlap, or fragmentation of  proposed advisory groups with existing advisory groups and (2) their  awareness of any other FACA or non-FACA advisory group within the  agency or governmentwide that focused on the same issues as their  group.", "From these 47 advisory groups, we then selected those groups that focus  on common issues or topic areas in these broad areas for further analysis  to better understand whether in fact the groups\u2019 efforts were potentially  duplicative and interviewed agency officials in the following offices:", "DOT: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) officials within the Office  of the Deputy Administrator; Air Traffic Organization; Office of Aviation  Safety; and Office of Policy, International Affairs and Environment that  were involved in five FACA and four non-FACA advisory groups that  were identified as potentially duplicative, overlapping or fragmented;  and", "DOE: Office of the Secretary; Office of Science; Office of Health,  Safety and Security; and Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable  Energy officials that were involved in three FACA and five non-FACA  advisory groups that were identified as potentially duplicative,  overlapping, or fragmented.", "To review the usefulness of DOT and DOE advisory groups in assisting  their respective agencies in carrying out their mission, and to identify  practices to enhance their usefulness or help avoid duplication, we  conducted in-depth case studies on three FACA and two non-FACA  advisory groups.

For FACA advisory groups,  we also considered results from the performance measures section of the  FACA database, but this information was not available for non-FACA  advisory groups. For each case study, we reviewed relevant  documentation and interviewed agency officials, advisory group  members, and third party or industry stakeholders to obtain their  perspectives on the group\u2019s activities and its usefulness to the agency.  For instance, to understand the group\u2019s usefulness, we asked about how  helpful the group was at assisting the agency in carrying out its mission,  the impact the group or its products had on the agency, and the value  added by the group. For example, we met with FAA, Maritime  Administration, and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration  officials to discuss the effectiveness and usefulness of selected DOT  advisory groups.
