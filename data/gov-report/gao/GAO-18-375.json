VHA's CBOC Report is prepared by VHA central office and distributed to VISNs and VAMCs quarterly and at year-end. The CBOC Report could be useful to compare clinical quality of care between VHA-operated and contracted CBOCs, but it is inaccurate and incomplete. Specifically, VHA officials have used their judgment to classify certain sites as CBOCs in the report, rather than use the official classifications in policy.

In fiscal year 2016, VHA\u2019s health care system included 168  VA medical centers (VAMC) that offered inpatient, outpatient, and  residential services and 733 community-based outpatient clinics  (CBOC)\u2014stand-alone clinics that are geographically separate from  VAMCs and provide outpatient primary care, mental health care, and, in  some cases, specialty care services. In fiscal year 2016, these clinics  provided care to more than 3 million veterans at a cost of $5.3 billion,  which represented about half of the veterans treated by VHA and nearly  10 percent of total spending for their care. Although most CBOCs (632 of  the 733) are owned and operated by VHA, about 14 percent (101) are  operated by non-VHA health care organizations that contract with VHA to  provide services. According to VHA, as of the end of fiscal year 2016, 29  contractors held CBOC contracts, for which VHA spent nearly $312  million. It is VHA policy that all CBOCs provide one standard of care that  is of high quality, regardless of whether they are VHA-operated or  contracted.", "In May 2000, VHA published the last in a series of reports in response to  a 1998 request from the Under Secretary for Health to evaluate CBOC  performance. The evaluation found that VHA-operated and contracted  CBOCs performed equally on most performance measures, but  contracted clinics provided fewer primary care visits, had fewer patients  with mental health diagnoses, and did not have adequate cost data  available to compare their costs to those clinics operated by VHA. Since  that time, outpatient care use in VHA has grown substantially. In 2015, an  external assessment of VHA reported that between 2007 and 2014, VHA  outpatient visits increased 41 percent while inpatient bed days declined 9  percent. The 2015 assessment also reported that VHA\u2019s planning  models predicted inpatient bed days would decline by at least another 50  percent over the next 20 years.", "We and others have cited longstanding concerns about VHA\u2019s oversight  of its health care system. These concerns contributed to veterans\u2019 health  care being placed on GAO\u2019s High-Risk List beginning in 2015. You  asked us to conduct a management review of VHA that included, among  other issues, its use of contracts to carry out core functions. In this  report, we examine the extent to which:  1.  VHA-operated and contracted CBOCs vary in their provision of health  2.  VHA oversees CBOC operations, including ensuring the same quality  of care at both VHA-operated and contracted CBOCs.", "To determine the extent to which VHA-operated and contracted CBOCs  vary in their provision of health care services, we analyzed fiscal years  2014 through 2016 expenditure and encounter data (the three most  recent fiscal years of data available) for the 687 of 733 CBOCs that  provided care as of September 30, 2016, and for which these data were  available. We compared expenditures per encounter and the types of  services provided by VHA-operated clinics to those for contracted clinics.  We also spoke to officials from VHA\u2019s central office about the factors that  influence per-encounter expenditure variation across CBOCs. Given that  our 3-year analysis period was relatively short, we did not adjust the  values for inflation. We assessed the reliability of the encounter and  expenditure data by checking for missing values and obvious errors and  discussing them with VHA officials who were knowledgeable about the  data. We analyzed the data as reported by CBOCs in VHA\u2019s managerial  cost accounting system and we did not independently verify the accuracy  or completeness of the information, or the methodology used by VHA to  calculate total costs for VHA-operated clinics. After taking these steps,  we determined the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this  reporting objective.", "In addition, we interviewed officials from eight selected CBOCs and from  the four VAMCs and the four Veterans Integrated Service Networks  (VISN) that oversee them. We also interviewed the four VHA contracting  officers associated with the contracted CBOCs. The eight selected  clinics are a nongeneralizable sample of four pairs of VHA-operated and  contracted CBOCs. (See table 1.)

We selected the clinics for variation in geographic diversity, parent VAMC  complexity level, clinic type (multi-specialty vs. primary care), and clinic  size. We also interviewed officials from the American Legion, a veterans  service organization, to obtain the perspective of veterans on the services  provided at CBOCs. The information from our interviews is not  generalizable to all CBOCs, VAMCs, VISNs, or contracting officers. We  assessed the reliability of the VAST system data on clinic characteristics  by reviewing relevant documentation and speaking to knowledgeable  agency officials.

Also, officials said  they wanted to alleviate the travel burden for veterans who needed the  care, as the next closest VHA facility that offered this care was a 2.5-hour  drive away. Officials from another VAMC told us that they approached the  service needs at their clinics from a regional perspective, allowing for  veteran demand for services to be met across multiple clinics in the same  geographic area instead of relying on one clinic to meet the need.

One of our selected contracted CBOCs had one of the highest per- encounter expenditures for fiscal year 2016 among all clinics.

Officials said the VAMC is in the process of awarding a new contract for  this clinic.", "Although per-encounter expenditures were generally lower for contracted  CBOCs, officials from the VISNs and VAMCs in our review told us they  consider several factors in determining whether a new clinic will be VHA- operated or contracted. Such factors include the ability to directly monitor  performance and implement new standards of care, as well as the ability  to recruit and staff the clinic. For example, officials from two VAMCs in  our review told us that VHA-operated clinics can be easier to manage  because the VAMC has direct control of the clinic.

On the other  hand, officials from three of the four VISNs and three of the four VAMCs  in our review told us that contractors can be more flexible than VHA in  recruiting staff (such as the ability to offer higher salaries), making a  contracted clinic desirable for geographic areas where VHA has  challenges recruiting or retaining providers."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "VHA Has Not Fully Implemented Policy Requirements, and Inaccurate Information Limits Its Oversight of CBOC Quality of Care VHA Has Not Fully Implemented CBOC Oversight Policy Requirements", "paragraphs": ["We found that VHA has implemented certain oversight requirements, but  not others described in Directive 1229\u2014its policy that outlines VHA\u2019s  oversight responsibilities for outpatient sites of care, including CBOCs.

Second, officials from the office of the Deputy  Under Secretary for Health for Organizational Excellence told us that  their office was not responsible for addressing the broader issue of  monitoring clinics. Third, officials from the office of the Deputy Under  Secretary for Health for Operations and Management told us that  although they do not have formal guidelines in place, they believe  their office meets the Directive 1229 requirement as part of their  regular VISN oversight. Officials said they collect and review VISN- level performance data, such as patient satisfaction data, which can  be broken down to the level of the CBOC if there is a performance  problem. However, VHA may miss clinic performance problems that  are not identifiable in the VISN-level data. In addition, without  developing such guidelines, VHA has not established standardized  processes for how it monitors CBOCs, which can lead to inconsistent  oversight.

We  found that three of the four VISNs in our review largely delegated  oversight of the CBOCs to the VAMCs, rather than conducting  continuous quality monitoring as required in the policy. Specifically,  officials from these VISNs said that they largely focus their oversight  on the VAMCs and do not separately review the performance of every  CBOC unless the VAMC informs them of a quality problem at a  particular clinic. Officials from the remaining VISN in our review said  they do conduct CBOC-specific oversight activities. Specifically, this  VISN had created a performance review survey tool that it sends to  each clinic on an annual basis, and the results are reviewed by a  workgroup made up of VISN staff. The workgroup examines trends  across the CBOCs, including a comparison of VHA-operated and  contracted performance. For example, one question in the tool asks  how an individual CBOC\u2019s performance compares with others  overseen by the VAMC. The delegation of oversight responsibility for  the CBOCs to the VAMCs without consistent VISN-level oversight  creates the potential for inconsistencies in oversight, which does not  align with VHA policy to provide one standard of care for all clinics.

We found that 22 percent of sites were incorrectly  classified as CBOCs, based on the site classifications in VAST.  Several of these sites were much more complex, such as health care  centers and VAMCs. For example, a VAMC was included in the  report as a CBOC, but this VAMC has three specialized intensive care  units and serves as a regional referral center for intensive inpatient  surgery, including open heart surgery. In addition, we also identified  sites included in the report that provided less complex services than  those that are provided in CBOCs, such as other outpatient services  sites.", "VHA officials who produce the CBOC Report told us that, prior to the  establishment of the VAST site classifications in 2014, they used their  judgment to classify existing sites of care as CBOCs and they have  not updated their classifications since then. For sites established  since 2014, officials told us they use the VAST site classifications, but  may also use their judgment in certain situations. For example, if a  site\u2019s classification changed in VAST from a non-CBOC to a CBOC,  they would make a decision about whether to classify it as a CBOC in  the report by examining various aspects of the facility, such as the  services provided and encounters. This procedure differs from what is  documented in the methodology section of the CBOC Report, which  states that site classifications are based on VAST. Further, VHA  officials said they did not have a document available that outlined how  they make these decisions. Because the site classifications in the  CBOC Report are based, in part, on officials\u2019 judgment in addition to  the classifications in VAST, the report does not present accurate  information on CBOCs across VHA and is of limited usefulness to  VHA as a tool to ensure that VHA-operated and contracted CBOCs  are providing the same standard of care that is of high quality.", "Missing CBOCs. We found that 53 CBOCs (7 percent of all CBOCs)  were missing from the CBOC Report from the first quarter of fiscal  year 2017, rendering the data incomplete. VHA officials provided  examples of why a CBOC might not be included in the report. For  example, a newer CBOC might not be included because it did not  have quality of care data available at the time the report was  developed. However, we identified several other sites that were listed  in the report, despite unavailable data.", "Inaccurate summary calculations. Due to the incorrect site  classifications and missing CBOCs, the national- and VISN-level  summary calculations of performance in the CBOC Report were also  inaccurate. Specifically, the report includes national- and VISN-level  averages for each HEDIS measure, which VHA officials can use as  benchmarks for clinic performance. These averages were over- inclusive\u2014incorporating performance results from additional sites that  were not CBOCs, and under-inclusive\u2014omitting performance results  from CBOCs that were missing from the report. These inaccuracies  may lead VHA officials to draw incorrect conclusions about the quality  of care provided in CBOCs. For example, officials from one VAMC  told us that they use the national averages as benchmarks against  which they compare the performance of their CBOCs. Because this  VAMC requires CBOCs with lower-than-average HEDIS performance  results to develop a formal action plan to improve performance,  officials may not be identifying clinics that are in need of an action  plan due to the inaccuracy of the averages. In addition, VHA central  office officials who develop the CBOC Report said that the results  from recent reports have shown that VHA-operated and contracted  clinics in general provided the same standard of care, but this  conclusion may not be correct as it is based on unreliable data.", "No guidance or training for use of the CBOC Report.

Officials  from the office of the Deputy Under Secretary for Health for  Operations and Management said that VISNs and VAMCs are  expected to use the report as part of their CBOC oversight; however,  we found there is no requirement that they do so.

Officials from  one of the four VAMCs and one of the four VISNs in our review were  using it as part of CBOC oversight activities at the time of our review.  Officials from another VISN said that they planned to start using the  CBOC Report after we made them aware of it during our interview.

However, as it currently stands, the report is inaccurate and  incomplete and VISNs and VAMCs are not trained on or required to use  it; thus, it is of limited use to VHA, including the VISNs and VAMCs that  have responsibility for CBOC oversight.
