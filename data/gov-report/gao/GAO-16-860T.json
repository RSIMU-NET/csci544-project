For example, in 2012 and 2015, GAO found that DOD was not meeting its internal requirement to complete whistleblower reprisal investigations within 180 days, with cases closed in fiscal years 2013 and 2014 averaging 526 days. In response, DODIG\u2014which is responsible for both conducting investigations and overseeing investigations conducted by the military services\u2014took steps to better track and analyze timeliness data by developing a guide to help ensure the accurate tracking of case processing time and by updating its case management system in April 2016 to include new investigation milestones. Because these actions were not taken until 2016, it is too early to determine if timeliness has improved since GAO last reported on the status. Similarly, in 2015, GAO found that DOD had not met the statutory requirement to notify servicemembers within 180-days about delays in their investigations for about half of the reprisal investigations closed in fiscal year 2013. In response, DODIG developed an automated tool in its case management system to flag cases approaching 180 days. However, DODIG continues to not regularly report to Congress on the timeliness of military whistleblower reprisal investigations as GAO recommended in 2012. On August 31, 2016, a senior DODIG official stated that DODIG will implement this recommendation by reporting timeliness information to Congress biannually.", "DODIG has strengthened its oversight of military service reprisal investigations in response to recommendations GAO made in 2012 and 2015 by establishing processes and developing guidance for overseeing investigations, among other things. For example, in 2015, GAO found that DODIG did not have a process for documenting whether investigations were independent and were conducted by someone outside the military service chain of command. In response, DODIG directed the service IGs to certify investigators' independence for oversight reviews. GAO also found in 2015 that DODIG had provided limited guidance to investigators using its case management system, limiting its utility as a real-time management system, as intended. In response, DODIG issued a system guide and a data entry guide, which provide key information on how to work with and maintain system data. However, in 2015 GAO also found that DODIG and the military service IGs used different terms in their guidance to investigators, hindering DODIG oversight of case completeness. GAO recommended that DOD direct the military service IGs to follow standardized investigation stages and issue related guidance. DODIG officials stated in August 2016 that they are working with the services to standardize investigation stages and that DODIG is willing to work with the Secretary of Defense to issue such direction. Separately, GAO found in 2012 that unreliable data on corrective actions taken in response to substantiated reprisal cases was hampering oversight and recommended that DOD regularly report to Congress on the frequency and type of corrective actions taken in response to substantiated reprisal claims.

However, whistleblowers also  risk reprisal, such as demotion, reassignment, and firing.

DODIG can conduct an investigation into a military reprisal complaint or  refer the investigation to the appropriate military service IG, but DODIG  has the final responsibility for approving the results of all investigations.  The majority of DODIG\u2019s investigation workload for military reprisal cases  is related to oversight reviews of investigations conducted by the military  service IGs. According to a senior DODIG official at the time of our last  review in May 2015, DODIG referred most military whistleblower reprisal  cases to the service IGs for investigation, but retained cases that are high  profile or involve (1) issues such as sexual assault, (2) senior officers,  and (3) members from different services or a joint base or command.", "Our prior work has found that DODIG\u2019s oversight of the military  whistleblower reprisal program has faced challenges.

In 2012, we found that neither the DODIG nor military service  IGs had been making the required notifications. During that review,  DODIG changed its practice and started reporting this information in  October 2011 and identified steps in an action plan to help ensure that it  and the military service IGs followed the statutory reporting requirements.", "During our 2015 review, DODIG officials stated that they had taken  additional steps to help ensure they met the statutory notification  requirement. For example, DODIG assigned an oversight investigator to  remind the service IGs to send the required letters and developed a  mechanism in DODIG\u2019s case management system to indicate which  cases were older than 180 days. However, during our 2015 review, we  again found that DOD had not sent the required letters to notify  servicemembers about delays in their investigations in about half of  reprisal investigations closed in fiscal year 2013; that the median  notification time for servicemembers receiving the required letter was  about 353 days after the servicemember filed the complaint; and that the  letters that DOD had sent, on average, had significantly underestimated  the date by which the investigation would be competed.", "Consequently, we recommended in our 2015 report that DOD develop an  automated tool to help ensure compliance with the statutory 180-day  notification requirement by providing servicemembers with accurate  information regarding the status of their reprisal investigations within 180  days of receipt of an allegation of reprisal. DOD concurred with this  recommendation and in April 2016, launched an automated tool within its  case management system to help ensure compliance with the statutory  180-day notification requirement, instead of relying on its manual  reconciliation process. Specifically, the case management system now  has an alert that provides the age of the case and the date by which the  notification letter must be transmitted to the required parties.

The  semiannual report to Congress is required to include information on fraud,  abuses, and deficiencies related to the administration of programs and  operations managed or financed by DOD, but DOD interpreted this  requirement as not applying to the military whistleblower reprisal  program.

Further,  DODIG requires that the service IGs report back to DODIG on command  actions taken against the individual alleged to have reprised against a  whistleblower, according to officials from these organizations. However, in  2012 we found that DODIG had not been maintaining reliable information  on command actions needed to oversee this process. Specifically, for 40  percent of all substantiated cases that DODIG closed from October 1,  2005, through March 31, 2011, the database that DODIG used during that  period did not contain information on the command actions taken.", "As a result, we recommended in our 2012 report that DOD (1) establish  standardized corrective action reporting requirements, and (2)  consistently track and regularly reconcile data regarding corrective  actions. DOD addressed these recommendations by issuing an update to  its military whistleblower directive in April 2015 that required standardized  corrective action reporting requirements by the services. DODIG also  issued additional guidance in its March 2016 investigations manual  requiring that investigators populate data fields for corrective actions and  remedies. Finally, DODIG provided us with a report in April 2016 detailing  its tracking of corrective actions taken in response to substantiated  reprisal cases between October 2011 and January 2016.", "In 2012, we also found that DODIG had not yet fully established  performance metrics for ensuring the timeliness and quality of  whistleblower reprisal investigations but was taking steps to establish  timeliness metrics that focused on investigation processing time. Federal  internal control standards state that metrics are important for identifying  and setting appropriate incentives for achieving goals while complying  with law, regulations, and ethical standards. Further, we found in our  previous work that metrics on both timeliness and quality\u2014such as  completeness of investigative reports and the adequacy of internal  controls\u2014can enhance the ability of organizations to provide assurance  that they are exercising all of the appropriate safeguards for federal  programs. During our 2012 review, DODIG officials stated that they  recognized the importance of both timeliness and quality metrics and that  they planned to develop quality metrics as part of their effort to improve  case management and outcomes. They further noted that quality metrics  could include measuring whether interviews are completed and  documented and whether conclusions made about the case are fully  supported by evidence. To assist DOD in improving oversight of the  whistleblower reprisal program, we recommended in our 2012 report that  DOD develop and implement performance metrics to ensure the quality  and effectiveness of the investigative process, such as ensuring that the  casefiles contain evidence sufficient to support the conclusions.", "DOD concurred with our recommendation and in 2014 fully developed  timeliness metrics, along with some performance metrics to assess the  completeness of a sample of (1) DODIG-conducted whistleblower reprisal  investigations and (2) DODIG oversight reviews of the military services  whistleblower reprisal investigations. For example, now DODIG is to  complete internal control checklists for investigations it conducts and  oversight worksheets for investigations conducted by the military services  to determine whether casefiles are compliant with internal policy and best  practices. On a quarterly basis, DODIG is to draw a sample of the  checklists and oversight worksheets for cases closed by DODIG and the  military service IGs and compare these checklists to the quality metrics  that it developed. According to DODIG officials, these metrics were  briefed to the DOD Inspector General in fiscal year 2014. DODIG officials  stated in July 2016 that they continued to conduct quality assurance  reviews and collect associated metrics in fiscal year 2015, but that they  have not briefed these metrics to the DOD Inspector General since fiscal  year 2014 and that changes to the metrics briefings are forthcoming per  direction from the DOD Inspector General and Principal Deputy Inspector  General. DODIG did not provide information on the nature of these  changes. While we believe that DODIG\u2019s actions should help oversee the  quality of investigations, we will continue to work with the DODIG and  monitor its progress in implementing and communicating these  performance metrics during our ongoing review assessing whistleblower  reprisal investigation processes for DOD civilian employees and  contractors. Further, we also believe that until the military services follow  standardized investigation stages, as discussed later in this statement, it  will be difficult for the DODIG to consistently measure the quality of the  services\u2019 military whistleblower reprisal investigations.", "Separately, in 2015, we found that DODIG and the service IGs had  processes for investigators to recuse themselves from investigations, but  there was no process for investigators to document whether the  investigation they conducted was independent and outside the chain of  command. Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency  standards state that in all matters relating to investigative work, the  investigative organization must be free, both in fact and appearance, from  impairments to independence. Further, guidance for documenting  independence is included in generally accepted government auditing  standards, which can provide guidance to service IGs as a best practice  on how to document decisions regarding independence when conducting  reprisal investigations.", "At the time of our 2015 review, DODIG officials stated that their recusal  policies for investigators, their decentralized investigation structure, and  their removal of the investigator from the chain of command adequately  addressed independence issues and that no further documentation of  independence was needed. However, during the case file review we  conducted for our 2015 report, we identified oversight worksheets on  which DODIG oversight investigators had noted potential impairments to  investigator objectivity in the report of investigation. For example, one  oversight worksheet stated that the report gave the appearance of service  investigator bias, and another oversight worksheet stated that the  investigator was not outside the chain of command, as is statutorily  required. DODIG approved these cases without documenting how it had  reconciled these case deficiencies. As a result, in our 2015 report we  recommended that DOD develop and implement a process for military  service investigators to document whether the investigation was  independent and outside the chain of command and direct the service IGs  to provide such documentation for review during the oversight process.  DOD concurred with this recommendation and issued a memorandum in  June 2015 that informed service IGs that DODIG would look for  certification of an investigator\u2019s independence during its oversight  reviews. Concurrently, DODIG also directed the service IGs to provide  such documentation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Guidance", "paragraphs": ["In 2012, we found that DODIG was updating its guidance related to the  whistleblower program but that the updates had not yet been formalized  and that the guidance that existed at that time was inconsistently  followed.

Further,  guidance should be regularly evaluated to help ensure that it is still  appropriate and working as intended. However, in 2012 we found, among  other things, that DODIG\u2019s primary investigative guide distributed to  investigators conducting whistleblower reprisal investigations had not  been updated since 1996 and did not reflect some investigative  processes that were current in 2012. Additionally, because guidance  related to key provisions of the investigative process was unclear, it was  being interpreted and implemented differently by the service IGs. As a  result, we recommended in our 2012 report that DODIG update its  whistleblower reprisal investigative guidance and ensure that it is  consistently followed, including clarifying reporting requirements,  responsibilities, and terminology. DOD concurred with this  recommendation and in October 2014 released a guide of best practices  for conducting military reprisal investigations and in April 2015 updated  Directive 7050.06 on military whistleblower protection, which established  policies and assigned responsibilities for military whistleblower protection  and defined key terminology.", "Separately, in 2015 we found that DODIG had provided limited guidance  to users of its case management system on how to populate case  information into the system. The case management system, in use since  December 2012, was to serve as a real-time complaint tracking and  investigative management tool for investigators. DOD\u2019s fiscal year 2014  performance plan for oversight investigators notes that investigators  should ensure that the case management system reflects current, real- time information on case activity. This intent aligns with Council of the  Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency\u2019s quality standards for  investigations, which state that accurate processing of information is  essential to the mission of an investigative organization and that this  begins with the orderly, systematic, accurate, and secure maintenance of  a management information system. However, based on our file review of  a sample of 124 cases closed in fiscal year 2013, we found that DODIG  investigators were not using the case management system for real-time  case management. Specifically, we estimated that DODIG personnel  uploaded key case documents to the system after DODIG had closed the  case in 77 percent of cases in fiscal year 2013. Among other things,  these documents included reports of investigation, oversight worksheets,  and 180-day notification letters regarding delays in completing  investigations. Additionally, we estimated that for 83 percent of cases  closed in fiscal year 2013, DODIG staff had made changes to case  variables in the case management system at least 3 months after case  closure.", "DODIG officials stated in 2015 that they planned to further develop a  manual for the case management system that was in draft form along  with internal desk aides, but that they did not plan to issue additional  internal guidance for DODIG staff on the case management system  because they believed that the existing guidance was sufficient. However,  DODIG\u2019s draft manual did not instruct users on how to access the  system, troubleshoot errors, or monitor caseloads. As a result, in our  2015 report we recommended that DOD issue additional guidance to  investigators on how to use the case management system as a real-time  management tool. DOD concurred with this recommendation and in  March 2016 issued a case management system user guide and in July  2016, a data entry guide.

DODIG is required to review all service  IG determinations in military reprisal investigations in addition to its  responsibility for conducting investigations of some military reprisal  complaints, and DOD Directive 7050.06 requires that service IGs notify  DODIG of reprisal complaints within 10 days of the receipt of a complaint.  However, our analysis indicated that DODIG\u2019s case management system  did not have records of at least 22 percent of service investigations both  open as of September 30, 2014, and closed in fiscal years 2013 and  2014. Further, based on our file review, we estimated that there was no  evidence of the required service notification in 30 percent of the cases  closed in fiscal year 2013.

We also noted in 2012 that a 2009 Department of Justice review  recommended that the results of investigations that substantiate  allegations of reprisal be publicized as a way to heighten awareness  within the services of the Military Whistleblower Protection Act, to  potentially deter future incidents of reprisal, and to possibly encourage  other reprisal victims to come forward. While the DODIG cannot directly  take corrective action in response to a substantiated case per DOD  Directive 7050.06, it is the focal point for DOD\u2019s military whistleblower  reprisal program and is well positioned to collect and monitor data  regarding program outcomes. Further, DODIG officials stated in 2012  that because DODIG is the focal point, it is important for it to have  visibility and information of all military whistleblower reprisal activities, not  only to provide oversight but also to provide a central place within the  department where internal and external stakeholders can obtain  information.", "In addition to the recommendations we made regarding establishing  corrective action reporting requirements and regularly tracking these data,  we also recommended in our 2012 report that DOD regularly report to  Congress on the frequency and type of corrective actions taken in  response to substantiated reprisal claims. We noted that DOD could do  so, for example, through its semiannual reports to Congress. DOD  concurred with that recommendation and has since included examples in  its semiannual reports to Congress of corrective actions taken by the  military services for substantiated cases but not a comprehensive list of  all corrective actions taken. However, in following up on actions that  DODIG has taken regarding this recommendation in August 2016,  DODIG officials stated that the corrective actions listed in its semiannual  reports to Congress included all corrective actions taken during the 6  month reporting period, but that the reports incorrectly identified these  actions as examples. DODIG provided us corrective action information to  compare with the corrective actions reported in DODIG\u2019s December 2015  and March 2016 semiannual reports to Congress for those reporting  periods. We identified some key differences. Specifically, we identified  corrective actions in the information provided to us by DODIG that were  not published in the December and March reports to Congress and  identified discrepancies in the types of corrective action contained in the  reports and in the information that DODIG provided. As a result, we  believe that DODIG\u2019s two most recent semiannual reports to Congress  did not include the frequency and type of all corrective actions reported  during those reporting periods.", "Relatedly, we also noted in August 2016 that DODIG\u2019s semiannual  reports did not include other information needed to convey the frequency  and type of corrective actions. Specifically, DODIG officials stated in  August 2016 that their case management system would require additional  capability in order to produce a list of substantiated allegations that do not  have associated corrective actions, which would indicate which corrective  action recommendations are outstanding. Further, these officials stated  that publishing information showing the status of all DODIG corrective  action recommendations\u2014not just actions that were taken during a  particular reporting period\u2014could be misleading because the military  services sometimes take actions that are different than those  recommended by DODIG and that may not result from reprisal  investigations. However, as noted in the 2009 Department of Justice  review, publicizing the results of investigations that substantiate  allegations of reprisal may help to deter future incidents of reprisal and  encourage other whistleblowers to come forward. Without including  information on (1) all corrective actions taken during a reporting period,  (2) outstanding corrective action recommendations, and (3) actions taken  by the services that are different than those recommended by DODIG, we  believe that DODIG\u2019s current method of reporting does not fully address  our recommendation to report to Congress on the frequency and type of  corrective action taken in response to substantiated claims. Moreover, it  does not meet the requirement to keep Congress fully and currently  informed on the progress of implementing corrective actions through,  among other things, its semiannual reports to Congress. We therefore  continue to believe that without such information, Congress will be  hindered in its ability to provide oversight of the corrective action portion  of the military whistleblower reprisal program.", "In summary, DOD has taken actions to implement 15 of the 18  recommendations that we made to address the military whistleblower  reprisal timeliness and oversight challenges we identified in our 2012 and  2015 reports. These efforts constitute progress toward improving the  DODIG\u2019s ability to accurately track the timeliness of military whistleblower  reprisal investigations and increase the DODIG\u2019s ability to effectively  oversee the department\u2019s military whistleblower reprisal program. Fully  implementing the remaining 3 recommendations would further strengthen  DODIG\u2019s capacity to assess the quality of military whistleblower reprisal  investigations and enhance Congress\u2019 visibility into the timeliness of  investigations as well as into the corrective actions taken for  substantiated allegations. We have ongoing work that will help to both  monitor the actions taken by DODIG to improve its oversight of military  reprisal investigations and provide additional insight on the DODIG\u2019s  ability to conduct timely and quality reprisal investigations for DOD\u2019s  civilian and contractor employees.", "Chairman DeSantis, Ranking Member Lynch, and Members of the  Subcommittee, this concludes my prepared statement.
