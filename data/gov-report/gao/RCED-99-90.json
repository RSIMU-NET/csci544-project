The Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform  Act of 1996, commonly known as the 1996 farm bill, encouraged farmers to  make production decisions in response to market forces.  It also helped  farmers who were eligible for payments through federal commodity  programs to reduce their reliance on federal support by providing  \u201ctransition\u201d payments, which are gradually declining over a 7-year period.   At the same time, U.S. farmers have faced increased global competition,  new technology, and volatile weather patterns.  In light of these changes,  the 1996 farm bill required the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), in  consultation with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, to educate  farmers about the tools available for managing risks.  These risk  management tools primarily include crop insurance to provide  compensation if crop yields are substantially lower than expected and  forward contracts to enable farmers to lock in a price for their crop or  livestock production prior to harvest or slaughter.  Farmers can also  engage in hedging by buying or selling futures or options contracts on a  commodity exchange, such as the Chicago Board of Trade, to reduce the  risk of receiving lower prices for crops or livestock.  (App. I describes each  of these risk management tools in more detail.)", "Concerned about the level of knowledge farmers have about available  federal and private-sector tools for managing risk and the adequacy of  USDA\u2019s initiatives to prepare farmers to use these tools, you requested that  we examine USDA\u2019s efforts to educate farmers about risk management.   Specifically, you asked us to (1) provide information on the extent of  farmers\u2019 use of risk management tools and (2) identify educational  programs and projects USDA has directed or initiated to prepare farmers  for managing risks and to determine the groups or individuals who have  participated in or been served by these programs.  To address the first  objective, we obtained data from USDA\u2019s Agricultural Resource  Management Study for 1996, the most current year in which USDA  surveyed farmers about their use of risk management tools."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Farming has always been a risky endeavor, and farmers have always had to  manage risk as a part of doing business.  Over the years, the federal  government has played an active role in several ways to help mitigate the  effects of production losses and low prices on farm income.  For example,  USDA's Risk Management Agency (RMA) administers the federal crop  insurance program to protect farmers against major production losses.   Under this program, RMA subsidizes the federal multiple-peril crop  insurance program, which allows insured farmers to receive an indemnity  payment if production falls below a certain level.  In addition, to help  protect farmers against the risk of low crop prices, USDA\u2019s Farm Service  Agency administered price- and income-support programs for farmers who  grew certain crops--corn, wheat, grain sorghum, barley, oats, cotton, and  rice.", "The 1996 farm bill changed the government\u2019s role.  It replaced the income- support programs with \u201cproduction flexibility contracts\u201d that provide for  fixed but declining annual payments to participating farmers from 1996  through 2002.  These government payments--known as transition  payments--are not tied to market prices, and participating farmers are not  restricted with regard to the type or amount of crops that they plant, as  they were in the earlier programs.  Furthermore, unlike the deficiency  payments of the last 6 decades, the transition payments do not rise in years  when crop prices are low, nor do they fall in years when prices are high.  As  shown in table 1, the 1996 farm bill specified that transition payments  would total about $36 billion over the 7-year period, declining from about  $5.6 billion in 1996 to about $4 billion in 2002.", "By giving farmers increased flexibility in deciding which crops to plant, the  1996 farm bill allows them to choose the particular crop or combination of  crops that they believe offers the best chance to maximize their profits and  offset the decline in income resulting from lower government payments.   However, the increased flexibility in planting decisions brings other risks.   For example, small increases in expected profits may lead many farmers to  decide to increase the acreage devoted to a particular crop.  This, in turn,  could result in the increased production of the crop nationwide and  ultimately in lower prices as a result of the greater supply.", "Section 192 of the 1996 farm bill required that USDA, in consultation with  the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), educate farmers in  managing the financial risks inherent in producing and marketing  agricultural commodities.  The act specified that, as a part of such  education activities, USDA may develop and implement programs to assist  and train farmers in using (1) forward contracts, which enable farmers to  lock in a price for their crop or livestock production prior to harvest or  slaughter, (2) crop insurance, which ensures compensation if crop yields  are substantially lower than expected, and (3) hedging--buying or selling  futures or options contracts on a commodity exchange, such as the  Chicago Board of Trade--which reduces the risk of receiving lower prices  for crops or livestock.   The act authorized USDA to use its existing  research and extension authorities and resources to implement this  provision.", "In March 1997, the Secretary of Agriculture organized a steering committee  to direct the government's education activities for managing agricultural  risk.  The steering committee is chaired by RMA\u2019s administrator and  includes a CFTC commissioner; the administrator of USDA\u2019s Cooperative  State Research, Education, and Extension Service (CSREES); and the  director of USDA's National Office of Outreach.  These agencies have  different responsibilities.  RMA primarily administers the federal crop  insurance program; the 1996 farm bill expanded its authority to include a  broader risk management perspective.  CFTC, which regulates commodity  futures and options trading in the United States, also develops and  maintains research and informational programs concerning futures and  options trading for farmers, commodity market users, and the general  public.  CSREES develops and conducts agricultural research, higher  education, and extension programs to provide education and technical  assistance to farmers and the general public.  USDA's National Office of  Outreach is responsible for ensuring that information, technical assistance,  and training are available to all USDA customers, with an emphasis on  underserved populations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Farmers\u2019 Use of Risk Management Tools Varied by Size of Farming Operation and Commodity", "paragraphs": ["USDA\u2019s 1996 Agricultural Resource Management Study (Phase 3), based on  a statistical sample of farmers, found that about 42 percent of the nation\u2019s 2  million farmers used at least one of the risk management tools--forward  contracts, crop insurance, or hedging--to manage their income risk.  In  1996, a substantially greater percentage of farmers with agricultural sales  of at least $100,000 (large-scale farmers) used each risk management tool  than did farmers whose agricultural sales were less than $100,000 (small- scale farmers).  Similarly, a greater percentage of farmers whose primary  crops were corn, wheat, or cotton purchased crop insurance and used  forward contracts than did farmers who grew other field crops.

The university partners developed and implemented a series of regional  and local risk management conferences targeted initially at groups that  influence farmers--bankers, crop insurance agents, grain elevator  operators, and agricultural educators.  USDA expects that these individuals  will provide farmers with specific information for using risk management  tools as the program continues.  During fiscal year 1998, USDA also  awarded 17 grants for risk management education projects, provided  funding to land grant universities to promote additional risk management  education efforts, and funded the development of an electronic risk  management education library.", "In fiscal year 1998, USDA obligated $5 million of RMA\u2019s $10 million for crop  insurance research to RMA\u2019s risk management education initiatives-- amounting to about $2.50 per U.S. farmer.  These funds were the  predominant source of risk management education funding within USDA.   In comparison, a CSREES official told us that CSREES typically obligates  only about $100,000 per year, primarily for specific risk management  education projects.  The official noted that land grant universities may also  use a portion of their general CSREES education funding to support risk  management education projects; however, the amount that universities  spent in fiscal year 1998 is not known.  For fiscal year 1999, USDA has  allocated $1 million of RMA\u2019s $3.5 million for crop insurance research to  risk management education."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "USDA\u2019s Conferences and Regional Partnerships", "paragraphs": ["In response to the 1996 farm bill\u2019s requirement that it educate farmers  about managing their production and marketing risks, USDA used a  September 1997 national risk management education summit to initiate a  series of 20 national and regional risk management education conferences.   USDA\u2019s conferences focused on developing partnerships with \u201cthird-party  influencers\u201d in an effort to leverage the available government funds to train  those who are in a position to educate farmers on risk management tools.   According to USDA\u2019s director of risk management education, the training  would enable third-party influencers to demonstrate to farmers how the  various tools fit together in an overall risk management and marketing  plan.  These individuals interact frequently with farmers and are in a  position to influence the risk management decisions farmers make.  For  example, land grant college or extension service educators provide various  training and advisory services to farmers on both the production and  business aspects of farming.  Crop insurance agents meet with farmers  several times during the year as the farmers decide on insurance coverage  levels and provide the agents with information on acres planted and final  crop production levels.  The bank or farm credit services loan officers meet  with farmers to discuss business plans and arrange for operating loans.   Commodity brokers interact with farmers who choose to engage in hedging  with futures or options.  Farmers interact with grain elevator operators  when they sell their crops on either a cash or forward contract basis.   According to RMA, the conferences helped participants to gain information  and knowledge about areas outside their own expertise.  For example,  commodity brokers learned more about crop insurance, and crop  insurance agents learned more about the futures market.", "As of December 1998, USDA\u2019s major conferences had reached a relatively  small percentage of the target groups\u2019 members.  Table 6 shows that 335 (2  percent) of about 15,000 crop insurance agents in the United States had  attended a USDA-sponsored risk management conference.  Similarly, only  251 bankers and 96 grain elevator operators had attended the conferences,  although there are about 3,200 agricultural banks and about 10,000 grain  elevators in the United States.  About 20 percent of the conference  attendees were USDA or other government agency employees, rather than  members of the groups influencing farmers.", "Conference speakers generally presented broad, overview information  about a number of farm management areas without providing detailed  information addressing specific problems in any single area.  According to  RMA officials, providing overview information was appropriate because it  enabled participants to appreciate how their specialty area interacts with  other areas for the benefit of farmers.  USDA also expanded the scope of  the conferences to discuss more than the two risk areas that the 1996 farm  bill had identified--producing and marketing agricultural commodities.   Sections of the conferences also addressed tools for reducing financial  risks, legal risks, and human resource risks, in addition to tools for  reducing production and marketing risks.  RMA officials noted that  financial, legal, and human resource risks are also significant concerns for  farmers.", "RMA officials consider the risk management conferences to be a first step  in developing regional and state partnerships with USDA, universities, and  private organizations to provide risk management education to farmers.   USDA has designated five land grant university educators as regional  coordinators of its risk management education program.  (App. III  identifies, for each region, the coordinator\u2019s university affiliation, the  associated RMA regional service offices, and the states covered.)  The  regional coordinators are responsible for (1) working with private sector  partners, including bankers, crop insurance company representatives, and  farmer organizations, to develop regional and local conferences, meetings  and other training efforts and (2) serving as a focal point for providing  information about the risk management education opportunities in each  region.   State and local educational activities, training sessions, and events  sponsored by these partnerships have begun to reach additional farmers  and individuals who influence farmers\u2019 decisions.", "In fiscal year 1998, USDA spent $1.5 million to support the risk  management conferences and initiate regional partnerships, including  about $300,000 for the conferences, $250,000 for publications and  materials, $133,000 for the regional coordinating offices, and $45,000 for an  evaluation project.  USDA also spent about $350,000 for special outreach  projects designed to enhance the risk management skills of small and  minority producers in areas described as underserved by traditional risk  management tools and $50,000 to sponsor a Future Farmers of America  essay contest on risk management."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Risk Management Education Grants", "paragraphs": ["In addition to sponsoring conferences and developing regional  partnerships, USDA awarded a series of risk management education and  research grants totaling $3 million.

In June 1998, USDA  awarded 17 risk management education grants, ranging from $19,172 to  $250,000, and averaging about $178,000.  USDA awarded 12 grants to land  grant colleges and universities, 3 to other educational entities, 1 to a crop  insurance industry organization, and 1 to a grain elevator industry  organization.
