VA developed its system as a direct delivery system, with the government owning and operating its own health care facilities. Since then, the VA system has become one of the nation\u2019s largest networks of direct delivery health care providers, with 173 hospitals and 376 outpatient clinics nationwide. Because public and private health insurance programs have also grown, most veterans now have one or more alternatives to VA health care.

VA services included 925,000 inpatient hospital stays and about 25 million outpatient visits.", "The VA health care system was established primarily to treat war-related injuries and help rehabilitate veterans with disabilities incurred or aggravated as a result of military service; such service-connected disabilities include blindness, paralysis, and loss of limb. Subsequently, the Congress expanded the system so that hospital services could be provided, to the extent space and resources were available, to veterans who did not have service-connected disabilities and who lacked the resources to pay. Today, all veterans are eligible for treatment at VA medical facilities, but few are entitled to the full range of services under the existing complex eligibility requirements. For example, veterans with service-connected disabilities are eligible for cost-free hospital care, while high-income veterans without such disabilities are eligible for such care but may receive it only if space and resources are available. Such high-income veterans are also subject to co-payments and, if insured, their insurers must be billed for services provided by VA facilities.", "When the VA health care system was established, there were no health insurance programs to help veterans pay for needed care. Private insurance began to emerge in the 1930s and expanded rapidly in the 1950s. In the 1960s, the Congress established the Medicare and Medicaid programs\u2014public insurance programs that help the elderly and selected low-income individuals pay for health care. By 1990, 9 out of 10 veterans had one or more alternatives to VA health care for standard benefits (excluding such special services as psychiatric care and prescription drugs): about 81 percent had private health insurance, almost 26 percent were eligible for Medicare, and 1.6 percent had Medicaid coverage.", "The VA health care system is fundamentally different from private or public health insurance programs. VA generally delivers health care to patients directly using salaried physicians, nurses, and other professionals in VA facilities. Insurance programs, on the other hand, provide services on a fee-for-service basis or through contracts with private providers. VA does not charge veterans for services provided to treat service-connected disabilities, although veterans may be required to make co-payments for nonservice-connected conditions if their income exceeds prescribed thresholds. Insurance programs typically charge premiums to, impose deductibles on, and require co-payments from all enrollees. In addition, VA provides some services that insurance programs typically do not provide. For example, VA covers outpatient prescription drugs and dental care that are not covered by Medicare. Similarly, while Medicare and most private insurance programs provide short-term nursing home care following hospitalization, VA may, in some instances, offer more extensive, longer-term nursing home and domiciliary care.", "If cost and service differences between VA and insurance programs diminish, the importance of accessibility as a factor in veterans\u2019 decisions on where to obtain health care could increase. VA surveyed the status of veterans in 1987 and found that distance to VA facilities was one of the reasons most frequently cited by veterans for not using VA facilities. VA\u2019s survey of the status of veterans in 1992 also showed that about one-third of the responding veterans who received inpatient care did not choose a VA hospital because they were too far from the VA location. Similarly, over one-fourth of the veteran respondents to VA\u2019s health care reform customer satisfaction survey said that, given a choice of health programs and assuming no difference in cost, they would choose private providers, in part, because the private providers were more accessible.", "In October 1995, VA began a major reorganization that will replace its four regional offices with 22 integrated service networks.

Only about 20 percent of VA\u2019s physicians are primary care physicians, while about 60 percent of managed care plans\u2019 physicians are typically primary care physicians. Private-sector officials we spoke with believed that VA would have difficulty increasing the number of primary care physicians to staff its facilities because of the shortage of such physicians and because VA currently is unable to match the salaries and benefits offered by managed care plans.", "Further, VA-operated facilities might duplicate private-sector services in areas where the private sector has sufficient capacity, requiring VA to compete for existing patients. Several private-sector officials we spoke with questioned the need to open new VA outpatient facilities, especially in urban areas where the private sector already provides sufficient access. In these cases, contracting with existing providers might be a more viable option for improving access.", "Conversely, VA-operated facilities might be a more viable option in areas that are underserved by the private sector. Some rural and inner-city areas, for example, suffer from a shortage of physicians. In other areas, physicians may have full practices and, as a result, be unlikely to take on additional patients. Thus, if VA wanted to improve access for veterans in such areas it might be able to do so only by establishing its own facility."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Willingness of Private Providers to Contract With VA", "paragraphs": ["Finally, even if VA chose to do so, it could have difficulty contracting for veterans\u2019 health care. Several private-sector officials indicated that providers would be cautious about entering into capitation arrangements with VA because the risk of financial loss would be too high. They said that the VA patient population is perceived as being sicker and, therefore, more expensive to care for than the general population. At the same time, they questioned the willingness of VA to provide an adequate level of reimbursement, particularly under a capitation arrangement.", "A medical center in Chicago recently encountered such an obstacle. The VA medical center proposed establishing a VA-operated outpatient clinic in its service area after failing to interest three local health maintenance organizations (HMO) in providing services on a capitation basis. The HMOs were not interested because they believed the medical histories of the medical center\u2019s patients represented too high an underwriting risk. The HMOs, according to medical center officials, were unwilling to develop a rate for patients outside their normal risk definition.", "In addition, officials at two managed care plans expressed concern about contracting with VA because doing so could adversely affect veteran patients\u2019 care. Non-VA physicians who lacked admitting rights in VA hospitals would be required to relinquish control of patients needing inpatient care to VA physicians. Officials at one managed care plan said that their physicians would not be likely to be receptive to such an arrangement because they would lose the ability to ensure continuity of care for their patients. Similarly, officials from another plan said that contracting only for primary care would result in veterans\u2019 seeing physicians from two different systems\u2014their plan and VA. This, they said, would make tracking their patients difficult.", "Finally, some private-sector officials believed that many providers would be reluctant to contract with VA because of their unwillingness to deal with excessive government contracting requirements and regulations."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Veterans\u2019 access to VA health care could improve significantly if medical centers employed all means at their disposal to expand access, as VA\u2019s February 1995 interim policy encourages centers to do.

Also, medical centers\u2019 decisions on how to operate new facilities\u2014directly or by contracting\u2014require the evaluation of several key factors on a facility-specific basis to ensure care is delivered in the most appropriate manner.

The officials agreed with the basic concepts in our report.

For example, they said that the availability of a large number of private-sector medical facilities does not ensure that veterans can receive needed care from such facilities, noting that veterans often need such special services as psychiatric care and rehabilitation for blindness. We revised the report to show that we focused on veterans\u2019 access to standard health care benefits. VA officials also suggested some technical changes, primarily for clarification.

The Office of Management and Budget defines a metropolitan statistical area as either (1) an area that includes at least one city with a population of at least 50,000 or (2) a Census Bureau-defined urbanized area of at least 50,000 inhabitants and a total metropolitan population of 100,000 (75,000 in New England). Metropolitan statistical areas with populations of 1 million or more are called consolidated metropolitan statistical areas if separate component areas, or primary metropolitan statistical areas, can be identified in the areas. We used the primary metropolitan statistical area rather than the consolidated metropolitan statistical area to determine whether VA had medical facilities in urban areas. For example, both Portland and Salem, Oregon, are part of the same consolidated metropolitan statistical area but are separate primary metropolitan statistical areas. VA has a medical center located in Portland, and we classified the Portland primary metropolitan statistical area as an urban area with a VA medical center. The Salem primary metropolitan statistical area has no VA facility, and we classified it as an urban area with no VA medical facilities.", "The four study locations were selected as a nonrandom judgmental sample representing VA\u2019s typical market categories and a diversity of geographic areas.
