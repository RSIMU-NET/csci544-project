As an initial step to improve its investment management capability, the department has issued a Capital Planning and Investment Control Guide, which describes its approach to IT investment management. However, it has thus far implemented few of the processes described in its own guide. In addition, it has yet to develop an adequate approach to identify existing projects and systems. In order to ensure strong investment management at all levels, the department has also specified a requirement for certifying bureau-level investment processes, but certification has not yet begun. Finally, in order to strengthen the CIO's ability to manage IT investments at all levels, the Secretary of the Interior has issued an order establishing the authority of the bureau-level CIOs; however, the order has not been fully implemented. In order to improve investment management processes, an organization needs to develop and implement a coherent plan, supported by senior management, which defines and prioritizes enhancements to its investment processes. While Interior has undertaken a number of initiatives designed to improve its investment management processes, the department has not yet developed a unified, comprehensive plan to achieve its objective of establishing effective investment management processes, nor has it committed the resources to successfully implement the necessary reforms.

Five Assistant Secretaries support the  Secretary of the Interior at the department level. One of these is  responsible for Policy, Management and Budget. The others are responsible  for mission-related matters including Land and Minerals Management,  Indian Affairs, Fish and Wildlife and Parks, and Water and Science.", "At the next level of the organization, eight bureaus, aligned with these  Assistant Secretaries, are responsible for achieving Interior\u2019s diverse  missions. Interior\u2019s missions include managing approximately 500 million  acres of land\u2014about one-fifth of the total U.S. land mass\u2014and about 1.8  billion acres of the Outer Continental Shelf; fulfilling the government\u2019s trust  responsibility to American Indians and Alaska Natives; conserving and  protecting fish and wildlife; offering recreational opportunities; managing  the National Park System; providing stewardship of energy and mineral  resources; fostering the sound use of land and water resources; helping  with the management of the National Fire Plan; ensuring the reclamation  and restoration of surface mining sites; and providing scientific  information on resource, natural hazard, and earth science issues.

These missions include law enforcement on federal and tribal lands, urban  and wildland firefighting, seismic monitoring, wildlife tracking  management of national parks, and water reclamation activities. In  contrast, Interior\u2019s Minerals Management Service owns systems that track  oil and gas production on public lands and maintains records on royalties  that are due to the federal government and to American Indian tribes.  Interior\u2019s bureaus and associated program offices propose, fund, and  manage these kinds of investments, while certain departmental offices\u2014 such as the Offices of Financial Management and Personnel Policy\u2014 propose and manage other systems that support administrative functions.

Over the last several years, we have issued a series of  reports on Interior\u2019s major IT investments and associated management  practices. In April and July of 1999, we reported that Interior had not  followed sound management practices in the early stages of its effort to  acquire the Trust Asset and Accounting Management System, a system  designed to manage Indian assets and land records. We also reported that,  as a result of poor planning, Interior could not ensure that the system  would meet financial management needs cost effectively or mitigate  system development risks adequately. In September 2000, we reported that  Interior still needed to address significant remaining risks. Among other  things, we recommended that Interior take steps to strengthen its software  development and acquisition processes and that it regularly assess the  progress being made in implementing this system.", "Between 1995 and 2001, we reported on Interior\u2019s efforts to acquire a land  and mineral case processing system called Automated Land and Mineral  Record System(ALMRS)/Modernization and raised concerns about the  Bureau of Land Management\u2019s (BLM) and the prime contractor\u2019s abilities to  complete, integrate, and test the new software system and complete the  current schedule. Among other things, we recommended that BLM take  steps to strengthen its IT investment management processes and systems  acquisition capabilities. ALMRS was terminated in 1999, but many of the  management weaknesses we had identified remained. In 2000 and 2001, we  reported that BLM had been working to implement our recommendations,  and we further recommended that BLM develop a plan to integrate all of  the corrective actions necessary to implement our recommendations and  establish a schedule for completing them.", "In August 2002, Interior\u2019s OIG reported that the department did not have a  process to ensure that IT capital investments or projects focused on  departmental mission objectives or federal government goals and  initiatives\u2014principally because of its decentralized approach to IT  investment management. The OIG further stated that only 20 investment  projects\u2014representing over 24 percent of the total\u2014were subject to  departmental review and approval in fiscal years 2002 and 2003 through  submission of capital asset plans. Therefore, about $1 billion in Interior IT  investment projects were not subject to department-level review and  approval during those 2 years.", "Consistent with these reports, OMB reported in the President\u2019s fiscal year  2003 budget that Interior was putting large sums of public funds at high risk  for failure and that it had not complied with applicable legislative  requirements that were established in the Paperwork Reduction Act of  1995 and the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996. OMB also reported that the  department had not been able to adequately identify major projects within  its IT portfolio or to demonstrate through adequate business cases the need  for all of the major projects that it did identify. In addition, out of the 23  federal agencies included in the fiscal year 2003 budget supplemental  document entitled Performance Information for Major IT Investments,  the Department of the Interior was one of only two agencies that were  unable to provide the type of information on the actual performance of  their IT investments. In the President\u00eds fiscal year 2004 budget, OMB  reported that Interior had made significant strides toward more fully  identifying its IT investments and strengthening the business cases that it  developed for major IT projects, although 20 of its 35 initial submissions  remained on OMB\u2019s at-risk list."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Information Technology Investment Management Maturity Framework", "paragraphs": ["Our IT Investment Management (ITIM) maturity framework, issued in  May 2000, is a useful tool that can help Interior to improve its IT investment  management capabilities. The ITIM framework can be used to determine  both the status of an agency\u2019s current IT investment management  capabilities and what additional steps need to be taken to put more  effective processes in place. The ITIM framework establishes a hierarchical  set of five maturity stages. Each stage builds upon the lower stages and  represents increased capabilities toward achieving both stable and  effective (and thus mature) IT investment management processes. Except  for the first stage\u2014which largely reflects ad hoc, undefined, and  undisciplined decision and oversight processes\u2014each maturity stage is  composed of critical processes that are essential to satisfying the  requirements of that stage. These critical processes are defined by key  practices that include organizational commitments (e.g., policies and  procedures), prerequisites (e.g., resource allocation), and activities (e.g.,  implementing procedures). Key practices are the specific conditions that  must be in place and tasks that must be performed for an organization to  effectively implement the necessary critical processes.", "Figure 2 shows the five ITIM stages and a brief description of each stage.", "While the ITIM framework defines critical processes and key practices in  general terms, our work at multitiered organizations, such as the Postal  Service and the Department of Justice, showed that specific roles and  responsibilities may vary by organizational tier. For example, in such  organizations, department-level management has overall responsibility for  a process, while component-level management is responsible for ensuring  that applicable requirements defined by the department are met and that  operational units such as program offices take primary responsibility for  performing the day-to-day activities that are described by ITIM, in  accordance with management expectations. In such an environment, the  presence of well-established and managed processes at lower levels of the  organization can provide a level of assurance to the department concerning  the quality and reliability of proposals for new investments, information  reported on the actual performance of projects, and budget requests.", "In an agency like Interior, in which organizations at different levels execute  various aspects of IT investment management, it is essential that top  agency management establish and oversee processes throughout the  agency to ensure that effective investment management practices are being  adhered to. Over the past decade, Congress has enacted a series of laws  that require centralized management and performance reporting to ensure  that agencies can demonstrate that they are making the best funding  decisions to support their mission needs.  The Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996  specifically requires that the head of each agency designate a CIO to  implement a process that maximizes the value and assesses and manages  the risk of IT investments. Under the Clinger-Cohen Act, the Department of  the Interior\u2019s CIO has the ultimate responsibility for ensuring the cost- effectiveness of decisions made by program managers to expend funds on  IT in support of the agency\u2019s mission needs. Therefore, even though  individual bureaus have CIOs or similar officers, the department\u2019s CIO  must monitor and evaluate the performance of its IT investment portfolio  as a whole and report to the Secretary on compliance with applicable laws  and policies."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To determine the department\u2019s capabilities for managing its information  technology (IT) investments, including its ability to effectively oversee  bureau processes, we used several different criteria.

We  applied the framework as it is described in the exposure draft, except that  we used a revised version of the IT Asset Inventory critical process, called  IT Project and System Identification, after discussion with departmental  officials at the beginning of this engagement. This revised critical process  has been used in our evaluations since June 2001.  At the start of our  evaluation, we requested that the department conduct a self-assessment  using the ITIM as criteria. Using this self-assessment and the supporting  documentation as a starting point, we worked with Interior officials to  further support their conclusions.  Based on the department\u2019s  acknowledgement that it had only executed two of the key practices in  Stage 3, we did not independently assess the capabilities at this stage or at  Stages 4 and 5 of the framework. In our evaluation, an ITIM key practice  was rated as \u201cexecuted\u201d only when we found sufficient evidence that the  practice was already in place at the time of the review.

In order to evaluate  the success of the department\u2019s oversight activities, we also assessed the  capabilities of Interior\u2019s components. To determine the capabilities of the  components, we collected documentation describing bureau CPIC and  investment management processes and spoke with responsible officials at  eight bureaus (the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Bureau of Land  Management, the Bureau of Reclamation, the Minerals Management  Service, the National Park Service, the Office of Surface Mining  Reclamation and Enforcement, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and the  U.S. Geological Survey) and the National Business Center.", "To assess Interior\u2019s plans for improving its IT investment management  processes\u2014including oversight of bureau processes\u2014and to identify  potential barriers to their implementation, we obtained and evaluated  documents showing what management actions had been taken and what  initiatives had been planned by the department.

In addition, opportunities to  consolidate projects or systems and avoid redundant investments may be  found when proposals are evaluated in this context. The information that  could be used in this analysis includes current and planned system  functions, physical location, organizational owners, and how funds are  being expended toward acquiring, maintaining, and deploying these assets.", "A project and system inventory can take many forms and does not have to  be centrally located or consolidated.

In multitiered organizations, information from an IT project  and system inventory should be accessible and relevant to the decision  processes of boards at all levels of the organization that are responsible for  ITIM activities. An IT project and system inventory is also essential to  successfully implementing certain other critical processes, including IT  Project Oversight and Proposal Selection, and developing a comprehensive  IT investment portfolio.", "According to the ITIM framework, organizations at the Stage 2 level of  maturity allocate adequate resources for tracking IT projects and systems,  designate responsibility for managing the project and system identification  process, and develop related written policies and procedures. Resources  required for this purpose typically include managerial attention to the  process; staff; supporting tools, such as an inventory database; inventory  reporting, updating, and query tools; and a method for communicating  inventory changes to affected parties. Stage 2 organizations also maintain  information on their IT projects and systems in one or more inventories  according to written procedures, recording changes in data as required,  and maintaining historical records.

It does not have any written standards or existing  repositories of information on Interior\u2019s IT investments that meet ITIM  standards, and it has not assigned responsibility or allocated resources for  this purpose. In April 2003, departmental officials indicated that they are  planning to use the Exhibit 53 report they prepared for OMB as their IT  project and system inventory.

As a result, Interior\u2019s IT investment boards do  not currently have the information they need to make well-informed  decisions regarding selecting, controlling, and evaluating investment  decisions. Without information from such an inventory, the department-  and bureau-level boards cannot ensure that duplication among existing and  proposed IT investments is eliminated. In addition, the boards cannot  compare actual project performance with expectations and determine  whether corrective actions should be taken.", "Table 4 summarizes our ratings for each key practice.", "According to the ITIM framework, effective project oversight requires,  among other things, (1) having written policies and procedures for project  management; (2) developing and maintaining an approved management  plan for each IT project; (3) having written policies and procedures for  oversight of IT projects; (4) making up-to-date cost and schedule data for  each project available to the oversight boards; (5) reviewing each project\u2019s  performance by regularly comparing actual cost and schedule data to  expectations; (6) ensuring that corrective actions for each under- performing project are documented, agreed to, implemented, and tracked  until the desired outcome is achieved; and (7) using information from the  IT projects and systems inventory. (The complete list of key practices is  provided in table 5.) For all IT projects, performance reviews should be  conducted at least at each major life cycle milestone.

As a  result, the department has no mechanisms for ensuring that up-to-date  information on actual costs and schedule are being provided to the IT  investment boards. Finally, Interior lacks an IT projects and systems  inventory to capture performance information that can be used by its  boards in the investment decision process.", "According to Interior officials, the department is not executing many of the  key practices for Stage 2 IT project oversight because it currently relies on  the bureaus to perform these management functions. However, since the  department has not developed policies and procedures for the bureaus to  follow in conducting IT project oversight, Interior is running the risk that  under performing projects will not be reported to the appropriate IT  investment board.

Because  nonmajor projects comprised approximately 67 percent of Interior\u2019s  projects and 45 percent of its total IT expenditures in fiscal year 2003,  business needs were not captured for many of Interior\u2019s projects. The  department was also unable to demonstrate that identified users  participated in project management throughout a project\u2019s life cycle.", "Office of Chief Information Officer (OCIO) officials explained that the  department has not provided oversight of the process of identifying  business needs, because it has historically relied on its IT investment  sponsors to determine the business needs of the investments.

In such  organizations, the CIO has been positioned for success, having been  assigned clearly defined roles, responsibilities, and accountabilities.  Because Interior has multiple levels of IT investment management  authority, it is especially critical that the roles, responsibilities, and  accountabilities of all the CIOs be clearly defined.", "In 2002, Interior contracted with Science Applications International  Corporation (SAIC) to study the department and bureau CIO organizations  and determine whether it was in compliance with the requirements of the  Clinger-Cohen Act.

The study pointed to a general lack of  authority and resource control at the bureau level as well, which further  inhibited the CIO\u2019s ability to function. According to SAIC, in most of the  bureaus, the CIOs lacked the authority to effect change among their  subordinate IT staff and decision areas because they cannot allocate or  withdraw funds and do not control hiring, training, or performance  appraisals. On the basis of these findings, SAIC recommended that Interior  establish formal lines of authority from the department\u2019s CIO to the bureau  CIOs and to IT staff at lower levels.", "On the basis of the SAIC study, and because of its desire to comply with the  Clinger-Cohen Act, Interior issued Secretarial Order 3244, which  acknowledged that authority and control over management of IT resources  had not been fully established or coordinated in the department, resulting  in significant variability among bureaus and offices in implementing IT  functions and setting funding priorities. To rectify this situation, the order  provides broad authorities to all of Interior\u2019s CIOs.

On January 15, 2003, the department CIO issued  a memorandum that called for the bureaus to immediately begin  implementing more formal IT processes, using the CPIC Guide. The  department held training sessions in which bureaus were informed that the  Exhibit 300s they provide to the department for review as part of the  annual budget formulation process must first be reviewed by their own IT  investment review boards.

G&B Solutions was then contracted to further elaborate and  validate the earlier work, focusing on technical solutions and CIO  authorities.
