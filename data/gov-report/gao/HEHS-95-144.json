In this context, vocational education remains an especially important tool for ensuring that entry-level workers are fully prepared for the labor market.", "The Carl D. Perkins Vocational Education Act of 1984 (P.L. 98-524) provides federal support for vocational education at both the secondary (high school) and postsecondary levels. In 1990, the Congress amended the Perkins Act to realign national priorities for vocational education. In these amendments, the Congress encouraged several types of vocational education approaches that are designed to provide students with a better understanding of how schoolwork relates to job requirements. In addition, the amendments removed a requirement that 57 percent of Perkins funding be set aside for services to students from special populations\u2014including students with disabilities, economically disadvantaged students, and students with limited English proficiency.The amendments do require that states\u2019 vocational education plans provide special population students with equal access to vocational education programs and services; in addition, the amendments direct districts to allocate Perkins funds so as to give priority to sites or programs that have higher concentrations of special population students. Nonetheless, some individuals were concerned that removal of the set-aside requirement would reduce special population students\u2019 access to vocational education.", "In response to a mandate in the amendments, we compared student participation and program features in high school (secondary level) vocational education programs in school year 1993-94 (after enactment of the amendments) with 1990-91 (before enactment of the amendments). A companion report will address changes at the postsecondary level.  Specifically, this report addresses the following questions:", "For students from special population groups, what changes have taken place in (1) participation in vocational education, including participation in innovative programs; (2) availability of support services; and (3) college attendance and employment following graduation?", "For vocational education programs, to what extent have schools and school districts adopted recommended approaches to enhance quality\u2014such as (1) school-to-work transition activities, (2) integration of academic and vocational learning, (3) development of competency standards for students, and (4) increased use of quality indicators for program assessment?", "We collected information for this study through two surveys. To obtain information for 1990-91, and again for 1993-94, we mailed questionnaires to a nationally representative sample of public secondary schools and their associated central district offices. For the schools and districts that responded to both surveys, we determined what changes had taken place (1) among students from special populations and (2) in vocational education programs. To supplement our survey data, we visited four school districts. (Details on our scope and methodology are in app. I, and detailed information about our results is in app. II. Apps. III and IV contain the aggregate responses to the two surveys.)"], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Vocational education prepares students for an increasingly demanding labor market through an organized sequence of courses that are directly related to preparing students for employment in jobs that do not require a bachelor\u2019s degree. For example, one school district offers high school students the opportunity to acquire the technical skills needed for careers in fields like automobile repair, medical assisting, or electronics.", "Vocational education programs are funded at the federal, state, and local levels. Funding provided under the 1984 Perkins Act is the federal government\u2019s primary form of assistance for vocational education. Although federal financing accounts for only a small percentage of expenditures on vocational education, the Perkins Act provided about $1.4 billion in 1993-94, compared with approximately $1 billion in 1990-91.", "In addition to eliminating the set-aside requirement for special populations, the Perkins Act amendments included several provisions intended to improve the quality of vocational education. To help ensure that programs are of sufficient size and scope to be effective, the amendments set minimum funding thresholds at the secondary school level. School districts that would have received funding allocations of less than $15,000 under the original Perkins Act are now generally ineligible for funds unless they join other districts in a consortium in which the total funding meets the $15,000 minimum.", "The amendments also encourage several approaches to vocational education that smooth the transition from school to work. In 1993-94, Perkins funding included $104 million for tech-prep programs, which link secondary vocational education programs to postsecondary institutions in a coordinated program leading to an associate\u2019s degree or certificate. For example, one school district operates a tech-prep program in allied health services that prepares students for a career as a Medical Assistant, Emergency Medical Technician, or Surgical Technologist.", "The Perkins amendments also encourage schools and districts to integrate vocational and academic instruction, so that vocational students can develop a better appreciation of how academic learning is related to job requirements. In addition, the amendments require recipients (schools and districts) to evaluate the effectiveness of their vocational education programs and in particular to evaluate the progress of special population students. For example, placement data on high school graduates can indicate whether students have continued their education or obtained employment in their field."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Removal of Set-Aside Requirement Does Not Appear to Have Hurt Special Population Students", "paragraphs": ["Despite widespread concern, removal of the set-aside requirement has apparently had no adverse impact on special population students.

In 1993-94, 42 percent of all students participated in vocational education, compared with 45 percent in 1990-91. This decline in overall participation was reflected in small, statistically insignificant declines in participation among students with disabilities (from 48 to 47 percent) and among students who were disadvantaged (from 53 to 50 percent). (See fig. 1.)", "Not only did students from special populations continue to participate in vocational education, but these students could be found in the full range of vocational education activities, including school-to-work transition activities. Since the implementation of the amendments, more schools have offered tech-prep programs; schools have also continued to offer work-study and apprenticeship opportunities. When comparing students from special populations with other students, we observed no significant differences in participation in these activities either before or after the amendments. For example, in 1993-94, 16.8 percent of disadvantaged students\u2014and 16 percent of students who did not belong to special population groups\u2014participated in tech-prep.

For example, the percentage of schools that offered transportation services to students with disabilities increased dramatically (from 59 to 74 percent). These students\u2019 access to teacher aides, tutoring, and life skills training also rose significantly. For students not in special population groups, there was a significant increase in the percentage of schools offering tutoring (from 52 to 66 percent).", "In some support areas, special population students were more likely to be offered additional services than students who did not belong to these groups (see fig. 2). For example, in 1993-94 students from any of the three special population groups were significantly more likely to be offered teacher aides than students who did not come from any of these groups. However, for many of the remaining support services, the differences between the various groups of students were small and statistically insignificant. Across all student groups, in 1993-94 schools were most likely to offer counseling or guidance, tutoring, evaluation or assessment, life skills training, and special recruitment; over two-thirds of schools offered these services. Day care was offered less frequently (by less than one-sixth of schools).

This pattern is evident in both our 1990-91 and 1993-94 surveys. In general, these differences neither widened nor narrowed over time. For example, the proportion of disadvantaged vocational students who expected to attend a 4-year college was 14 percent in 1990-91 and 13 percent in 1993-94\u2014a statistically insignificant change. However, many schools were unable to provide placement information, and this low response rate limited our ability to observe changes in postgraduation status.

The sponsors of the Perkins amendments believed that these approaches would improve the quality of vocational education by easing the transition from school to work and by ensuring that students apply cognitive skills in a vocational education environment. For similar reasons, vocational education experts have advised schools and districts to emphasize school-to-work transition activities. We observed many schools and districts moving aggressively to implement several of these approaches. However, other recommendations (such as using academic teachers in vocational classes) have been slower to gain acceptance. Many of the attributes associated with quality programs still affect only a small percentage of vocational education students. Similarly, although districts have increased their use of quality indicators for self-assessment, many districts have not yet developed standards to guide these assessments."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Schools and Districts Increased Use of Quality Approaches, but Relatively Few Students Were Served", "paragraphs": ["Schools have moved aggressively to increase several of the approaches to vocational education associated with quality\u2014such as integrated learning and tech-prep programs. For example, in 1993-94 35 percent of all schools reported that to a \u201cgreat\u201d or \u201cvery great\u201d extent they were participating in teacher training activities designed to integrate academics into vocational education, compared with 20 percent or less in 1990-91 (see fig. 3). Even more dramatically, the percentage of schools offering tech-prep programs increased significantly in just 2 years: in 1990-91 only 27 percent of schools offered tech-prep, but by 1993-94 that figure had jumped to 45 percent (see fig. 4). For example, when we visited one district in 1990, officials were planning their tech-prep program. In 1991-92, they formed a tech-prep consortium, including 10 school districts. When we visited again in 1993-94, two more districts had joined the consortium and the first tech-prep program was under way. The consortium hopes to have 200 tech-prep students entering affiliated postsecondary institutions by September 1996.", "Acceptance of the integrated learning and tech-prep concepts has grown substantially. However, many more students will need to be exposed to these approaches before they become a standard part of vocational education. Less than half of the schools we surveyed employed several practices, such as team teaching, that bring integrated learning into the classroom. In one school we visited, informal cooperation among teachers facilitated integration\u2014for example, the teacher of a course in computer-aided design invited the physics teacher into his classroom to explain some of the physics elements in computer-aided design. However, another district we visited was unable to implement the integrated learning concept to the extent that its administrators would have liked. These officials told us that teacher credentialing requirements at the state level prevented vocational teachers from teaching academic subjects, and contracting arrangements limited teachers\u2019 incentives to participate in summer training.", "Similarly, despite sizable increases in the number of schools and students participating in tech-prep programs, only 16 percent of vocational students in 1993-94 were participating in tech-prep. In addition, other methods for improving the school-to-work transition\u2014such as work study and apprenticeships\u2014have not grown significantly since the Perkins amendments were implemented (see fig. 4). These programs also reach only a small number of students; only 16 percent of vocational students participated in work-study programs in 1993-94, although 74 percent of schools reported that they offer a work-study program.", "In addition to integrated learning and school-to-work activities, experts in vocational education have urged schools to develop certificates of competency and to require students to meet minimum standards or competencies to complete the program. These initiatives have been slow to develop since the Perkins amendments; both the percentage of schools that reported issuing certificates and the number of programs that required competencies remained roughly constant between 1990-91 and 1993-94."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Districts Report Using More Quality Indicators for Self-Assessment", "paragraphs": ["School districts reported an increase in the use of various measures in their self-assessment process.

The schools we visited, however, reported that it was difficult and time consuming to gather this type of information. For example, one school district attempted to contact recent graduates by mail but received only a 25-percent response rate. In addition, despite this increased use of information for self-assessment, many schools have yet to develop standards to guide these assessments. For example, 71 percent of schools used measures of students\u2019 academic gains as an input into their assessment process. However, only 69 percent of the schools that used this measure had developed standards that would allow them to determine if students\u2019 academic progress was satisfactory.

Consequently, we compared the status of special population students and vocational education programs before the amendments with their status after the amendments. Specifically, we measured the extent to which changes have occurred for students, in participation in vocational education, including participation in innovative programs; availability of special services; and college attendance and employment following graduation; for vocational education programs, in schools\u2019 and districts\u2019 use of formal coordination of high school and college courses; integration of academic and vocational learning; and development of competency standards for students."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Average Differences Across Schools Were Used to Measure Changes", "paragraphs": ["To address these objectives, we used panel data from two surveys administered to a nationally representative, stratified, randomly selected set of schools and their associated districts.

The findings were then averaged across all schools that had responded to that item. The advantage of this approach is that small changes in the variables of interest are more easily identified than if separate studies were made using two or more independent samples. In addition, by comparing the data for just those schools that responded, we are able to report the average responses without concern that the averages are contaminated by changes in the composition of the respondents.", "The major disadvantage of the panel approach is that when nonresponse occurs, the data are no longer representative of national averages. The requirement that a school must have answered both surveys gives us a smaller response rate than had we used the mean values from both surveys independently.
