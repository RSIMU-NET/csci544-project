Superfund money may also be used to address the immediate health threats from other releases of hazardous substances through shorter-term measures (referred to as \u201cremoval actions\u201d).

When EPA pays for the cleanup, the work is conducted by a private contractor who is either directly hired by EPA, another federal entity, or a state.", "Superfund contractors study and design cleanups, as well as manage and implement physical cleanup actions. Physical cleanup actions include both remedial and removal actions. Remedial actions are long-term comprehensive cleanups at the nation\u2019s worst hazardous waste sites (known as National Priorities List sites). Removal actions tend to be shorter-term measures that usually occur at sites not on the National Priorities List, such as a cleanup when a truck spills hazardous wastes onto a highway. During fiscal years 1996-97, about 65 percent of the funds spent on physical cleanup actions went for remedial actions and the remainder went for removal actions.", "When EPA administers a remedial action, it typically uses an architect and engineering firm as the prime contractor to provide the professional services needed to direct the cleanup. However, this firm typically does not physically implement the cleanup, such as moving soil or treating groundwater. Instead, the architect and engineering firm hires subcontractors (referred to as \u201cpool subcontractors\u201d) to perform the physical cleanup work. In contrast, when the Corps undertakes a remedial action, the prime contractor may perform some of the physical cleanup.", "Once the construction work on a remedial action is completed, the site often requires subsequent operations and maintenance (O&M) activities.

However, in updating this information, we found that both the amount and share of spending for contractor cleanup work declined from about 49 percent in fiscal year 1996 ($695 million) to about 46 percent in fiscal 1997 ($664 million). Between fiscal years 1996 and 1997, EPA\u2019s Superfund costs for administration and support activities increased by 3 percent of total Superfund spending\u2014from about 21 percent ($299 million) in fiscal 1996 to about 24 percent ($355 million) in fiscal 1997. The relative share of spending for other Superfund cost categories remained about the same between fiscal years 1996 and 1997. Figure 1 provides a comparison of the amount and share of Superfund spending for various cost categories in the 2 fiscal years.", "The cost categories used in figure 1 were derived from the codes that EPA\u2019s Office of the Comptroller uses to account for the expenditure of Superfund money. Costs shown in the \u201ccleanup actions\u201d category consist of contractor spending to perform remedial and removal actions. In fiscal year 1996, this spending included about $419 million for remedial actions and $196 million for removal actions. In fiscal year 1997, this spending included about $360 million for remedial actions and $228 million for removal actions. The costs shown in the \u201cstudy and design\u201d category consist of contractor spending to study and design remedial actions. Spending for other program activities covers (1) \u201cdirectly related\u201d costs, for activities such as EPA\u2019s salaries and travel for overseeing cleanups and the costs associated with screening sites for inclusion on the National Priorities List; (2) \u201cenforcement\u201d costs related to EPA oversight of responsible parties\u2019 cleanups and costs for negotiating and settling with responsible parties; (3) research and development, and laboratory analysis (RD/Lab), including the costs of EPA\u2019s scientists, innovative technology programs, and the evaluation of hazardous waste samples; and (4) administration and support, including indirect program costs, such as those for rent, utilities, and accounting systems.", "EPA stated that the increase in spending for administration and support between fiscal years 1996 and 1997 can be attributed to normal spending fluctuations for items such as rental payments and other infrastructure needs, and to possible accounting changes. Our review of Superfund spending over the last 11 years indicates that spending for administration and support fluctuated between 18 percent and 25 percent during fiscal years 1987-91.

As figure 2 shows, the Corps managed the largest portion of this spending during fiscal years 1996-97 (about 65 percent of the spending during the 2-year period). One reason for this is that the Corps manages the more expensive projects. EPA\u2019s policy is that remedial action projects estimated to have a total cost of $15 million or more should generally be handled by the Corps (because of its long experience in managing construction contractors). Accordingly, most of the contractor spending managed by the Corps is attributable to several large-dollar projects.", "State governments collectively managed about 17 percent of contractor spending during fiscal years 1996-97. EPA managed about 13 percent of contractor spending during the 2 fiscal years. The Department of the Interior managed a small portion of contractor spending (about 5 percent), primarily for mining cleanups."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Contractor Costs for Remedial Actions Managed by EPA or the Corps", "paragraphs": ["Nationwide, about 71 percent of contractor spending for remedial actions managed by EPA during fiscal years 1996-97 went to the physical implementation of the cleanups.

For the two remedial action projects where information was available from the Corps, about 69 percent of contractor spending during fiscal years 1996-97 went to the physical implementation of the cleanups. We could not determine if these results are typical of the Corps\u2019 projects, however, because these two projects accounted for only 16 percent of the Corps\u2019 spending for contractors during fiscal years 1996-97. The information needed to divide contractor spending for remedial actions between physical implementation of the cleanups and other expenses was generally unavailable for the contracts administered by the Corps. (See footnote 2.)"], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Contractor Spending Managed by EPA", "paragraphs": ["For the remedial action projects performed by EPA\u2019s contractors, we found that, nationwide, about 71 percent of contractor spending during 1996-97 went to the subcontractors who physically perform the cleanup work. However, we found a wide range in the percentage of contractor spending that went to the physical implementation of the cleanups among EPA\u2019s 10 regions\u2014from a low of 6 percent in region 1 to a high of 80 percent in region 6. We discussed these differences with EPA\u2019s regional project officials to identify the reasons for the wide range in the share of spending for the physical implementation of the cleanups.", "The EPA regional officials told us that the primary reason for this wide range is the stage of the cleanup projects in the regions during the 2-year period of our analysis. At the beginning and end of a remedial action, administrative costs and fees are relatively high, while physical implementation costs are relatively low. EPA\u2019s regional project officials explained that at the beginning of a remedial action, the prime contractor has to perform such tasks as developing a work plan, a project budget, and a health and safety plan. Also, the prime contractor has to hire the subcontractors who will physically implement the work, which involves advertising the work, as well as obtaining and analyzing bids. At the end of a remedial action, according to EPA\u2019s project officials, the prime contractor has to ensure that the subcontractors have satisfactorily completed their work, and the prime contractor must comply with the administrative requirements for the project\u2019s completion, such as writing reports and preparing for the final financial audit of the project. Additionally, once EPA has assessed the prime contractor\u2019s performance in carrying out the remedial work, EPA pays final fees to the contractor.", "For example, spending for the physical implementation of cleanups was low in EPA\u2019s region 1 during fiscal years 1996-97 because the region\u2019s spending for remedial actions was for three projects that were almost completed. For two of the projects, most of the spending was for performance fees that EPA awarded the contractor at the end of the project. For the third project, most of the costs were for the prime contractor\u2019s administrative functions related to closing out the project.", "EPA\u2019s regional officials told us that over the life of remedial action projects, the beginning and ending administrative costs are balanced by the relatively high percentage of physical remediation costs incurred during the middle phases of the cleanup. To verify this explanation, we analyzed the cumulative remedial action spending for the life of the projects included in our review (those with spending of $10,000 or more in either fiscal year 1996 or 1997). We found that, nationwide, 70 percent of the cumulative project spending went to the physical implementation of the cleanups, about the same share that went to physical implementation during fiscal years 1996-97. The individual regions that had relatively low percentages of spending for physical implementation during fiscal years 1996-97 had much higher percentages of such spending over the life of their projects, thus corroborating the explanation provided by EPA\u2019s regional officials. For example, in region 1 while only 6 percent of the spending had been for physical implementation during fiscal years 1996-97, 75 percent of the spending was for physical implementation over the life of the same projects. (See fig. 3.)", "R Because EPA regions 3 and 10 had the lowest cumulative shares of contractor spending for the physical implementation of cleanups, we discussed these results with project officials from these regions. The officials told us that a couple of factors help to explain these results. In some cases, the remedial actions were still in such an early stage that even on a cumulative basis, little spending had occurred for physical implementation. In other cases, the remedial action project was to construct a groundwater treatment facility. According to EPA\u2019s project officials, unlike soil remediation, which involves massive construction work, the physical construction work for a groundwater treatment facility is typically limited to the installation of wells. While the physical implementation charges are relatively lower for this type of project, the prime contractor typically incurs significant charges for its engineers to oversee a well\u2019s installation and ensure that the well will function properly.", "While 71 percent of contractor cleanup charges in fiscal years 1996-97 went to pool subcontractors for physically implementing the cleanup work, the remainder was retained by the prime contractors for other expenses related to overseeing and managing the cleanups. During fiscal years 1996-97, 29 percent of contractor spending for remedial actions went for these other expenses, as follows:", "Professional labor needed to oversee and manage cleanups (8 percent).", "Travel associated with the professional labor (1 percent).", "Fringe benefits associated with the professional labor (1 percent).", "Overhead, such as rent and utilities for on-site space (7 percent).", "General and administrative expenses, such as salaries for upper management and corporate office costs (3 percent).", "Fees, including money paid to the contractor to motivate good performance (5 percent).", "Technical assistance subcontractors who provide professional expertise beyond the prime contractor\u2019s expertise (1 percent).", "Other costs, such as office and technical equipment, reports, and messenger service (3 percent).", "Appendix I provides a further explanation of these cost categories and a detailed account of EPA\u2019s contractor spending, by region."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Contractor Spending Managed by the Corps", "paragraphs": ["During fiscal years 1996-97, only 2 of the about 70 remedial actions with significant charges by the Corps\u2019 contractors ($10,000 or more in spending during either year) were billed on a cost-reimbursement basis, thus allowing us to analyze the share of contractor spending for physical cleanups. In managing Superfund cleanup contractors, the Corps has traditionally used \u201cfixed-price\u201d contracts. Under this type of contract, the Corps negotiates a firm price with the contractor for the work to be performed. The contractor then charges the government for completed portions of the work. However, fixed-price billings do not yield the detailed accounting of costs needed for the type of analysis we performed in this review.", "The Corps\u2019 contractors charged almost $76 million for these two projects during fiscal years 1996-97. Of this amount, about 69 percent (or $52 million) went to the physical implementation of the cleanups. For the two projects individually, we found that 71 and 48 percent of the contractor charges, respectively, during the past 2 fiscal years went to the physical implementation of the cleanups. We also found that the shares of spending that went to the physical cleanups during the entire life of these remedial actions were 70 and 51 percent, respectively. (Both projects were almost complete at the end of fiscal year 1997.) The Corps official managing these two projects told us that the second project had a lower portion of spending for physical cleanup because the project involved groundwater remediation, which entails less construction work and more prime contractor engineering services.", "Appendix II provides a detailed accounting of contractor spending for these two projects.

This report\u2019s analysis was primarily focused on the Superfund spending that goes for the physical implementation of remedial action cleanups. Therefore, our analysis necessarily focused on contractor cleanup spending because this is the only Superfund cost category that includes physical implementation costs. We do not dispute the fact that the other activities cited by EPA are related to the cleanup process, but they do not encompass physical implementation of site cleanups.", "In addition, EPA attributed the increase in administration and support costs to normal spending fluctuations.
