In carrying out their mission, some FBOs prefer to hire individuals who share their religious beliefs. Although the 1964 Civil Rights Act prohibits employment discrimination based on religion, section 702(a) of the Act exempts FBOs from this prohibition, thereby allowing them to hire based on religion. However, some federal grant programs contain statutory restrictions prohibiting this practice. Since a 2007 DOJ legal opinion, federal agencies allow faith-based grantees to use RFRA as a basis for seeking an exemption to allow religious-based hiring.", "GAO was asked to review the extent to which faith-based grantees have sought RFRA exemptions from statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring. This report describes (1) what is known about faith-based grantees that have certified exemption from statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring, per RFRA, since 2007; and (2) how agencies inform grantees of statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring and requirements for demonstrating their eligibility for an exemption.", "GAO reviewed information from DOJ, HHS, and DOL grantees from fiscal years 2007 to 2015 that were subject to statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring. GAO interviewed faith-based grantees that certified as exempt and a selection of those that did not. GAO also reviewed agency grant documentation and guidance provided to grantees and interviewed cognizant officials to understand the processes FBOs must follow to certify as exempt."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["From fiscal years 2007 through 2015, few faith-based grantees sought an exemption based on the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA) from nondiscrimination laws related to religious-based hiring. Specifically, GAO found that the Department of Justice (DOJ), Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and Department of Labor (DOL) awarded funding to at least 2,586 grantees through at least 53 grant programs containing nondiscrimination hiring restrictions during this time. The number of relevant grant programs could be higher, because GAO could not identify all such programs due to data limitations. Across the 3 agencies, GAO identified 117 grantees that were potential Faith-Based Organizations (FBOs). Of the 117 potential FBOs, 9 DOJ grantees were FBOs that certified as being exempt from statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring. GAO interviewed 6 of these FBOs, all of which stated that hiring individuals who share their religious beliefs was critical to their mission, and that had the RFRA exemption not been available to them, they likely would not have sought the grant.", "DOJ, DOL, and HHS inform grant applicants and recipients of statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring and processes for obtaining an exemption from such restrictions generally through grant materials. DOJ and DOL also provide relevant information on their web sites. All three agencies require grantees that seek to make employment decisions based on religion to self-certify that they meet requirements to be eligible for an exemption, but vary in how they review and approve requests for exemptions. For example, DOJ, DOL, and HHS have policies requiring grantees to submit their exemption self-certification, but only DOL reviews exemption requests and either approves them or provides a reason for denial."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Each year the federal government provides billions of dollars to  organizations that provide social services to needy families and  individuals. Some of these funds are provided through competitive grants  to faith-based organizations (FBOs), which may include religious groups,  like churches, mosques, synagogues, and temples, or charitable  organizations affiliated with religious groups.", "In some instances, FBOs believe it is necessary to only hire individuals  who share their religious beliefs in order to carry out their mission. Title  VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits employment discrimination  based on religion, as well as other factors such as race, color, sex, and  national origin. However, section 702(a) of the Act exempts FBOs with  respect to basing employment decisions on religion, thereby permitting  FBOs to intentionally, and exclusively, hire individuals who share their  religious beliefs. In light of section 702(a), FBOs that receive federal  grant funding have generally been permitted to make employment  decisions based on religion. There are, however, certain federal grant  programs that are subject to statutory restrictions that prohibit grant  recipients from using grant funding, in whole or in part, to discriminate or  deny employment on the basis of religion, among other factors.", "In 2005, the Office of Justice Programs (OJP) within the Department of  Justice (DOJ) awarded grant funding to World Vision, a FBO, under a  program that was subject to a statutory provision that prohibited recipients  from considering religion when making employment decisions in  connection with the grant. World Vision had a policy to hire only Christian  staff in order to maintain its identity as a Christian organization. OJP  informed World Vision about the grant program\u2019s statutory restriction,  which prohibited religious-based hiring. World Vision petitioned OJP  arguing that it should be exempted from the statutory restriction based on  the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA). Although RFRA  does not explicitly address religious-based hiring, under RFRA, the  government may not substantially burden a person\u2019s exercise of religion,  unless it can prove a compelling interest in doing so. World Vision  argued that being required to comply with the restriction substantially  burdened its exercise of religion and that the government did not have a  compelling interest in prohibiting World Vision from making religious- based hiring decisions. In response, DOJ\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel (OLC)  issued an opinion in June 2007 stating that RFRA could be reasonably  construed to require OJP to exempt World Vision from the statutory  requirement restricting federal grantees from hiring on the basis of  religion. Pursuant to this OLC opinion, and RFRA, certain federal  agencies have permitted FBOs that receive funding under a program that  is subject to a statutory restriction on religious-based hiring to certify that  they are exempt from such restrictions.", "Since OLC issued this opinion, however, the extent to which faith-based  grantees have certified that they are exempt from statutory restrictions on  religious-based hiring is not readily available. You asked us to examine  the extent of use and the various procedures regarding these exemptions.  This report addresses the following questions:  1.  What is known about faith-based grantees that have certified that they  are exempt from statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring, per  RFRA, since 2007?  2.  What processes do selected federal agencies use to notify grantees  about statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring and the related  exemption, per RFRA, and what processes do agencies require FBOs  to follow to demonstrate they are eligible for an exemption?", "In conducting our work, we reviewed the RFRA, the OLC opinion, laws  and regulations related to religious-based hiring, and our prior work on  the federal government\u2019s efforts to monitor FBOs and their performance.  We sought to include federal agencies that, because of their mission, may  be likely to provide funding to FBOs. Therefore, we selected the five  agencies required by Executive Order 13198 to establish a Center for  Faith-Based and Community Initiatives: DOJ, Department of Education  (Education), Department of Health and Human Services (HHS),  Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and Department  of Labor (DOL). These centers were established in each department to  help the federal government coordinate a national effort to expand  opportunities for faith-based and other community organizations and  strengthen their capacity to meet social needs in American communities.", "To address our first objective, we asked each agency to identify any  grantees that certified they were exempt from statutory restrictions on  religious-based hiring. We also asked each agency to identify all grant  programs that met the following criteria\u2014the grant program was subject  to a statutory restriction on religious-based hiring; nonprofits, including  FBOs, were eligible to be primary recipients of the grant funding; and  funding was awarded during fiscal years 2007 through 2015. We selected  this timeframe because it covered the period immediately after the OLC  opinion was issued through the most recent fiscal year for which grant  awards had been announced at the start of our review. We subsequently  removed Education and HUD from our scope after the agencies reported  that they did not have any grant programs that met our criteria.", "We could not determine the complete universe of FBOs that are eligible  to be primary recipients of grant funding or the amount of federal funds  they receive because DOJ, DOL, and HHS do not maintain, and are not  required to maintain, information on whether or not an organization is an  FBO. Also, there is no formal, federal-level definition of FBOs, which  makes it difficult to identify and count them. In addition, DOJ was unable  to identify the total number of grant programs from fiscal years 2007  through 2015 that were subject to nondiscrimination provisions and for  which nonprofits, including FBOs, were eligible to be primary recipients of  grant funding, in time for our review. As a result, the information we  received may not represent the complete number of DOJ grant programs  and grantees subject to the provisions; therefore, we use the term \u201cat  least\u201d in our report because the number of relevant grant programs could  be higher.", "Because DOJ\u2019s OJP and Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS)  components, DOL, and HHS do not collect information on which grantees  are FBOs and potentially eligible for an exemption, we sought other ways  to identify potential FBOs. After reviewing Internal Revenue Service (IRS)  documents, in particular IRS Publication 4838, Instructions for Requesting  Information on Exempt Organizations (Effective January 2010), we  determined that the IRS collects and maintains data on tax-exempt  organizations that could indicate whether the organizations are faith- based. In addition, DOJ\u2019s Office on Violence Against Women (OVW)  component utilized progress reports that allow grantees to self-identify as  FBOs. We asked DOJ, DOL, and HHS to provide information, including  name, contact information, and Employer Identification Number (EIN), for  all of the grantees that received funding for each of the grant programs  that met our criteria. Additionally, we contracted with LexisNexis to  provide us with the relevant IRS data for each of the grantees. We  analyzed the IRS data to determine which grantees had at least one faith- based indicator; and for the purpose of our review, we refer to such  grantees as potential FBOs. If DOJ, DOL, or HHS had potential FBOs,  we provided the agency with a list of these grantees and asked them to  confirm whether any of these grantees certified that they were exempt  from statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring.", "We contacted all nine of the grantees that the agencies identified as  having certified that they were exempt, and six responded to our interview  requests. These interviews yielded information on how the grantees  certified that they were exempt from restrictions on religious-based hiring;  why they determined it was important to hire someone who shared their  religious beliefs; and what they would have done had the exemption  option not been available to them. Additionally, we contacted all 35  potential faith-based grantees we identified that agencies reported had  not filed a self-certification to be exempted from religious-based hiring  restrictions that were awarded funding in fiscal years 2014 and 2015  through any of the grant programs that met our criteria. We selected this  timeframe to increase the likelihood that grantees would be able to recall  the details of the grant application process. Five of the 35 potential faith- based grantees responded to our interview request. We interviewed these  faith-based grantees to discuss, among other things, whether the  grantees were familiar with the exemption option and why they decided  not to seek the exemption.", "To address our second objective, we obtained and reviewed grant  solicitations, language of the relevant statutory restrictions, grant  applications, agency policies, and exemption documentation submitted by  faith-based grantees. To better understand the agencies\u2019 familiarity with  the OLC opinion and the processes the agencies have in place to accept  and review exemption documentation, we interviewed agency officials  and attorneys from DOJ, DOL, and HHS.", "We conducted this performance audit from April 2016 to October 2017 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
