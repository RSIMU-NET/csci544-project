In 2016, DOE completed a long-term strategic review of the SPR after its last comprehensive examination was conducted in 2005. The 2016 review examined the benefits of several SPR sizes, but it did not identify an optimal size and was limited in several ways. In particular, in the review, DOE did not fully consider recent and expected future changes in market conditions, such as the implications of projected fluctuations in net imports or the role of the private sector in responding to supply disruptions. These changes have contributed to SPR and private reserves reaching historically high levels on a net imports basis. These changes are expected to continue to evolve, and according to government projections, the United States will become a net exporter in the late 2020s before again becoming a net importer between 2040 and 2050. GAO has found that agencies should reexamine their programs if conditions change. GAO recommended that DOE supplement its 2016 review by conducting an additional analysis, and take actions to ensure the agency periodically conducts a strategic review of the SPR. DOE generally agreed with these recommendations.", "DOE has taken steps to account for congressionally mandated sales of SPR crude oil in its $1.4 billion modernization plans for SPR's infrastructure and facilities. However, DOE's current plans, developed in 2016, are based on information largely developed prior to recent congressionally mandated sales of an additional 117 million barrels of oil. According to DOE officials, the agency began a study in March 2018 to assess the effects of these sales on the SPR's modernization. However, GAO reported that this study was not examining a full range of options for handling any excess SPR assets that may be created by currently mandated sales or any additional sales that may be mandated in the future, inconsistent with an agency order on real property asset management that calls for identifying excess assets. For example, according to officials, DOE does not currently have the authority to lease unused storage capacity to the private sector, and DOE was not planning to examine this option. If authorized, leasing unused SPR storage capacity could generate revenues that could help offset the costs of modernization. GAO recommended that DOE should consider a full range of options for handling potentially excess assets and, if needed, request congressional authority for the disposition of these assets. DOE agreed with this recommendation."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO made four recommendations, including that DOE (1) supplement the 2016 review by conducting an additional analysis, (2) ensure it periodically reexamines the SPR, and (3) consider a full range of options for handling potentially excess assets.

More than 4 decades ago, Congress authorized the creation of the  SPR\u2014currently the world\u2019s largest government-owned stockpile of  emergency crude oil\u2014to reduce the impact of disruptions in supplies of  petroleum products. DOE manages the SPR. As of March 2018, the  SPR held 665.5 million barrels of crude oil, worth about $42 billion. In the  decades since its creation, the structure of the SPR generally has not  changed\u2014it has always held crude oil in salt caverns along the Gulf  Coast\u2014though markets for crude oil and petroleum products\u2014products  such as gasoline and diesel that are refined from crude oil for final  consumption\u2014have changed in important ways.", "Throughout most of the SPR\u2019s history, domestic crude oil production was  generally in decline, while consumption of petroleum products was  generally increasing, causing the United States to rely increasingly on  imported crude oil and petroleum products. However, the SPR now  operates in a context of increasing U.S. crude oil production (the United  States is now one of the world\u2019s largest crude oil producers), relatively  stable consumption, and shrinking net crude oil and petroleum product  imports. Moreover, whereas the Arab oil embargo of 1973 to1974 led to  shortages and long lines at gas pumps around the country, prices now  change to accommodate supply and demand, so that physical crude oil  shortages are less of a concern than they were in the 1970s when the  SPR was created.", "The SPR also helps the United States meet its obligations as a member  of the International Energy Agency (IEA)\u2014an international energy forum  of 30 member countries established in 1974 to help members respond  collectively to major energy supply disruptions. To become a member of  the IEA, a country must have, among other things, crude oil or petroleum  product reserves equivalent to 90 days of the previous year\u2019s net imports,  and measures in place to ensure that it is able to contribute its share of a  collective action initiated in response to a significant global oil supply  disruption. As of March 2018, according to IEA data, the SPR held the  equivalent of 138 days of net imports. The IEA counts both public and  private reserves toward meeting the 90-day reserve obligation, although  the United States has recently met this obligation solely through publicly  owned reserves in the SPR, as shown in figure 1.", "Since 2015, six laws mandated sales of crude oil from the SPR to fund  the modernization of SPR facilities and other national priorities. Total  planned sales are projected to reduce the amount of crude oil held in the  SPR from 665.5 million barrels in March 2018 to 405 million barrels by the  end of fiscal year 2027. These sales have an estimated value of almost  $16 billion, according to Congressional Budget Office documents. Of the  total estimated value, sales of up to $2 billion were specifically authorized  for the SPR\u2019s modernization program. The SPR\u2019s infrastructure of  facilities, pipelines, pumps, and other equipment is aging and much of it  needs replacement, according to DOE documents. Since 2014, DOE has  developed plans for modernizing the SPR to address these needs,  among other things.", "My testimony today discusses findings from our May 2018 report on the  SPR and focuses on (1) how the United States and other IEA members  meet their IEA obligations, (2) the extent to which DOE has identified the  optimal size and the potential need for additional petroleum product  reserves for the SPR, and (3) the extent to which DOE\u2019s plans for  modernizing the SPR take into account the effects of current and potential  future congressionally mandated oil sales.", "To conduct this work, we reviewed documents, reports, and studies that  we identified through DOE officials, recommendations from experts and  stakeholders, and sources referenced in DOE publications as well as our  prior work on the SPR. We also interviewed DOE officials and  representatives of energy consulting groups and a state agency, among  others. Our May 2018 report includes a detailed discussion of the  objectives, scope, and methodology used to conduct this work. We  conducted the work on which this testimony is based in accordance with  generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards  require that we plan and perform audits to obtain sufficient, appropriate  evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions.  We believe that the evidence obtained provided a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Unlike the United States, Most IEA Members Rely on Private Reserves to Meet Reserve Obligations and Hold Significant Proportions of Their Reserves as Petroleum Products", "paragraphs": ["As we found in our May 2018 report, in terms of how they meet their IEA  90-day reserve obligations, most other IEA members differ from the  United States in two basic ways. First, as of December 2017, most other  IEA members rely at least in part on private rather than public reserves to  meet their obligations. As of December 2017, 18 of the 25 IEA members  that met their 90-day reserve obligation and had a formal process for  holding and releasing reserves relied entirely or in part on private  reserves to meet their obligations. Specifically, based on IEA data as of  December 2017, these 18 countries met their 90-day reserve obligations  through private reserves and either had no public reserves or had public  reserves of less than 90 days. Unlike the 18 countries that rely at least in  part on private reserves, as of December 2017, the United States and 6  other IEA members met the 90-day reserve obligation exclusively through  public reserves. The second way other IEA members differ from the  United States is that most hold at least a third of their reserves as  petroleum products, according to a 2014 IEA report. Holding petroleum  products can be advantageous during certain disruptions because such  reserves can be directly distributed to consumers, whereas crude oil must  first be refined and turned into products, adding response time. In  contrast, more than 99 percent of the SPR (665.5 million barrels as of  March 2018) is held as crude oil. Because of the large U.S. refining  sector, crude oil from the SPR can be domestically refined into petroleum  products to meet demand."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOE Has Not Identified the Optimal Size for the SPR or the Potential Need for Regional Product Reserves", "paragraphs": ["As we found in our May 2018 report, DOE has not identified the optimal  size or the potential need for additional petroleum product reserves for  the SPR.

In February 2005, we found that agencies should  reexamine their programs if conditions change. Without addressing the  limitations of its 2016 review and periodically performing reexaminations  in the future, DOE cannot be assured that the SPR will be sized  appropriately into the future. In May 2018, we recommended that DOE (1)  supplement its 2016 review by conducting an additional analysis that  takes into account, among other things, the costs and benefits of a wide  range of different SPR sizes and (2) take actions to ensure that it  periodically conducts and provides to Congress a strategic review of the  SPR. DOE partially agreed with the first recommendation and stated that  it will conduct an additional analysis to assess the purpose, goals, and  objectives of the SPR, taking into account private sector response, oil  market projections, and any other relevant factors, that will lead to an  evaluation of possible optimal sizes of the SPR in the future. DOE agreed  with the second recommendation.", "DOE has also not fully identified whether additional regional petroleum  product reserves should be part of the SPR. The Quadrennial Energy  Review of 2015 recommended that DOE analyze the need for additional  or expanded regional product reserves by undertaking updated cost- benefit analyses for all of the regions of the United States that have been  identified as vulnerable to fuel supply disruptions. In response, DOE  studied the costs and benefits of regional petroleum product reserves in  the West Coast and Southeast Coast, though it did not finalize or publicly  release these studies. Nevertheless, the draft studies concluded that a  product reserve in the Southeast would provide significant net economic  benefits to the region and the United States, particularly in the event of a  major hurricane, while further analyses are needed to determine the  potential benefits of a reserve on the West Coast. According to DOE  officials, the agency has no plans to conduct additional studies. Without  completing studies on the costs and benefits of regional petroleum  product reserves, DOE cannot ensure that it and Congress have the  information they need to make decisions about whether additional  regional product reserves are needed. In our May 2018 report, we  recommended that DOE conduct or complete such studies. DOE  disagreed with this recommendation, though we continue to believe that  conducting these analyses will provide Congress with needed  information."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOE Has Taken Steps to Update Its Modernization Plans but Is Hindered by Uncertainty Regarding the SPR\u2019s Long-term Size", "paragraphs": ["As we found in our May 2018 report, DOE has taken steps to account  for the effects of congressionally mandated oil sales in its plans for  modernizing the SPR, though DOE\u2019s current plans, developed in 2016,  are based on information largely developed prior to recent  congressionally mandated sales of an additional 117 million barrels of oil.  According to DOE documents, the SPR modernization program is  focused on a life extension project to modernize aging infrastructure to  ensure that the SPR will be able to meet its mission requirements for the  next several decades. The project\u2019s scope of work has undergone several  revisions since its inception in response to changing conditions and  requirements, according to the agency. DOE has estimated that the  SPR\u2019s modernization will cost up to $1.4 billion, and according to officials,  the agency had spent $22 million as of the end of February 2018.  According to DOE officials, in March 2018, DOE commenced a study\u2014 the SPR post-sale configuration study targeted for completion in October  2018\u2014to examine potential future reserve configurations and to account  for the effects of congressionally mandated sales on the reserve and its  modernization. Information from the study will inform DOE\u2019s updates to  the SPR\u2019s modernization plans, according to DOE officials.", "Although the SPR had a design capacity to hold 713.5 million barrels of  oil, in January 2017, the SPR held 695 million barrels. As shown in figure  2, congressionally mandated sales will cause excess storage capacity to  grow to 308 million barrels or more by the end of fiscal year 2027\u2014 meaning that about 43 percent of the SPR\u2019s total design capacity to store  oil would be unused.", "In its ongoing SPR post-sale configuration study, DOE plans to explore  some options to use potentially excess SPR assets, such as spare  storage capacity. In withdrawing oil to meet congressionally mandated oil  sales currently in place (290 million barrels through fiscal year 2027),  DOE could close at least one SPR site based on our analysis of projected  excess storage capacity. For example, if DOE were to close the smallest  SPR site, Bayou Choctaw in Louisiana, the agency could also explore  selling the connected pipeline and marine terminal, which are currently  being leased to a private company. DOE could also consider leasing  excess storage capacity to other countries so that they could store oil at  the SPR. DOE had not entered into any such leases with other  countries and had not considered such leases as of May 2018 because,  according to DOE, the SPR has historically lacked capacity to store  additional oil. DOE had not proposed any of these options or explored the  revenue the agency could generate by selling or leasing these assets.  However, according to DOE officials, the agency will examine the  feasibility of such options in the ongoing SPR post-sale configuration  study.", "In the course of our work, we also identified other options for handling  potentially excess SPR assets that DOE was not planning on examining  as of May 2018, largely because DOE did not have the authority to  pursue them, according to agency officials. First, DOE could explore  leasing storage capacity to private industry. U.S. oil production has  generally increased over the last decade. As a result, the private sector  may want to lease excess SPR capacity, which may be cheaper than  above-ground storage, according to a representative of a private  company we interviewed. Fees for doing so could help defray SPR  storage or maintenance costs. However, agency officials told us that the  Energy Policy and Conservation Act gave DOE authority to lease  underutilized storage to other countries but not to the private sector.  Second, if Congress determines that the SPR holds oil in excess of that  needed domestically, DOE could explore selling contingent contracts for  the excess oil rather than selling the oil outright. Australian and New  Zealand officials told us that such contracts would help their countries  meet their IEA 90-day reserve obligations.", "Australian officials told us that they have discussed this option with DOE.  Currently the United States and Australia have agreed, through an  arrangement, to allow Australia to contract for petroleum stocks located in  the United States and controlled by commercial entities. While the  arrangement does not cover government-owned oil in the SPR, if it did,  based on our analysis, DOE could generate up to approximately $15  million if Australia purchased the maximum allowable amount of oil  specified in an arrangement through contracts for excess SPR oil in  2018. However, although the Energy Policy and Conservation Act  allows DOE to lease underutilized storage to other countries, DOE lacks  the authority to sell contracts for the oil and does not plan to seek this  authority, according to DOE officials. DOE officials told us that they did  not plan to examine these options.", "According to DOE\u2019s real property asset management order, the agency is  to identify real property assets that are no longer needed to meet the  program\u2019s mission needs and that may be candidates for reuse or  disposal. Once identified, the agency is to undertake certain actions,  including determining whether to dispose of these assets by sale or lease.  As part of its SPR post-sale configuration study, DOE plans to determine  whether it is appropriate to close SPR facilities, and the relative benefit of  any closures would be informed by potential lease revenues from  maintaining sites so they could be leased, according to agency officials.  However, as mentioned previously, we identified other options for  handling potentially excess SPR assets that DOE was not planning to  examine in its study. Although DOE does not currently have the authority  to implement these options, according to officials, examining their  potential use, including possible revenue enhancement, could inform  Congress as it examines whether it should grant such authority. Without  examining a full range of options in the SPR post-sale configuration  study, DOE risks missing beneficial ways to modernize the SPR while  saving taxpayer resources. In May 2018, we recommended that in  completing its ongoing SPR post-sale configuration study, DOE should  consider a full range of options for handling potentially excess assets and,  if needed, request congressional authority for the disposition of these  assets. DOE agreed with this recommendation.", "Finally, as DOE takes steps to plan for the SPR\u2019s modernization, ongoing  uncertainty regarding the SPR\u2019s long-term size and configuration have  complicated DOE\u2019s efforts. Congress has generally set the SPR\u2019s size by  mandating purchases or sales of oil. DOE officials told us they do not  know whether Congress will mandate additional sales over the next 10  years or whether other changes may be required to the configuration of  the reserve. Any additional congressionally mandated sales would require  DOE to again revisit its modernization plans and assessments of the  potential uses of any excess SPR assets. Oil market projections also  have implications for the future of the SPR. The United States is projected  to become a net exporter by the late 2020s and would then no longer  have a 90-day reserve obligation, but it is projected to return to being a  net importer between 2040 and 2050. These projected fluctuations could  affect the desired size of the SPR in the future. Such uncertainties create  risks for DOE\u2019s modernization plans, as DOE may end up spending funds  on facilities that later turn out to be unnecessary should Congress  ultimately decide on a larger- or smaller-sized SPR than DOE anticipates.  In May 2018, we suggested that Congress may wish to consider setting a  long-range target for the size and configuration of the SPR that takes into  account projections for future oil production, oil consumption, the efficacy  of the existing SPR to respond to domestic supply disruptions, and U.S.  IEA obligations.", "In conclusion, we found that given the constrained budget environment  and the evolving nature of energy markets and their vulnerabilities, it is  important that DOE endeavor to ensure that the SPR is an efficient and  effective use of federal resources.", "Chairman Upton, Ranking Member Rush, and Members of the  Subcommittee, this concludes my prepared statement.
