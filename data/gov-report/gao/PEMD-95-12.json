Major contributors to this report are listed in appendix VIII."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["In the United States, there are essentially two categories of drugs for distribution: prescription and nonprescription. Nonprescription drugs are often referred to as over-the-counter (OTC) medications (the terms are used interchangeably in this report). The term \u201cprescription\u201d has several meanings but generally refers to the order of a physician to a pharmacist for the delivery of certain medications to a patient. A prescription drug may be dispensed to a patient only on the basis of such an order. Nonprescription drugs are available for general sale without a prescription by self-service in pharmacies and in nonpharmacy outlets such as grocery stores, mass merchandisers, gas stations, and restaurants. The principal factors used to determine the prescription or nonprescription status of drugs are the margin of safety, method of use and collateral measures necessary to use, benefit-to-risk ratio, and adequacy of labeling for self-medication. Nonprescription drug sales were over $13 billion in 1992 and may reach $18 billion by the end of 1995 or 1996 (Covington, 1993, p. xxv). The importance of these medicines is growing, partly as a result of the reclassification of some commonly used drugs from prescription to nonprescription status.", "The two-tier system in the United States is unusual. Other countries typically have either more or different categories. There can be limitations on where and by whom a nonprescription drug can be sold. In some countries, the sale of some or all nonprescription drugs is restricted to pharmacies. Additionally, in some countries, certain nonprescription products have to be dispensed personally by a pharmacist.", "The 1951 Durham-Humphrey Amendment to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938 provided the statutory basis for the two-tier drug classification system in the United States. Since that time, there have been a number of proposals to introduce a third category of drugs in the United States. These proposals have been called by a number of names, including pharmacist-legend, pharmacist-only, third class of drugs, and transition class. Although there is some variation between them, the basic idea is the same: a class of drugs would be established that would be available only in pharmacies but no prescription would be needed. One variation is that the pharmacist would have to be personally involved in the sale of a drug in this class; a sales clerk could not sell the drug without the permission of the pharmacist. (For additional information on the history of this issue in the United States, see appendix I.)", "There are two general views on how an additional class of drugs would be used in the United States. The first, and the one advocated in the past by various pharmacist organizations such as the American Pharmaceutical Association (APhA) and the California Pharmacists Association, sees it as a permanent class. It would be similar to the current classes in that drugs would be placed in the class with no expectation that they would eventually be moved to the prescription or nonprescription class. Drugs in the new class would be thought not to be appropriate for use without some supervision by a health professional but a physician\u2019s oversight would not be necessary. Drugs in this middle class could come from either the prescription or nonprescription classes, although it is generally believed that they should come from the prescription class. Opponents of this proposal have included the Nonprescription Drug Manufacturers Association (NDMA) and the American Medical Association (AMA).", "The second, advocated first in 1982 by the National Association of Retail Druggists (NARD) and currently supported by such groups as APhA and the National Consumers League, sees the intermediate class as a transition class. A drug that was being switched from prescription to nonprescription status would spend a period of time in the transition class, during which the suitability of the drug for general sale could be assessed. The assessment could be based not only on experiences with the drug as a prescription product (as is currently done) but also on experiences with the drug in the transition class, where it would not be limited to prescription sale. The argument is that this would give a better picture of how the drug would be used if it were available for general sale (that is, without a prescription and outside of pharmacies). Information that could be gathered while the drug was in the transition class includes types and levels of misuse among the general public, incidents of adverse drug reactions, and interactions with other medications. At the end of a specified period, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) would decide to switch the drug to the general sale class, return the drug to prescription status, or keep the drug in the transition class for further study. This proposal has also been opposed by, among others, NDMA and AMA.", "The effect of an intermediate class of drugs in the United States would depend on whether the drugs in it would come from the prescription or general sale class. Figure 1.1 illustrates the several ways an intermediate drug class might function in the United States."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Arguments for and Against an Intermediate Class of Drugs", "paragraphs": ["Arguments for and against an intermediate class of drugs fall into two general (but sometimes related) categories: health and economic. Table 1.1 lists some of the arguments that have been put forth in support of and opposition to an intermediate class of drugs. Most of the arguments are relevant for both a fixed and a transition class. The principal difference between a fixed and a transition class is not the benefits and costs that would ensue but their goals. The goal of a transition class in the United States would be to facilitate the movement of drugs into the general sale category. The goal of a fixed class would be to place drugs permanently in the class.", "Many of the arguments for an intermediate class of drugs suggest that the quality of health care would improve if pharmacists\u2019 involvement were greater. Proponents such as APhA argue that pharmacists are well trained in pharmacology and that their expertise is underused. They could play an important role in improving drug use. It is argued further that making use of this expertise is especially important for recently switched drugs whose potential for widespread abuse and toxicity is great. In the case of a transition class, Penna (1985) writes that pharmacists would be in a position to aid FDA in its switch decisions by maintaining records of the medications they dispense and by providing access to them to researchers assessing the safety and efficacy of these drugs. They might also be encouraged or required to report adverse drug reactions and be involved in postmarketing evaluation studies. Currently, FDA derives this information only from the use of drugs as prescription products.", "Some arguments against an intermediate class of drugs come from industry officials who have argued that while pharmacists have useful information to pass on to consumers, an intermediate class is not necessary for tapping into it. If customers are interested in getting advice from pharmacists, they can go to a pharmacy and ask for it but are not forced to do so. They also note some difficulties with an increased role for pharmacists. Counseling for nonprescription products is infrequent and sometimes inappropriate, and they argue that this would not change with the establishment of an intermediate class of drugs. In addition, consumers use nonprescription drugs responsibly. They read and understand drug labels. There is nothing for the pharmacist to add. NDMA agrees that pharmacists are well-trained in pharmaceuticals but believes that they are not trained in other roles\u2014in particular, diagnosing illnesses (NDMA, 1992). Only physicians have this training and should be performing this role. Improper diagnosis could lead to treating symptoms rather than the underlying cause of an illness. Finally, opponents argue that the current two-tier system works well (NDMA, 1992). It is simple and effective. Either a drug is safe enough to be taken without medical supervision or it is not. There is no need for an intermediate class of drugs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Objectives", "paragraphs": ["To find out whether there would be significant advantages to creating an additional class of drugs, the Ranking Minority Member of the House Committee on Commerce asked us to examine the operation of drug distribution systems in 10 countries that have a pharmacist or pharmacy class of drugs and to compare these systems with that in the United States.

In all the countries other than the United States, there is some government provision of health care to the general public or universal health insurance through the private sector but regulated by the government. Thus, the context in which drugs are acquired, sold, and paid for can be quite different in these countries from that in the United States.

For example, as of March 1995, researchers had not attempted to determine how differences in drug distribution systems may affect health care costs. A number of studies have found significant differences in prescription drug prices across countries, both at the retail and manufacturers\u2019 level. However, as the costs of production and distribution make up only a small share of the total cost of any prescription drug, it is unlikely that differences in distribution systems are major sources of country-by-country differences in drugs prices (GAO, 1994a, p. 29). The effect of different drug distribution systems on nonprescription drug prices has not been assessed.", "Similarly, no studies have attempted to link the type of drug distribution system in a country to the frequency of adverse drug reactions or have attempted to relate different drug distribution systems to the quality of health care.", "The studies that have been done focus on the experiences of a single country when switching specific drugs and do not attempt to assess the merits of alternative drug distribution systems (Andersen and Schou, 1993; Bytzer, Hansen, and Schaffalitzky de Muckadell, 1991; Halpern, Fitzpatrick, and Volans, 1993; Hansen, Bytzer, and Schaffalitzky de Muckadell, 1991; Hopf, 1989; Perry, Streete, and Volans, 1987; Ryan and Yule, 1990; and Temin, 1992). While some researchers have found health and economic benefits to switching specific drugs in a particular country, no attempt has been made to determine what the effects would have been under a different drug classification system. For instance, would cough and cold remedies have been switched earlier in the United States if an intermediate-drug class had been available? If so, what would the benefits have been? If not, are there costs (for instance, adverse drug reactions) that would have been avoided if they had been switched into an intermediate class?

Officials in the United Kingdom also told us that when making classification decisions, they take into account the role that pharmacists are expected to play.

In fact, this is a worldwide trend. Despite arguments for a transition class in the United States, an intermediate class is not frequently used as a transition class in the study countries. It is operative only in Australia (and there was some support for it by government officials in Ontario and by Canadian national pharmacy association officials). In the Australian state of Victoria, after a drug is switched from prescription class to pharmacist class, officials watch for reports of adverse drug effects (they do not actively track users of the drug). If reports do not materialize, they consider switching the drug from pharmacist to pharmacy class. It is important to emphasize that even when the class is considered a transition class, the goal is not to allow the drug to be sold outside pharmacies. One Australian official told us that she could remember only paracetemol (acetaminophen in the United States) being moved into the general sale category.", "In Canada, although some government and pharmacy officials told us they support the general idea of a transition class, the intermediate class is not generally used in this manner. Some manufacturers\u2019 officials were concerned that drugs could get \u201cstuck\u201d in a transition class. They said that ibuprofen was switched in the provinces in 1989 out of prescription class into pharmacist class, where it was supposed to remain for only a short time, but it still remains there today, 6 years later. More generally, a Canadian official questioned the idea of whether a transition class would allow drugs to be switched from prescription status faster if the data package for switching remained the same. Only by altering the package could the process be made faster: either fewer or shorter tests would be required or drugs would have to be switched before the tests were completed. The same official raised the issue of the usefulness of the data that might be gathered through a transition class. There would be no controls in the studies. The official thought that because of the lack of controls, the studies would provide little useful information. A U.S. manufacturer echoed this idea and stated that FDA responds to randomized, double-blind studies in which the experimental drugs are compared to placebos. (In a double-blind medical experiment, neither the patients nor the persons administering the treatment and recording the results know which subjects are receiving the drug and which are receiving the placebo.) This allows the effectiveness and adverse effects to be accurately assessed. A transition class would not provide this type of study. An official in the United Kingdom stated that, theoretically, new adverse reactions could be found when a drug is switched to a pharmacist or pharmacy class but that, as a practical matter, the adverse-effect profile for a drug is established by the time a drug is switched.", "In the other countries we visited, the intermediate classes were not transition but permanent. There was no certainty that the drugs would be assessed for reclassification after a period of time. Thus, little helpful information is available from other countries as to whether or how a transition class might speed the switching of drugs.", "If a transition class is to play a role in speeding approval of a change from prescription to nonprescription status, it must regularly employ a system to track adverse effects. Without this information, the class could not aid FDA in assessing a drug for general sale. Tracking studies would help link drug use (or at least purchases) to adverse effects.

For example, the pharmacist would be expected to intervene if a customer wanted to purchase inordinate amounts of a drug (either at one time or over a period of time) or if the customer appeared to have no medical need for it. The class could be used in two ways. First, for drugs being switched from prescription to nonprescription status, abuse could be studied and a decision made at a later time on appropriate classification. Second, nonprescription products that were being abused could be moved back to the intermediate class for some safeguards.", "The advantage of moving a drug from general sale to an intermediate class is that it would still be available to customers for legitimate uses. Although access would be restricted to pharmacies, the added impediment of a prescription would not be required. Currently, if access is to be restricted, the drug must be moved to prescription class.", "The usefulness of an intermediate class to prevent drug abuse has not been demonstrated. We identified no studies that addressed the general issue of using an intermediate class to deter drug abuse. Few government and pharmacy officials whom we spoke with in the United States and abroad thought that an intermediate class would be completely successful in doing so. They agreed that it would be quite easy for an individual who wanted a large amount of a drug simply to visit several pharmacies and buy what appears to be a reasonable amount in each one, thereby avoiding potential surveillance. Having to deal with a pharmacist might be an impediment, as would the necessity of visiting several pharmacies; however, it would not be overly difficult to get around the system.", "The difficulties in using a pharmacist class to prevent abuse can be illustrated by experience in New South Wales, where Australian truck drivers were taking ephedrine to try to stay awake. At the time, the drug was restricted to sale by pharmacists. New South Wales officials decided to move the drug back to prescription status, and eventually the other Australian states followed their lead. In this case, since restricting the sale of ephedrine to pharmacists did not prevent abuse, officials thought it necessary to put tighter controls on the product.", "Similarly, a study in Germany indicated the difficulty of preventing the sale of nonprescription drugs even when they are restricted to pharmacies (Product Testing Foundation, 1991). Children between the ages of 10 and 14 were sent to pharmacies to see how easily they could purchase nonprescription medications containing alcohol.

The few studies that have been done focus on the switching of particular drugs in particular countries.

However, in the United Kingdom (and all the study countries), prescription drug prices are controlled in some manner by the government. Nonprescription drug prices generally are not, although some are controlled if the drugs are purchased with a prescription. Therefore, a comparison of drug prices before and after a switch is not a comparison of two free markets. Because there is no U.S. government price control, a comparison of drug prices in the study countries before and after switching would not yield useful insights for the United States. (Thus, the Ryan and Yule findings do not necessarily indicate what would occur in the United States if a drug were switched to an intermediate class.)", "When Temin (1992) studied the costs and benefits of switching cough-and-cold medicines in the United States, he found that visits to doctors for common colds fell by 110,000 per year (from 4.4 million) from 1976 to 1989, coinciding with the switching of the medicines. After ruling out other possibilities, he concluded that the decrease in physicians\u2019 visits was attributable to the switching of these drugs. He estimated this to be a saving of $70 million per year.", "Although there is thus some evidence of cost savings from switching drugs, the effect of an intermediate class of drugs has not been assessed. Ryan and Yule did not assess what the savings would have been if loperamide and topical hydrocortisone had been sold outside pharmacies. Temin did not study how the savings would have been different if cough-and-cold medications had been restricted to sale by pharmacists.Therefore, while the studies do indicate potential savings from switching drugs, we cannot use them to assess empirically the relative savings from different drug distribution systems.", "Our interviews with officials in the study countries indicated that the cost savings from fewer physicians\u2019 visits may not be as great as expected. They said that many patients do not pay the full price for a prescribed drug. For instance, an insured patient might have only a $5.00 copayment for a prescription drug while having to pay the full price for a nonprescription product. Patients might thus have an incentive to go to doctors for a prescription. It could be for either a different but therapeutically equivalent product or the original drug if insurance covers it. The latter has occurred in Denmark with antiulcer medications that were switched in 1989. Bytzer, Hansen, and Schaffalitzky de Muckadell (1991) estimated that only 3 percent of the sales of cimetidine and ranitidine were made without some medical assessment or control. In Germany, approximately half of nonprescription drug sales are prescribed and reimbursed.", "A somewhat similar situation exists in the Netherlands with respect to acetaminophen. This drug can be purchased without a prescription as a general pain reliever; however, it is also commonly used as a pain killer for cancer patients and, in fact, is the most prescribed drug in the country.

For example, if drugs were moved to pharmacy or pharmacist class from prescription status, then the drug choices available to consumers without a prescription would increase. However, if drugs were largely moved to the intermediate class from the general sale category, then these drugs would be less widely available to consumers because fewer retail outlets could sell them (although they would still be available without a prescription).", "A major unresolved question is how the availability of a pharmacist or pharmacy class would affect pharmaceutical prices. Depending on the structure of the new class, several factors might strengthen or soften its effect. The following four examples provide an illustrative, but not comprehensive, list of scenarios that could play out if the United States adopted an intermediate class of drugs.", "The availability of an intermediate class of drugs might prompt a change in manufacturers\u2019 pricing patterns. For example, if the introduction of an intermediate class permitted a drug to be switched from prescription status, the price might decline. If drugs were switched from general sale to the intermediate class, they would be available in fewer retail outlets. It is possible that the decrease in the number of retailers selling these drugs could adversely affect retail competition and, as a result, drive up prices. However, the availability of mail-order pharmacies and other outlets (provided they sold the drugs in the intermediate class), and the likelihood of new pharmacies opening, could mitigate or eliminate this effect. If drugs were moved to the intermediate class from the general sale category, the greater role of pharmacists might lead to higher prices if a counseling fee were implemented.", "The effect of an intermediate class of drugs on consumers\u2019 out-of-pocket drug expenses would depend on the behavior of third-party payers such as health insurers, which often pay all or most of the cost of prescription drugs but generally do not pay for over-the-counter products. If insurers elected not to reimburse consumers for drugs that were moved from prescription status to an intermediate class, consumers\u2019 out-of-pocket expenditures would increase. However, if fewer drugs were reimbursed, health insurance costs might decrease and partially or fully offset consumers\u2019 greater out-of-pocket drug expenditures.", "An intermediate class of drugs could also produce savings in other health care costs. The cost of obtaining a prescription drug includes not only the cost of the drug itself but also the cost of the visit to a physician. Patients would be saved the cost of the visit to the physician for a pharmacy- or pharmacist-class drug.

Germany\u2019s was by far the highest estimate. The second highest, based on self-reports of pharmacists, was 37.6 percent in the United Kingdom for single proprietor pharmacies (Phelan and Jepson, 1980).

However, even in Germany, the researchers generally thought that too little counseling was being done. In one third of the cases in Germany, only one piece of information was being passed to the consumer.", "An Australian study found that the vast majority of pharmacists thought that they should counsel for both prescription and nonprescription medications (Ortiz et al., 1984b). However, pharmacists gave a number of reasons for not counseling. The three most important were lack of adequate medical histories, lack of feedback from the person counseled, and the belief that counseling may not be necessary.", "Another reason counseling may not occur is that customers may not want it. In Canada, Taylor and Suveges (1992a) found that 195 of 207 customers who did not receive advice on a nonprescription product indicated that they did not want counseling. The main reasons they gave were that they had \u201cused  medicine before with good results\u201d and \u201chad already received advice elsewhere on what to buy.\u201d", "Regarding the quantity of counseling (that is, the availability of pharmacists to counsel, the number of counseling events per day, and the time spent counseling), a Canadian study found that pharmacists responded to requests from patients for advice on nonprescription drugs an average of 2.8 times a day (Poston, Kennedy, and Waruszynski, 1994). The range between pharmacies was from 0.07 to 38.64 counseling events per day. A study in Australia found that 23 percent of pharmacist counseling activities involved OTC medications (Ortiz, Thomas, and Walker, 1989). (This was the second most frequent counseling activity behind giving advice on prescribed medications.) Patients initiated the counseling in 259 of 438 cases. In 394 of the cases, counseling took 2 minutes or less.", "The quality of counseling was somewhat mixed. Recommended products and advice (when given) were generally found to be appropriate. Willison and Muzzin (1992) found that in Canada the quality of advice varied by ailment, with patients receiving better advice on less complex problems. For three of four scenarios in which the use of a prescription medication was not involved, the percentage of patients receiving totally safe and appropriate advice ranged from 62 to 77 percent. For the fourth scenario, only 17 percent received such advice. In Germany, the Product Testing Foundation (1991) found that pharmacists\u2019 explanations tended to be accurate for preparations requiring special explanations (for instance, appetite suppressants and iron preparations) and that performance had improved since 1984. There are also examples of inappropriate advice being given. For instance, Goodburn et al. (1991) found that pharmacists in the United Kingdom gave inappropriate advice for the treatment of childhood diarrhea 70 percent of the time. In Germany, Glaeske (1989) found that 61 percent of all nonprescription products sold were ineffective or presented dangers to the uninformed user.", "In all the countries where studies have been conducted, researchers found that information-gathering and advice were often incomplete (that is, the information given was appropriate but not everything that should have been covered was discussed). In Australia, Feehan (1981) found a lack of information-gathering on patients\u2019 characteristics. For instance, 25 of 43 pharmacists were prepared to sell a weight-reduction product without checking on the patient\u2019s health or to see whether she was taking other medications. Glaeske (1989) reported that in Germany no pharmacist asked all the questions considered to be essential. For instance, not one trained shopper who was a woman was asked if she was pregnant or lactating. Consultation on side effects was unsatisfactory\u2014for example, such simplistic statements as \u201cevery medication has side effects\u201d and \u201cthere are no side effects\u201d were sometimes made. In a 1991 study, the Consumers Association (1991) of the United Kingdom found that customers were not adequately questioned. Only 10 percent of pharmacists asked the trained shoppers what other medications they were taking.", "Studies in Australia (Harris et al., 1985), Canada (Willison and Muzzin, 1992), and the United Kingdom (Smith, Salkind, and Jolly, 1990) found a wide range of skills and performance between pharmacists.

Interestingly, Smith, Salkind, and Jolly (1990) in the United Kingdom found that pharmacists\u2019 counseling was either very good or very poor. Few pharmacists were in the middle.", "The studies generally found that pharmacy practice has improved as more and better counseling has been given. This is so when the same organization collected the same data at different times (Product Testing Foundation, 1984 and 1991) as well as when the results of different studies over time were compared (Willison and Muzzin, 1992).", "The results of studies in the United States of pharmacist counseling on nonprescription drug use are quite similar to the findings in other countries. However, no studies in the United States have assessed the frequency of pharmacy counseling on these products.", "Three studies assessed some aspect of the quantity of counseling. In a mail survey, Carroll and Gagnon (1983) found that 96 percent of households said the pharmacist was available to answer questions about nonprescription medications half the time or more. Meade (1992), reporting on a study conducted for APhA, noted that 69 percent of pharmacists said they counsel patients 10 or more times per day on nonprescription products, well within the range reported in Canadian pharmacies. Another survey conducted for APhA (Market Facts, 1994) indicates that pharmacist counseling for nonprescription drugs is increasing. The 1993 National Prescription Buyers Survey found that the percentage of respondents who had ever asked a pharmacist for advice about a nonprescription drug had increased from 37 percent in 1979 to 64 percent in 1993. (There was evidence that interactions with pharmacists for prescription advice had increased as well.)", "The other U.S. studies in table 4.2 examined the quality of counseling. In the 1960\u2019s and early 1970\u2019s, two studies examined pharmacists\u2019 counseling regarding nonprescription drugs in U.S. pharmacies (Knapp et al., 1969, and Wertheimer, Shefter, and Cooper, 1973). The conclusions of both studies were generally negative. Insufficient inquiries of patients were made, counseling was infrequent, and inappropriate drugs were sold.", "Jang, Knapp, and Knapp (1975), while finding some positive aspects of pharmacists\u2019 counseling, also had criticisms, including poor performance on drug monitoring and controlling OTC drug use.", "The Wertheimer, Shefter, and Cooper (1973) study was replicated by Vanderveen and colleagues (Vanderveen, Adams, and Sanborn, 1978; Vanderveen and Jirak, 1990). In the 1978 study, the authors concluded that the pharmacy \u201cprofession has not made any great strides in the area of OTC product counseling.\u201d The only question asked by more than one fourth of the pharmacists was the age of the child for whom the medicine was being purchased. The 1990 study found some improvement, with a majority of pharmacists asking about both the age of the child and the duration of the illness. However, no other issue was raised by more than half the pharmacists. The general conclusion was that while pharmacists\u2019 counseling had improved, it could still be better.", "Barnett, Nykamp, and Hopkins (1992) found that the majority of pharmacists questioned customers before making OTC recommendations and gave directions on their use. For one scenario, an average of 2.81 out of 5 pertinent questions were asked; for a second, an average of 1.58 questions out of 5 were asked. Combining results from the two scenarios, they found that 68.2 percent of product recommendations by pharmacists younger than 30 were appropriate while 42.4 percent by pharmacists 30 and older were appropriate. Overall, the authors concluded in 1992 that pharmacists had made strides in OTC counseling since the earlier studies.", "In a study of pharmacist counseling for prescription drugs in Wisconsin, where there is a requirement that pharmacists provide appropriate consultation for a prescription, Pitting and Hammel (1983) sent trained shoppers to 84 pharmacies.

They found that 61.5 percent of pharmacists did not consult with the patient when a prefabricated drug was dispensed, although 87.5 percent did consult on compounded products. Thus, even when pharmacists were legally required to counsel patients, not all pharmacists did so.", "The results of the studies in the United States are rather similar to those in countries where the sale of at least some nonprescription drugs is restricted to pharmacies. In general, the theory of pharmacy practice diverges from the reality. The advice of pharmacists is often appropriate but not universally given. In addition, it is often incomplete, with little information being given to customers on such items as possible side effects. In other words, what information is given is accurate, but not enough was passed on to consumers. Researchers consistently found a lack of information-gathering on the part of pharmacists. For instance, information is often not gathered on symptoms and other medications. More positively, within a range of pharmacists\u2019 behavior, many pharmacists do a good job.

Similarly, a profile could alert the pharmacist to possible adverse interactions with other drugs that a patient was currently taking.", "It is not possible to judge the usefulness of such a procedure for nonprescription products. Only in Australia are pharmacists ever required to include nonprescription drug use in patient profiles. These requirements are determined by the individual Australian states and exist only in certain states and for particular pharmacist-class drugs. The drugs for which sales must be recorded vary from state to state. There are no requirements in any of the states for recording sales of pharmacy-class drugs or drugs available outside pharmacies. Officials in Victoria told us that there has been some difficulty in getting pharmacists to comply with recording requirements.

It moves pharmacists away from their traditional role of dispensing drug products and involves them more in selecting and monitoring drug therapies. The idea has been advocated in the United States by academics in university-based pharmacy schools and pharmacy organizations and has spread to other countries (the initiatives mentioned above have often been undertaken under the name of pharmaceutical care). Hepler defined pharmaceutical care as \u201cthe responsible provision of drug therapy for the purpose of achieving definite outcomes that increase a patient\u2019s quality of life\u201d (1991, pp. 141-42). It involves \u201cdesigning, implementing, and monitoring a therapeutic plan, in cooperation with the patient and other health professionals, that will produce specific therapeutic outcomes\u201d (Klein-Schwartz and Hoopes, 1993, p. 11).", "The proponents of pharmaceutical care point to various studies (most of them in institutional settings where complete patient information exists) that show the benefits that pharmacists can have on health care. For instance, one hospital study showed shorter length of stay, smaller total cost per admission, and smaller pharmacy cost per admission for patients who received either of two programs involving pharmaceutical care (Clapham et al., 1988). In another study, elderly apartment residents were instructed in drug use and given access to drug counseling by pharmacists (Hammarlund, Ostrom, and Kethley, 1985). After 1 year, the residents who initially had the greatest number of medication problems (and were available for follow-up interviews) were found to have had an 11-percent decrease in the number of prescriptions taken and a 39-percent decrease in the number of medication problems.", "There is some evidence of the value of pharmaceutical care in community pharmacies. McKenney et al. (1973) examined the effect of a clinical pharmacist\u2019s counseling hypertensive patients in three community pharmacies. Throughout the study, the pharmacist maintained close contact with the patients\u2019 physicians. The patients who received the counseling were more likely than those who did not receive it to show an increased knowledge of hypertension and its treatment, comply more often with their prescribed therapy, and maintain their blood pressure within the normal range. In a later study, pharmacists in six community pharmacies in Virginia were trained to provide similar services (McKenney et al., 1978). Results showed improved compliance and better blood pressure control in patients receiving counseling than in those not receiving it. Pharmacists also detected 38 instances of adverse drug reactions.", "Rupp (1992) estimated the value of community pharmacists intervening to correct prescribing errors. Of 33,011 prescriptions that were examined, 623 (1.9 percent) were found to be problematic. The estimated value of these interventions was $76,615. Nichols et al. (1992) examined the effect of counseling on nonprescription drug purchasing decisions. They found that 25.4 percent of patients purchased a different product than they had intended after receiving counseling, 13.4 percent did not purchase a drug, and 1.3 percent were referred to their physician. However, the study did not measure the importance of these decisions (for instance, how much of an improvement was brought by changing medications).", "More research is being conducted on the effect of pharmaceutical care in community pharmacies. Studies are focusing on the effect of drug use reviews by pharmacists, the use of protocols by pharmacists in managing and monitoring diseases, and a pharmaceutical care program for pediatric and adolescent patients with asthma. In addition, there appears to be at least some movement among community pharmacists to implement pharmaceutical care. Training courses are offered on how to implement pharmaceutical care (Martin, 1994) and articles have been written on pharmacies where it has been established (Meade, 1994a and b).", "For our purposes, it is important to note that the methods and goals of pharmaceutical care are consistent with those of an intermediate drug class. The general idea of both is that pharmacists would be more involved in a patient\u2019s drug therapy by such actions as consulting with patients. The evaluation of pharmaceutical care in community pharmacies would give some indication of the potential value of a greater role for pharmacists and, consequently, would provide some information on the value of an intermediate class of drugs. However, even if a positive value were established, or at least indicated, a number of the difficulties we have identified in this report would still have to be addressed. For nonprescription drugs, pharmacists would need to counsel patients, monitor and report adverse drug reactions, refer patients to physicians when necessary, and perform many other activities. This has not been the norm.", "Other issues would also need to be addressed. For instance, pharmaceutical care can take a great deal of time. Pharmacists would probably have to delegate more responsibility to technicians. The appropriate role for technicians would have to be determined. Pharmacists\u2019 compensation for pharmaceutical care activities may be especially important. Many pharmacies now charge a fee for pharmaceutical care services. (Some pharmacies have different fees depending on the level of services offered.) However, some insurance companies have been reluctant to pay for the services (Martin, 1994).", "It should be clear that pharmaceutical care regarding nonprescription drugs can be given without an intermediate class of drugs. When and if pharmaceutical care is established in community pharmacies, the need for an intermediate class will still need to be established. It will still be unclear what benefits would accrue from establishing such a class of drugs. Arguments such as we hear now will still be heard (for instance, more drugs would be switched and health care costs would be reduced). The difference would be that, at least in some areas, pharmacists would be doing what is necessary for an intermediate-drug class to be successful.

Exact counseling requirements are defined by each state.

Seventy-one percent of offers to counsel were accepted, and the same percentage of patients thought that counseling was very important. The counseling that was done also appears to have been of a high quality, with 99 percent of respondents believing that the pharmacist had clearly presented the information and with pharmacists telling patients how and how often to use their medications at least 93 percent of the time. A large majority of patients were also told the dosage amount, the name (along with a description) of the medication, how long it should be taken, special directions or precautions, and any side effects.
