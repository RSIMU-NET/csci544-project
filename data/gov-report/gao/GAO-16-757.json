Most universities reported that academic freedom was not at all  restricted for faculty or students. Several, however, reported that they  either did not know the extent of academic freedom at their institution in  China or that it was slightly restricted. For example, administrators from  one university, which reported that students\u2019 academic freedom was  slightly restricted and freedoms of speech, assembly, and religion or  worship were moderately restricted, noted that its students were Chinese  citizens and subject to all applicable rules and regulations intended for  Chinese students.", "In addition, U.S. universities reported that they generally controlled  curriculum development and led or influenced faculty hiring. All 12  universities we reviewed reported that they led or played a leading role in  curriculum development, with most reporting that they effectively  controlled this process. Several universities noted that the curriculum  used for their institution in China was the same as the curriculum used on  their U.S. campus, while several others noted that they designed and  developed a new curriculum or modified their existing curriculum  specifically for the institution in China. At several universities we visited,  selected courses addressed the U.S. Constitution\u2019s relevance to China,  comparative Chinese-American legal cultures, American foreign policy in  Asia, and the Cultural Revolution. With regard to faculty hiring, most  universities indicated that they either exerted more authority than their  Chinese partner over faculty hiring, including in some cases recruiting,  vetting, and recommending candidates for hire, or played a collaborative  role in the process. For example, administrators from one university told  us that faculty candidates were interviewed first by a committee at the  university\u2019s U.S. campus and again at the institution in China, while  administrators from another university told us that they entirely controlled  faculty recruitment. Administrators from several universities noted,  however, that while they controlled or influenced processes related to  faculty hiring, an official from their Chinese partner university technically  had final faculty-hiring authority.", "More broadly, administrators identified various goals related to  establishing their institution in China. For example, administrators from at  least half of the universities we reviewed reported that goals included  providing U.S. students with an international education experience,  providing Chinese students with an American education experience,  enhancing U.S.-Chinese research collaboration and knowledge  exchange, strengthening U.S.-Chinese relations, attracting Chinese  students to further studies at the U.S. university\u2019s U.S. campus, and  providing faculty additional locations for teaching and research."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Internet Censorship, Self- Censorship, and Other Factors Create Obstacles to Learning at Some Universities", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Fewer than Half of Reviewed Universities Have Uncensored Internet Access", "paragraphs": ["Five of the 12 U.S. universities in China that we reviewed reported  uncensored Internet access, generally through use of a virtual private  network.

Correspondingly, as is shown in figure 6, we  observed university members accessing search engines, newspapers,  and social media sites that have been blocked in China\u2014such as the  New York Times, Google, and Facebook\u2014at some universities but not  others.", "Administrators at the three universities we visited that have uncensored  Internet access told us that uncensored access was available to all  university members throughout campus and was an integral aspect of  their institution in China. An administrator at one of these universities,  however, told us that the university is required by the Chinese  government to track and maintain records for several months of faculty,  student, and staff Internet usage, including the Internet sites visited by  faculty and staff. The administrator added that, to date, no Chinese  government official had asked for these records. Administrators at other  universities we visited told us that they were either not required to track  Internet usage of faculty or students or that they were unaware of any  such requirement.", "Internet Search Results in China May be  Filtered by Language  Search results can also be filtered depending  on the language used. An English language  search of \u201cTiananmen Square\u201d on one search  engine references what the State Department  has characterized as the Chinese  government\u2019s violent suppression of protests  in and around Tiananmen Square in1989, as  shown above; however, an image search in  Chinese language on the same search engine  instead provides mostly tourist images about  Tiananmen Square.", "At several universities that lacked access to uncensored Internet  content, students and faculty told us that, as a result, they sometimes  face challenges teaching, conducting research, and completing  coursework. For example, one faculty member told us that she  sometimes asks others outside of mainland China to conduct Internet  research for her because they can access information she cannot. A  student at one university told us she needed to access a certain scholarly  database typically blocked in China, while several students at another  university told us their ability to conduct academic research was  constrained by the Internet limitations. Students at one university told us  that the educational software used in some classes relied on tools  developed by a search engine provider blocked in China and that this  software would therefore sometimes not function. Individuals at several  other universities noted that faculty had to adapt to the Internet  restrictions, for example, by accessing websites comparable to those  censored in China, such as sites comparable to YouTube for sharing  videos or to Gmail for sending email. Administrators, faculty, and  students at several of these universities told us that individuals often  used virtual private networks to mitigate Internet restrictions, but some  students and faculty told us that these networks had limitations. For  example, students and faculty at one university in China told us that the  U.S. university provided access to its virtual private network but that it  was not always reliable. Some students and faculty noted that they had  purchased access to their own virtual private networks. At the time of our  visit, however, some students told us that some of these commercial  networks were operating poorly, causing them to revert to using the  university\u2019s network.", "Several universities we reviewed not only faced Internet censorship but  also experienced restricted service. For example, at one university  Internet service is unavailable in certain buildings, and some students  cannot use the Internet in dormitories after 11 p.m, according to  university administrators. In addition, several individuals told us that  Internet access is sometimes blocked or significantly slowed at night,  speculating that this was due to the university network\u2019s bandwidth being  taxed by the number of students playing video games during those hours.", "University library services may offset Internet restrictions to some degree.  All five universities we visited provided university members access to the  university\u2019s main online library, which included access to research  journals and other publications that may otherwise have been blocked in  China. Universities\u2019 on-campus libraries varied in size and offerings. Two  universities we visited featured libraries that were recently built or  renovated and that enabled students to browse or select books directly  from the shelves. As figure 8 shows, one of these libraries contained  books on topics such as Taiwan, Tibet, and Tiananmen Square, which  may be banned or difficult to obtain in China. The other library had more  than 120,000 books, including both English and Chinese.", "Administrators at both of these universities told us that no book had ever  been removed from the library by Chinese government officials, though  one of them noted that, in the past, Chinese Customs officials confiscated  some books intended for the library. To compensate, faculty traveling  from the United States to China had occasionally brought books for the  library in their personal luggage. In contrast, a former student at another  university we visited told us the only library available was that of the  Chinese university and said a study room intended for U.S. students  contained a limited number of English language titles."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Self-Censorship and Other Factors Create Obstacles to Learning", "paragraphs": ["We found that several factors can create obstacles to learning at  universities we reviewed, including self-censorship, constraints specific to  Chinese students, and restrictions beyond campus borders.", "Self-censorship: While we were told of examples of self-censorship\u2014 choosing to not express an idea or thought that may offend others or  cause other problems\u2014at universities we reviewed, it is difficult to  assess the extent to which this occurs. Several faculty members we  interviewed noted that it is ultimately not possible to know whether,  when, or the extent to which self-censorship takes place. For  example, individuals may self-censor unconsciously or may knowingly  self-censor but not acknowledge doing so. Moreover, self-censorship  can occur in any number of settings and with different motivations.  Nonetheless, administrators, faculty, and students representing more  than half of the universities we reviewed gave examples of self- censorship, including some cases where individuals were advised by  their teachers or others in positions of authority to avoid certain topics.  For example, an administrator at one university noted that he believed  it was advisable, as a guest of China, to refrain from insulting China,  while an administrator at another university noted that the university  advises teachers to avoid discussing sensitive subjects in class.  Several professors at one university told us that they avoid certain  political topics or topics that may make others uncomfortable. At  another university, faculty told us they try to be respectful of the host  country in treating certain academic subjects, and one professor told  us he believes he should not discuss Tiananmen Square. One  professor told us he advised students to avoid presentations on  sensitive topics, while a few students from a few universities told us  they had been advised to avoid certain sensitive topics, such as  Tiananmen Square or China\u2019s relationship with Taiwan. Other  students at several universities told us they avoided certain topics for  various reasons\u2014for example, to avoid starting arguments with their  Chinese classmates or out of concern that raising certain topics may  cause other problems. Several other students reported to us that they  specifically avoided discussing religion or political topics because they  thought it might be inappropriate or cause trouble. In addition, several  faculty members noted that self-censorship may affect research  efforts given that publishing articles on certain topics may jeopardize  the researcher\u2019s ability to obtain a visa to visit or work in China.", "Constraints specific to Chinese students: Some conditions specifically  affecting Chinese students may constrain their academic experience.  Faculty and students from various universities observed that in  general Chinese students participated in classroom discussions less  often than students from other countries. Some suggested that  Chinese students may be uncomfortable with Western teaching  methods or inhibited by language limitations; however, some noted  that Chinese students may know or suspect that their Chinese  classmates are government or Communist Party monitors and will  report on whatever the students say. Moreover, an administrator at  one university told us that he assumes there are Chinese students  and faculty in the institution who report to the government or the  Communist Party about the activities of other Chinese students.  Faculty members at several universities also told us that they  understood there were Chinese students in class who intended to  report on the speech of faculty or Chinese students. Several faculty  members told us they had adopted various teaching approaches to  circumvent these constraints and encourage greater participation  among Chinese students. One professor told of constructing  classroom debates in which students were required to argue both  sides of a sensitive political issue regardless of their nationality or  belief; he believed that this enabled Chinese students to speak more  freely about these topics. We found other examples of certain  conditions Chinese students face that could constrain their academic  experience. For example, one university provides only non-Chinese  students access to its main university web portal, which provides  uncensored Internet access. In addition, according to university  administrators, only Chinese students must complete military training  and take certain courses, such as on Chinese political thought. A  student at one university told us Chinese students had a curfew and  Internet restrictions while international students did not.", "Restrictions off campus: Administrators, faculty, and students at  several universities emphasized that they have certain freedoms on  campus, such as the ability to teach or discuss whatever they want,  but not off campus. They offered examples of how some typical  activities in an American college setting are not possible in China. For  example, a faculty member at one university told us she once brought  her class to a coffee shop adjacent to campus, but the public location  stifled discussion. Students at another university told us that they  ended a classroom discussion that had been continued on a social  media site because some classmates believed the discussion was  inappropriate.

We asked  universities we reviewed to comment on the law and its potential impact  on their institutions in China. The six universities that responded indicated  either that they believed the law would not have an impact or that it was  unknown or too early to tell, while several noted that they would continue  to monitor the law\u2019s implementation. According to a State official, it is too  soon to tell what, if any, impact the law may have on universities.", "Universities may take different actions if Chinese law or other factors  create infringements to academic or other freedoms. University  administrators and faculty members have outlined ways individuals could  raise concerns to respond to potential infringements on academic and  other freedoms, such as by contacting university administrators based in  the United States or China, speaking directly with institution directors, or  raising concerns through the student government or academic senate.  Administrators at several universities asserted that they would  discontinue their institution and leave China if they encountered problems  related to academic freedom that they were unable to resolve. Academics  have made other recommendations to protect academic freedom,  including that universities make public their agreements with Chinese  partners, ensure these agreements state that cooperative education  institutions will be terminated if academic freedom is compromised, and  establish an office to investigate and report on academic freedom  infringements."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["In recent years, a growing number of U.S. universities have established  degree-granting institutions with Chinese partners in an environment, as  characterized by the Department of State, of worsening human rights and  academic freedom conditions in China.

Nonetheless, the  environment in which these universities operate presents both tangible  and intangible challenges. In particular, Internet censorship presents  challenges to teaching, conducting research, and completing coursework.  However, it is much more difficult for universities to know the degree to  which faculty or students self-censor or how this may affect academic  freedom. Moreover, given that motivations to self-censor can be deeply  rooted in individual concerns and shaped by long-established conditions  in China, universities have limited ability to prevent self-censorship in the  classroom or on campus.", "Members of universities we reviewed indicated they have freedoms on  campus that do not exist beyond it, suggesting that they operate within a  protected sphere in China.

To identify  universities, we reviewed several information sources, including the  Department of Education\u2019s list of U.S. universities with locations in China  and the Chinese Ministry of Education\u2019s data on U.S. universities  approved to operate cooperative education institutions and cooperative  education programs in China. (See app. II for these Ministry of Education  lists.) We determined that we did not intend to review the more than 130  U.S. universities that have established individual education programs in  China but rather the universities that, at the time of our review, were  approved to operate cooperative institutions. The results we report are  therefore not necessarily generalizable to all U.S. universities that have  partnered with Chinese universities to establish cooperative education  programs. During our review, two other universities were also approved to  operate cooperative education institutions in China. Because of the status  of and extent of completed work for our review of the 12 universities, we  did not include these universities in our review. In addition, we reviewed  documents of independent organizations that list, review, and outline  standards for higher education partnerships abroad and interviewed  officials from several of these organizations. One of these organizations  maintains a list of \u201cinternational branch campuses.\u201d We reviewed this list,  discussed it with its authors, and found that it was generally consistent  with the Chinese Ministry of Education\u2019s list of approved cooperative  education institutions. In addition, we interviewed university  administrators to better understand the characteristics of their institutions  in China. As a result of these interviews, we decided to include in our  review one additional university that was not included on the Chinese  Ministry of Education\u2019s list of approved cooperative education institutions.  We also interviewed officials from several organizations associated with  international higher education to better understand types of overseas  higher education programs, including those in China; trends in U.S.- Chinese educational cooperation; standards for international higher  education; and academic freedom protections at such programs, among  other topics. In our reporting information about the 12 universities, we did  not attribute information or statements to them by name. We used the  following terms to report the results of our review of these universities:  \u201cmost\u201d represent 8 to 11; \u201cabout half\u201d represent 5 to 7; and \u201cseveral\u201d or \u201ca  few\u201d represent 2 to 4.", "We sent a questionnaire to administrators of all 12 universities in our  sample asking about a variety of topics. As part of the questionnaire  development, we submitted the questionnaire for review by a GAO survey  specialist. To minimize errors that might occur from respondents  interpreting our questions differently than we intended, we pretested our  questionnaire with administrators from three universities. During the  pretests, conducted by telephone, we asked the administrators to read  the instructions and each question aloud and to tell us how they  interpreted the question. We then discussed the instructions and  questions with them to determine whether (1) the instructions and  questions were clear and unambiguous, (2) the terms we used were  accurate, (3) the questionnaire was unbiased, (4) the questionnaire did  not place an undue burden on the officials completing it, and (5) the  identification of potential solutions to any problems detected was  possible. We noted any potential problems. We modified the  questionnaire based on feedback from the pretests and internal GAO  review as appropriate. We sent the Microsoft Word form questionnaire  and a cover email to the universities on February 26, 2016, and asked  them to complete the questionnaire and email it back to us within 2  weeks. We closed the questionnaire on June 3, 2016. Eleven universities  provided detailed responses on the questionnaire form; one university  provided useful narrative responses but did not answer the questionnaire  itself. Therefore, the overall response rate for the questionnaire was 92  percent. Some universities declined to answer some questions, especially  about financial information, so the item-level response rate varies by  question. Because we are not trying to generalize the results of the  questionnaire to other universities outside that sample, there was no  questionnaire sampling error. However, the practical difficulties of  conducting any survey may introduce errors, commonly referred to as  nonsampling errors. For example, differences in how a particular question  is interpreted, the sources of information available to respondents, how  the responses were processed and analyzed, or the types of people who  do not respond can influence the accuracy of the questionnaire results.  We took steps in the development of the questionnaire, the data  collection, and the data analysis to minimize these nonsampling errors  and help ensure the accuracy of the answers that were obtained. For  example, a social science survey specialist designed the questionnaire in  collaboration with GAO staff with subject matter expertise. Then, as noted  earlier, the draft questionnaire was pretested to ensure that questions  were relevant, clearly stated, and easy to comprehend. The questionnaire  was also reviewed by an additional GAO survey specialist, as mentioned  above. Data were manually entered from the Word questionnaires into an  Excel spreadsheet that was then imported into a statistical program for  analyses. All data entry was checked and any errors corrected. We  examined the questionnaire results and performed computer analyses to  identify missing data, inconsistencies, and other indications of error and  addressed such issues as necessary, including through follow-up  communications with the universities. Quantitative data analyses were  conducted by a GAO survey specialist using statistical software, and a  review of open-ended responses was conducted by the GAO staff with  subject matter expertise. An independent GAO data analyst checked the  statistical computer programs for accuracy.", "To identify funding and other support the U.S. government and other  sources have provided to U.S. universities to operate in China, we  analyzed responses to the questionnaire we sent to administrators,  interviewed administrators from all 12 universities, and reviewed  university documents. The questionnaire included questions about the  sources of funding and nonmaterial assistance used to establish and  operate the institutions in China, about financial aid to students, and  about the financial relationship between the U.S. university and the  institution. We also interviewed university administrators about the  funding and other support their institutions in China received. Because of  differences in the ways universities tracked and reported on their funding  sources, we were not able to report funding amounts for each university  or to calculate the percentage of each university\u2019s institution budget  funded by Chinese government entities, private donors, and other  sources. However, by combining information we obtained from the  questionnaire, interviews, and university documents, we were able to  identify the types of support provided. We also obtained information and  interviewed officials from the Department of Education (Education) and  reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations, including those related to  financial aid under Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as  amended.", "To determine the treatment of academic and other key freedoms \u2014 specifically freedoms of speech, information, assembly, and religion or  worship\u2014in arrangements between U.S. universities and their Chinese  partners, we reviewed written agreements and university policies  submitted by the U.S. universities. University policies include faculty and  student handbooks as well as other planning documents for the  institutions in China. Of the 12 U.S. universities that participated in our  review, 9 provided either all or a part of the written agreement with their  Chinese partner universities, and 8 provided university policies. In total,  11 of the 12 universities we reviewed submitted either their written  agreement or other university policies pertaining to their programs in  China. We conducted a content analysis of the written agreements and  other policies to identify instances in which the U.S. universities address  academic freedom and other key freedoms. To define academic freedom,  we derived our definition from the American Association of University  Professors\u2019 1940 Statement of Principles on Academic Freedom and  Tenure, to which hundreds of U.S. universities adhere. We also identified  freedoms of information, speech, assembly, and religion or worship as  other key freedoms relating to universities operating in China given the  significance of these freedoms to universities in the United States and  reported restrictions related to these freedoms in China. We derived our  definition for freedom of information from the United Nations\u2019 2011 Report  of the Special Rapporteur on the Promotion and Protection of the Right to  Freedom of Opinion and Expression, which designates Internet freedom  as a basic human right. In addition, we derived definitions for the  freedoms of speech, assembly, and religion or worship from the United  Nations\u2019 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which outlines  these freedoms as basic human rights. In addition, in our questionnaire  we asked university administrators to identify the extent to which their  universities\u2019 written agreements or other policies address academic  freedom and other key freedoms. We also interviewed administrators  from all 12 U.S. universities that participated in our review to learn how  these U.S. universities developed written agreements with their Chinese  partner universities. For the content analysis, we compared the definitions  of each freedom with all the agreements, handbooks, and other official  publications provided by the universities to assess whether and how the  freedom was referenced in those documents. One GAO analyst  conducted this analysis, coding the information based on how universities  referenced the freedom and entering it into a spreadsheet, and another  GAO analyst checked the information for agreement. Any initial  disagreements in the coding were discussed and reconciled by the  analysts.", "To learn about the experiences of academic freedom and other key  freedoms by faculty, students, and administrators at selected U.S.  universities in China, we interviewed administrators from all 12  universities.

We  asked them to complete the questionnaire because we believed some  students might be more willing to answer candidly on an anonymous  questionnaire than during an oral interview. To maintain their  anonymity and to encourage candid responses students were  instructed not to write their names on the questionnaire. The  questionnaire was in English, and students were asked to respond in  English, as they were enrolled in courses taught in English.

We also planned to visit two additional  institutions, but our visits were declined by, in one case, the Chinese  university partner and, in the other case, by the provincial ministry of  education with jurisdiction over the institution.
