Although exempt from the BHC Act, S&L holding companies are regulated by the Federal Reserve System Board of Governors (Federal Reserve) under the Home Owners\u0092 Loan Act as amended. Excluding S&Ls, the number of exempt institutions drops to 57 that comprise less than 1 percent of banking system assets and there is a 3-year moratorium on the approval of federal deposit insurance on select exempt institutions that ends in 2013. These institutions vary by size, activities, and risks. Larger institutions such as ILCs provide banking services similar to those of commercial banks and carry many of the same risks. Other exempt institutions are smaller, provide only a few services such as credit card loans and related services, and thus have lower risk profiles.", "Federal regulation of the holding companies of exempt institutions and their affiliates varies. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) oversee ILCs, credit card banks, and trust banks, and focus their supervision on the institutions, not the parent holding companies. They examine the institutions for safety and soundness and for potential conflicts of interest in transactions with affiliates and the holding company. In contrast, the Federal Reserve oversees bank and, more recently, S&L holding companies using consolidated supervision that allows examiners to look at all entities and affiliates in the structure. OCC officials and representatives of exempt institutions viewed the current oversight was sufficiently robust. FDIC officials indicated that supervision of the exempt institutions themselves was adequate, but noted that consolidated supervision authorities provide important safety and soundness safeguards. Officials from the Federal Reserve and Department of the Treasury (Treasury) stated that the exemptions should be removed, given that exempt institutions have access to FDIC insurance and the holding companies of most types of exempt institutions are not subject to consolidated supervision.", "The implications of subjecting exempt institutions and their holding companies to the BHC Act vary. While many officials from the exempt institutions owned by commercial holding companies said that the institutions would be divested, data suggest that removing the exemptions would likely have a limited impact on the overall credit market given the overall market share of exempt institutions is small. Views varied on how removing the exemptions would improve safety and soundness and financial stability. Some officials from exempt institutions said that financial stability could be adversely affected by further concentrating market share. Federal Reserve officials noted that institutions that remain exempt are not subject to consolidated supervision but could grow large enough to pose significant risks to the financial system, an issue they plan to continue to watch."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["More than 7,500 banks insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance  Corporation (FDIC) were operating in 2011, most of them owned or  controlled by bank holding companies regulated under the Bank Holding  Company Act of 1956 (BHC Act).

In 1999, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) provided  that a bank holding company may elect to become a financial holding  company that can engage in a broader range of activities that the Federal  Reserve determines to be financial in nature or incidental to such financial  activity.

S&Ls are often part of holding company structures. Like bank holding companies, S&L  holding companies are subject to restrictions on the activities they  conduct. HOLA permits S&L holding companies to conduct activities that  the Federal Reserve Board has determined to be closely related to  banking and activities permissible for financial holding companies. With  the abolishment of OTS, the Federal Reserve is now the regulator for  these holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act made significant  changes to the regulatory framework for S&L holding companies. The  Dodd-Frank Act amends HOLA and the BHC Act to create similar  requirements for both bank holding companies and S&L holding  companies. For example, the Dodd-Frank Act amended both the BHC Act  and HOLA to provide that the Federal Reserve Board has authority to  impose capital requirements on depository institution holding companies  by regulation or order, including bank holding companies and S&L holding  companies.", "Before GLBA, commercial companies could own a single S&L without  becoming subject to the activities restrictions that apply to S&L holding  companies, and a number of commercial firms\u2014such as General Electric;  Macy\u2019s, Inc.; and Nordstrom, Inc.\u2014acquired S&Ls.

A  grandfathered unitary S&L holding company will be required to establish  an intermediate holding company if the Federal Reserve determines that  the establishment of the intermediate holding company is necessary to  appropriately supervise activities determined to be financial activities or to  ensure that supervision by the Federal Reserve does not extend to the  grandfathered unitary S&L holding company\u2019s nonfinancial activities.

For  example, a holding company or an affiliate with poor risk management  procedures may take excessive investment risks and fail. The failure of a  holding company or affiliate can impair an insured institution\u2019s access to  financial markets. Moreover, a poorly managed bank holding company  can initiate adverse intercompany transactions with the insured  depository institution or impose excessive dividends on it. Adverse  intercompany transactions may include charging the insured depository  institution above-market prices for products or services, such as  information technology services, provided by an affiliate or requiring the  insured institution to purchase poor quality loans at inflated prices from an  affiliate, thus placing the insured institution at greater risk of loss. Market  risk is the risk to a banking organization\u2019s financial condition resulting  from adverse movements in market prices due to such factors as  changing interest rates. Operational risk is the potential that inadequate  information systems, operations problems, breaches in internal controls,  or fraud will result in unexpected losses. From a practical standpoint,  insured depository institutions may be susceptible to operational risk  when they are dependent on or share in the products or services of a  holding company or its subsidiaries, such as information technology  services or credit card account servicing. If these entities ceased their  operations, the insured institution could be adversely impacted.  Reputational risk is the potential that negative publicity regarding an  institution\u2019s or affiliate\u2019s business practices, whether true or not, could  cause a decline in the customer base, costly litigation, or revenue  reductions. Operational or reputational risk that impacts the holding  company can also affect affiliates throughout the corporate structure.", "The BHC Act has established a consolidated supervisory framework for  assessing the risks to a depository institution that could arise because of  its affiliation with other entities in a holding company structure.  Consolidated supervision of a bank holding company includes the parent  company and its subsidiaries and allows the regulator to understand the  organization\u2019s structure, activities, resources, and risks and to address  financial, managerial, operational, or other deficiencies before they pose  a danger to the bank holding company\u2019s subsidiary depository institutions.  According to Federal Reserve Board Supervisory Letter SR 08-9, the  agency has established capital standards for bank holding companies,  helping to ensure that they maintain adequate capital to support  groupwide activities, do not become excessively leveraged, and are able  to serve as a source of strength to their depository institution subsidiaries.  The Federal Reserve may generally examine holding companies and  their nonbank subsidiaries, subject to some limitations, to assess the  nature of the operations and financial condition of the holding company  and its subsidiaries, the financial and operational risks within the holding  company that may pose a threat to the safety and soundness of any  depository institution subsidiary, and the systems for monitoring and  controlling such risks, among other things.", "As the new regulator for S&L holding companies, the Federal Reserve  has indicated that it intends, to the greatest extent possible taking into  account any unique characteristics of S&L holding companies and the  requirements of HOLA, to assess the condition, performance, and  activities of S&L holding companies on a consolidated basis in a manner  that is consistent with the Board\u2019s established risk-based approach  regarding bank holding company supervision.", "In contrast, FDIC and OCC do not have consolidated supervisory  authority over the holding companies for the exempt banking institutions  but do have full authority to apply to them the same federal regulatory  safeguards that apply to all insured banks and S&Ls. For example, FDIC  and OCC can impose conditions and examine agreements,  dependencies, and transactions between exempted depository  institutions and their holding companies (including affiliated entities) in  order to better ensure the safety and soundness of those institutions.  Furthermore, FDIC can terminate an exempted entity\u2019s deposit insurance,  enter into agreements during the acquisition of an insured entity, and take  enforcement measures.

While few of the exempt institutions are large depository  institutions that pose significant systemic risk to the financial system,  many engage in several types of banking and nonbanking activities that  carry a variety of risks. These risks exist at the depository institution and  holding company levels.", "ILCs. The Federal Reserve and Treasury view these institutions as  full-service commercial banks and therefore view the risks they pose  as similar to those of commercial banks, including credit risk. The  FDIC concurs in this view and noted that many exempt institutions  primarily accept brokered deposits, considered to be riskier than  demand deposits because of concerns about liquidity risks.can provide a wide range of banking services and are able to make  loans (including credit card loans) and investments, like commercial  banks.", "Limited-purpose credit card banks. These exempt institutions are  generally restricted to credit card lending activities and are not  permitted to conduct many banking activities, such as mortgage or  commercial lending. They are not permitted to accept demand deposits. The most dominant risks for these banks are compliance,  liquidity, reputational, and to some extent credit risk.", "Municipal deposit banks and trust banks. These exempt institutions\u2019  banking activities are limited. The sole purpose of municipal deposit  banks is to accept municipal deposits, and these banks do not make  commercial or consumer loans. Similarly, the three trust banks that  are exempt from the BHC Act function only in a fiduciary capacity and  do not pose the same types of financial risks as commercial banks.  Their risk profile is based on fiduciary responsibility and litigation risk.", "S&Ls. These exempt institutions offer a range of banking services that  are similar to those provided by commercial banks, including offering  a variety of banking products, accepting demand deposits and making  commercial, real estate, and residential mortgage loans. Because  S&Ls are similar to commercial banks, they are exposed to credit,  liquidity, operational, reputational, and compliance risks. However, as  discussed, unlike the owners of other exempt institutions, S&L holding  companies are subject to supervision and regulation at the holding  company level, by the Federal Reserve.", "In addition to their banking activities, commercial ownership of exempt  institutions could pose additional risks. Federal Reserve, FDIC and Treasury  officials each acknowledged the risk that a commercial holding company  may seek to operate an exempt financial institution for the holding  company\u2019s own benefit. For example, ILCs and limited-purpose credit card  banks could be directed to engage in transactions that benefited the holding  company\u2019s affiliates but were detrimental to the financial institutions\u2019 safety  and soundness. To address adverse transactions between an insured  institution and its affiliates, Congress restricted the ability of insured  depository institutions, including exempt institutions, to enter into transactions  with affiliates. Insured institutions are subject to both qualitative and  quantitative limits on transactions with affiliates. For example, a bank may  not engage in a transaction with an affiliate if the aggregate amount of the  bank\u2019s covered transactions with all affiliates would exceed 20 percent of the  bank\u2019s capital stock and surplus. In addition, an institution generally cannot  purchase low-quality assets from an affiliate. Congress established collateral  requirements for credit transactions provided to an affiliate, generally  requiring that a credit transaction be secured by collateral having market  value of at least 100 percent of the transaction. All covered transactions  between depository institutions and their affiliates must be on terms and  conditions that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices.  Additionally, covered transactions between institutions and their affiliates  must occur on market terms, which must be at least as favorable to the  institution as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with  unaffiliated companies.", "While the regulators view the commercial ownership of exempt  institutions as posing potential risks to the financial institution,  representatives from exempt institutions countered that such ownership  could be a source of strength. In particular, representatives of the 14 ILCs  and 3 limited-purpose credit card banks we interviewed said that their  holding companies currently could serve as a source of strength to their  depository institutions. To assess whether these holding companies could  be a source of strength to the financial institution, we analyzed the  capitalization of holding companies for ILCs and credit card banks. On  average, the holding companies of ILCs and credit card banks we  analyzed had higher ratios of equity-to-total assets over the 5-year period  than bank holding companies (see fig. 2). The higher ratio shows that  these holding companies had a higher, stronger cushion against losses  that might occur. The average equity-to-total assets ratios for limited- purpose credit card banks remained above 20 percent over the period. In  comparison, the average equity-to-total assets ratio of bank holding  companies with total assets of more than $500 million that were required  to file financial data with the Federal Reserve remained below 10 percent  during the same period.", "Federal Reserve acknowledged that commercial holding companies may  be able to act as a source of strength for exempt institutions. However,  they expressed three concerns. First, Federal Reserve officials noted that  no federal regulator was assigned to look at the health of the entire  holding company for an exempt institution, other than for S&Ls, creating a  potential regulatory \u201cblind spot.\u201d The officials explained that a regulator  should have the authority to look at the entire organization and not at  what affects only the depository institutions. Second, holding companies  of ILCs are not held to the same risk management and capital standards  as bank holding companies, according to the officials. For example,  through consolidated supervision, the Federal Reserve assesses a bank  holding company\u2019s risk management functions and its impact on the  depository institution. Third, regulators cannot take enforcement actions  to compel nonbank holding companies to serve as a source of strength  for the exempt institution.could ask holding companies to inject capital into exempt depository  institutions and to enter into agreements with them requiring such capital  injections when necessary. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, as described  earlier, if an insured depository institution is not the subsidiary of a bank  holding company or an S&L holding company, the appropriate federal  regulator for the insured depository institution will require any company  that directly or indirectly controls the insured depository institution to  serve as a source of financial strength for the insured depository  institution.

OCC examines federally  chartered limited-purpose credit card banks every 12-18 months.", "We reviewed a total of 18 examinations of exempt institutions with assets of $1 billion or  more that FDIC and OCC conducted in 2010 and 2011. We chose examinations of the  largest banks (by asset size) because these institutions represented a greater financial  risk.

According to an OCC lead examiner for credit card banks, aspects of  affiliate transactions were included as part of their review of audit,  earnings, and management for each of the limited-purpose credit card  banks. Because many of the limited-purpose credit card banks rely on the  holding company to provide funding for the receivables on a daily basis,  the examiners review the transactions to ensure that they are in  compliance with the law. The OCC examiner told us that if the examiners  had not found any problems with affiliate transactions, the transactions  would not be discussed in the reports.

As of July  21, 2011, the Federal Reserve assumed responsibility for supervising  S&L holding companies in accordance with the Dodd-Frank Act. The  Federal Reserve plans apply certain elements of its consolidated  supervisory program for bank holding companies to S&L holding  companies. The consolidated supervision program, which applies  primarily to large and regional bank holding companies, is aimed at  assessing and understanding the bank holding company on a  consolidated basis. In April 2011, the Federal Reserve issued a notice of  intent to provide information to the S&L holding companies on how it  plans to supervise them and to solicit feedback. The notice covered  consolidated supervision, the holding company rating system, capital  adequacy, and small noncomplex holding companies. In particular, the  Federal Reserve stated that it intended to apply the same type of  consolidated supervision to the S&L holding companies that it applied to  bank holding companies and that this supervision could entail more  rigorous reviews of internal control functions and consolidated liquidity  compared to their previous consolidated supervision. The notice stated  that the supervision may also include discovery reviews of specific  activities as the Federal Reserve attempts to expand its understanding of  certain types of activities. Federal Reserve officials said that the agency  would issue a notice for rulemaking and request for comments once a  supervisory rating system had been developed.", "Federal Reserve officials also told us that the agency had organized S&L  holding companies into groups based on their size and nonbanking  activities for supervision purposes. Large, complex holding companies\u2014 those with $50 billion or more in assets\u2014will be assigned permanent  onsite examination teams that will provide ongoing supervision. S&L  holding companies with assets of between $10 billion and $50 billion will  be assigned off-site examiners for monitoring that may not be continuous.  For S&L holding companies with assets of less than $10 billion, the  Federal Reserve will depend largely on the primary federal regulator\u2014 either OCC or FDIC\u2014for the exempt S&Ls. S&Ls with less than $10  billion in assets generally consist only of the S&L and a holding company  and thus require less supervision at the holding company level, according  to an OCC official. Relying on the work of the primary federal regulator is  similar to the Federal Reserve\u2019s approach to supervising small \u201cshell\u201d  bank holding companies. The primary federal bank regulator, either FDIC  or OCC, is responsible for examining the bank, and the Federal Reserve  reviews the holding company information, including financial data such as  the capital and liquidity levels and the quality of the risk management at  the holding company level.", "While the Federal Reserve plans to use its consolidated supervisory  program for S&L holding companies, it still must decide how it plans to  supervise grandfathered unitary S&L holding companies that engage in  commercial activities. Federal Reserve officials acknowledged that the  regulation and the supervision of grandfathered unitary S&L holding  companies that engage in commercial activities presented unique  supervisory challenges. They said they would look at these holding  companies in a broader framework than OTS had used, because that  approach had covered only the impact of the holding company on the  S&L. These officials said the new framework that is being developed  would allow them to supervise the holding company\u2019s financial activities  but not its commercial activities. As noted earlier, the Dodd-Frank Act  gave the Federal Reserve the authority to decide whether the  grandfathered unitary S&L holding companies should establish  intermediate holding companies for their financial activities. Federal Reserve officials, as of September 30, 2011, this decision had  not been made for any of the grandfathered unitary S&L holding  companies.

FDIC officials  believe that they can adequately supervise exempt institutions but  acknowledged the safety and soundness benefits of consolidated  supervision. FDIC officials told us that they tried to ensure that institutions  complied with all applicable laws and regulations and had sufficient  capital.

We noted that while FDIC had developed an  alternative approach that it claimed has mitigated losses to the bank  insurance fund, it did not have some of the explicit authorities that other  consolidated supervisors possess, and its oversight over nonbank holding  companies may be disadvantaged by its lack of explicit authority to  supervise these entities, including companies that own large and complex  ILCs. In 2007, FDIC officials noted in testimony that the number, size  and types of commercial applicants had changed significantly causing the  FDIC to carefully examine this new environment.

With its enactment in 2010, the Dodd-Frank  Act included a 3-year moratorium on approving FDIC insurance for ILCs,  credit card banks, and trust banks that are directly or indirectly owned or  controlled by a commercial firm. The Dodd-Frank Act also established the  Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), which is charged with  determining whether institutions are systemically important, among other  responsibilities. If FSOC were to designate an exempt institution or its  holding company as a systemically important nonbank financial firm, it  would be regulated and supervised by the Federal Reserve. A Federal  Reserve official stated that exempt institutions could be identified as  systemically important nonbank financial firms. However, the official  added that this designation would not address the unbalanced  competition of ILCs or the other exempt institutions that would not be  designated as systemically significant.

Almost all representatives from exempt  institutions that are owned by commercial holding companies told us that  divestment was the likely outcome.

Representatives from one of the noncommercial companies we spoke  with stated that the holding company\u2019s ability to compete against larger,  more diversified commercial banks would be reduced.

Approximately half of the representatives from ILCs and limited-purpose  credit card banks whom we interviewed stated that they were either  uncertain about or opposed to the idea of an intermediate holding  company.  Some of the representatives that held this opinion argued that  an intermediate holding company structure would not improve the current  regulatory environment or foster greater safety and soundness within the  overall holding company. However, representatives from one limited- purpose credit card bank stated that an intermediate holding company  could potentially be a compromise. But they added that the utility of such  an option would depend on how the policy was implemented and which  financial activities were required to be conducted within the intermediate  holding company.", "Representatives of exempt institutions also told us that divesting the  exempt institutions could have additional implications for the holding  companies, their customers, and their employees.", "Changes in business models. Representatives from several ILCs and  limited purpose credit card banks we interviewed told us that their  exempt institution was an integral part of the parent holding  company\u2019s business model.

Furthermore for some representatives, divesting  their exempt institution would likely require changes in their business  models or could reduce revenues for the holding company. For  example, three ILCs that we spoke with indicated that divestment  would result in a decrease in the parent holding companies\u2019 sales or  revenue. Similarly, four of the five limited-purpose credit card banks  we spoke with said that in order to continue offering credit without the  BHC Act exemptions, they would likely have to use a third-party credit  provider, such as one of the large banks that issue credit cards, and  would lose interest and late fee income.", "Changes in customer relationships. Representatives from six ILCs  and two credit card banks indicated that losing the financial institution  could result in a significant loss of customers, damage customer  relations for the parent company, or both.

However, exempt institutions could have larger market shares in some  regions and smaller market shares in others. To the extent that the credit  market is segmented by region, the effects of removing the exemptions  would likely be larger in regions where exempt institutions are a larger  share of the market and smaller in regions where exempt institutions are  a smaller share of the market.", "While removing the exemptions would likely have a limited impact on the  overall credit market, doing so could have a larger impact on segments of  the market in which exempt institutions have larger market shares. These  shares remain relatively small, however. For example, in 2010, ILCs  accounted for about 1 percent of multifamily, commercial, and farm real  estate loans and about 2 percent of non-credit-card consumer loans on  the balance sheets of all FDIC-insured institutions, but they accounted for  less than 1 percent of each of the five other types of loans we analyzed  (construction and land development loans; residential mortgage loans;  commercial, industrial, and agricultural production loans; credit card  loans; and leases). Limited-purpose credit card banks, on the other hand,  accounted for about 1 percent of credit card loans, but they accounted for  less than 1 percent of construction and land development loans and  almost none of any other type of loan. Grandfathered S&Ls accounted for  no leases; less than 1 percent of commercial, industrial, and agricultural  production loans; and for 2 to 5 percent of each other type of loan. Other  S&Ls accounted for more than 9 percent of residential mortgages, less  than 1 percent of credit card loans and leases, and for 1 to 5 percent of  each other type of loan. Although the actions exempt institutions might  take if the exemptions were removed may differ by the type of institution,  the magnitude of the effects of these actions on credit markets\u2014overall or  in specific segments\u2014are likely related to each type of exempt  institution\u2019s share of the market.", "The overall credit market would likely remain unconcentrated even if  exempt institutions exited the market and transferred their loans to other  institutions. To assess the impact of removing the exemptions on  concentration among FDIC-insured institutions, we calculated the  Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI), a key statistical indicator used to  assess market concentration and the potential for firms to exercise  market power. As shown in table 5, the HHI for the overall loan market  for 2010 is well below 1,500, the threshold for moderate concentration, as  are the HHIs for six of the seven specific loan markets we analyzed  (credit card loans were the exception). As a result, firms in the overall  loan market and in most market segments likely have little ability to  exercise market power by raising prices, reducing the quantity of credit  available, reducing innovation, or otherwise harming customers.  However, the HHI for the market for credit card loans is close to the  threshold for moderate concentration, suggesting that one or more firms  making credit card loans may have a moderate amount of market power.  Furthermore, our HHIs are for the United States as a whole, and HHIs for  markets in specific states or metropolitan areas within the U.S. are likely  to be different.", "If the exemptions were removed, some exempt institutions might exit the  credit market and stop making loans. As previously discussed,  representatives from some ILCs and limited-purpose credit card banks  owned by commercial parent companies indicated that their parent  companies would likely divest themselves of their exempt institutions if  the exemptions were removed. To estimate the effect of the divestment of  grandfathered S&Ls owned by commercial companies, we estimated the  change in the HHI for each loan market in alternative scenarios in which  all grandfathered S&Ls, all ILCs, or all limited-purpose credit card banks  ceased making loans and transferred the loans on their balance sheets to  the firms remaining in the market. In the first scenario, we assumed that  exiting institutions\u2019 loans were distributed proportionally among all  remaining firms. In the second scenario, we assumed that the exiting  institutions\u2019 loans were acquired by the largest remaining firm. The  estimated changes in the HHIs indicated that the overall loan market was  unlikely to become concentrated in any of these scenarios. Even in the  event that all grandfathered S&Ls, all ILCs, or all limited-purpose credit  card banks exited the credit market, the remaining firms would still have  little market power and thus little ability to increase loan prices or reduce  the quantity of loans available. In every market we analyzed, except credit  card loans, estimated changes in the HHIs indicated that these markets  were also unlikely to become concentrated in similar scenarios. However,  our definition of the market excludes other providers of credit, including  uninsured affiliates of FDIC-insured institutions, finance companies, credit  unions, and other institutions that are not FDIC-insured. Our estimates  may be either overstated or understated, depending on the number and  sizes of the credit providers we excluded.", "Although available data suggest a degree of concentration in the credit  card loan segment, the likely impact of removing the exemptions on this  market varies across institution types. We found that the HHI for the  market for credit card loans in 2010 was close to the threshold for  moderate concentration. However, under current conditions, estimated  changes in the HHI were small\u2014less than 100\u2014in scenarios in which all  ILCs or all limited-purpose credit card banks ceased making loans and  transferred their portfolios to other FDIC-insured institutions. Removing  the exemptions for these institutions would likely not lead to significant  increases in market power in the credit card loan market. In contrast, the  HHI for the credit card loan market increased by more than 100 in  scenarios in which grandfathered S&Ls ceased making credit card loans  and transferred their portfolios to other FDIC-insured institutions. In these  scenarios, the increase in concentration in the credit card loan market  could be large enough to significantly increase market power for some of  the remaining firms and might lead to price increases or reductions in  availability of credit card loans. Once again, this definition of the market  excludes other providers of credit, including uninsured affiliates of FDIC- insured institutions, finance companies, credit unions, and other  institutions that are not FDIC-insured. Our estimates may be either  overstated or understated, depending on the number and sizes of the  credit providers we excluded.", "Some representatives of exempt institutions also expressed concern that  removing the exemptions could increase concentration in the market for  credit card loans and reduce the availability of credit in certain niche  markets. Representatives from five limited purpose credit card banks and  several ILCs and their parent companies reported that if the exemptions  were removed, the parent company would most likely divest itself of the  credit card bank or ILC rather than convert to a bank holding company.  As a result of divestment, some stated that their credit portfolios would  most likely be acquired by large credit card issuers or banks, argued that  divestment BHC Act exempt institutions could potentially increase credit  market concentration, or restrict access to credit for some customers.   Two exempt institutions said that credit to borrowers with limited access  to general purpose credit would be affected.", "Representatives from several ILCs and two credit card banks also told us  that they made a significant proportion of loans in niche markets, including  student loans, small business loans, and vehicle and equipment loans and  leases to businesses and consumers involved in activities such as  specialized retail sales, insurance, transportation services, and taxi cab  operations. Representatives from 3 exempt institutions and their parent  companies also indicated that they offered specific credit products that  commercial banks did not offer and served customers that commercial  banks typically did not serve.  One large credit card issuer told us that it  had developed cobranded credit card arrangements for certain businesses,  such as a small customer machinery tool manufacturer, and designed  programs to serve a particular demographic for a particular retailer. This  credit card issuer told us that it had invested substantial resources in  developing a user friendly, secure, and reliable nationwide structure  customized to a particular group in order to win cobranding relationships  with retailers in niche markets. However, one academic we spoke with said  that traditional banks and other lenders would likely not expand into niche  consumer credit markets, because these institutions lacked the market  expertise of such credit card banks and ILCs. The lack of data on activity in  niche markets prevented us from measuring concentration and estimating  potential changes to it in scenarios in which exempt institutions ceased to  make loans. Representatives from some exempt institutions also  expressed concerns about the availability of credit to certain niche markets  if the exemptions were removed.", "Federal Reserve officials told us that they believed that credit would  continue to be available to creditworthy customers, even if the  exemptions were removed and some institutions no longer provided  credit. When we discussed the issue of credit availability in niche markets  with the Federal Reserve, an official explained that the agency generally  used FDIC\u2019s Call Report data to analyze credit markets and that the  reports did not include data on niche credit markets. Although Federal  Reserve officials acknowledged that removing the exemptions for credit  card banks and ILCs could affect the price and quantity of credit available  in some niche markets in which those institutions operated, they expected  that other financial institutions would step in and make credit available to  qualified borrowers at prices determined by the market. The officials  stated that they had not seen any data supporting the idea that exempt  institutions offered better terms than commercial banks. Moreover, they  stated that companies that currently owned exempt institutions could  continue to provide credit to their customers through institutions without  insured deposits, such as finance companies, which are not permitted to  have insured deposits. One example of this type of nonbank finance  company is the Ford Motor Credit Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of  the Ford Motor Company that finances Ford automobiles and supports  Ford dealers but does not accept FDIC-insured deposits."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Views Varied on How Removing the Exemptions Would Impact Institutions\u2019 Safety and Soundness and Financial System Stability", "paragraphs": ["Representatives from three exempt institutions stated that if the  exemptions were removed, they would see no additional improvement in  safety and soundness. Other exempt institution representatives explained  that they did not consider consolidated supervision a stronger model than  the FDIC and state regulator model for exempt institutions. In addition to  not improving safety and soundness, some representatives from exempt  institutions stated that removing the exemptions would likely result in  further credit market concentration.  For example, representatives from a  limited-purpose credit card bank noted that their share of the market  would likely be absorbed by large credit card issuers as their holding  company would likely divest their institution if the exemptions were  removed.", "OCC officials have not expressed concerns about the sufficiency of the  current oversight of exempt institutions and FDIC officials acknowledged  the safety and soundness benefits of consolidated supervision. Federal  Reserve and Treasury officials maintained that the safety and soundness  of exempt institutions would be improved if the BHC Act exemptions were  removed because exempt institutions\u2014and their holding companies\u2014 would be subject to consolidated supervision. Consolidated supervision  allows regulators to understand an organization\u2019s structure, activities,  resources, and risks, and to address financial, managerial, operational, or  other deficiencies before they pose a danger to subsidiary depository  institutions. However, Federal Reserve officials acknowledged that  consolidated supervision needed to be improved in light of the financial  problems experienced by several bank holding companies during the  2007-2009 financial crisis but noted that they had learned many lessons  from the crisis. For example, according to the Federal Reserve officials,  regulated institutions, particularly large U.S. banking organizations, had  complained to federal banking regulators, including the Federal Reserve,  about unregulated entities taking over more of their business. Their  concerns and influence contributed to a less than a rigorous application of  safety and soundness standards by federal regulators, which was one of  the causes for the recent financial crisis. Representatives from a former  ILC holding company that became a bank holding company agreed with  the Federal Reserve and Treasury\u2019s view on the merits of subjecting  exempt institutions to consolidated supervision, noting, for example, that  their holding company was now required to implement more robust risk  management systems than it had previously maintained.", "Federal Reserve officials also stated that financial system stability would  improve if the exemptions from the BHC Act were removed. They noted  that the risk posed by the exempt institutions should not be discounted  based on their relative size and small number of the institutions, as the  size and number of the institutions could change in the future. For  example, Federal Reserve officials told us that if the exemption were not  removed and the Dodd-Frank moratorium expired, the number and size of  ILCs could grow to the much higher levels that they had reached prior to  the financial crisis. Furthermore, Federal Reserve officials noted that  maintaining these exemptions resulted in differing regulatory oversight,  raising questions about whether the exemptions provide an unfair  competitive advantage. For example, holding companies of exempt  institutions (aside from S&L holding companies) are not subject to the  same level of scrutiny as bank holding companies\u2014despite enjoying the  benefits of being FDIC insured. Federal Reserve officials also cited other  potential competitive concerns introduced by maintaining the exemptions.  For example, a large company that owns an exempt insured depository  institution could direct that institution to (unfairly) deny credit to the parent  company\u2019s competitors. Moreover, the parent company could encourage  the affiliated exempt insured depository institution to offer loans to the  company\u2019s customers based on terms not offered to its competitor\u2019s  customers.", "The impact of removing the exemption and addressing risks posed by  exempt institutions varies. For example, the Dodd-Frank Act requires the  holding companies for S&Ls, which are by far the largest in number and  size, to be supervised by the Federal Reserve.  S&L holding companies  will be subject to capital requirements and other regulatory requirements  similar to those applicable to bank holding companies. In contrast, the  other exempt institutions are few in number and size, but their holding  companies are not subject to Federal Reserve\u2019s supervision. In addition,  the banking activities of the exempt institutions vary\u2014for example, ILCs  conduct activities similar to those of full-service commercial banks and  limited-purpose credit card banks conduct few banking activities\u2014and  these activities carry different risks. The moratorium on approving federal  deposit insurance for ILCs, credit card banks, and trust banks is set to  expire in 2013. Federal Reserve officials told us that they plan to continue  to watch changes in the number or size of exempt institutions, as they  have previously, consistent with their position that the exemptions  represent gaps in the regulatory structure which may pose risks to the  financial system. They also said they would bring forward any concerns  about exempt institutions which may pose a risk to financial system  stability to FSOC. Ultimately, the decision to remove the BHC Act  exemptions is a policy decision that involves trade-offs among a number  of competing considerations, including potentially increasing  concentration in certain credit markets and decreasing consumer choice  and the availability of credit in certain regions and credit markets and  addressing existing regulatory gaps and potential competitive impacts."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Federal Reserve, FDIC, OCC, the  New York State Department of Financial Services, and Treasury for their  review and comment.

We also interviewed officials from the  FDIC and OCC to obtain their understanding of the exemptions listed in  the BHC Act. Once we established the type of institutions that were  exempted from the BHC Act, we collected data from the FDIC, Federal  Reserve, and OCC on these institutions from 2006 through 2010. The  data included: asset size, geographic location, and primary federal  regulators. We also interviewed the state banking departments of  California, Nevada, New York, and Utah to collect information on the  industrial loan companies (ILC) and municipal deposit banks, which are  exempt from the definition of bank under the BHC Act and are state- chartered institutions. We tested the reliability of the data provided to us  by the federal banking regulators and determined it to be sufficiently  reliable for our purposes. To do this, we interviewed the regulators on  how they identified institutions that were exempt from the BHC Act and  what process they used to identify the institutions and then compared the  lists from the federal banking regulators. As part of this comparison, we  looked for any duplicates or inconsistency between the regulators.", "To determine whether ILCs, limited-purpose credit card banks, municipal  deposit banks, and trust banks were owned by commercial holding  companies, we reviewed information from the federal bank regulators on  the holding companies of the exempt institutions and analyzed public  information, if available, on the holding companies to identify the business  segments of the company. The types of publicly available information that  we examined included Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC)  filings and company annual reports.  Using this information, we identified  the annual gross revenue and the business segments that created the  revenue. Using the activities listed in Section 4 (k) of the BHC Act, we  compared the activities of the holding company listed in the public  documents to identify the activities considered financial in nature and then  determined the extent to which their 2010 annual gross revenue was  produced by financial activities. In accordance with the Dodd-Frank Wall  Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, if 15 percent or more of a  company\u2019s activities were financial, we classified it as noncommercial.

Our review of examinations did not include trust banks and  municipal deposit banks because their asset sizes were much lower than  $1 billion. We focused on the larger institutions because we determined  that the regulators generally dedicated more resources to them, such as  placing examiners onsite and concluded that if certain supervisory  practices are not taken on the larger institutions, then they would not  likely be implemented for the smaller institutions.

We defined the  market as the collection of all FDIC-insured institutions for which we could  obtain balance sheet data as of June 30, 2010. We obtained lists of  FDIC-insured institutions from the Summary of Deposits (SOD) data  available on FDIC\u2019s website. We obtained balance sheet data from each  institution\u2019s Call Report or Thrift Financial Report from SNL Financial, a  financial industry database. Some institutions indicated that they were  subsidiaries of other institutions in the data and that their parent institution  reports consolidated balance sheet data for both institutions on the parent  institution\u2019s balance sheet. In these cases, we removed the subsidiary  institution from the sample in these cases to avoid double-counting them.", "We identified seven groups of institutions: (1) commercial banks and all  subsidiaries of bank holding companies, (2) limited-purpose credit card  banks, (3) ILCs, (4) municipal deposit banks, (5) trust banks, (6) S&Ls  that are subsidiaries of grandfathered unitary savings and loan holding  companies (\u201cgrandfathered S&Ls\u201d), and (7) other S&Ls. All institutions  that are subsidiaries of bank holding companies are in the first group. The  two groups of S&Ls are distinguished by the types of holding companies  of which they are subsidiaries. Prior to the enactment of the Gramm- Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) in 1999, unitary S&L holding companies could  generally operate without activity restrictions. GLBA restricted companies  that filed applications to acquire an S&L after May 4, 1999, to only  engage in activities permissible for S&L holding companies. Existing  unitary S&L holding companies were \u201cgrandfathered\u201d and could continue  to engage in any type of financial or commercial activities. Thus, some  S&Ls are subsidiaries of grandfathered unitary S&L holding companies  that are not subject to activity restrictions, while other S&Ls are either  subsidiaries of holding companies that are subject to activity restrictions  or are not subsidiaries of holding companies.", "We obtained lists of limited-purpose credit card banks, ILCs, municipal  deposit banks, and trust banks as of September 30, 2010, or December  31, 2010, from FDIC, the Federal Reserve, and OCC. We then used  institution histories obtained from FDIC\u2019s Bank Find website (Bank Find)  to adjust those lists to reflect institutions\u2019 types as of June 30, 2010. We  used FDIC\u2019s SOD data to identify S&Ls. To further identify grandfathered  S&Ls, we obtained a list of grandfathered unitary S&L holding companies  and their subsidiaries as of December 31, 2010, from OTS. Because the  unitary S&L holding companies were grandfathered in 1999, the savings  and loans that were their subsidiaries as of December 31, 2010, must  also have been their subsidiaries as of June 30, 2010. That is, an S&L  could not have become a subsidiary of a grandfathered unitary S&L  holding company between June 30, 2010, and December 31, 2010.  Finally, we used FDIC\u2019s SOD data to identify commercial banks and all  institutions that are subsidiaries of bank holding companies. All  institutions that are subsidiaries of bank holding companies\u2014including  limited-purpose credit card banks, ILCs, municipal deposit banks, S&Ls,  and trust banks\u2014are put in the group containing commercial banks and  bank holding company subsidiaries.", "We estimated each group\u2019s share of the market for various types of loans,  including total loans and leases; construction and land development  loans; residential mortgage loans, multifamily, commercial, and  agricultural real estate loans; commercial, industrial, and agricultural  production loans; credit card loans; consumer loans other than credit card  loans; and leases. A group\u2019s market share is equal to the total dollar  value of loans on the balance sheets of all institutions in the group as a  percent of the total dollar value of loans on the balance sheets of all  institutions in the market.", "To assess the extent to which the price of credit and the quantity of credit  available are likely to be affected if the exemptions are removed, we  calculated the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) of market concentration  in loan markets. The HHI is a key statistical indicator used to assess the  market concentration and the potential for firms to exercise market power.  The HHI reflects the number of firms in the market and each firm\u2019s market  share, and it is calculated by summing the squares of the market shares  of each firm in the market. For example, a market consisting of four firms  with market shares of 30 percent, 30 percent, 20 percent, and 20 percent  has an HHI of 2,600 (900 + 900 + 400 + 400 = 2600). The HHI ranges  from 10,000 (if there is a single firm in the market) to a number  approaching zero (in the case of a perfectly competitive market). That is,  higher values of the HHI indicate a more concentrated market.  Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission guidelines as of  August 19, 2010, suggest that an HHI between 0 and 1,500 indicates that  a market is not concentrated, an HHI between 1,500 and 2,500 indicates  that a market is moderately concentrated, and an HHI greater than 2,500  indicates that a market is highly concentrated, although other factors also  play a role in determining market concentration.", "To calculate HHIs, we defined a firm as the collection of all FDIC-insured  institutions that are subsidiaries of the same parent company (for  institutions that are subsidiaries of parent companies) or the institution  itself (for institutions that are not subsidiaries of parent companies).  Parent companies of FDIC-insured institutions are either bank holding  companies, S&L holding companies, or other parent companies. We  identified bank holding company parents and all their subsidiaries for  each year using FDIC\u2019s SOD data. We obtained lists of S&L holding  company parents and their OTS-regulated subsidiaries from OTS. Based  on data for 2011, we assumed that each savings bank that is not a  subsidiary of a bank holding company is either a standalone institution  without a parent company or is the only FDIC-insured subsidiary of its  parent holding company. We obtained data on other parent companies\u2014 the nonbank holding company, non-S&L holding company parent  companies of some credit card banks, industrial loan companies, and  trust banks\u2014for 2010 from FDIC and OCC. A limitation of this strategy is  that we may not have identified all the institutions that belong to the same  other parent company. As a result, our HHIs may understate the amount  of concentration in the market.", "We calculated the HHI for the markets for various types of loans,  including total loans and leases; construction and land development  loans; residential mortgage loans; multifamily, commercial, and  agricultural real estate loans; commercial, industrial, and agricultural  production loans; credit card loans; consumer loans other than credit card  loans; and leases. We first calculated each firm\u2019s market share as the  total dollar value of loans on the balance sheets of all institutions in the  firm as a percent of the total dollar value of loans on the balance sheets  of all institutions in the market. We then summed the squared market  shares of every firm in the market to obtain the HHI for that market.", "For groups composed of grandfathered S&Ls (part of a unitary S&L  holding company), ILCs, and limited-purpose credit card banks, we  estimated the change in the HHI for each loan market in alternative  scenarios in which each group of exempt institutions ceases to make  loans and transfers the loans on its balance sheets among firms in the  market. In the first scenario, we assumed that the exiting institutions\u2019  loans are distributed proportionally among remaining firms. In the second  scenario, we assumed that the exiting institutions\u2019 loans are acquired by  the largest firm remaining in the market.", "A limitation of including only FDIC-insured institutions in our market share  and HHI calculations is that we exclude many institutions that do not have  FDIC insurance but that provide credit, such as uninsured affiliates of  FDIC-insured institutions, credit unions, and finance companies. Capital  markets are another source of funds. Thus, our calculations may  overstate exempt institutions\u2019 share of loan markets. Furthermore, our  calculations may either overstate or understate the amount of  concentration in loan markets, depending on the numbers and sizes of  the firms we are excluding.", "Our analysis implicitly assumes loan markets are national markets, that  is, that credit provided by an institution is available to any potential  borrower, regardless of their respective geographic locations. We make  this assumption because subnational loan data are not readily available.  If loan markets are not national in scope, then our market share and  market concentration estimates are unlikely to represent those that we  would estimate for a specific subnational geographic region, such as a  state or metropolitan area. The market share and market concentration  estimates for some regions would likely be greater than our national  estimates, while others would likely be lower.", "We assessed the reliability of all of the data used to determine the  potential implications of removing the exemptions and found that the data  were sufficiently reliable for our purposes.
