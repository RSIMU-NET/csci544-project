Beginning January 1, 2014, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) prohibits health insurers in the individual market from denying coverage, increasing premiums, or restricting benefits because of a pre-existing condition. GAO was asked to examine the effect of this provision on adults who are 19-64 years old. GAO examined (1) the most common medical conditions that would cause an insurance company to restrict or deny insurance coverage for adults and the average annual costs associated with these conditions, (2) estimates of the number of adults with pre-existing conditions, and (3) the geographic and demographic profile of adults with pre-existing conditions.", "To address these three issues, GAO (1) identified four recent studies that narrowly or more broadly identified five lists of conditions likely to result in restricted coverage in the individual insurance market and (2) used the 2009 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey to generate five separate estimates, referred to as estimates 1 through 5. There is no commonly accepted list of pre-existing conditions because each insurer determines the conditions it will use for medical underwriting. We also contacted state insurance department officials in all 50 states and the District of Columbia to confirm information about state insurance protections that currently limit or prohibit medical underwriting."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Hypertension was the most commonly reported medical condition among adults that could result in a health insurer denying coverage, requiring higher-than-average premiums, or restricting coverage. GAO\u0092s analysis found that about 33.2 million adults age 19-64 years old, or about 18 percent, reported hypertension in 2009. Individuals with hypertension reported average annual expenditures related to treating the condition of $650, but maximum reported expenditures were $61,540. Mental health disorders and diabetes were the second and third most commonly reported conditions among adults. Cancer was the condition with the highest average annual treatment expenditures\u0097about $9,000.", "Depending on the list of conditions used to define pre-existing conditions in each of the five estimates, GAO found that between 36 million and 122 million adults reported medical conditions that could result in a health insurer restricting coverage. This represents between 20 and 66 percent of the adult population, with a midpoint estimate of about 32 percent. The differences among the estimates can be attributed to the number and type of conditions included in the different lists of pre-existing conditions. For example, estimate 1, which is the lowest estimate, includes adults reporting that they had ever been told they had 1 or more of 8 conditions. Estimate 3, the midpoint estimate, includes any individual reporting they had one of over 60 conditions. Estimate 5, the highest estimate, includes any individual reporting a chronic condition in 2009.", "The estimated number of adults with pre-existing conditions varies by state, but most individuals, 88-89 percent depending on the list of pre-existing conditions included, live in states that do not report having insurance protections similar to those in PPACA. Compared to others, adults with pre-existing conditions spend thousands of dollars more annually on health care, but pre-existing conditions are common across all family income levels.", "The Department of Health and Human Services reviewed a draft of this report and had no substantive or technical comments."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Americans obtain health insurance coverage through a variety of private  and public sources, but a majority\u201467 percent of adults as of 2010\u2014rely  on private insurance, most through employer-sponsored group coverage.  Another 16 percent of adults in 2010 had coverage through public  programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and about 22 percent were  uninsured. While group health plans and health insurers offering group  coverage may not condition eligibility based on an individual\u2019s health  status, such protections generally do not exist for individuals attempting to  purchase coverage directly through the private individual market, which  accounted for about 14.6 million adults aged 18-64 years old in 2010. In  addition, individuals are at risk of losing the protections of employer- sponsored group coverage if they become unemployed or retire before  eligibility for Medicare begins at age 65 and they have a break in health  coverage. With certain exceptions, such individuals and any other  individual attempting to purchase coverage in the private individual  market can have coverage denied, offered at a higher-than-average  premium, or offered with a rider that excludes coverage of a pre-existing  condition. A pre-existing condition is a health condition that exists before  someone applies for or enrolls in a new health insurance policy. Each  insurer develops its own list of pre-existing conditions that influences to  whom and under what terms it offers coverage. Pre-existing conditions  can be conditions that an individual is currently being treated for (such as  heart disease) or past health problems (such as cancer in remission).", "With the enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act  (PPACA) in March 2010, enrollment in private health insurance could  expand significantly, particularly for individuals and families that do not  have access to group coverage through their employer. PPACA  provisions that could expand such coverage include income-based  subsidies to make coverage more affordable for certain individuals,  penalties for individuals not obtaining coverage, and new insurance  requirements to increase access to coverage, particularly for individuals  with pre-existing conditions. Specifically, beginning January 1, 2014,  health insurers in the individual market will be prohibited from denying  coverage, increasing premiums, or restricting benefits because of a pre- existing condition.", "To better understand the potential impact of PPACA, you asked us to  examine the demographics of adults with pre-existing conditions. In this  report, we examine: (1) the most common medical conditions that would  cause an insurance company to restrict or deny insurance coverage for  adults and the average annual costs associated with these conditions,   (2) estimates of the number of adults with pre-existing conditions, and   (3) the geographic and demographic profile of adults with pre-existing  conditions. We define adults as age 19-64 years old in this report  because a PPACA provision prohibiting insurers from denying coverage  or restricting benefits because of a pre-existing condition for individuals  under the age of 19 became effective September 23, 2010, and Medicare  covers individuals 65 and older.", "To address these three issues, we identified several recent studies that  listed conditions considered likely to result in restricted coverage in the  individual insurance market and then used the 2009 Medical Expenditure  Panel Survey (MEPS) to analyze the conditions listed in each study in  order to develop estimates of (1) the number of adults reporting and costs  associated with treating specific pre-existing conditions, (2) size of the  total affected adult population with pre-existing conditions, and (3) their  geographic and demographic characteristics. MEPS is a commonly used,  nationally representative, and publicly available panel survey of  Americans; 2009 was the most recent year data were available. It  includes information on medical conditions and the costs associated with  those medical conditions, both self-reported and from a review of medical  events.", "We identified four recent studies that used different lists of pre-existing  conditions to develop five estimates of the number of affected individuals.  Each of these studies identified a set of conditions that would cause an  insurance company to deny health insurance coverage, offer coverage at  a higher-than-average premium, or offer coverage with restrictions. The  sets of conditions run the continuum from narrow (having one of eight  conditions that would qualify an individual for participation in a high-risk  pool) to broad (reporting any condition considered chronic). Each  insurer separately determines which conditions will result in restricted  coverage in the individual insurance market, so lists of conditions may not  be consistent from insurer to insurer.", "High-risk pools are designed for individuals who cannot obtain insurance in the individual  market because of a pre-existing condition, and therefore estimates of individuals  potentially eligible for high-risk pools can serve as a proxy for individuals with pre-existing  conditions.", "A chronic condition is defined as one that lasts 12 months or longer and places limits on  self-care, independent living, and social interactions and/or results in the need for ongoing  intervention.", "As shown in table 1, there were important differences across the four  studies, including the conditions and time frames considered, the  populations that the estimates were developed for (e.g., children and  adults under age 65, or solely the uninsured), the data sources used to  develop the estimates, and whether the study included only individuals  treated for a condition during a given year or individuals ever diagnosed  with a condition. We used the set of conditions developed for each study  to generate estimates of adults with pre-existing conditions using a  consistent data source (2009 MEPS) and population (19-64 year olds not  enrolled in Medicare). We assigned each condition list an estimate  number from 1 to 5 in order to more readily identify which set of study  conditions each estimate is based on. For example, the condition list in  the study authored by Harold Pollack is referred to as estimate 1.", "To describe the geographic and demographic profile of adults with pre- existing conditions, we further analyzed data on the low, midpoint, and  high estimates of adults with pre-existing conditions. To enable us to  develop estimates of individuals with pre-existing conditions living in  states reporting insurance protections similar to those that will be offered  under PPACA in 2014, we updated information on state insurance  protections previously reported by the Kaiser Family Foundation by  contacting state insurance department officials in all 50 states and the  District of Columbia.

Estimate 4 also includes individuals reporting neurotic and related  disorders, stress and adjustment disorders, conduct disorders, and  emotional disturbances.", "Estimate 5 was based on the methodology used in the GAO report  Health Insurance: Enrollment, Benefits, Funding, and Other  Characteristics of State High-Risk Health Insurance Pools, GAO-09-730R  (Washington, D.C.: July 22, 2009). This report used the Healthcare Cost  and Utilization Project\u2019s Chronic Condition Indicator to identify chronic  conditions in the 2006 MEPS, which were assumed to make a person  medically uninsurable and therefore potentially eligible for a state high- risk pool. The Chronic Condition Indicator categorizes all International  Classification of Diseases, Ninth Edition, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM)  codes as chronic or not chronic. A chronic condition is defined as a  condition that lasts 12 months or longer and meets one or both of the  following tests: (a) it places limitations on self-care, independent living,  and social interactions; and (b) it results in the need for ongoing  intervention with medical products, services, and special equipment.  Individuals reporting any condition considered chronic were included in  this estimate. We used the three-digit ICD-9-CM codes for medical  conditions. Of 1,019 three-digit ICD-9-CM codes, the Chronic Condition  Indicator categorized 417 as chronic.", "To standardize the estimates from the different sources, we applied the  conditions identified by each study to the same population (19 to 64 year  olds not enrolled in Medicare) and the same year and source of data (the  2009 MEPS) to construct estimates 1 through 5."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Identifying the Most Common Medical Conditions and Estimating Treatment Costs", "paragraphs": ["To estimate the number of adults (age 19 to 64) with medical conditions  that would cause an insurance company to restrict or deny insurance  coverage and the average expenditures related to these conditions, we  analyzed MEPS data on medical conditions and expenditures.

Guaranteed issue requirements prohibit the denial of coverage to  individuals based on pre-existing conditions. In some states, all products  must be guaranteed issue, while in other states guaranteed issue  requirements are only applicable to some individuals, for instance those  with 12 months of continuous coverage, or some standard product, such  as a basic health plan.

First, each insurance company  separately determines which medical conditions will result in a denial,  limitation in coverage, or an increase in premiums.

Therefore,  the population of individuals who would be denied by an insurer, offered  restricted coverage, or offered coverage at higher-than-average  premiums actually varies by each health insurer. Second, our estimates  could overstate the adult population with pre-existing conditions because  of the way in which conditions are aggregated in the MEPS database.
