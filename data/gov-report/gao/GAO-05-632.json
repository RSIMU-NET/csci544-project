Data collection methods for air and soil surveillance have varied across the services, for example, although they have been using the same monitoring standard for water surveillance. Variations in data collection have been compounded by different levels of training and expertise among service personnel responsible for OEHS. For some OEHS activities, a cross-service working group has been developing standards and practices to increase uniformity of data collection among the services. In addition, while the deployed military services have been conducting OEHS activities, they have not submitted all of the OEHS reports that have been completed during OIF, which DOD officials attribute to various obstacles, such as limited access to communication equipment to transmit reports for archiving. Moreover, DOD officials did not have the required consolidated lists of all OEHS reports completed during each quarter in OIF and therefore could not identify the reports they had not received to determine the extent of noncompliance. To improve OEHS reporting compliance, DOD officials said they were revising an existing policy to add additional and more specific OEHS requirements. DOD has made progress in using OEHS reports to address immediate health risks during OIF, but limitations remain in employing these reports to address both immediate and long-term health issues. OIF was the first major deployment in which OEHS reports have been used consistently as part of operational risk management activities intended to identify and address immediate health risks and to make servicemembers aware of the health risks of potential exposures. While these efforts may help reduce health risks, DOD has no systematic efforts to evaluate their implementation in OIF. In addition, DOD's centralized archive of OEHS reports for OIF has several limitations for addressing potential long-term health effects related to occupational and environmental exposures. First, access to the centralized archive has been limited due to the security classification of most OEHS reports. Second, it will be difficult to link most OEHS reports to individual servicemembers' records because not all data on servicemembers' deployment locations have been submitted to DOD's centralized tracking database. For example, none of the military services submitted location data for the first several months of OIF. To address problems with linking OEHS reports to individual servicemembers, the deployed military services have made efforts to include OEHS monitoring summaries in the medical records of some servicemembers for either specific incidents of potential exposure or for specific locations within OIF. Third, according to DOD and VA officials, no federal research plan has been developed to evaluate the longterm health of servicemembers deployed in support of OIF, including the effects of potential exposures to occupational or environmental hazards."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The health effects from service in military operations have been of  increasing interest, particularly since the end of the 1991 Persian Gulf War.

Subsequent  research and investigations into the nature and causes of these illnesses by  the Department of Defense (DOD), the Department of Veterans Affairs  (VA), the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Institute of  Medicine, and a Presidential Advisory Committee were hampered by a lack  of servicemember health and deployment data, including inadequate  occupational and environmental exposure data.

The operational risk management process includes risk  assessments of deployment locations, risk mitigation activities to limit  potential exposures, and risk communication to servicemembers and  commanders about potential hazards.", "Risk Assessments. Preventive medicine units from each of the services  have generally used OEHS information and reports to develop risk  assessments that characterized known or potential hazards when new  bases were opened in OIF. CHPPM\u2019s formal risk assessments have also  been summarized or updated to include the findings of baseline and  routine OEHS monitoring conducted while bases are occupied by  servicemembers, CHPPM officials said. During deployments,  commanders have used risk assessments to balance the identified risk  of occupational and environmental health hazards, and other  operational risks, with mission requirements. Alternatively, some  preventive medicine units have addressed hazards identified through  risk assessments without initially involving a commander. A Navy  official said that, for example, if a preventive medicine unit found  elevated bacteria levels when monitoring a drinking water purification  system, the unit would likely order that the system be shut down and  corrected and then notify the commander of the action in a summary  report of OEHS activities. Generally, OEHS risk assessments for OIF  have involved analysis of the results of air, water, or soil monitoring.  CHPPM officials said that most risk assessments that they have received  characterized locations in OIF as having a low risk of posing health  hazards to servicemembers.", "Risk Control and Mitigation. Using risk assessment findings, preventive  medicine units have recommended risk control and mitigation activities  to commanders that were intended to reduce potential exposures at  specific locations. For OIF, risk control and mitigation  recommendations at bases have included such actions as modifying  work schedules, requiring individuals to wear protective equipment, and  increasing sampling to assess any changes and improve confidence in  the accuracy of the risk estimate.", "Risk Communication. Risk assessment findings have also been used in  risk communication efforts, such as providing access to information on  a Web site or conducting health briefings to make servicemembers  aware of occupational and environmental health risks during a  deployment and the recommended efforts to control or mitigate those  risks, including the need for medical follow-up. Many of the risk  assessments for OIF we reviewed recommended that health risks be  communicated to servicemembers.", "The experience at Port Shuaiba, Kuwait, provides an illustration of the risk  management process. Officials determined that Port Shuaiba, which had a  moderate risk rating in numerous OEHS risk assessments, had the highest  assessed risk for potential environmental exposures identified in OIF. The  site is a deepwater port used for bringing in heavy equipment in support of  OIF, and a large number of servicemembers have been permanently or  temporarily stationed at this site. CHPPM officials said reported concerns  about air quality problems, such as sulfur dioxide emissions and  windblown dust and sand particles, and the concentration of a large  number of industrial facilities at Port Shuaiba led to this risk  characterization as a result of multiple OEHS risk assessments conducted  before and during OIF. Risk mitigation recommendations that have been  implemented at Port Shuaiba include increasing air monitoring to  continuous, 24-hour sampling; implementing the use of standard protective  equipment, such as goggles and face kerchiefs; and using dust suppression  measures, such as laying gravel over the entire location to reduce dust.  CHPPM officials said they were uncertain whether some other risk  mitigation recommendations for Port Shuaiba had been implemented, such  as requiring servicemembers to stay inside buildings or tents as much as  possible when air pollution levels are high or increasing the number of  servicemembers available for operations to reduce the duration of shifts.  On the basis of recommendations from the risk assessments, military  officials have been attempting to transfer the activities at Port Shuaiba to a  nearby port that does not have industrial facilities, but servicemembers  have continued to live and work at the site, though in greatly reduced  numbers, CHPPM officials said. CHPPM officials said they have  recommended extensive risk communication activities at Port Shuaiba,  including providing information to servicemembers in town hall meetings  and through posters and handouts in dining facilities. In addition, CHPPM  officials said they have worked with commanders to allow CHPPM to  provide briefings about the identified and potential health hazards as soon  as new military units arrive at Port Shuaiba.", "While risk management activities have become more widespread in OIF  compared with previous deployments, DOD officials have not conducted  systematic monitoring of deployed military services\u2019 efforts to conduct  OEHS risk management activities.

In  response to recommendations for risk mitigation and risk communication  activities, commanders may have issued written orders and guidance that  were not always stored in a centralized, permanent database that could be  used to track risk management activities.

For example, the Marine Corps has provided location of  servicemembers only by country, whereas each of the other military  services has provided more detailed location information for some of their  servicemembers, such as base camp name or grid coordinate locations.  Furthermore, the military services did not begin providing detailed location  data until OIF had been ongoing for several months.", "DHSD officials said they have been revising an existing policy to provide  additional requirements for location data that are collected by the military  services, such as a daily location record with grid coordinates or latitude  and longitude coordinates for all servicemembers. Though the revised  policy has not been published, as of May 2005 the Army and the Marine  Corps had implemented a new joint location database in support of OIF  that addresses these revisions.", "During OIF, some efforts have been made to include information about  specific incidents of potential and actual exposure to occupational or  environmental health hazards in the medical records of servicemembers  who may be affected. According to DOD officials, after preventive  medicine units have investigated incidents involving potential exposure,  they generally have developed narrative summaries of events and the  results of any medical procedures for inclusion in affected  servicemembers\u2019 medical records. Additionally, rosters were generally  developed of servicemembers directly affected and of servicemembers  who did not have any acute symptoms but were in the vicinity of the  incident. For example, in investigating an incident involving a chemical  agent used in an improvised explosive device, CHPPM officials said that  two soldiers who were directly involved were treated at a medical clinic,  and their treatment and the exposure were recorded in their medical  records. Although 31 servicemembers who were providing security in the  area were asymptomatic, doctors were documenting this potential  exposure in their medical records.", "In addition, the military services have taken some steps to include  summaries of potential exposures to occupational and environmental  health hazards in the medical records of servicemembers deployed to  specific locations. The Air Force has created summaries of these hazards at  deployed air bases and has required that these be placed in the medical  records of all Air Force servicemembers stationed at these bases. (See app.  II for an example.) However, Air Force officials said no follow-up activities  have been conducted specifically to determine whether all Air Force  servicemembers have had the summaries placed in their medical records.  In addition, the Army and Navy jointly created a summary of potential  exposure for the medical records of servicemembers stationed at Port  Shuaiba. Since December 2004, port officials have made efforts to make the  summary available to servicemembers stationed at Port Shuaiba so that  these servicemembers can include the summary in their medical records.  However, there has been no effort to retroactively include the summary in  the medical records of servicemembers stationed at the port prior to that  time."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "No Federal Research Plan Exists for Using OEHS Reports to Follow the Health of OIF Servicemembers over Time", "paragraphs": ["According to DOD and VA officials, no federal research plan that includes  the use of archived OEHS reports has been developed to evaluate the long- term health of servicemembers deployed in support of OIF, including the  effects of potential exposure to occupational or environmental hazards.

However, the Deployment  Health Working Group, a federal interagency body responsible for  coordinating research on all hazardous deployments, recently began  discussions on the first steps needed to develop a research plan for OIF.  At its January 2005 meeting, the working group tasked its research  subcommittee to develop a complete list of research projects currently  under way that may be related to OIF.

However, these efforts still could be strengthened.  OEHS data that the deployed military services have collected during OIF  may not always be comparable because of variations among the services\u2019  data collection standards and practices. As a result of these variations, the  amount and comprehensiveness of data for servicemembers from one  military service may be more extensive than for servicemembers from  another service. Additionally, the deployed military services\u2019 uncertain  compliance with OEHS report submission requirements casts doubts on  the completeness of CHPPM\u2019s OEHS archive. These data shortcomings, in  conjunction with the incomplete data in DOD\u2019s centralized tracking  database of servicemembers\u2019 deployment locations, limit CHPPM\u2019s ability  to respond to requests for OEHS information about possible exposure to  occupational and environmental health hazards of those who are serving or  have served in OIF. Other limitations may also impede the  comprehensiveness of the archived OEHS reports, including the inability to  collect OEHS data outside of base camps and a lack of knowledge of all  potential health hazards. Nonetheless, these limitations do not outweigh  the need to collect data on known or expected hazards in order to make  every effort to address potential health issues. DHSD officials have said  they are revising an existing policy on OEHS data collection and reporting  to add additional and more specific OEHS requirements. However, unless  the military services take measures to direct those responsible for OEHS  activities to proactively implement the new requirements, the services\u2019  efforts to collect and report OEHS data may not improve.", "DOD\u2019s risk management efforts during OIF represent a positive step in  helping to mitigate potential environmental and occupational risks of  deployment. But the effects of such efforts are unknown without  systematic monitoring of the deployed military services\u2019 implementation  activities. Rates of disease and nonbattle injury have been used as an  overall surrogate outcome measure for risk management in OIF, but DOD  and the military services currently are unable to ascertain how and to what  extent risk management efforts have contributed to the relatively low  disease and nonbattle injury rate for OIF.", "Although OEHS reports alone are not sufficient to identify the causes of  potential long-term health effects in deployed servicemembers, they are an  integral component of research to evaluate the long-term health of  deployed servicemembers. However, efforts by a joint DOD and VA  working group to develop a federal research plan for OIF that would  include examining the effects of potential exposure to occupational and  environmental health hazards have just begun, despite similarities in  deployment location to the 1991 Persian Gulf War. Unless DOD addresses  OEHS data collection and reporting weaknesses and develops a federal  research plan for OIF with VA, the departments ultimately may face the  same criticisms they faced following the first Gulf War over their inability  to adequately address the long-term health issues of servicemembers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making recommendations aimed at improving the collection and  reporting of OEHS data during deployments and improving OEHS risk  management.

However, DOD stated that officials are planning steps  that will meet the intent of our recommendation to improve the collection  and reporting of OEHS data during deployments. DHSD officials stated that  cross-service implementation guidance for the revised policy on  deployment OEHS would be developed by the Joint Staff instead of by the  individual military services, as we originally recommended. We believe that  the development of cross-service implementation guidance is a critical  element needed to improve OEHS data collection and reporting during  deployments, regardless of the entity responsible for developing this  guidance. Therefore, we modified the wording of our recommendation to  clarify our intent that joint guidance be developed.", "DOD partially concurred with our recommendation that the military  services jointly establish and implement procedures to evaluate the  effectiveness of risk management efforts. DOD stated that OEHS reports  would be of no value for \u201cimmediate\u201d health risks, except for incident- driven reports, and assumed that we were referring to health risks that may  occur once servicemembers return from a deployment. However, our  findings describe the OEHS operational risk management process that is  specifically conducted during a deployment, including risk assessment, risk  mitigation, and risk communication activities that are used to identify and  reduce the risk of immediate health hazards. Additionally, DOD stated that  it has procedures in place to evaluate OEHS risk management through a  jointly established and implemented lessons learned process. Because the  lessons learned process was not raised by agency officials during our  review, we did not determine whether it would systematically monitor or  evaluate the effectiveness of OEHS risk management activities. However,  in further discussions, DHSD officials told us that they were not aware of  any lessons learned reports related to OEHS risk management for OIF.", "DOD partially concurs with our recommendation that DOD and VA work  together to develop a federal research plan to follow the health of  servicemembers deployed in support of OIF that would include the use of  archived OEHS reports. Although DOD states that it agrees with the  importance of following the health of its servicemembers, its response  focuses on initiatives for the electronic exchange of clinical health  information with VA. In further discussions, DHSD officials explained that  analysis of this clinical information could lead to the development of  research hypotheses and, ultimately, research questions that would guide  federal health research. Although DOD officials stated that they have not  yet linked any occupational or environmental exposures to specific adverse  health effects, there is no certainty that long-term health effects related to  these types of exposures will not appear in veterans of OIF. Federal  research has not clearly identified the causes of unexplained illnesses  reported by servicemembers who served in the 1991 Persian Gulf War, and  OIF servicemembers are serving in the same region for longer periods of  time.", "Separately, VA concurred with our recommendation to work jointly with  DOD to develop a federal research plan to follow the health of OIF  servicemembers. VA confirmed that the Deployment Health Working  Group, which includes DOD officials, had initiated steps in January 2005  toward developing a comprehensive joint federal surveillance plan to  evaluate the long-term health of servicemembers returning from both OIF  and Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF). However, more importantly, the  difference in VA and DOD\u2019s responses to this recommendation illustrates a  disconnect between each agency\u2019s understanding of whether and how such  a federal research plan should be established. Therefore, continued  collaboration between the agencies to formulate a mutually agreeable  process for proactively creating a federal research plan would be beneficial  in facilitating both agencies\u2019 ability to anticipate and understand the  potential long-term health effects related to OIF deployment versus taking  a more reactive stance in waiting to see what types of health problems may  surface.", "In its response, VA also contends that we overstate problems related to its  ability to access DOD\u2019s classified occupational and environmental health  data. VA notes that it has staff with the necessary security clearances to  examine classified OEHS reports, so that there is no barrier to access.  However, during our review VA officials expressed concerns that they did  not have OEHS data and that access to the data was difficult. Even if VA  staff have security clearances that enable them to examine OEHS data, any  materials that arise from the use of classified documents, such as research  papers or other publications, would likely be restricted. Therefore, these  results would have limited use, as they cannot be broadly shared with other  researchers and the general public. Nonetheless, VA maintains that  development of a systematic method to tabulate and organize the exposure  data is needed, as is a complete roster of OIF and OEF veterans, pre- and  post-deployment health screening data, and a complete roster of the most  seriously injured veterans. We agree that a systematic method to organize  and share OEHS data is important.

We attempted to  include only unique OIF bases in our analysis; however, CHPPM officials  told us that a few duplicate OIF bases may be included in our analysis due  to reasons such as frequent base openings and closures and base name  changes. We used these supporting documents to identify the number and  percentage of bases with and without baseline or routine reports during the  reporting periods. Incident-driven reports reflect OEHS investigations of  unexpected incidents and would not be submitted to CHPPM\u2019s archive  according to any identified pattern.

To characterize the OEHS reports for  OIF submitted to CHPPM, we discussed the numbers of reports submitted  and characterized the categories of reports using percentages.

Workers  are  provided  appropriate  protective  equipment  (i.e.  nitrile/rubber  gloves, goggles, safety glasses and face s hields) when and where needed.  5.  Radiation:  Ionizing radiation is emitted from medical/dental x-ray and OSI operations, and low-level radioactive materials  present  in equipment such as chemical ag ent monitors and alar ms.  No worker has been identified as exceed ing 10% of the 5 REM/year OSHA  permissible  exposure  level.    Radio  frequency  (RF)  radiation  is  emitted  from  multiple  radar  systems  and  communication  equipment.  Systems are marked with warning signs and communication workers recei ve appropriate training.
