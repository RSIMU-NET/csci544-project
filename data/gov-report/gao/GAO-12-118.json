Because most of the usable spectrum in the United States has been allocated to existing uses, FCC must change its rules to move spectrum from an existing use to a new use, a process known as repurposing spectrum. Yet, this process can be lengthy\u0097from 7 to 15 years for the six repurposings that GAO reviewed. Four factors contribute to the time it takes FCC to repurpose spectrum: the regulatory nature of the process, which to some extent is guided by statute; opposition of incumbent users, who could be required to vacate spectrum; coordination challenges between FCC and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), which oversees federal agencies\u0092 use of spectrum, on the repurposing of federal spectrum for commercial use; and concerns about interference from users of spectrum in adjacent bands of spectrum. FCC has identified voluntary approaches that it thinks could speed the process, but these approaches generally require congressional approval and face some stakeholder opposition.", "Experts and stakeholders had mixed views on FCC\u0092s plans and recent actions to meet future spectrum needs. The National Broadband Plan included a set of recommendations to FCC, FCC and NTIA jointly, and Congress, aimed at meeting future spectrum needs. Some recommendations garnered broad support, including recommendations to auction certain bands of spectrum and enhance research and development. However, experts\u0092 and stakeholders\u0092 opinions diverged on other recommendations, such as reallocating a portion of spectrum from television to wireless broadband. Opinions also varied on FCC\u0092s progress in implementing the recommendations. In some instances, these conflicting opinions arose from participants\u0092 divergent positions in the industry, with, for example, incumbent licensees such as broadcasters opposing recommendations that they believe could impose burdens or costs on their businesses.", "Experts and stakeholders GAO contacted strongly supported extending FCC\u0092s auction authority, but varied in their opinions on potential changes to auctions. Since 1994, FCC has used auctions to assign mutually exclusive licenses to commercial entities providing certain wireless services. GAO previously reported that auctions were effective in assigning licenses to entities that valued them the most; were quicker, less costly, and more transparent than mechanisms FCC previously used to assign licenses; and were an effective mechanism for the public to realize a portion of the value of a national resource used for commercial purposes. Experts and stakeholders responding to GAO\u0092s survey strongly supported extending FCC\u0092s auction authority\u009753 of 65 respondents supported extending FCC\u0092s authority. However, experts and stakeholders held varied opinions on potential changes to auctions. For example, respondents generally supported actions that would provide a clear road map detailing future auctions, which could reduce uncertainty. In contrast, a proposal to require winners of auctions to pay royalties based on their revenues rather than the full amount of their winning bids up front garnered the least support."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["Given the continued support of FCC's use of auctions, Congress should consider extending FCC's auction authority beyond the current expiration date of September 30, 2012.

Demand for radio-frequency spectrum has exploded over the past several  decades as new technologies and services have been and continue to be  brought to the market in the private sector and new mission needs unfold  among government users of spectrum, including wireless  communications critical for public safety officials responding to natural  and man-made disasters. As a result, nearly all parties are becoming  increasingly concerned about the availability of spectrum for future needs,  because most of the usable spectrum in the United States has already  been allocated to existing services and users. These concerns are  compounded by evidence that some of the spectrum is currently  underutilized. Therefore, to promote more efficient use of this resource  and meet future needs, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)  has increasingly adopted more market-oriented approaches to spectrum  management in recent years, including using a competitive bidding  process, or auctions, to assign spectrum licenses to commercial users.  From 1994, when FCC first implemented its auction authority, through  June 30, 2011, FCC held 79 auctions for over 68,000 licenses to select  between competing applications for the same license, and generated  nearly $52 billion for the U.S. Treasury. In addition, in March 2010, an  FCC task force issued the National Broadband Plan aimed at achieving  affordability and maximizing the use of broadband, or high-speed Internet  access, to advance a range of economic and civic goals. Because  broadband access and use is becoming increasingly mobile and wireless,  the plan included a set of recommendations aimed at ensuring efficient  allocation and use of radio-frequency spectrum for wireless broadband  services. In some instances, the plan recommends that FCC change its  rules to move certain bands of spectrum from an existing use, such as  television broadcasting, to new uses, such as wireless broadband, a  process known as repurposing spectrum.", "In response to your request to review FCC\u2019s management of commercial  spectrum, we examined (1) the extent to which FCC has made spectrum  available for new commercial uses since it implemented auction authority  in 1994 and the time taken to do so, (2) experts\u2019 and stakeholders\u2019 views  on FCC\u2019s plans and recent actions to meet future spectrum needs, and  (3) experts\u2019 and stakeholders\u2019 views on the continued use of auctions to  assign spectrum. In addition, we examined the extent to which FCC  seeks to ensure the quality of its data on commercial spectrum licenses  (see app. II).", "To address these issues, we reviewed FCC\u2019s plans, notices, orders, and  other publications. We interviewed officials at FCC and analyzed FCC\u2019s  quality control processes for its four spectrum license databases\u2014the  Universal Licensing System, the Consolidated Database System, the  International Bureau Filing System, and the Experimental Licensing  System\u2014and for FCC\u2019s database of authorizations of equipment using  the radio frequency spectrum, the Equipment Authorization System. We  reviewed six instances since 1994 in which FCC made spectrum  available by repurposing it for new commercial uses; we limited our  analysis to repurposings that involved substantial amounts of spectrum  that were repurposed to a higher value use. We reviewed the National  Broadband Plan and reports and orders related to FCC\u2019s implementation  of the plan. We also reviewed industry comments on the plan and FCC\u2019s  steps to implement the plan. In addition, we surveyed 30 experts and 79  industry stakeholders about their views on FCC\u2019s licensing data, the  amount of time it takes FCC to reallocate spectrum for new commercial  uses, the recommendations in the National Broadband Plan\u2019s chapter on  spectrum, FCC\u2019s steps to implement those recommendations, and the  continued use of auctions to assign spectrum. We selected the experts  and stakeholders based on their expertise in spectrum policy as  represented by presentations or publications, or on their organization\u2019s  vested interest in spectrum policy. Twenty of the experts and 54 of the  stakeholders responded to our survey, representing a 68 percent  response rate. Because we selected a nonprobability sample of experts  and industry stakeholders, the information we obtained from the survey  may not be generalized to all experts and industry stakeholders who have  an interest in spectrum policy. We also conducted semistructured  interviews with representatives of academia, industry, and public interest  groups. (See app. I for additional information on our scope and  methodology.) We conducted this performance audit from August 2010 to  November 2011 in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the  audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable  basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We  believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The radio-frequency spectrum is the part of the natural spectrum of  electromagnetic radiation lying between the frequency of 3 kilohertz (kHz)  and 300 gigahertz (GHz). It is the medium that makes possible wireless  communications and supports a vast array of commercial and  governmental services. Commercial entities use spectrum to provide a  variety of wireless services, including mobile voice and data, paging,  broadcast television and radio, and satellite services. Federal, state, and  local agencies use spectrum to fulfill a variety of government missions,  such as national defense, air-traffic control, weather forecasting, and  public safety.", "Spectrum is managed at the international and national levels. The  International Telecommunication Union (ITU), a specialized agency of the  United Nations, coordinates spectrum management decisions among  nations. Spectrum management decisions generally require international  coordination, since radio waves can cross national borders. Once  spectrum management decisions are made at the ITU, regulators within  each nation, to varying degrees, follow the ITU decisions. In the United  States, responsibility for spectrum management is divided between two  agencies: FCC and the Department of Commerce\u2019s National  Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA). FCC  manages spectrum use for nonfederal users, including commercial,  private, and state and local government users under authority provided in  the Communications Act. NTIA manages spectrum for federal  government users and acts for the President with respect to spectrum  management issues. FCC and NTIA, with direction from Congress and  the President, jointly determine the amount of spectrum allocated to  federal and nonfederal users, including the amount allocated to shared  use.", "Historically, concern about interference or crowding among users has  been a driving force in the management of spectrum. FCC and NTIA work  to minimize interference through two primary spectrum management  functions\u2014the \u201callocation\u201d and the \u201cassignment\u201d of radio spectrum.  Specifically:  \uf0b7  Allocation involves segmenting the radio spectrum into bands of  frequencies that are designated for use by particular types of radio  services or classes of users. For example, the frequency bands from  88 to 108 MHz are allocated to FM radio broadcasting in the United  States. (Fig. 1 illustrates examples of services by frequency band.) In  addition to allocation, spectrum managers specify service rules, which  include the technical and operating characteristics of equipment.  \uf0b7  Assignment, which occurs after spectrum has been allocated for  particular types of services or classes of users, involves providing  users, such as commercial entities or government agencies, with a  license or authorization to use a specific portion of spectrum. For  example, FCC assigned a license for the 88.5 MHz band in  Washington, D.C., to American University, for its radio station,  WAMU. FCC assigns licenses for frequency bands to commercial  enterprises, state and local governments, and other entities, while  NTIA makes frequency assignments to federal agencies.", "In some frequency bands, FCC authorizes unlicensed use of spectrum\u2014 that is, users do not need to obtain a license to use the spectrum. Rather,  an unlimited number of unlicensed users can share frequencies on a  noninterference basis. Thus, the assignment process does not apply to  the use of unlicensed spectrum. However, manufacturers of unlicensed  equipment must receive authorization from FCC before operating or  marketing an unlicensed device. Traditional unlicensed equipment  consists of low-powered devices that operate in a limited geographic  range, such as cordless phones, baby monitors, garage door openers,  and wireless access to the Internet.", "When FCC assigns a portion of spectrum to a single entity, the license is  considered exclusive. When two or more entities apply for the same  exclusive license, FCC classifies these as mutually exclusive  applications\u2014that is, the grant of a license to one entity would preclude  the grant to one or more other entities. Since 1994, FCC has primarily  used auctions to assign spectrum for mutually exclusive applications.  Auctions are a market-based mechanism in which FCC assigns a license  to the entity that submits the highest bid for specific bands of spectrum.  FCC was provided with authority to use auctions to assign mutually  exclusive licenses for certain subscriber-based wireless services in the  Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. FCC implemented its  auction authority conducting its first auction in 1994. In subsequent  years, Congress has modified and extended FCC\u2019s auction authority,  including exempting some licenses from competitive bidding, such as  licenses for public safety radio services and noncommercial educational  broadcast services. FCC\u2019s auction authority is scheduled to expire on  September 30, 2012.", "As of June 30, 2011, FCC had conducted 79 auctions to select between  competing applications for the same license, which have generated  nearly $52 billion for the U.S. Treasury. However, only about 3 percent of  licenses have been auctioned. The vast majority of the other 97 percent  of licenses were assigned through other means before FCC began using  auctions.", "In March 2010, an FCC task force issued the National Broadband Plan.  Because broadband access and use is becoming increasingly wireless,  the plan includes a set of recommendations aimed at ensuring efficient  allocation and use of radio-frequency spectrum for wireless broadband  services. The plan recommended that FCC make 300 MHz of spectrum  newly available for mobile broadband use in the next 5 years and 500  MHz of spectrum for broadband within the next 10 years. In June 2010,  the President issued a memorandum with a similar goal for NTIA working  in collaboration with FCC."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Since 1994, FCC Has Made Over 520 Megahertz of Spectrum Available for New Uses through a Process That Can Be Lengthy", "paragraphs": ["To accommodate new commercial uses of spectrum, such as wireless  broadband, FCC must often change its rules to move certain bands of  spectrum from an existing use to the new use, a process known as  repurposing spectrum.

We identified the  following factors that contribute to the time it takes FCC to repurpose  spectrum: the regulatory nature of repurposing, opposition of incumbent  users, FCC and NTIA coordination on the repurposing of federal  spectrum, and concerns about interference. FCC identified voluntary  approaches that it thinks could speed the process by, for example,  avoiding some opposition; however, these approaches generally require  congressional approval and face some stakeholder opposition."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "FCC Uses a Multiphase Process to Repurpose Spectrum", "paragraphs": ["Since most of the usable spectrum in the United States has been  allocated to existing uses, FCC must often repurpose spectrum from an  existing use to make it available for new uses. When there are competing  interests for specific spectrum, FCC determines which use or uses of the  spectrum will best serve the public interest, considering factors such as  economic and social value, including importance for public safety. FCC  also seeks to ensure that the spectrum is technically suitable for the new  use. To repurpose spectrum for a new use, FCC uses a three-phase  process:  Identification. As a first step, FCC identifies a spectrum band, or  bands, that appear to be good candidates for repurposing. To identify  candidate bands, FCC conducts a formal study or releases a notice of  proposed rulemaking soliciting industry input, or another party, such  as NTIA or Congress, identifies a candidate band.  \uf0b7  Reallocation. FCC subsequently reallocates the spectrum by  changing the designated use of the spectrum. FCC develops service  and other technical rules for the spectrum that define (1) the eligibility  criteria for users, (2) the services that users can provide, (3) the time  frames and other requirements for users to build the infrastructure  required to support the services, and (4) the interference limits.  \uf0b7  Reassignment or secondary markets. If the new use entails a licensed  use of the spectrum, new users must be assigned, or provided  authorization, to use the spectrum. In some cases, FCC reassigns the  spectrum to new entities, often using auctions. In other cases, FCC  permits incumbent licensees to sell or lease their licenses to other  entities, through a process known as secondary market transactions.  If the new use entails an unlicensed use of the spectrum, FCC does  not need to complete a reassignment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FCC Has Made Over 520 Megahertz of Spectrum Available for New Commercial Uses", "paragraphs": ["Since 1994, FCC has completed six major repurposings of spectrum,  which have made over 520 MHz of spectrum available for new  commercial uses. In most instances, FCC repurposed the spectrum to  enable mobile broadband service. Five of the six repurposings collectively  generated over $47 billion in auction revenues, which provides one  measure of the new economic value arising from the repurposing. The  former uses of the repurposed spectrum included microwave services,  specialized mobile radio services (such as those used in radio dispatch  systems), and one-way systems that transmit video (see table 1).", "The six major repurposings we reviewed took from 7 to 15 years to  complete, from the identification through the reassignment phase. For  example, the Enhanced Specialized Mobile Radio repurposing took 7  years while three repurposings\u2014Personal Communications Service,  Advanced Wireless Services-1, and 700 MHz Wireless\u2014took over 10  years to complete (see fig. 2). Similar to our findings, in the National  Broadband Plan, FCC noted that the process of revisiting or revising  spectrum allocations has historically taken 6 to 13 years.", "In addition to the time required to complete the repurposing process  (identification through reassignment), time is needed to relocate existing  users and allow new users to construct new wireless networks before  new services can be made available using the repurposed spectrum.  Typically, existing users must relocate to a new spectrum band or bands,  and new users must construct the infrastructure required to support their  services. While the participants undertake most of these actions, FCC  and other government agencies\u2019 actions and decisions can influence the  time frames. For example, FCC held the first auction for the Advanced  Wireless Services-1 repurposing in 2006, but NTIA expects that it will  take until 2013 for all federal agencies to relocate from the spectrum that  was repurposed for commercial use. In addition, FCC allowed licensees  15 years from the inception of their license term to begin providing  substantial service. Therefore, substantial service on a widespread  basis using the Advanced Wireless Services-1 spectrum appears unlikely  before 2013 and, in theory, could extend to 2021, fully 29 years after the  beginning of the identification phase, although FCC officials anticipate  that carriers will generally provide service sooner in order to meet their  business needs.", "Large majorities of stakeholders and experts that replied to our survey  indicated that the repurposing process takes too long. In particular, 39 of  46 stakeholders and 16 of 20 experts reported that it takes longer than it  should from the time FCC or Congress designates a spectrum band for  reallocation until the band is available for the new use. Furthermore, 25 of  these stakeholders and 11 of these experts reported that it takes much  longer than it should."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Several Factors Contribute to the Lengthiness of the Repurposing Process", "paragraphs": ["Based on our review of several completed and ongoing repurposings, the  relevant literature, interviews with agency officials and industry  participants, and our survey of stakeholders and experts, we identified  four factors that contribute to the time it takes FCC to repurpose  spectrum. These factors include the regulatory nature of repurposing,  opposition of incumbent users, FCC and NTIA coordination on the  repurposing of federal spectrum, and concerns about interference.  \uf0b7  Regulatory nature of repurposing. FCC\u2019s repurposing of spectrum is  often an iterative process involving deliberation based on extensive  industry participation. As shown in figure 3, the repurposing of  spectrum can involve stakeholder coordination efforts, issuance of  notices of proposed rulemaking and reports and orders, review of  stakeholder comments and reply comments, and multiple rounds of  assignment. For example, during the Personal Communications  Service repurposing, FCC adopted an order in September 1993, and  67 participants subsequently petitioned FCC for reconsideration  because of concerns about the spectrum to be reallocated and the  amount of spectrum to be individually licensed. In response, in June  1994, FCC amended the bands to be reallocated and assigned. In  1995, some stakeholders sued the Commission over the rules it  established in 1994 pertaining to ownership limitations in the wireless  communications industry. In November 1995, the Sixth Circuit Court  of Appeals decided against FCC\u2019s rules and remanded the matter for  further proceeding. In June 1996, FCC issued an order addressing  these issues.", "As also shown in figure 3, the assignment and, in some instances  multiple reassignments, of spectrum can lengthen the process of  repurposing spectrum. In some cases, prior to an auction and at the  direction of Congress or the courts, or the request of licensees and  potential bidders, FCC clarifies or revises the auction and relocation  rules. For example, in providing auction authority, which occurred  during the Personal Communications Service repurposing, Congress  directed FCC to expand opportunities for small businesses, minorities,  and women. FCC subsequently adopted competitive bidding rules  designed to encourage designated entities participation in Personal  Communications Service. However, 3 days before the auction, the  U.S. Supreme Court decided that \u201call racial classifications, imposed  by whatever federal, state, or local government actor, must be  analyzed by a reviewing court under strict scrutiny\u201d and the  Commission subsequently postponed the auction. In other  instances, the bankruptcy or default of an auction winner lengthened  the repurposing of spectrum. On several occasions, after winners of  the original auction declared bankruptcy or defaulted on their  payments, FCC repeated auctions. For example, FCC\u2019s auctions 10,  22, and 35 included reauctions of licenses won at prior auctions.  \uf0b7  Opposition of incumbent users. The completed repurposings we  reviewed involved opposition from incumbent users that took time to  resolve. Incumbent users are likely to incur costs for relocating but  derive little, if any, benefit and are therefore often reluctant to make a  move. For example, during the Personal Communications Service  repurposing, incumbent microwave users, which included utilities,  public safety entities, and petroleum and natural gas companies,  raised concerns that an allocation would displace a large number of  them, disrupt their operations to the detriment of the public, and  require them to purchase new equipment. In the Advanced Wireless  Services-1 repurposing, incumbent government agencies had  difficulties identifying current users of the spectrum and were reluctant  to give up spectrum because they believed the spectrum was critical  to fulfilling their mission and that relocating would cause them to incur  staff time and expenses for which they had not budgeted. In the 700  MHz Wireless repurposing, television broadcasters raised concerns  about the transition from analog to digital television, including their  need to use more spectrum for advanced television services and the  financial costs of building digital television stations. A law firm with  experience in FCC\u2019s repurposings characterized reallocations as  \u201ccontests between incumbent service providers and the new entrants  competing to unseat them.\u201d  \uf0b7  FCC and NTIA coordination on the repurposing of federal spectrum.", "Government efforts to coordinate the repurposing of federal spectrum  to commercial use can take many years; several factors contribute to  the lengthy time frame, including the lack of data and resources and  the time necessary to relocate existing federal users. For example,  the Advanced Wireless Services-1 repurposing, which combined  federal and nonfederal spectrum, took over 14 years and the passage  of several laws to complete. In 1992, FCC first identified the upper  Advanced Wireless Services-1 band, 2110-2150 MHz, for reallocation  to services using new and innovative technologies. In 1995, NTIA  identified the lower Advanced Wireless Services-1 band, 1710-1755  MHz, for transfer from exclusive use by the federal government to  FCC for commercial use. In 1997 legislation was enacted that  required NTIA to accelerate the availability of the lower Advanced  Wireless Services-1 band, and in 1998 legislation was enacted that  sought to encourage the transfer of spectrum from federal  government to private use by providing for mandatory reimbursement  of government spectrum users required to relocate from their  spectrum, including the lower Advanced Wireless Services-1 band.", "From 2000 through 2002, FCC and NTIA conducted further studies to  determine appropriate bands for Advanced Wireless Services-1.  Finally, in 2002, NTIA issued a study and FCC issued an order  allocating 90 MHz for Advanced Wireless Services.  \uf0b7  Concerns about interference. Users in adjacent bands often oppose a  repurposing of spectrum because they are concerned that the new  service will interfere with their existing service. A good example of this  concern arises with the 700 MHz Wireless repurposing, which  included the relocation of broadcast television stations; public safety  organizations raised the concern that the proposed relocation would  result in increased interference between broadcasting and public  safety operations. Similarly, with the Advanced Wireless Services-1  repurposing, some stakeholders raised concerns about the potential  for interference between Multipoint Distribution Service licensees and  Advanced Wireless Services systems.", "Resolving issues such as the opposition of incumbent users and  concerns about interference lengthens the time necessary to complete  the repurposing of spectrum, thereby delaying the introduction of possibly  more economically valuable services. As an independent regulatory  agency, FCC must follow many, but not all, federal laws related to  rulemaking. In particular, the Administrative Procedures Act outlines a  multistep process to initiate and develop rules and includes provisions for  parties to challenge them, which FCC must follow. Many steps require  agencies to provide public notice of proposed or final actions, as well as  provide a period of time for interested parties to comment on the notice.  Furthermore, the Communications Act outlines procedures for addressing  petitions for reconsideration by FCC and appeals to federal court for FCC  rules; the U.S. Courts of Appeals have jurisdiction to review all final FCC  rules. Given that the spectrum issues are often complicated and  controversial, FCC often issues multiple orders in the same proceeding to  deal with the many comments it receives and to address petitions for  reconsideration, as well as any direction from the courts. In the National  Broadband Plan, FCC identified voluntary approaches, such as incentive  auctions, that it thinks could speed the process. By incorporating  incentives into the process, FCC may avoid some opposition to  repurposings and thereby reduce the time necessary to repurpose  spectrum. However, these incentive approaches generally require  congressional approval and face stakeholder opposition themselves. As  we reported in 2003, \u201cwhile spectrum reform is increasingly being  discussed, debated, and reviewed, it does not appear likely that timely  reforms can be agreed upon amid the diversity of views held by  stakeholders,\u201d a situation that appears to hold to this day."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Responding Experts and Stakeholders Had Mixed Views on FCC\u2019s Plans and Recent Actions to Meet Future Spectrum Needs", "paragraphs": ["The National Broadband Plan includes recommendations in several areas  aimed at meeting future spectrum needs.

Discussion of the first three categories follows; appendix III  provides additional details on those three categories and also discusses  the last two categories."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Responding Experts and Stakeholders Generally Agreed with Making More Spectrum Available for Wireless Broadband Use by 2015", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Recommendations in Plan", "paragraphs": ["To meet anticipated increases in demand for wireless broadband services,  the plan contained a recommendation that FCC make 300 MHz of  spectrum newly available for such services by 2015 and 500 MHz by 2020.  These targets were based on an FCC staff forecast of spectrum demand.  In the plan, the largest source of spectrum\u2014120 MHz\u2014arises from the  repurposing of a portion of the spectrum currently allocated for broadcast  television service. Most experts and stakeholders other than television  broadcasters responding to our survey supported this recommendation,  while most responding broadcasters opposed it (see table 2). Both a  wireless device manufacturer and an expert said that the recommendation  is consistent with expected increases in demand for spectrum. Two  broadcasters said that wireless service providers could meet additional  demand by using their existing spectrum more intensively.", "To make 300 MHz of spectrum newly available by 2015, the plan included  five recommendations related to specific spectrum bands. In addition to  repurposing the 120 MHz of spectrum currently allocated to broadcast  television, the plan recommended accelerating terrestrial use of Mobile  Satellite Services spectrum by providing sufficient flexibility to licensees to  increase terrestrial broadband use of the spectrum, auctioning Advanced  Wireless Services and the Upper 700 MHz D-Block spectrum, and  revising outdated interference rules in the Wireless Communications  Services spectrum that largely preclude the use of the spectrum for  broadband. These recommendations, as well as experts\u2019 and  stakeholders\u2019 level of agreement with the recommendations, are shown in  table 2; in the table, we sometimes separately report broadcasters to  illustrate meaningful differences in their responses.", "The majority of responding experts and stakeholders agreed with each of  the five recommendations related to specific bands. However, the  recommendation on reallocating 120 MHz of television spectrum has  generated a significant amount of controversy, and this was reflected in  our survey results; the 120 MHz of television spectrum in this  recommendation is in addition to the spectrum made available through  the transition of television from analog to digital service in 2009. Experts  and stakeholders other than broadcasters strongly supported the  recommendation, whereas all 11 broadcasters strongly opposed it. FCC,  as well as some experts and stakeholders who supported reallocating a  portion of the television band, said that the spectrum would have much  higher economic value if it were allocated for wireless broadband. FCC,  for instance, argues that reallocating television spectrum for mobile  broadband would increase its value by roughly a factor of 10. According  to FCC, this difference in value reflects, in part, \u201cchallenging long-term  trends\u201d facing the television broadcasting industry; FCC noted, for  example, that the percentage of households viewing television solely  through over-the-air broadcasts declined from 24 percent in 1999 to 10  percent in 2010, and since 2005, broadcast television station revenues  have declined 26 percent. In contrast, broadcasters responding to our  survey cited the following arguments against reallocating a portion of the  television spectrum:  \uf0b7  Doing so would likely have a significant, negative impact on the  public\u2019s access to local television broadcasts, both via free over-the- air television and via cable and satellite, because broadcasters use  spectrum to provide local broadcasts to viewers both directly over-the- air and indirectly by broadcasting their signals to cable and satellite  television providers, which then retransmit the local broadcasts to  their subscribers.  \uf0b7  Broadcasters are deploying mobile digital television with their  spectrum. This deployment will play a significant role in mobile  broadband content delivery and should be encouraged to flourish as it  is the most efficient way of distributing video, which Cisco Systems,  Inc. says will account for 66 percent of all mobile traffic in 2015.  \uf0b7  A better way to move underutilized broadcast spectrum to mobile  carriers would be to allow broadcasters to sell or lease such spectrum  to mobile carriers in a private market transaction.  \uf0b7  FCC should not implement this recommendation without completing a  full spectrum inventory that also analyzes current utilization. Action, if  at all, should be predicated on demonstrated need rather than on  assertions of a looming spectrum crisis and after full investigation of  whether less disruptive alternatives to reallocation of broadcast  spectrum could address demonstrated needs.", "In the National Broadband Plan, FCC acknowledges that \u201cover-the-air  television continues to serve important functions in our society,\u201d by  providing, among other things, free access to news, entertainment, and  local programming; children\u2019s educational programming; coverage of  community news and events; reasonable access for federal political  candidates; and closed captioning and emergency broadcast information.  Therefore, FCC says that the plan\u2019s recommendations \u201cseek to preserve   as a healthy, viable medium going forward,\u201d and  the plan calls for FCC to \u201cstudy and develop policies to ensure that its  longstanding goals of competition, diversity, and localism [in broadcast  television] are achieved.\u201d However, these statements do not appear to  have assuaged the concerns of broadcasters.", "To implement the plan\u2019s recommendations to make more spectrum  available for broadband in specific bands, FCC, among other things:  \uf0b7  performed technical analysis and worked with broadcast industry  engineers and experts in related fields on how reallocating a portion of  television spectrum to broadband could work;  issued a proposed rule to establish a regulatory framework to facilitate  wireless broadband uses of television bands, in anticipation of the  Commission\u2019s intended future reallocation of this spectrum to  broadband;  \uf0b7  granted a waiver to a Mobile Satellite Services provider,  LightSquared, allowing it to expand its terrestrial use of its satellite  spectrum for broadband, conditional on addressing concerns about  interference with Global Positioning System devices;  \uf0b7  added co-primary fixed and mobile terrestrial wireless allocations to  the 2 GHz satellite band and gave Mobile Satellite Services licensees  the flexibility to lease their spectrum to terrestrial operators via  spectrum manager leasing arrangements, both of which FCC sees as  steps toward providing flexibility to allow greater use of the band for  mobile broadband;  revised its interference rules in Wireless Communications Services  spectrum to facilitate its use for broadband, along the lines  recommended by the plan; and  issued analyses supporting its recommendation to auction the Upper  700 MHz D block; while the plan recommends the auction of this  band, several proposals in the 112th Congress, such as the  SPECTRUM Act, S.911, and the Public Safety Spectrum and  Wireless Innovation Act, H.R. 2482, call for the reallocation of this  band for deployment of a nationwide broadband public safety network  and therefore FCC is waiting to see if any related active legislation is  passed before proceeding with implementation of this  recommendation.", "Experts and stakeholders responding to our survey that supported the  plan\u2019s overall recommendation to make 300 MHz of spectrum available  for wireless broadband by 2015 were fairly evenly split between those  satisfied and those dissatisfied with FCC\u2019s overall progress in  implementing the recommendation (see table 3). In contrast, regarding  FCC\u2019s progress on the recommendations aimed at specific bands,  experts and stakeholders tended to be more satisfied than dissatisfied.  For example, experts and stakeholders were generally satisfied with  FCC\u2019s progress on implementing the recommendation to accelerate  terrestrial deployment in Mobile Satellite Services spectrum but were  generally dissatisfied with FCC\u2019s progress on the Upper 700 MHz D  Block; although, as we note above, FCC is waiting on the outcome of  pending legislation pertaining to this spectrum band before taking further  action.", "Respondents expressed a variety of views on FCC\u2019s progress. For  example, one expert reported that FCC should have auctioned the Upper  700 MHz D block already but was satisfied with FCC\u2019s efforts to  accelerate terrestrial deployment in Mobile Satellite Services spectrum.  Another expert said that FCC\u2019s approach to spectrum policy has resulted  in the U.S. mobile and fixed wireless broadband industries losing ground  to their foreign counterparts.

FCC proposed incentive  auctions as a mechanism to free up 120 MHz of spectrum currently  allocated to television service, which as we noted above, broadcasters  oppose. The experts and stakeholders expressed a variety of views about  incentive auctions. For example, one expert commented that Congress  should simply allow FCC to pay some of the auction revenues to  broadcasters instead of the U.S. Treasury and avoid legislating any  details of the auction. An infrastructure provider said that incentive  auctions would take years off of FCC\u2019s usual repurposing approach,  which as we noted earlier has taken from 7 to 15 years. A broadcaster  commented that instead of using incentive auctions to reallocate  television spectrum, FCC should allow licensees to sell or lease their  licenses to wireless service providers. Another broadcaster commented  that incentive auctions would be acceptable so long as (1) participation by  broadcasters is truly voluntary and (2) FCC reimburses broadcasters who  choose not to participate for the costs they incur to relocate to new  frequencies.", "Many more experts agreed than disagreed with granting FCC authority to  impose fees on licensees, while slightly more wireless device  manufacturers and stakeholders in our \u201cother\u201d category agreed than  disagreed. All broadcasters disagreed with granting FCC authority to  impose fees, and about twice as many wireless service providers  disagreed as agreed; as licensees, broadcasters and wireless service  providers could be subject to the fees. The experts and stakeholders  expressed a variety of views about fees. An expert commented that the  value of spectrum is usually far greater than the amount recovered in  auctions, and that fees can better capture this value by being adjusted  upward if the value of the spectrum appreciates. Similarly, a public  interest group commented that annual fees would increase spectrum  utilization, give license holders who do not use their spectrum an  incentive to return it, and raise far more money for the U.S. Treasury than  auctions do. Alternatively, an expert responded that fees would not create  incentives for efficient use of spectrum, and suggested that instead FCC  allow competitive forces wider scope by permitting licensees to deploy  any service, technology, or business model that may be profitable. A  range of stakeholders commented that fees should be reduced or waived  for current licensees that purchased their licenses at auction or that  already pay annual regulatory fees.", "Almost all responding experts and most stakeholders agreed with the  recommendation that FCC identify and address barriers to secondary  markets. An expert responded that addressing barriers to secondary  markets would eliminate the need for incentive auctions. Similarly, a  broadcaster commented that allowing all current licensees to participate  in secondary markets would enable market forces to determine the best  use for spectrum without requiring wholesale reallocation of designated  bands. A wireless service provider noted that FCC\u2019s secondary market  rules have been greatly successful in creating access to spectrum  resources by nonlicensees, with leasing arrangements becoming  increasingly commonplace.", "In response to the recommendation on secondary markets, FCC officials  told us that the Commission reviewed its secondary markets policies and  concluded that it should do more to promote these markets. It also  requested public comments on technologies that could enable dynamic  sharing of spectrum, including how such technologies could facilitate  secondary markets. FCC officials told us that the Commission intended  to issue a related order, tentatively by the end of 2011. Among those  responding to our survey and that support the recommendation, more  experts and wireless device manufacturers were satisfied than  dissatisfied with FCC\u2019s progress, while more wireless service providers  were dissatisfied than satisfied (see table 5).", "Two broadcasters commented that FCC\u2019s analysis of barriers to  secondary markets must include broadcast spectrum to be credible and  effective.

Experts and stakeholders expressed a variety of  views about unlicensed uses. For example, an expert commented that  future demand for rich wireless media cannot be satisfied by licensed  spectrum alone but will require more unlicensed spectrum to provide  many more wireless fidelity (Wi-Fi) access points so that wireless traffic  can be off-loaded to the wired network. A wireless service provider said  that the potential benefit of unlicensed uses is so great that FCC should  be aiming to set aside a band for such uses within 2 to 3 years rather  than 10 years. In contrast, a Mobile Satellite Services company  responded that there is already enough spectrum available for unlicensed  uses. Similarly, an expert commented that because there are now  affordable devices that can operate effectively over a range of  frequencies, FCC should assist the market in using an online database as  it is doing for television white spaces so that unlicensed devices can  sense available spectrum and use it dynamically, rather than clearing a  new band for unlicensed use.", "More responding experts and stakeholders other than broadcasters  agreed than disagreed that FCC should move expeditiously to complete  new rules permitting unlicensed use of television white spaces, while  more broadcasters disagreed than agreed. Experts and stakeholders  expressed a variety of views on the recommendation. A wireless device  manufacturer that supported white spaces noted that white spaces are  primarily available in rural areas where spectrum congestion is less  common than in densely populated environments like urban areas. But,  three broadcasters responded that FCC must ensure that its rules protect  incumbent users from interference. Two experts expressed concern that  unlicensed use of television white spaces could adversely impact or be in  tension with an incentive auction of television spectrum.", "Experts and stakeholders generally supported the recommendation on  opportunistic uses, and they made a variety of comments on the  recommendation. For example, a wireless service provider supported the  continued development of dynamic spectrum access but expressed  strong opposition to FCC\u2019s development of any related rules that would  diminish the rights of licensees of exclusive spectrum purchased at  auction to control access to their spectrum. A broadcaster also  commented that FCC should protect the integrity of existing services; the  broadcaster disagreed with the recommendation on opportunistic uses  and stated that FCC should free incumbent licensees from technical  restrictions that hinder innovation. Similarly, an expert commented that  instead of implementing this recommendation, FCC should develop rules  that create incentives for competitive processes to create efficient  solutions to spectrum shortages. Another expert expressed doubt that  mass market technology and the demands of the commercial  marketplace will allow for opportunistic uses within the next decade.", "Experts and stakeholders generally supported the recommendation on  R&D. For example, a wireless service provider commented that, in  implementing this recommendation, FCC should leverage work that is  currently being done in private industry and in academia. Two other  wireless service providers reported that rather than trying to foster R&D  directly, FCC should instead focus on ensuring a highly competitive  marketplace for wireless services because competition spurs innovation  by market participants. A Mobile Satellite Services company responded  that spectrum shortages are already providing incentive for licensees to  spend their funds on R&D for ways to use spectrum more intensively. An  expert also noted that there is no need for FCC to enhance already  substantial ongoing R&D efforts by the private sector.", "To implement the recommendations aimed at expanding opportunities for  innovative spectrum access models, FCC has taken or plans to take the  following steps:  \uf0b7  Unlicensed spectrum. FCC intends to consider making additional  spectrum available for unlicensed use in conjunction with NTIA\u2019s plan  to make available 500 MHz of spectrum for wireless broadband, which  addresses both licensed and unlicensed uses.  \uf0b7  White spaces. FCC eliminated the requirement that white spaces  devices include technology to sense what spectrum is available, and  substituted requirements for geo-location technology and the ability to  access databases of available spectrum. FCC also conditionally  designated and began working with nine companies to develop and  administer the databases.  \uf0b7  Opportunistic uses of spectrum. FCC requested public comment on  how dynamic spectrum access radios and techniques can promote  more intensive and efficient use of the radio spectrum.  \uf0b7  R&D. FCC issued a proposed rule that would expand the agency\u2019s  existing Experimental Radio Service rules to promote cutting-edge  research and foster development of new wireless technologies,  devices, and applications. Specifically, FCC proposed a new type of  license, called a \u201cprogram license,\u201d which would give qualified entities  broad authority to conduct research without having to seek new  approval for each individual experiment.", "Among those that agreed with a recommendation aimed at expanding  opportunities for innovative spectrum access models, generally more  experts and more stakeholders were satisfied than were dissatisfied with  FCC\u2019s progress on implementing the recommendation (see table 7).", "More experts were satisfied than dissatisfied with FCC\u2019s progress on the  unlicensed spectrum recommendation, while stakeholders were evenly  split. An infrastructure provider said that television white spaces has been  the focus of FCC\u2019s efforts related to unlicensed use; the provider was  concerned that the white spaces will not support devices that work in  other countries because other countries use different spectrum bands  than the United States for television. A public interest group commented  that FCC has not made meaningful progress in this area, and that given  the success of unlicensed spectrum in dramatically increasing the public\u2019s  access to the public airwaves, unlicensed spectrum\u2014rather than  spectrum auctions to corporations\u2014should be FCC\u2019s priority.", "While more experts and stakeholders were satisfied than dissatisfied with  FCC\u2019s progress on the white spaces recommendation, experts and  stakeholders expressed a variety of concerns about FCC\u2019s  implementation. For example, an expert said FCC\u2019s approach is too  complicated. A device manufacturer was troubled by FCC\u2019s decision to  remove the requirement that white spaces devices have sensing  technology that could scan the spectrum for available frequencies, which  the manufacturer said had been deemed essential for sharing spectrum.  A public interest group responded that FCC was moving too slowly.", "More experts and stakeholders were satisfied than dissatisfied with FCC\u2019s  progress on the opportunistic uses recommendation, but they expressed  some concerns about FCC\u2019s implementation. For example, an  infrastructure provider commented that FCC has been too slow to resolve  interference issues in the 5 GHz band, which FCC has allowed for use by  devices capable of dynamically accessing spectrum. A wireless device  manufacturer was dissatisfied that FCC, rather proposing rules to  facilitate the use of smart radios, had instead taken the more preliminary  step of requesting public comments on how opportunistic uses can  promote more intensive and efficient use of the radio spectrum. The  manufacturer was also dissatisfied that the plan and the notice of inquiry  showed a preference for geo-location database approaches to dynamic  access over sensing approaches.", "More experts and stakeholders were satisfied than dissatisfied with FCC\u2019s  progress on the R&D recommendation, and they expressed a variety of  views about FCC\u2019s implementation.

For  example, a private user noted that FCC\u2019s proposal to expand the  Commission\u2019s Experimental Radio Service rules should be strengthened  to ensure that licensees are aware of experimental operations that may  cause harmful interference to them, and that FCC should more strictly  enforce against such interference.", "For examples of survey participants\u2019 comments on FCC\u2019s implementation  of the recommendation on opportunistic uses of spectrum, see appendix  III."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Responding Experts and Stakeholders Strongly Supported Extending FCC\u2019s Auction Authority but Varied in Their Opinions on Potential Changes to Auctions", "paragraphs": ["In the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, Congress provided  FCC authority to use auctions to assign certain spectrum licenses. From  1994 through June 30 2011, FCC conducted 79 auctions that have raised  nearly $52 billion for the U.S. Treasury. In 2005, we reported that FCC\u2019s  use of auctions to assign spectrum appeared to have had little to no  negative impact on end-user prices, infrastructure deployment, and  competition, but that evidence on how auctions impacted the entry and  participation of small businesses was less clear. We also reported that  FCC\u2019s implementation of auctions had mitigated problems associated  with comparative hearings and lotteries, which FCC previously used to  assign licenses. In particular, auctions were quicker, less costly, and  more transparent; were more effective in assigning licenses to entities  that valued them the most; and were an effective mechanism for the  public to realize a portion of the value of a national resource used for  commercial purposes. We recommended that Congress consider  extending FCC\u2019s auction authority beyond the then current expiration date  of September 30, 2007. Subsequent to our report, FCC\u2019s auction  authority was extended twice, first until September 30, 2011, and then  until September 30, 2012. Further, subsequent to our report through  June 30, 2011, FCC successfully completed 20 auctions, which raised  over $37 billion for the U.S. Treasury.", "Experts and stakeholders responding to our survey, by large margins,  supported extending FCC\u2019s authority to assign mutually exclusive  licenses by auction beyond the September 30, 2012, expiration date. In  particular, 53 of 65 experts and stakeholders supported extending FCC\u2019s  auction authority (see table 8). Experts and stakeholders made a variety  of comments related to extending FCC\u2019s auction authority. For example, a  wireless service provider commented that auctions are by far the most  efficient way to assign spectrum.", "Experts and stakeholders responding to our survey expressed varying  levels of support for five potential changes to FCC\u2019s auction policies that  we asked about (see table 9). In particular, we asked experts and  stakeholders about whether FCC should provide a clear schedule for future  auctions, allow all-or-nothing bids on multiple licenses (known as  \u201ccombinatorial auctions\u201d), reduce the geographic areas covered by  licenses, modify bidding credits that provide financial benefits to certain  auction participants, and implement royalties as the means though which  auction winners compensate the government instead of up-front payments.", "Among the potential changes we asked survey participants about,  reducing uncertainty about future spectrum auctions received the most  support. Currently, FCC provides information on scheduled auctions and  identifies auctions not yet scheduled. Most experts and stakeholders  agreed that FCC should reduce uncertainty by providing a clear road map  for future auctions, including their timing and size, so that potential  bidders can develop effective strategies. However, experts and  stakeholders that did not agree with the recommendation cited several  concerns. For example, a broadcaster was concerned that by providing a  road map, FCC would limit its flexibility to respond to changing  technological solutions and spectrum demand, and an expert was  concerned that if spectrum beyond that included in the road map were to  become available, the road map could be used by incumbents to protest  the release of the additional spectrum, harming consumers.", "Most responding experts agreed, and more stakeholders agreed than  disagreed, that FCC should allow all-or-nothing package bids on multiple  licenses in an auction (referred to as \u201ccombinatorial auctions\u201d) as  opposed to requiring bids on individual licenses. According to FCC, this  approach allows bidders to better express the value of any benefits from  combining complementary licenses and to avoid the risk of winning only  part of a desired set of licenses. However, a broadcaster and a wireless  service provider commented that package bidding would unfairly favor  large companies that can afford such approaches.", "An equal number of responding experts agreed and disagreed, and more  stakeholders agreed than disagreed, that FCC should reduce the size of  geographic areas covered by licenses to promote the participation of  small companies. In 2010, we reported that, according to some small  wireless carriers and stakeholders, the size of spectrum blocks has had  the effect of pricing small and regional carriers out of auctions, making it  difficult for these carriers to enter into new markets or expand their  services. However, an expert and a Mobile Satellite Services company  expressed concern that if FCC were to implement this recommendation,  small companies that get spectrum would sooner or later cash out and  sell to larger carriers, which the service provider said would add to  licensees\u2019 costs without actually fostering competition. However, a  wireless device manufacturer said that FCC could avoid this problem by  requiring any entity that acquires spectrum and sells it without a network  to pay a tax to the U.S. Treasury. Another expert responded that  implementation would result in the fragmentation of spectrum and  complex secondary market transactions aimed at recombining the  spectrum into larger geographic bundles.", "More experts disagreed than agreed, while more stakeholders agreed  than disagreed, that FCC should modify bidding credits designed to  promote the participation of small companies. Bidding credits are a  percentage discount applied to the high bid amount for a license if the  bidder meets specific designated entity criteria\u2014designed to make  spectrum available to new entrants\u2014established in the auction rules.  Several experts and stakeholders expressed concerns about FCC\u2019s  experience with bidding credits. For example, an expert commented that,  rather than promoting efficiency, bidding credits provide windfalls to the  owners of small companies who can use the credits to buy spectrum and  then turn around and sell it for a profit at market rates to larger firms. In  2010, we reported that some stakeholders said that, in the past, large  national carriers have used entities eligible for the credits as proxies,  allowing eligible entities to win certain licenses and then acquiring the  desired licenses from them later; a wireless service provider responding  to our survey expressed a similar concern. A device manufacturer cited  a case in which the Department of Justice, on behalf of FCC, settled with  a Wall Street money manager for $130 million to resolve allegations of  such abuse. A wireless service provider commented that the credits do  not work as intended, and an expert and a device manufacturer felt that  FCC should stop using them altogether.", "Requiring winners of auctions to pay royalties based on the amount of  revenues the winners earn by using the spectrum rather than requiring  them to pay the full amounts of the winning bids up front garnered the  least support. Both experts and stakeholders were nearly evenly divided  on this potential change and expressed several concerns about royalties.  For example, a public interest group commented that royalties based on a  share of revenues would have the undesirable effect of imposing risk on  the government. Similarly, a wireless service provider commented that  royalties would have to be paired with penalties for nonuse of spectrum in  order to be effective, or else licensees\u2014particularly large incumbents\u2014 would have an incentive to buy and not use spectrum to avoid the royalty  or to limit competition by smaller competitors and new entrants. Another  wireless service provider commented that royalties would create  disincentives for licensees to build out quickly, and that it would be  difficult for FCC to determine appropriate royalty amounts because of the  difficulty of parsing out a licensee\u2019s revenue from various spectrum  bands, some of which would be covered by a royalty fee and some of  which would not."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["As commercial enterprises increasingly utilize spectrum to provide  consumer services, FCC\u2019s ongoing implementation of the spectrum- related recommendations of the 2010 National Broadband Plan is of great  importance. Most of the plan\u2019s recommendations enjoyed fairly broad  support from experts and stakeholders responding to our survey,  although some recommendations were strongly opposed by some  experts or certain types of stakeholders. For example, the plan\u2019s  recommendation for incentive auctions, which could speed the lengthy  repurposing process, received mixed responses from expert and  stakeholder respondents. In some instances, these conflicting opinions  arise from participants\u2019 divergent positions in the communications  industry; for example, incumbent licensees, such as broadcasters, are  likely to oppose recommendations that they believe could impose  burdens or costs on their businesses. In addition, experts\u2019 and  stakeholders\u2019 satisfaction with FCC\u2019s implementation of the  recommendations to date tended to be more tempered than their support  for the recommendations themselves.

The six repurposings we  reviewed involved substantial amounts of spectrum that were repurposed  to a higher value use. In particular, these repurposings met the following  criteria: (1) the amount of spectrum repurposed was 5 megahertz (MHz)  or more; (2) the repurposing yielded $100 million or more in auction or  industry revenue; and (3) reassignment occurred in 1994, when FCC first  implemented its auction authority, or later. For these repurposings, we  reviewed FCC\u2019s notices, orders, and auctions; comments filed in the  proceedings by industry participants; and relevant court decisions. We  also included a question in our survey of experts and stakeholders  pertaining to the amount of time it takes from when FCC or Congress  designates a spectrum band for reallocation until the band is available for  a new use.", "To examine FCC\u2019s plans and recent actions to meet future spectrum  needs, we reviewed the National Broadband Plan and notices of inquiry,  reports and orders, and other publications related to FCC\u2019s development  or implementation of the plan\u2019s chapter on spectrum.

Four of the six spectrum  license-related systems allow (1) entities to apply for a license, (2)  existing licensees to apply for a license renewal or to update their license  information, and (3) the public to search for information on licenses; these  systems are the Universal Licensing System for wireless  telecommunications licenses, the Consolidated Database System for  broadcasting licenses, the International Bureau Filing System for satellite  licenses, and the Experimental Licensing System for experimental use  licenses. According to FCC officials, the Universal Licensing System is by  far the largest system with the most licenses, and is therefore the system  that the public is most likely to interact with. FCC recently implemented  the other two systems related to spectrum licenses\u2014Spectrum  Dashboard and License View\u2014to provide the public with more user- friendly tools, such as enhanced mapping capabilities, for searching for  information on spectrum licenses. These two systems pull data on  licenses from FCC\u2019s spectrum licensing systems; they do not allow  entities to file applications for licenses or update information on their  licenses. The Equipment Authorization System allows entities to file  applications for authorizations of radio equipment, such as cell phones,  and the public to search for information on these authorizations. FCC  uses these various systems for multiple purposes, including processing  applications for spectrum licenses or radio equipment authorizations and  helping to determine where spectrum is available.", "Most users of FCC\u2019s spectrum-related data systems responding to our  survey reported that the systems generally provide the type of information  they are looking for to either a great or moderate extent (see table 11). In  particular, for each of the seven systems, large majorities of survey  respondents expressed a favorable opinion on the availability of  information. However, respondents\u2019 opinions varied somewhat across the  systems. For example, a large majority of respondents reported a positive  evaluation of the Universal Licensing System; 54 of 58 respondents said  that the Universal Licensing System provides the type of information they  were looking for to a great or moderate extent. Spectrum Dashboard, a  system that pulls data from FCC\u2019s spectrum licensing systems, had a  somewhat lower level of support; 33 of 48 respondents reported that  Spectrum Dashboard provides the type of information they were looking  for to a great or moderate extent.", "According to some users of FCC\u2019s spectrum-related data systems that  responded to our survey, inaccurate and missing data hindered their use  of the systems to a great to moderate extent (see tables 12 and 13).

In particular, 19 of 54 respondents and 23 of 55  respondents reported that inaccurate information and missing information,  respectively, in the Universal Licensing System hindered their use to a  great or moderate extent. Dissatisfaction with inaccurate data rose to a  similar level only for the Consolidated Database System; 10 of 29  respondents reported that inaccurate data in the Consolidated Database  System hindered their use to a great or moderate extent. In addition to  the Universal Licensing System, respondents reported the most  difficulties arising from missing information with the Consolidated  Database System and the International Bureau Filing System. In  particular, almost one-third of respondents reported that missing data in  the Consolidated Database System and the International Bureau Filing  System hindered their use to a great or moderate extent.", "For some users, FCC\u2019s primary spectrum-related data systems can prove  challenging to use. In the National Broadband Plan, FCC noted that the  complexity of its data on licensing of spectrum and the lack of  transparency and usability of data created impediments to public policy  and restricted the development of new technologies, such as dynamic  spectrum access, that could utilize spectrum data. Several stakeholders  told us that systems, such as the Universal Licensing System, are  relatively user-friendly for \u201cexpert\u201d users with technical knowledge and  experience, but that the systems could pose challenges for other users.  Consistent with this view, half or more of respondents reported that the  International Bureau Filing System and the Experimental Licensing  System were not too or not at all user-friendly, and about one-third of  respondents reported similar views of the Universal Licensing System  and the Consolidated Database System (see table 14).", "To respond to these concerns; to help ensure greater transparency in  spectrum allocation, assignment, and use; and to help promote  secondary market transactions; FCC developed the Spectrum Dashboard  and License View systems. As discussed earlier, these systems pull and  compile data from the primary spectrum-related data systems, such as  the Universal Licensing System and the Consolidated Database System,  and are designed to present the information in a meaningful, easy-to-use  format to the public. In designing these systems, FCC sought a means  whereby its data could be leveraged by citizens for greater purposes, and  both Commission staff and external parties are better positioned to  identify data inaccuracies or inconsistencies. As shown in table 14, over  four-fifths of respondents reported that Spectrum Dashboard was very or  somewhat user-friendly, thereby meeting FCC\u2019s intent of the system while  more than half of respondents reported that License View was very or  somewhat user-friendly."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FCC Has Processes Aimed at Ensuring the Quality of Its Data; However, Past Audits Identified Some Problems", "paragraphs": ["FCC has commissionwide programs, policies, and procedures for the  collection and management of information, which help ensure FCC\u2019s  compliance with governmentwide laws and regulations pertaining to  information collection and management. For example, FCC\u2019s records  management program is intended partly to control the quantity and quality  of records produced by the Commission. In 2010, we reviewed and  reported on 30 information collection systems used by FCC, including  those associated with the Experimental Licensing System and the  Equipment Authorization System data systems. We found that FCC  followed relevant policies and procedures, including those pertaining to  quality control. For this report, we examined the processes in place to  ensure the quality of data in FCC\u2019s five spectrum license and  authorization systems. We identified several quality-control features  incorporated in the five systems, which we discuss below and illustrate in  table 15.  \uf0b7  Edit checks. FCC\u2019s spectrum-related licensing and authorization  systems each incorporate edit checks, which check for missing or  anomalous data elements; these edit checks occur either online  during the filing process or in batch mode. All five systems incorporate  online edit checks, which check the accuracy of data entered by filers  in real time and flag potential errors for users. FCC officials said that  these online checks are helpful to filers and help ensure data  accuracy. In addition, the Universal Licensing System, the  Consolidated Database System, and the International Bureau Filing  System incorporate edit checks in the nightly batch processing of data  submitted by users. Among other things, the edit checks address  acceptable ranges of values, filings from parties with delinquent debts,  and accuracy of geographic coordinates.  \uf0b7  FCC staff review. Before granting a spectrum license or equipment  authorization, FCC checks all information provided by the applicant or  licensee using automated or staff reviews. For example, FCC staff  scrutinizes all spectrum license renewal applications that require  exhibits demonstrating compliance with license requirements. FCC  staff seeks correction or clarification of any inaccuracies detected in  the information. According to FCC officials, these ongoing staff  reviews of applications supplement the automated edit checks. In  addition to its own reviews, FCC accepts reports of data  discrepancies from members of the public.  \uf0b7  Filer notification. According to FCC officials, the Commission in part  depends on the applicants for licenses to submit accurate data. FCC  believes this is appropriate because entities filing applications are in  the best position to know the relevant facts and are often experts and,  therefore, the data these entities submit should be of high quality.  Furthermore, FCC officials noted that when entities submit  applications or renewals, they must certify and affirm the accuracy of  the data. When FCC staff discovers errors, the Commission alerts the  original filer and solicits correction.  \uf0b7  Tracking systems. FCC maintains a help desk, with access via  telephone and e-mail. Applicants, licensees, and the general public  may use these resources to obtain help with FCC\u2019s data systems. In  addition, the Universal Licensing System, the Consolidated Database  System, and the Equipment Authorization System incorporate  systems that track e-mail and phone queries and thus help FCC to  identify problems with the data systems.", "While these quality-control features can help promote the quality of FCC\u2019s  spectrum-related data, past Commission audits have uncovered some  problems with the timeliness of FCC\u2019s data. FCC periodically reviews its  systems and data and, from 2001 through 2005, FCC audited licensees in  three spectrum bands. FCC conducted these audits because of concerns  that some licensees for certain types of services included in the Universal  Licensing System were not keeping FCC informed of their operating  status. These audits were aimed at determining, for each license, whether  the licensed service was operational, and canceling the licenses in cases  where service had been discontinued. The audits resulted in the  cancellation of the following licenses:  \uf0b7  220 MHz licenses: 94 licenses cancelled out of 956 licenses audited  (10 percent cancelled)  \uf0b7  Paging licenses: 2,076 licenses cancelled out of 7,770 licenses  audited (27 percent cancelled)  \uf0b7  Private land mobile radio licenses: 37,448 licenses cancelled out of  420,112 licenses audited (9 percent cancelled)", "As these audit results illustrate, FCC\u2019s spectrum-related systems may not  incorporate the timeliest information. FCC acknowledged that the extent  to which its data match real world conditions depends upon the particular  rules governing filers and the burden of filing upon industry. For example,  since a broadcaster must renew its license once every 8 years, the data  on file, as of the most recent renewal, may not remain accurate over time.  Although FCC also requires that filers update information about significant  events as needed, FCC has no practical way to ensure that filers comply  with that requirement. FCC officials said that the Commission could take  measures, such as requiring more frequent updates and certification of  data in its databases, but such measures must be balanced with the  burden placed upon industry. According to FCC officials, the Commission  has focused on checking the accuracy of the data submitted to FCC at  the time of submission, not on maintaining accuracy over time. But FCC  now recognizes that there is a need to ensure that the data in its systems  reflect conditions in the real world on an ongoing basis to determine  where spectrum is available. Regarding the possibility of future audits,  FCC officials said that the Commission does not currently have concerns  that would warrant additional audits of license holders but, that if such  concerns were to arise, it would consider conducting additional audits."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FCC Has Several Efforts Under way with the Potential to Improve Its Spectrum-Related Data", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Data Innovation Initiative", "paragraphs": ["Recognizing the need to improve the Commission\u2019s information practices,  in July 2009, the FCC Chairman initiated a review of FCC\u2019s systems and  processes for information collection, processing, analysis, and  dissemination, and this effort continued with the June 2010 launch of the  Data Innovation Initiative.

In addition, CLS would incorporate enhanced edit check  capability, including for example, validation of geographic coordinates for  antennas to ensure that the coordinates coincide with the locations of the  antennas. FCC staff said that CLS would include information from its  legacy databases, such as the Universal Licensing System, and that cost  considerations may affect how much legacy information the new system  includes; however, FCC believes that the information for the current  filings and the previous filings should be sufficient to meet FCC\u2019s needs  for spectrum management.
