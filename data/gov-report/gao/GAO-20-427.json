An increase in either of these groups  could indicate that the poorest, most burdened households  experienced either an increase in income or a decrease in rent  burden. However, because these other groups did not increase, it is  possible that some of these extremely low-income, severely burdened  households moved in with other households or experienced some  other form of homelessness.", "Rent burdens affect households differently depending on their income.  Households with lower incomes may pay the same percentage of income  in rent as moderate- or higher-income households but have less income  left over for other necessities.

For  example, as figure 11 shows, in the San Francisco area in 2017 a very  low-income family of four would experience a severe rent burden if it paid  the fair market rent for a two-bedroom apartment ($3,018 per month).  Such a family would struggle to pay the rent and afford other necessities  even with two or three full-time minimum wage jobs. In contrast, a very  low-income family of four in the St. Louis area in 2017 would experience a  moderate or no rent burden if it paid the fair market rent for a two- bedroom apartment ($896).

For example, a family of four earning the median income in San  Francisco that paid fair market rent for a two-bedroom apartment would  be rent burdened. A housing unit that would be considered affordable to  them would cost at least $135 per month below fair market rent (or  approximately $2,882 or less). Money that a family could save on a unit  below fair market rate could help reduce household debt, add to  retirement savings, or pay for necessities like child care. Rent burden  among moderate-income households tends to be more common in large  cities with strong economies and significant geographic and regulatory  constraints on new housing, such as San Francisco and New York.", "The lowest-income households face challenges securing affordable rental  units.

Estimates of the polychoric correlation  matrix and of the factor loadings are reported in tables 7 and 8  respectively. We assessed stability by estimating the model on each AHS  year separately and broadly found that factor loadings estimates varied  little over time. Given the estimates from our preferred specification,  which accounts for the survey design, we then relied on empirical Bayes  estimation to assign a quality score to each unit for which responses to all  13 quality variables were observed.

Units with no issues  represented between 54 and 62 percent of the rental units to which we  were able to assign quality scores. To further separate units experiencing  any issues into two groups, we inspected the quality score distribution for  local minima in its density to find a score around which small  perturbations in threshold choice would have little effect on the share of  units falling into each of the two groups. We examined all quality issue  profiles experienced in units with scores in the region around two  candidates where the density nearly reached 0, and selected a score of  0.5240 as the second threshold, immediately above which were units with  one or more holes in the floor large enough to catch someone\u2019s foot.

In determining both unit  completeness and quality, we were limited to the variables consistently  available across all survey years. Therefore, we could not include  features not observed in the AHS which could be deemed to be important  components of either unit completeness (such as a unit\u2019s access to an  internet service provider) or quality (such as the presence of major  defects in the structure of the unit\u2019s building).", "In the quality factor model, we assumed that quality was uncorrelated with  the error term from each measurement equation and that the error terms  were uncorrelated with each other to obtain estimates of the model\u2019s  parameters, and ultimately the quality scores. A violation of these  assumptions would bias the estimates. For example, if rental units located  in regions with harsh weather were of systematically worse quality than  units in fairer weather regions, the estimated effect of poor quality on a  variable like the number of outdoor leaks could be overstated, which  would in turn overweight the importance of outdoor leaks in the estimation  of the quality scores, resulting in overly poor quality score estimates for  units experiencing outdoor leaks. Conversely, if units in harsh weather  regions were of systematically better quality than those in fairer weather  regions (e.g. as a measure of resilience) the estimated effect of poor  quality on outdoor leaks would be understated, biasing down the  importance of outdoor leaks in the estimation of quality scores. In general,  any systematic linear relationship between latent quality (\ud835\udf02\ud835\udf02) and the  unobserved factors (\ud835\udf00\ud835\udf00\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56) affecting one of the 13 unobserved latent  continuous variables, or between the unobserved factors themselves,  would be a violation of the model\u2019s assumptions.", "Since the two quality variables recording uncomfortably cold periods and  heating equipment breakdowns were only asked of respondents who  occupied their unit in the winter prior to the survey year, we could not  assign quality scores to the 10 to 25 percent of rental units across years  which were occupied by recent movers. To assess potential biases on the  quality distribution of the full cash-rent-occupied rental housing stock  introduced by excluding this group, we therefore compared both groups  along the remaining 11 dimensions  Of the 11 observable quality variables, three exhibited an incidence of  issues that differed meaningfully across the two groups. These  differences were persistent throughout survey years and consistent in  their direction: units whose respondents moved in later than the winter  prior to the interview were between 5 to 10 percentage points less likely  to experience any outside leaks, inside leaks, and to report evidence of  rodents. The differences were meaningful in that they corresponded to  over a halving of the incidence of the evidence of rodents, and up to a  halving of the incidence of both types of leaks in the recent-mover units  relative to the units for which all quality variables were available.", "To evaluate the effect of these differences on the quality distribution of  the full universe of cash-rent units, we estimated a modified quality factor  model in which we dropped the uncomfortably cold periods and heating  equipment breakdowns variables. This allowed us to obtain quality scores  for both the units with the original scores and the recent-mover units. The  distributions of the modified quality indices in the two groups reached  their largest difference at the share of units without any of the set of 11  quality issues, and we estimated that across all survey years, 1.3 to 2.4  percentage points more units would likely have no measured quality  issues in the full cash-rent universe than we found in that which excludes  the recent movers.", "Furthermore, the distributions of the modified indices truncated to exclude  the respective units without any of the 11 quality issues were largely  comparable. In the full universe of cash-rent units, we would therefore  expect decreases in each of the shares of less substantial issues and  substantial issues units proportional to their respective shares in the  partial universe, and in sum corresponding to the magnitude of the  increase in units with no issues each year. The alternative of including  recent movers in our main model at the expense of the uncomfortably  cold periods and heating equipment breakdowns variables would have  yielded a share of units without any other quality issues that we estimated  to be 3 to 4 percentage points higher than the share calculated using the  original index in the partial universe.
