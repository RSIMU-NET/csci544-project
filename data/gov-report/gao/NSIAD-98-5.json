To improve reporting and enhance enforcement efforts, the U.S. Customs Service and the Census Bureau in 1991 initiated the Automated Export System (AES). AES allows exporting companies to electronically enter data on shipments, automatically checks for errors, and provides data to help detect export violations. Although it introduced the system as voluntary, Customs recognized that achieving a high level of participation in AES would be difficult and wanted its use to be mandatory. In 1996, Customs sought to make AES mandatory for some users. However, AES was not made mandatory, in part because companies raised concerns about the impact of AES on their business practices, especially if they are required to enter data before shipments depart.", "At your request, we reviewed the potential impact of AES and the views of the export community regarding AES. Specifically, we sought to determine whether AES is likely to achieve its objectives of improving export data, enhancing enforcement efforts, and streamlining export data collection and, in so doing, we obtained the export community\u2019s views on AES. As you requested, we are also providing information on the export procedures of other selected countries. (See app. I for information on selected countries.)"], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Merchandise trade, the exchange of goods with other nations, is an increasingly important component of the U.S. economy. The U.S. Customs Service collects data on imports and exports that the U.S. Census Bureau uses to produce statistics on U.S. trade. While Customs has numerous import responsibilities, its export functions include guarding against the exportation of illegal goods, such as protected technologies, stolen vehicles, and illegal currency.", "Customs has broad authority to enforce export laws and regulations. However, it has historically placed more emphasis on imports than on exports. While U.S. import data is recognized as generally reliable, export data is viewed as less accurate. A 1997 Census report notes that the value of U.S. exports has probably been underreported by between 3 and 7 percent but could be understated by as much as 10 percent.Underreporting of exports can significantly affect the accuracy of statistics on the nation\u2019s trade balance. Inaccurate trade statistics can be an impediment in negotiations for bilateral and multilateral trade agreements. Export statistics also are relied on by the government to calculate the gross domestic product (which is used to assess the performance of the U.S. economy) and to determine appropriate promotional programs for expanding exports. Export data is also used to establish controls on sensitive exports.", "A primary source of export statistics is information that is recorded on a form called the Shipper\u2019s Export Declaration (SED). The SED contains information such as the nature, value, quantity, and destination of the goods to be exported. Generally, exporters or their agents are required by regulation to file the SED for each export transaction having a value over a certain amount, now set at $2,500 for all shipments without a license.Under current regulations, the SED must be delivered to the exporting carrier prior to exportation. Ocean and air carriers, with a bond on file,are permitted to file the complete manifest (a carriers manifest lists all the cargo it is transporting) with Customs within 4 working days after departure. For overland shipments, the SED must be presented to Customs at the time of export.", "The major sources of error in merchandise trade statistics include missing SEDs and incomplete or inaccurate reporting. Since the 1980s, Customs, Census, and other government agencies have conducted numerous studies, which found serious problems with companies properly completing the document and filing it at the required time and place. For example, Customs completed an audit of selected ocean vessel manifests in 1996 that found about 29 percent of shipments listed on the manifest did not have the required SED. In 1997, Customs conducted an audit of airline manifests that determined 40 percent of SEDs were incorrectly completed.  Without a properly completed SED, an export is either not recorded or recorded incorrectly.", "Currently, about one-third of all export transactions are recorded on paper SEDs. Census collects another third of the export data on a monthly basis directly from exporting businesses through an electronic filing system known as the Automated Export Reporting Program (AERP). Census is terminating AERP in December 1999 because it believes the system is outdated and that AES will provide more accurate data. (Twenty-five percent of all AERP transmissions contain errors that must be corrected.) Census officials stated that AERP has systems limitations related to the amount of data it can accept. They stated that the system would require a complete redesign in methodology and computer technology in order to be able to accept more participants and improve data quality, resulting in a system similar to AES. Census officials also noted that about one-third of all AERP participants submit their data late via AERP."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Context for AES\u2019 Development", "paragraphs": ["Customs and Census initiated AES in 1991 to improve (1) the collection and reporting of export statistics and (2) the enforcement of export regulations. Initially, the system was designed to replace the manual process of handling paper SEDs with a more efficient and less costly automated process that would increase the accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of SED data.", "AES is an interactive system that allows exporters or their agents to electronically transmit SED information directly to Customs before a carrier\u2019s departure. In order to improve the quality of export data, data transmitted via AES is subjected to a series of automatic edits. The system in turn sends back to the exporter a message to check the data if it does not fall within statistical parameters developed by Customs and Census. (See app. II for information on how AES works.)", "According to Customs, AES was also designed to improve the enforcement of export controls by evaluating the risk of export shipments based on certain criteria, such as the country of destination and the type of cargo;compiling exporter histories; allowing for trend analysis; and providing inspectors with detailed commodity data prior to departure. Customs officials believe that the more export information they have, the more focused their efforts to target illegal shipments will be.", "Finally, in 1994, in response to several initiatives including the Vice President\u2019s National Performance Review, Customs decided that AES should be expanded to provide a centralized database for collecting and processing export documentation required by the U.S. government. Customs planned to work with other U.S. government agencies that have export-related responsibilities to help these agencies meet their export information requirements through AES. (See p. 18 for a discussion of the present status of the single electronic filing center.)", "Customs installed AES in all U.S. vessel ports in October 1996, and currently it is operational in all ports, including air, rail, and truck transit ports. Customs and Census officials estimate that they spent approximately $12.9 million to develop and implement AES from fiscal  year 1992 to 1997. These costs include, among other things, expenses for contractors, travel, and training. According to Customs\u2019 and Census\u2019 figures, both agencies estimate that together they will spend an additional $32.2 million through fiscal year 2002 on AES implementation and maintenance.", "This new system would require companies to make various changes in how they submit their export data to Customs. Companies that submit their export data via AERP will have to undergo modifications in programming the processing of their export data or return to submitting paper SEDs. Companies that submit their data via paper SEDs but want to participate in AES will have to automate their export processing, and/or purchase AES software, or use the facilities of a port authority or service center to transmit their data.", "In addition, some segments of the trade community have alleged that AES will require major changes in their current business practices. Because Customs has not strictly enforced the legal requirement that companies submit their SEDs to the carrier prior to departure, many companies have grown accustomed to turning in their SEDs to the carriers late. AES will require that companies file their export data directly to Customs, rather than the carrier, prior to departure.", "The trade community has varying views on AES. To obtain these views, we conducted two surveys of potential AES users: (1) a nationally representative sample of 400 U.S. ocean freight forwarders and Non-Vessel Operating Common Carriers (NVOCC) and (2) 80 U.S. exporting companies that file paper SEDs. We also interviewed officials from 12 of the largest U.S. sea and air carrier companies and several trade groups representing various segments of the export community. (See app. III for complete survey results.) (We did not independently verify information provided by U.S. companies and trade groups.) We also interviewed Customs officials at 13 sea, air, and land ports.

Unless AES participation increases significantly, AES will not enhance the quality of export data or the enforcement of export regulations. In addition, other factors may limit AES\u2019 ability to achieve its objective of enhancing export control enforcement. For example, Customs\u2019 plans to introduce a post-departure filing program may impede the system\u2019s effectiveness as a tool for targeting illegal exports. Finally, AES will not likely serve as a central point for collecting and processing all export documents because other export-related agencies have information needs that they say cannot be fulfilled through AES."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Trade Community Participation Is Low and Likely to Be Limited in the Near Future", "paragraphs": ["Trade community participation in AES is currently very limited, and our work showed most companies do not have immediate plans to participate in AES. As of September 1997, AES participants included 8 exporters, 27 freight forwarders, and 2 sea carriers out of tens of thousands of export-related businesses. Currently, less than 1 percent of all export data is being submitted via AES.", "Customs expects participation in AES to increase for several reasons. For example, Customs is planning to introduce the Automated Export System Post-Departure Authorized Special System (AES-PASS), which is a program designed to encourage participation in AES by allowing qualified exporters to submit a minimal amount of information prior to export\u2014generally an exporter identification number and a reference number for the shipment. Further, Census is terminating AERP and hopes current users will switch to AES. Customs also anticipates an increase in participation since AES first came online in July 1997 for exports via air, truck, and rail."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Most Companies Surveyed Do Not Have Immediate Plans to Get on AES", "paragraphs": ["Despite Customs\u2019 expectations of increased participation, most companies we surveyed do not have immediate plans to use AES. We surveyed 400 randomly selected freight forwarder companies and 80 exporters that file paper SEDs. As shown in figures 1 and 2, only about 36 percent of freight forwarders and about 32 percent of exporters we spoke with currently plan to use AES to submit their SED information; only 50 percent and 42 percent of those companies, respectively, reported that they plan to get on AES within the next 3 years. Of the companies that plan to use AES, only 4 percent of the freight forwarders and 5 percent of the exporters have filed a notice with Customs that they plan to participate in AES or are testing AES. (See fig. 3.) In addition, more than half the companies we surveyed that plan to use AES do not know when they will use it. Most companies did not know how much it will cost their company to implement AES and were not familiar with the AES-PASS program (see fig. 4).", "Companies and industry groups we spoke with cited certain benefits to getting on AES. The primary incentive mentioned was automating their export system. About 50 percent of the companies we surveyed that plan to use AES said that automation was an incentive to use AES. The other benefit voiced by over 15 percent of respondents was the potential for a single filing point for all export data, referred to as \u201cone-stop filing\u201d by Customs. In addition, those companies we interviewed that are already using AES said that they were doing so to reduce paperwork and personnel and associated administrative costs, take advantage of new automated initiatives, and participate in the development of AES.", "While the cost of automation and lack of knowledge regarding AES were cited as possible impediments to AES participation by the export community, predeparture filing emerged as a key concern among some segments of this group. Our work indicates that whether or not predeparture filing posed a problem for businesses was related to the type of export or mode of transportation used to export.", "According to industry groups and several companies\u2019 officials we interviewed, filing information predeparture is inconsistent with their business practices. These officials told us that they often do not know the precise volume and value of their final shipment until just before departure, which makes it difficult to file their paperwork on time. Predeparture filing was a particular concern for exporters of bulk goods or grain commodities. Some of these companies said that they would have to enter estimates in AES prior to departure and that the estimates would then have to be revised later, thereby resulting in rework. One exporter described this as having to do \u201ctwice the work.\u201d", "Regarding carriers, all of the eight airlines and air couriers we spoke with said that meeting the predeparture filing requirement would present a problem for their current business operations; six said that they would not participate in AES due to this requirement. While the air couriers we interviewed said that they generally have the SEDs in hand prior to departure, because of the fast-paced nature of the air courier business they are unable to input SED data into AES before the aircraft departs. Representatives from both these industries told us that they anticipate having to input data into AES as a service to exporters and freight forwarders.", "Representatives from companies participating in Customs\u2019 evaluation of AES, conducted in two vessel ports in 1996 before AES was expanded to all ports, indicated problems with predeparture filing. Representatives from some companies stated that 80 percent of the time they have all the information needed to complete the SED prior to departure of the vessel. However, for the remaining 20 percent of the time, they have difficulty in obtaining and providing predeparture data. In addition, the evaluation did not include airlines and air couriers, which have significant concerns regarding predeparture filing. It also did not include exporters of bulk commodities that have similar concerns.", "Export industry groups also have repeatedly expressed concerns about the AES-PASS program, which allows exporters to file most of their export information postdeparture, but still requires companies to file some data prior to departure. Specifically, they have stated that AES-PASS will be costly and burdensome to exporters without providing much benefit to the government. For example, in a March 1997 letter to the Commissioner of Customs, a group of large exporters stated that AES-PASS requires exporters to bear a predeparture reporting burden for all shipments while doing \u201cnothing to improve data collection or compliance.\u201d They stated that AES-PASS would require two submissions for a single shipment\u2014both pre- and post-departure\u2014resulting in additional programming of automated processes. In June 1997, the Trade Resource Group, the private advisory group to Customs on AES, expressed similar concerns in a letter to the Commissioner of Customs.", "In response to the export community\u2019s continued dissatisfaction with AES requirements (particularly filing information predeparture via AES and/or AES-PASS), in June 1997 the Commissioner of Customs proposed that industry groups enter into formal negotiations with Customs to resolve issues of disagreement regarding AES. Customs has used such negotiations, which rely on an outside moderator, to resolve issues with the trade community in the past. According to Customs officials, this approach will provide a forum for the trade community and Customs to discuss, and potentially resolve, the outstanding issues of concern to both parties. Customs officials told us that they are uncertain as to when the negotiations will begin."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "AES\u2019 Ability to Enhance Enforcement Is Currently Limited", "paragraphs": ["AES is designed to provide a \u201csmart targeting system\u201d that would allow inspectors to focus their attention on possible illegal shipments among the thousands of exports leaving the country each day. For example, AES is designed to compile exporter histories, allow for trend analysis, and provide a prioritized list of targets for selective enforcement actions.However, AES\u2019 ability to meet this objective is limited by four major factors. First, AES does not currently link with other law enforcement databases, such as those maintained by the Treasury; the Federal Bureau of Investigation; and the National Insurance Crime Bureau (which maintains a database on stolen vehicles). Customs inspectors told us that AES would be a more effective enforcement tool if it linked with these databases, allowing inspectors to obtain information more quickly on exporters with prior export violations or on stolen vehicles that may be exported. Customs officials told us that they are considering trying to have AES link with other enforcement databases in the future, but that at present they have no definitive plans to do so. They noted that very few enforcement or administrative databases are directly linked to each other because of logistics, funding, and security concerns.", "Second, AES-PASS will not provide adequate information to target shipments because it only requires a minimal amount of data prior to departure\u2014the exporter identification number; a reference number for the shipment; and a few additional data elements, such as the license code and number if the export requires a license. It will not provide the detailed commodity data that inspectors told us they need for better enforcement. Because so little predeparture information is provided on AES-PASS, some inspectors we interviewed were concerned that AES-PASS would undermine any advantage that AES would have provided, for example, ready access to more detailed commodity data predeparture.", "Third, AES allows SED information to be transmitted only hours before a shipment\u2019s departure (as with the current paper system), and inspectors told us that in most cases this is not sufficient time for targeting possible illegal shipments. While some inspectors told us that they would need SED information about 4 hours in advance of the carrier\u2019s departure in order to target shipments, others said they would need 24 hours. (We did not evaluate the feasibility of companies being able to file data within these time frames.) Finally, since participation in AES is voluntary, an illegal exporter is unlikely to use the system for filing export data. Inspectors at several ports told us that there is no incentive for exporters to get on AES, and others stated that they believe AES would need to be mandatory to be effective."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Most Other Agencies\u2019 Export Requirements Cannot Be Fully Satisfied by AES", "paragraphs": ["According to both Census and Customs, AES has the potential to provide exporters with \u201cone-stop shopping\u201d by creating a single electronic filing center for all U.S. export data. AES was not designed to replace any agency\u2019s authority to regulate exports. The system was designed to serve as a source of export data for agencies with export requirements and to reduce redundancies in filing and paperwork associated with various export control requirements. However, AES is unlikely to achieve those objectives because most agencies\u2019 export requirements cannot be fully satisfied through AES. For example, 8 of the 13 agencies identified by Customs as having regulatory authority over exports are not using AES to fulfill their export licensing or permit requirements because of existing regulations that require them to retain their own licensing procedures, including collecting information provided by the exporter. As a result, exporters will have to continue to apply to multiple agencies for approval to export certain commodities. (About 30 percent of all U.S. freight forwarders export goods that require export licenses.) For example, exporters seeking to ship products that have both civilian and military applications would still have to apply directly to the Commerce Department\u2019s Bureau of Export Administration for approval. In addition, exporters of chemicals and pharmaceutical drugs are required to apply directly to the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) 15 days prior to exportation in order for DEA to conduct an investigation.", "Although AES is designed to eliminate the paper SED, it will not substantially reduce or eliminate agency paperwork or the electronic filing associated with the issuance of export licenses, certificates, or permits. For example, the Department of Agriculture\u2019s Food Safety and Inspection Service issues inspection certificates for agricultural exports that must accompany the shipment abroad, precluding the possibility of electronic filing through AES. In addition, DEA officials noted that they are governed by international conventions, to which the United States is a signatory, that mandate their use of internationally standardized paper licenses for exports of certain chemicals and pharmaceutical products.", "According to Customs officials, there are several obstacles that prevent them from quickly achieving this goal. For example, many agencies lack sufficient staff or budgetary resources, have outdated regulations that may need to be changed, and/or are reluctant to share data with other agencies even though they may collect the same data. Customs recognizes that these obstacles will need to be overcome in order to have AES fully interface with other export-related agencies.", "Despite these limitations, officials at three agencies with export reporting (rather than licensing) requirements\u2014Census, the Maritime Administration, and the Energy Information Administration\u2014indicate that AES has the potential to satisfy their needs. Specifically, it is expected to eliminate their paperwork processing and help them fulfill their reporting requirements. Several other agencies, including the Bureau of Export Administration, the Office of Foreign Assets Control, and the Office of Arms Control and Nonproliferation indicated that as designed, AES would provide a more efficient means to track and monitor cargo shipments against approved licenses. Currently, AES validates cargo against State Department and Bureau of Export Administration licenses."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Slow Progress in Developing Interfaces With Other Agencies", "paragraphs": ["Since 1994, Customs has tried to develop an automated interface with other government agencies to maximize opportunities to share export information through AES and streamline data collection.

Customs has obtained written commitments from five other agencies to collaborate on AES. Some of the areas being discussed are data to be included in AES, information sharing and access, and the development of compatible information systems. Of these six agencies, Customs has completed and incorporated into AES the user requirements of Census, the Bureau of Export Administration, and the Office of Defense Trade Controls, specifying each agency\u2019s requirements for collecting and processing data. One reason that progress has been slow is that Customs has assigned only one full-time person to develop interfaces with other government agencies.", "Other agencies have not committed to use AES for a variety of reasons. For example, according to officials at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, the agency lacks sufficient resources to develop a compatible automated system, and DEA has regulations that preclude its use of AES. Officials at the Environmental Protection Agency told us that they cannot use AES, as they do not currently have an agreement with Census to access SED data. Furthermore, although AES does include Nuclear Regulatory Commission license codes in order to validate licensed shipments, agency officials indicated that the agency already has an automated information system that meets its needs. (See fig. 5.)", "It has been well documented that successful information systems require the continuing involvement and commitment of senior executives. In this case, where the concept of AES entails integrating the export reporting functions of 14 separate federal agencies, extensive high-level coordination and exchange are not presently in place to explicitly define what export reporting and/or licensing requirements can or cannot be accommodated by AES and what distinct licensing and/or reporting requirements must remain."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The quality of export data has been a long-term problem. AES represents a major initiative to improve the quality of export data that is used to negotiate trade agreements and enforce export laws and regulations. While the trade community believes export data needs to be automated, the reluctance of U.S. companies to participate and the uncertainty that other agencies will be able to interface with AES raise serious questions about the system\u2019s viability. In addition, Customs\u2019 planned use of AES as an enforcement tool is limited because AES is not currently linked to other law enforcement databases, and AES-PASS allows approved exporters to file almost all of their export data post-departure. We question whether AES will be able to meet its objectives without greater involvement of top management in resolving the operational and implementation problems we have identified. We believe the Commissioner of the U.S. Customs Service and the Director of the U.S. Census Bureau need to devote sustained management attention to AES. Specifically, these officials need to expeditiously assess the extent to which the export community\u2019s concerns can be addressed, the likely amount of participation in AES, the likely usefulness of AES in enhancing enforcement, and the extent to which other agencies will be able to use AES. In making this assessment, attention needs to be given to determining whether predeparture filing of export data is critical to improved export statistics and enforcement of U.S. laws and regulations and, if so, how far in advance inspectors need the information for AES to be an effective enforcement tool; a link between AES and the databases of law enforcement agencies can be allowing some exporters to file SEDs after departure would undermine the objective of achieving improved export data and/or render AES ineffective as an enforcement tool; and the requirements of other agencies can be modified or otherwise accommodated to permit their use of AES.", "Once this assessment is done, we believe the agencies need to consider how or whether to proceed with implementing AES.

They said that early in the system\u2019s development, they decided to use a phased implementation approach. They also noted that participation in AES has increased since it was expanded to all modes of transportation in July 1997 and they expect participation to be greater in the future.

We believe our work provides important insights into issues that will affect AES\u2019 success and that Customs and Census need to develop a strategy to address these issues. On the critical issue of participation, our survey revealed strong resistance among the export community that has serious implications for future participation.

We believe that the results from this survey when combined with those from our survey of the top 80 exporters that file paper SEDs, as well as in-depth interviews with 30 exporting companies and 14 of the top AERP filers, provides a reasonable basis on which to assess the views of a broad cross section of the export community regarding AES.

The resulting list contained 80 filers located in 22 states. During the course of the study, we learned that for some companies, a single individual was responsible for one or more additional filers. Multiple cases for a single respondent were combined into a single case, leaving a final study population of 72 filers.
