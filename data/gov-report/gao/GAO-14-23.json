The assessment found, for example, that the effects of increasing air temperatures on glaciers could negatively impact mission areas including navigation and flood damage reduction. The Corps has also conducted pilot studies to help identify adaptation guidance and strategies; it has completed 5 of the 15 pilot studies initiated and plans to start another study in 2013. Similarly, Reclamation has completed baseline assessments of the potential impacts of climate change on future water supplies for the major river basins where it owns and operates water management infrastructure. Reclamation, in collaboration with nonfederal entities, is now conducting more focused assessments, known as Basin Studies, through which Reclamation seeks to identify water supply vulnerabilities and project future climate change impacts on the performance of water infrastructure. According to agency officials, these studies will also help Reclamation develop adaptation strategies to address these impacts, such as operational or physical changes to existing water infrastructure or development of new facilities. Three Basin Studies have been completed, an additional 14 are under way, and 2 more are planned.

The U.S. Department of the Interior\u2019s  (Interior) U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has reported that of all the  potential threats posed by climate change, those associated with water  resources are arguably the most consequential for both society and the  environment. The effects of climate change on water resources have  already been observed and are expected to continue. For example, a shift  in the form of precipitation from snow to rain and earlier melting of  mountain snowpack has been documented in western states. This  change in precipitation is expected to result in a decrease in the amount  of reliable water supply in areas where snow has been a major source. As  we reported in October 2009, policymakers are increasingly viewing  adaptation\u2014defined by the National Research Council as adjustments in  natural or human systems to a new or changing environment that exploits  beneficial opportunities or moderates negative effects\u2014as a risk- management strategy to protect vulnerable resources that might be  affected by changes in the climate.

The first  document, published in 2011, described the water management  community\u2019s needs for climate change information and tools to  support long-term planning for time scales of 5 years and more. The  second document, published in 2013, described the data and tools  needed to support short-term planning of less than 5 years. For both  documents, the Corps and Reclamation asked their water resource  managers to identify the information and tools most relevant to their  programs, and they also consulted with other federal, state, and local  agencies and stakeholders with a role in water resource management  about their needs. The documents summarized the information and  tools needed into categories and identified the users\u2019 most pressing  needs within each category. According to these documents, the  CCAWWG agencies plan next to prepare two companion documents  to identify a scientific strategy for meeting the research needs  identified in the two initial documents.

For example, because the reliability of a planned flood  reduction project could depend on how climate change affects future  flooding, the Corps launched a pilot study with the goals of determining  (1) whether tools and data are available for the Corps to provide reliable  estimates of future flooding using climate projections and (2) how  changes in precipitation patterns will affect flood events.
