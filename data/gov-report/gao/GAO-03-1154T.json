The transportation system crisscrosses the nation and extends beyond our borders to move millions of passengers and tons of freight each day. The extensiveness of the system as well as the sheer volume of passengers and freight moved makes it both an attractive target and difficult to secure. Addressing the security concerns of the transportation system is further complicated by the number of transportation stakeholders that are involved in security decisions, including government agencies at the federal, state, and local levels and thousands of private sector companies. Further exacerbating these challenges are the financial pressures confronting transportation stakeholders. For example, the sluggish economy has weakened the transportation industry's financial condition by decreasing ridership and revenues. The federal government has provided additional funding for transportation security since September 11, but demand has far outstripped the additional amounts made available. It will take the collective effort of all transportation stakeholders to meet existing and future transportation challenges. Since September 11, transportation stakeholders have acted to enhance security. At the federal level, TSA primarily focused on meeting aviation security deadlines during its first year of existence and DOT launched a variety of security initiatives to enhance the other modes of transportation. For example, the Federal Transit Administration provided grants for emergency drills and conducted security assessments at the largest transit agencies, among other things. TSA has recently focused more on the security of the maritime and land transportation modes and is planning to issue security standards for all modes of transportation. DOT is also continuing their security efforts.

Although most of the  early attention following the September 11 attacks focused on aviation  security, emphasis on the other modes of transportation has since grown  as concerns are voiced about possible vulnerabilities, such as attempts to  introduce weapons of mass destruction into this country through ports or  launch chemical attacks on mass transit systems. The entire transportation  industry has remained on a heightened state of alert since the attacks.", "My testimony today examines (1) challenges in securing the nation\u2019s  transportation system; (2) actions transportation operators, as well as  state and local governments, have taken since September 11 to enhance  security; (3) the federal role in securing the transportation system and  actions the federal government has taken to enhance transportation  security since September 11; and (4) future actions that are needed to  further enhance the security of the nation\u2019s transportation system.

Key modes of transportation include aviation; highways;  motor carrier (i.e., trucking); motor coach (i.e., intercity bus); maritime;  pipeline; rail (passenger and freight); and transit (e.g., buses, subways,  ferry boats, and light rail). The transportation modes work in harmony to  facilitate mobility through an extensive network of infrastructure and  operators, as well as through the vehicles and vessels that permit  passengers and freight to move within the system. For example, the  nation\u2019s transportation system moves over 30 million tons of freight and  provides approximately 1.1 billion passenger trips each day. The diversity  and size of the transportation system make it vital to our economy and  national security, including military mobilization and deployment.", "Private industry, state and local governments, and the federal government  all have roles and responsibilities in securing the transportation system.  Private industry owns and operates a large share of the transportation  system. For example, almost 2,000 pipeline companies and 571 railroad  companies own and operate the pipeline and freight railroad systems,  respectively. Additionally, 83 passenger air carriers and 640,000 interstate  motor coach and motor carrier companies operate in the United States.  State and local governments also own significant portions of the highways,  transit systems, and airports in the country. For example, state and local  governments own over 90 percent of the total mileage of highways. State  and local governments also administer and implement regulations for  different sectors of the transportation system and provide protective and  emergency response services through various agencies. Although the  federal government owns a limited share of the transportation system, it  issues regulations, establishes policies, provides funding, and/or sets  standards for the different modes of transportation. The federal  government uses a variety of policy tools, including grants, loan  guarantees, tax incentives, regulations, and partnerships, to motivate or  mandate state and local governments or the private sector to help address  security concerns.", "Prior to September 11, DOT was the primary federal entity involved in  transportation security matters. However, in response to the attacks on  September 11, Congress passed the Aviation and Transportation Security  Act (ATSA), which created TSA within DOT and defined its primary  responsibility as ensuring security in all modes of transportation. The act  also gives TSA regulatory authority over all transportation modes. Since its  creation in November 2001, TSA has focused primarily on meeting the  aviation security deadlines contained in ATSA. With the passage of the  Homeland Security Act on November 25, 2002, TSA, along with over 20  other agencies, was transferred to the new Department of Homeland  Security (DHS)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Transportation System as a Whole Faces Numerous Challenges", "paragraphs": ["The United States maintains the world\u2019s largest and most complex national  transportation system.

Furthermore, as  industry representatives and transportation security experts repeatedly  noted, the extensiveness of the infrastructure makes equal protection for  all assets impossible.", "Protecting transportation assets from attack is made more difficult  because of the tremendous variety of transportation operators. Some are  multibillion-dollar enterprises, and others have very limited facilities and  very little traffic. Some are public agencies, such as state departments of  transportation, and some are private businesses. Some transportation  operators carry passengers, and others haul freight. Additionally, the type  of freight moved through the different modes is similarly varied. For  example, the maritime, motor carrier, and rail operators haul freight as  diverse as dry bulk (grain) and hazardous materials."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Interconnectivity and Interdependency Also Present Challenges", "paragraphs": ["Additional challenges are created by the interconnectivity and  interdependency among the transportation modes and between the  transportation sector and nearly every other sector of the economy. The  transportation system is interconnected or intermodal because passengers  and freight can use multiple modes of transportation to reach a  destination. For example, from its point of origin to its destination, a piece  of freight, such as a shipping container, can move from ship to train to  truck. (See fig. 1.) The interconnective nature of the transportation system  creates several security challenges. First, the effects of events directed at  one mode of transportation can ripple throughout the entire system. For  example, when the port workers in California, Oregon, and Washington  went on strike in 2002, the railroads saw their intermodal traffic decline by  almost 30 percent during the first week of the strike, compared with the  year before. Second, the interconnecting modes can contaminate each  other\u2014that is, if a particular mode experiences a security breach, the  breach could affect other modes. An example of this would be if a  shipping container that held a weapon of mass destruction arrived at a  U.S. port where it was placed on a truck or train. In this case, although the  original security breach occurred in the port, the rail or trucking industry  would be affected as well. Thus, even if operators within one mode  established high levels of security they could be affected because of the  security efforts, or lack thereof, of the other modes. Third, intermodal  facilities where a number of modes connect and interact\u2014such as ports\u2014 are potential targets for attack because of the presence of passengers,  freight, employees, and equipment at these facilities.", "Interdependencies also exist between transportation and nearly every  other sector of the economy. Consequently, an event that affects the  transportation sector can have serious impacts on other industries. For  example, when the war in Afghanistan began in October 2001, the rail  industry restricted the movement of many hazardous materials, including  chlorine, because of a heightened threat of a terrorist attack. However,  within days, many major water treatment facilities reported that they were  running out of chlorine, which they use to treat drinking water, and would  have to shut down operations if chlorine deliveries were not immediately  resumed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Number of Stakeholders Creates Challenges", "paragraphs": ["Securing the transportation system is made more difficult because of the  number of stakeholders involved. As illustrated in figure 2, numerous  entities at the federal, state, and local levels, including over 20 federal  entities and thousands of private sector businesses, play a key role in  transportation security. For example, the Departments of Energy,  Transportation, and Homeland Security; state governments; and about  2,000 pipeline operators are all responsible for securing the pipeline  system. The number of stakeholders involved in transportation security  can lead to communication challenges, duplication, and conflicting  guidance. Representatives from several state and local government and  industry associations told us that their members are receiving different  messages from the various federal agencies involved in transportation  security. For instance, one industry representative noted that both TSA  and DOT asked the industry to implement additional security measures  when the nation\u2019s threat condition was elevated to orange at the beginning  of the Iraq War; however, TSA and DOT were not consistent in what they  wanted done\u2014that is, they were asking for different security measures.  Moreover, many representatives commented that the federal government  needs to better coordinate its security efforts. These representatives noted  that dealing with multiple agencies on the same issues and topics is  frustrating and time consuming for the transportation sector.", "The number of stakeholders also makes it difficult to achieve the needed  cooperation and consensus to move forward with security efforts. As we  have noted in past reports, coordination and consensus-building are  critical to successful implementation of security efforts. Transportation  stakeholders can have inconsistent goals or interests, which can make  consensus-building challenging. For example, from a safety perspective,  vehicles that carry hazardous materials should be required to have  placards that identify the contents of a vehicle so that emergency  personnel know how best to respond to an incident. However, from a  security perspective, identifying placards on vehicles that carry hazardous  materials make them a potential target for attack."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Funding Is Key Challenge", "paragraphs": ["According to transportation security experts and state and local  government and industry representatives we contacted, funding is the  most pressing challenge to securing the nation\u2019s transportation system.  Although some security improvements are inexpensive, such as removing  trash cans from subway platforms, most require substantial funding.  Additionally, given the large number of assets to protect, the sum of even  relatively less expensive investments can be cost prohibitive. For example,  reinforcing shipping containers to make them more blast resistant is one  way to improve security, which would cost about $15,000 per container.  With several million shipping containers in use, however, this tactic would  cost billions of dollars if all of them were reinforced. The total cost of  enhancing the security of the entire transportation system is unknown;  however, given the size of the system, it could amount to tens of billions of  dollars.", "The current economic environment makes this a difficult time for private  industry or state and local governments to make security investments.  According to industry representatives and experts we contacted, most of  the transportation industry operates on a very thin profit margin, making it  difficult for the industry to pay for additional security measures. The  sluggish economy has further weakened the transportation industry\u2019s  financial condition by decreasing ridership and revenues. For example,  airlines are in the worst fiscal crisis in their history, and several have filed  for bankruptcy. Similarly, the motor coach and motor carrier industries  and Amtrak report decreased revenues because of the slow economy. In  addition, nearly every state and local government is facing a large budget  deficit for fiscal year 2004. For example, the National Governors  Association estimates that states are facing a total budget shortfall of $80  billion for fiscal year 2004. Given the tight budget environment, state and  local governments and transportation operators must make difficult trade- offs between transportation security investments and other needs, such as  service expansion and equipment upgrades. According to the National  Association of Counties, many local governments are planning to defer  some maintenance of their transportation infrastructure to pay for some  security enhancements.", "Further exacerbating the problem of funding security improvements is the  additional costs the transportation sector incurs when the federal  government elevates the national threat condition. Industry  representatives stated that operators tighten security, such as increasing  security patrols, when the national threat condition is raised or  intelligence information suggests an increased threat against their mode.  However, these representatives stated that these additional measures  drain resources and are not sustainable. For example, Amtrak estimates  that it spends an additional $500,000 per month for police overtime when  the national threat condition is increased. Transportation industry  representatives also noted that employees are diverted from their regular  duties to implement additional security measures, such as guarding  entranceways, in times of increased security, which hurts productivity.", "The federal government has provided additional funding for transportation  security since September 11, but demand has far outstripped the  additional amounts made available. For example, Congress appropriated a  total of $241 million for grants for ports, motor carriers, and Operation  Safe Commerce in 2002. However, as table 1 shows, the grant  applications TSA has received for these security grants totaled $1.8  billion\u2014nearly 8 times more than the amount available. Due to the costs of  security enhancements and the transportation industries\u2019 and state and  local governments\u2019 tight budget environments, the federal government is  likely to be viewed as a source of funding for at least some of these  enhancements. However, given the constraints on the federal budget as  well as competing claims for federal assistance, requests for federal  funding for transportation security enhancements will likely continue to  exceed available resources.", "Another challenge is balancing the potential economic impacts of security  enhancements with the benefits of such measures. Although there is broad  support for greater security, this task is a difficult one because the nation  relies heavily on a free and expeditious flow of goods. Particularly with  \u201cjust-in-time\u201d deliveries, which require a smooth and expeditious flow  through the transportation system, delays or disruptions in the supply  chain could have serious economic impacts. As the Coast Guard  Commandant stated about the flow of goods through ports, \u201ceven slowing  the flow long enough to inspect either all or a statistically significant  random selection of imports would be economically intolerable.\u201d", "Furthermore, security measures may have economic and competitive  ramifications for individual modes of transportation. For instance, if the  federal government imposed a particular security requirement on the rail  industry and not on the motor carrier industry, the rail industry might  incur additional costs and/or lose customers to the motor carrier industry.  Striking the right balance between increasing security and protecting the  economic vitality of the national economy and individual modes will  remain an important and difficult task."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Individual Transportation Modes Also Confront Unique Challenges", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the overarching challenges that transportation stakeholders  will face in attempting to improve transportation security, they also face a  number of challenges specific to the aviation, maritime, and land  transportation modes. Although aviation security has received a significant  amount of attention and funding since September 11, more work is  needed. In general, transportation security experts believe that the  aviation system is more secure today than it was prior to September 11.  However, aviation experts and TSA officials noted that significant  vulnerabilities remain. For example:    Perimeter security: Terrorists could launch attacks, such as launching  shoulder-fired missiles, from a location just outside an airport\u2019s perimeter.  Since September 11, airport operators have increased their patrols of  airport perimeter areas, but industry officials state that they do not have  enough resources to completely protect against these attacks.", "Air cargo security: Although TSA has focused much effort and funding  on ensuring that bombs and other threat items are not carried onto planes  by passengers or in their luggage, vulnerabilities exist in securing the  cargo carried aboard commercial passenger and all-cargo aircraft. For  example, employees of shippers and freight forwarders are not universally  subject to background checks. Theft is also a major problem in air cargo  shipping, signifying that unauthorized personnel may still be gaining  access to air cargo shipments. Air cargo shipments pass through several  hands in going from sender to recipient, making it challenging to  implement a system that provides adequate security for air cargo.  According to TSA officials, TSA is developing a strategic plan to address  air cargo security and has undertaken a comprehensive outreach process  to strengthen security programs across the industry.", "General aviation security: Although TSA has taken several actions  related to general aviation since September 11, this segment of the  industry remains potentially more vulnerable than commercial aviation.  For example, general aviation pilots are not screened prior to taking off,  and the contents of a plane are not examined at any point. According to  TSA, solutions that can be implemented relatively easily at the nation\u2019s  commercial airports are not practical at the 19,000 general aviation  airports. It would be very difficult to prevent a general aviation pilot intent  on committing a terrorist attack with his or her aircraft from doing so. The  vulnerability of the system was illustrated in January 2002, when a teenage  flight student from Florida crashed his single-engine airplane into a Tampa  skyscraper. TSA is working with the appropriate stakeholders to close  potential security gaps and to raise the security standards across this  diverse segment of the aviation industry.", "Maritime and land transportation systems have their own unique security  vulnerabilities. For example, maritime and land transportation systems  generally have an open design, meaning the users can access the system at  multiple points. The systems are open by design so that they are accessible  and convenient for users. In contrast, the aviation system is housed in  closed and controlled locations with few entry points. The openness of the  maritime and land transportation systems can leave them vulnerable  because transportation operators cannot monitor or control who enters or  leaves the systems. However, adding security measures that restrict the  flow of passengers or freight through the systems could have serious  consequences for commerce and the public.", "Individual maritime and land transportation modes also have unique  challenges and vulnerabilities. For example, representatives from the  motor carrier industry noted that the high turnover rate (about 40 to 60  percent) of drivers means that motor carrier operators must be continually  conducting background checks on new drivers, which is expensive and  time consuming. Additionally, as we noted in our report on rail safety and  security, the temporary storage of hazardous materials in unsecured or  unmonitored rail cars while awaiting delivery to their ultimate destinations  is a potential vulnerability. Specifically, unmonitored chemical cars could  develop undetected leaks that could threaten the nearby population and  environment. In addition, representatives from the motor coach industry  commented that the number of used motor coaches on the market,  coupled with the lack of guidance or requirements on buying or selling  these vehicles, is a serious vulnerability. In particular, there are  approximately 5,000 used motor coaches on the market; however, there is  very little information on who is selling and buying them, nor is there any  consistency among motor coach operators in whether they remove their  logos from the vehicles before they are sold. These vehicles could be used  as weapons or to transport weapons. Federal Motor Carrier Safety  Administration officials told us they have not issued guidance to the  industry on this potential vulnerability because TSA is responsible for  security and therefore would be responsible for issuing such guidance."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Transportation Operators and State and Local Governments Have Taken Steps to Improve Security", "paragraphs": ["Since September 11, transportation operators and state and local  governments have been working to strengthen security, according to  associations we contacted.

According to representatives from a number of industry  associations we interviewed, transportation operators have implemented  new security measures or increased the frequency or intensity of existing  activities. Some of the most common measures cited include conducting  vulnerability or risk assessments, tightening access control, intensifying  security presence, increasing emergency drills, developing or revising  security plans, and providing additional training. (Figure 3 is a photograph  from an annual emergency drill conducted by the Washington  Metropolitan Area Transit Authority.)", "As we have previously reported, state and local governments are critical  stakeholders in the nation\u2019s homeland security efforts. This is equally true  in securing the nation\u2019s transportation system. State and local  governments play a critical role, in part, because they own a significant  portion of the transportation infrastructure, such as airports, transit  systems, highways, and ports. For example, state and local governments  own over 90 percent of the total mileage of the highway system. Even  when state and local governments are not the owners or operators, they  nonetheless are directly affected by the transportation modes that run  through their jurisdictions. Consequently, the responsibility for protecting  this infrastructure and responding to emergencies involving the  transportation infrastructure often falls on state and local governments.", "Security efforts of local and state governments have included developing  counter terrorist plans, participating in training and security-related  research, participating in transportation operators\u2019 emergency drills and  table-top exercises, conducting vulnerability assessments of  transportation assets, and participating in emergency planning sessions  with transportation operators.

(See app. I for a table listing the actions  taken by DOT modal administrations since September 11.) The actions  taken by the DOT modal administrations have varied. For example, FTA  launched a multipart initiative for mass transit agencies that provided  grants for emergency drills, offered free security training, conducted  security assessments at 36 transit agencies, provided technical assistance,  and invested in research and development. The Federal Motor Carrier  Safety Administration developed three courses for motor coach drivers.

Given the intermodalism of the system, incidents in one mode of  transportation could affect other modes. Second, it is important not to  drive terrorism from one mode of transportation to another mode because  of perceived lesser security\u2014that is, make a mode of transportation a  more attractive target because another mode is \u201chardened\u201d with additional  security measures. Third, it is important that security measures for one  mode of transportation are not overly stringent or too economically  challenging compared with the measures used for other modes.

A risk  management approach is a systematic process to analyze threats,  vulnerabilities, and the criticality (or relative importance) of assets to  better support key decisions in order to link resources with prioritized  efforts. (See app. II for a description of the key elements of a risk  management approach.) The highest priorities emerge where the three  elements of risk management overlap. For example, transportation  infrastructure that is determined to be a critical asset, vulnerable to attack,  and a likely target would be most at risk and therefore would be a higher  priority for funding compared with infrastructure that was only vulnerable  to attack. According to TSA officials, risk management principles will  drive all decisions\u2014from standard-setting to funding priorities to staffing.", "Using risk management principles to guide decision-making is a good  strategy, given the difficult trade-offs TSA will likely have to make as it  moves forward with its security efforts. We have advocated using a risk  management approach to guide federal programs and responses to better  prepare against terrorism and other threats and to better direct finite  national resources to areas of highest priority. As representatives from  local government and industry associations and transportation security  experts repeatedly noted, the size of the transportation system precludes  equal protection for all assets; moreover, the risks vary by transportation  assets within modes and by modes. In addition, requests for funding for  transportation security enhancements will likely exceed available  resources. Risk management principles can help TSA determine security  priorities and identify appropriate solutions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "TSA Plans to Issue National Security Standards", "paragraphs": ["TSA plans to issue national security standards for all modes of  transportation. The federal government has historically set security  standards for the aviation sector. For instance, prior to the passage of  ATSA, FAA set security standards that the airlines were required to follow  in several areas including, screening equipment, screener qualifications,  and access control systems. In contrast, prior to the September 11 attacks,  limited statutory authority existed to require measures to ensure the  security of the maritime and land transportation systems. According to a  TSA report, the existing regulatory framework leaves the maritime and  land transportation systems unacceptably vulnerable to terrorist attack.  For example, the rail, transit, and motor coach transportation systems are  subject to no mandatory security requirements, resulting in little or no  screening of passengers, baggage, or crew. Additionally, seaborne  passenger vessel and seaport terminal operators have inconsistent levels  and methods of screening and are largely free to set their own rules about  the hiring and training of security personnel. Hence, TSA will set standards  to ensure consistency among modes and across the transportation system  and to reduce the transportation system\u2019s vulnerability to attacks.", "According to TSA officials and documents, TSA\u2019s standards will be  performance-, risk-, and threat-based and may be mandatory. More  specifically:    Standards will be performance-based.

The standards will be mandatory when  the risk level is too high or unacceptable. TSA officials stated that in these  cases, mandatory standards are needed to ensure accountability. In  addition, according to TSA officials, voluntary requirements put security- conscious transportation operators that implement security measures at a  competitive disadvantage\u2014that is, they have spent money that their  competitors may not have spent. This creates a disincentive for  transportation operators to implement voluntary requirements. TSA  officials believe that mandatory standards will reduce this problem. In  determining whether mandatory standards are needed, TSA will review  the results of criticality and vulnerability assessments, current best  practices, and voluntary compliance opportunities in conjunction with the  private sector and other government agencies.", "Although TSA officials expect some level of resistance to the standards by  the transportation industry, they believe that their approach of using risk-,  threat-, and performance-based standards will increase the acceptance of  the standards. For example, performance-based standards allow for more  operator flexibility in implementing the standards, compared with rigid,  prescriptive standards. Moreover, TSA plans to issue only a limited  number of standards\u2014that is, standards will be issued only when  assessments of the threats, vulnerabilities, and criticality indicate that the  level of risk is too high or unacceptable.", "TSA also expects some level of resistance to the standards from DOT  modal administrations. Although TSA will establish the security standards,  TSA expects that they will be administered and implemented by existing  agencies and organizations. DOT modal administrations may be reluctant  to assume this role because doing so could alter their relationships with  the industry. Historically, the missions of DOT surface transportation  modal administrations have largely focused on maintaining operations and  improving service and safety, not regulating security. Moreover, the  authority to regulate security varies by DOT modal administration. For  example, FTA has limited authority to regulate and oversee security at  transit agencies. In contrast, FRA has regulatory authority for rail security,  and DOT\u2019s Office of Pipeline Safety has responsibility for writing safety  and security regulations for liquefied natural gas storage facilities. In  addition, DOT modal administrations may be reluctant to administer and  implement standards because of resource concerns.

For example, industry associations expressed concerns  that the standards would come in the form of unfunded mandates\u2014that is,  the federal government would not provide funding to implement  mandatory standards. According to the industry and state and local  government associations we spoke to, unfunded mandates create  additional financial burdens for transportation operators, who are already  experiencing financial difficulties. Industry representatives also expressed  concern that TSA has not adequately included the transportation industry  in its development of standards. Many industry representatives and some  DOT officials we met with were unsure of whether TSA was issuing  standards, what the standards would entail, or the time frames for issuing  the standards. The uncertainty about the pending standards can lead to  confusion and/or inaction. For example, Amtrak officials noted that they  are reluctant to spend money to implement certain security measures  because they are worried that TSA will subsequently issue standards that  will require Amtrak to redo its efforts.

The TWIC program is intended to improve  access control for the 12 million transportation workers who require  unescorted physical or cyber access to secure areas of the nation\u2019s  transportation modes by establishing a uniform, nationwide standard for  secure identification of transportation workers. Specifically, TWIC will  combine standard background checks and biometrics so that a worker can  be positively matched to his/her credential.

In  November 2001, Congress passed ATSA, which created TSA and gave it  primary responsibility for securing all modes of transportation. However,  during TSA\u2019s first year of existence, TSA\u2019s main focus was on aviation  security\u2014more specifically, on meeting ATSA deadlines. While TSA was  primarily focusing on aviation security, DOT modal administrations  launched various initiatives to enhance the security of the maritime and  land transportation modes. With the immediate crisis of meeting many  aviation security deadlines behind it, TSA has been able to focus more on  the security of all modes of transportation.", "Legislation has not specifically defined TSA\u2019s role and responsibilities in  securing all modes of transportation. In particular, ATSA does not specify  TSA\u2019s role and responsibilities in securing the maritime and land  transportation modes in detail as it does for aviation security. For  instance, the act does not set deadlines for TSA to implement certain  transit security requirements. Instead, the act simply states that TSA is  responsible for ensuring security in all modes of transportation. The act  also did not eliminate the existing statutory responsibilities for DOT modal  administrations to secure the different transportation modes. Moreover,  recent legislation indicates that DOT still has security responsibilities. In  particular, the Homeland Security Act of 2002 states that the Secretary of  Transportation is responsible for the security as well as the safety of rail  and the transport of hazardous materials by all modes.", "To clarify their roles and responsibilities in transportation security, DOT  modal administrations and TSA planned to develop memorandums of  agreement. The purpose of these documents was to define the roles and  responsibilities of the different agencies for transportation security and  address a variety of issues, including separating safety and security  activities, interfacing with the transportation industry, and establishing  funding priorities. TSA and the DOT modal administrations worked for  months to develop the memorandums of agreement and the draft  agreements were presented to senior DOT and TSA management for  review in early spring of this year. According to DOT\u2019s General Counsel,  with the exception of the memorandum of agreement between FAA and  TSA, the draft memorandums were very general and did not provide much  clarification. Consequently, DOT and TSA decided not to sign the  memorandums of agreement, except for the memorandum of agreement  between FAA and TSA, which was signed on February 28, 2003.", "The General Counsel suggested several reasons why the majority of the  draft memorandums of agreement were too general. First, as TSA\u2019s  departure date approached\u2014that is, the date that TSA transferred from  DOT to DHS\u2014TSA and DOT modal administration officials may have  grown concerned about formally binding the organizations to specific  roles and responsibilities. Second, the working relationships between TSA  and most of the DOT modal administrations are still very new; as a result,  all of the potential issues, problem areas, or overlap have yet to be  identified. Thus, identifying items to include in the memorandums of  agreement was more difficult.", "Rather than execute memorandums of agreement, the Secretary of  Transportation and the Administrator of TSA exchanged correspondence  that commits each entity to continued coordination and collaboration on  security measures. In the correspondence, the Secretary and  Administrator also agreed to use the memorandum of agreement between  TSA and FAA as a framework for their interactions on security matters for  all other modes.

Nevertheless, transportation  experts, industry representatives, and federal officials all recommend that  more work be done. Transportation experts and state and local  government and industry representatives identified a number of actions  that, in their view, the federal government should take to enhance  security, including clarifying federal roles and coordinating federal efforts,  developing a transportation security strategy, funding security  enhancements, investing in research and development, and providing  better intelligence information and related guidance. Specifically:    Clarify federal roles and responsibilities. The lack of clarity about the roles  and responsibilities of federal entities in transportation security creates  the potential for confusion, duplication, and conflicts. Understanding  roles, responsibilities, and whom to call is crucial in an emergency.  However, representatives from several industry associations stated that  their members were unclear about which agency to contact for their  various security concerns and which agency has oversight for certain  issues. Furthermore, they said that they do not have contacts within these  agencies. As mentioned earlier, several industry representatives reported  that their members are receiving different messages from various federal  agencies involved in transportation security, which creates confusion and  frustration within the industry. According to industry representatives and  transportation security experts, uncertainty about federal roles and the  lack of coordination are straining intergovernmental relationships,  draining resources, and raising the potential for problems in responding to  terrorism. One industry association told us, for instance, that it has been  asked by three different federal agencies to participate in three separate  studies of the same issue.", "Establish a national transportation strategy. A national strategy is  crucial for helping stakeholders identify priorities, leveraging resources,  establishing stakeholder performance expectations, and creating  incentives for stakeholders to improve security. Currently, local  government associations view the absence of performance expectations\u2014 coupled with limited threat information\u2014as a major obstacle in focusing  their people and resources on high-priority threats, particularly at elevated  threat levels. The experts also noted that modal strategies\u2014no matter how  complete\u2014cannot address the complete transportation security problem  and will leave gaps in preparedness. As mentioned earlier, TSA is in the  process of developing a national transportation system security plan,  which, according to the Deputy Administrator of TSA, will provide an  overarching framework for the security of all modes.", "Provide funding for needed security improvements. Although an  overall security strategy is a prerequisite to investing wisely, providing  adequate funding also is essential, according to experts we contacted.  Setting security goals and strategies without adequate funding diminishes  stakeholders\u2019 commitment and willingness to absorb initial security  investments and long-term operating costs, an expert emphasized.  Industry and state and local government associations also commented that  federal funding should accompany any federal security standards;  otherwise, mandatory standards will be considered unfunded mandates  that the industry and state and local governments will have to absorb.", "Invest in research and development for transportation security.  According to most transportation security experts and associations we  contacted, investing in research and development is an appropriate role  for the federal government, because the products of research and  development endeavors would likely benefit the entire transportation  system, not just individual modes or operators. TSA is actively engaged in  research and development projects, such as the development of the next  generation explosive detection systems for baggage, hardening of aircraft  and cargo/baggage containers, biometrics and other access control  methods, and human factors initiatives to identify methods to improve  screener performance, at its Transportation Security Laboratory in  Atlantic City, New Jersey.

Without more  localized and actionable intelligence, stakeholders said they run the risk of  wasting resources on unneeded security measures or not providing an  adequate level of security. Moreover, local government officials often are  not allowed to receive specific intelligence information because they do  not have appropriate federal security clearances. Also, there is little  federal guidance on how local authorities should respond to a specific  threat or general threat warnings. For example, San Francisco police were  stationed at the Golden Gate Bridge to respond to the elevated national  threat condition.
