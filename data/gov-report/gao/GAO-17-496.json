Material weaknesses and significant deficiencies reported in agencies' financial audits and other challenges reported in Inspectors General (IG) readiness review reports show several widespread and longstanding issues that present risks to agencies' abilities to submit quality data as required by the Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (DATA Act). These issues fall into three categories: (1) accounting and financial management, (2) financial management systems, and (3) information technology security and controls. GAO has also reported weaknesses and challenges in government-wide financial management systems used for DATA Act reporting.", "Challenges with guidance will impact data quality. Challenges related to how agencies report certain intragovernmental transactions, reconcile recipient address information, and align required DATA Act files with missing data continue to present risks to the quality of data displayed on USASpending.gov. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) have stated that they do not expect to resolve these challenges before the May 2017 reporting deadline. Unresolved challenges affecting data quality could lead policymakers and the public to draw inaccurate conclusions from the data. This challenge underscores the need for OMB to address GAO's open recommendation that it provide agencies with additional guidance to address data quality issues. GAO will continue to assess how OMB, Treasury, and agencies address data quality issues moving forward.", "Limitations exist with data quality assurance processes. OMB guidance directs senior accountable officials at each agency to rely on existing assurance processes when they certify that their agencies' DATA Act submissions are valid and reliable. However, GAO identified concerns regarding some existing assurance processes. For example, OMB directed agencies to use a General Services Administration assurance statement attesting to the quality of data in two source systems, but the assurance statement focuses on data security rather than data quality, and it is unclear whether it applies to both procurement and financial assistance data. OMB is aware of these issues and expects to finalize the assurance process in time for the May 2017 reporting deadline. Accordingly, GAO is not making a recommendation at this time but will assess the quality of the assurance process in future work.", "Efforts to establish a data governance structure are still at an early stage. OMB has taken some actions to improve its data governance framework, but efforts to establish a fully functioning data governance structure are at an early stage with many specifics yet to be worked out. OMB formally chartered the Data Standards Committee as an advisory body in November 2016 to focus on clarifying existing data element definitions and identifying needs for new standards. The charter states that the committee will promote transparency by making the topics and outcomes of its proceedings public, but OMB has not kept records of the committee's meetings nor has the committee produced a work plan for moving forward. Public information about the committee's activities and outcomes would facilitate consultation with stakeholders, as required by the act."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the Director of OMB ensures that the Data Standards Committee publicly releases information about the topics of its proceedings and any resulting outcomes.

The DATA Act requires government- wide reporting on a greater variety of federal funds, such as budget and  financial information, as well as tracking of these funds at multiple points  in the federal spending lifecycle. To improve the quality of these data, the  act requires that agency-reported award and financial information comply  with new data standards established by OMB and Treasury. These  standards specify the items to be reported under the DATA Act and  define and describe what is to be included in each element with the aim of  ensuring that information will be consistent and comparable. The act  identifies OMB and Treasury as the two agencies responsible for leading  government-wide implementation.", "Two key components of ensuring the accuracy, completeness, and  consistency of federal spending data are OMB releasing policy guidance  and Treasury developing technical guidance for the agency submissions  and publication of the data required under the act. Toward that end, OMB  has taken a number of steps to help agencies meet their reporting  requirements, including establishing 57 standardized data element  definitions for reporting federal spending information, issuing guidance to  operationalize selected standards and clarify agency reporting  requirements, and meeting with agencies to assess their readiness to  meet the reporting requirements under the act. Specific actions include  the following:  In May 2015, OMB issued initial guidance to federal agencies on  reporting requirements pursuant to the Federal Funding Accountability  and Transparency Act (FFATA) as well as the new requirements that  agencies must employ pursuant to the DATA Act. The guidance also  directs agencies to (1) implement data definition standards for  collecting and reporting agency-level and award-level data by May 9,  2017; (2) implement a standard data exchange format for providing  data to Treasury to be displayed on USASpending.gov or a successor  site; and (3) link agency financial systems with award systems by  continuing to use specified unique identification numbers for financial  assistance awards and contracts.", "In May 2016, OMB released guidance on reporting financial and  award information required under the act. This guidance addresses  (1) reporting financial and award level data, (2) linking agency award  and financial systems using a unique award identifier, and (3)  assuring that data submitted to Treasury for publication on  USASpending.gov are sufficiently valid and reliable.", "In November 2016, OMB issued additional guidance in response to  questions and concerns reported by agencies. This guidance  specifies DATA Act reporting responsibilities for intragovernmental  transactions, explains how to report financial assistance awards with  personally identifiable information, and clarifies the senior accountable  official (SAO) assurance process over the data submitted to the DATA  Act broker, a system to standardize data formatting and assist  reporting agencies in validating their data prior to submission.", "The May and November 2016 guidance also directs agency SAOs to  leverage existing data quality and management controls established  in statute, regulations, or federal policy when submitting their  assurance over the data.", "In addition to issuing policy guidance to help agencies meet their  reporting requirements under the act, OMB\u2019s Controller and Treasury\u2019s  Fiscal Assistant Secretary conducted a series of meetings with CFO Act  agencies to obtain information on any challenges that could impede  effective implementation and assess agencies\u2019 readiness to report  required spending data in May 2017.", "Treasury also led efforts to develop the technical guidance and reporting  systems to facilitate agency reporting. In April 2016, Treasury released  the DATA Act Information Model Schema (DAIMS), or schema version  1.0, which provides information on how to standardize the way financial  assistance awards, contracts and other financial and non-financial data  will be collected and reported under the DATA Act. A key component of  the reporting framework laid out in the schema is the DATA Act broker.  According to Treasury guidance documents, agencies are expected to  submit three files sourced from their financial management systems to the  broker. The broker is also expected to extract award and sub-award  information from existing award reporting systems that currently supply  award data (covering federal assistance including grants and loans, as  well as procurements) to USASpending.gov.", "These award reporting systems\u2014including the Federal Procurement Data  System-Next Generation (FPDS-NG), System for Award Management  (SAM), the Award Submission Portal (ASP), and the FFATA Subaward  Reporting System (FSRS)\u2014compile information submitted by agencies and award recipients to report, among other things, procurement and  financial assistance award information required under FFATA. A more  detailed discussion of the broker and the agency file submission process  can be found in our August 2016 correspondence. In addition to  developing the schema version 1.0 and the broker, Treasury also issued  an implementation playbook that outlines 8 steps and a recommended  timeline for agency implementation, and hosted multiple meetings,  including weekly office hour calls and monthly technical workshops, to  help agencies prepare and test their data for submission to the broker.", "To help improve the quality of the data, the act also requires agencies\u2019  IGs and GAO to assess and report on the completeness, timeliness,  quality, and accuracy of spending data submitted by federal agencies.

Included in these challenges is how agencies are to report  certain intragovernmental transactions that result from financial activities  between federal government agencies. Specifically, in order to properly  present the financial balances and activities of the federal government,  the reciprocating balances and activities between the agencies should be  offset and result in a zero balance.", "Reconciling intragovernmental transactions for financial reporting  purposes is a longstanding and government-wide challenge.

Our most recent audit found that the amount of unmatched  funds from intragovernmental transactions amounted to hundreds of  billions of dollars. In response to our previous recommendations,  Treasury has continued to actively work with federal agencies and  improve its processes to resolve intragovernmental transactions.", "However, the guidance OMB developed on how agencies are to report  intragovernmental transactions does not appear to leverage the existing  processes that Treasury has put in place to resolve on a quarterly basis  the differences in intragovernmental transactions between federal  agencies.

This  guidance requires agencies to ensure that award-level data in their  systems for financial assistance recipients matches the recipients\u2019  information in SAM. Consistent with OMB guidance, financial assistance  recipients are required to register in SAM prior to submitting an  application for an award, and OMB staff told us recipients are also  required to provide accurate information as part of the terms and  conditions of their award agreements.

In addition, some rural  communities do not have ZIP+4 because the U.S. Postal Service (USPS)  only assigns 5-digit ZIP codes in those areas.", "As a result of the requirement that ZIP+4 information be consistent with  the USPS address database, Treasury officials told us some agencies are  unable to validate their financial assistance award information in the  DATA Act broker. For example, USDA officials told us in January 2017  that instituting the ZIP+4 validation rule in the broker as a fatal error rather  than just a warning would cause a large number of their financial  assistance records to fail and ultimately not be included in data that are  displayed on USASpending.gov. In February 2017, Treasury  implemented the ZIP+4 validation rule as a fatal error.

OMB and Treasury have taken some initial steps to build  a data governance structure including conducting interviews with  key stakeholders and developing a set of recommendations for  decision-making authority. In September 2016, OMB and  Treasury took another step toward establishing a data  governance structure by creating a new Data Standards  Committee that will be responsible for advising OMB and  Treasury on new data elements and revisions to established  standards. According to OMB staff, the committee has held  several meetings but has not yet provided recommendations to  OMB.   However, more remains to be done.

This  memorandum provided guidance on new federal prime award  reporting requirements, agency assurances, and authoritative  sources for reporting. In November 2016, OMB followed this with  additional guidance intended to provide clarification on how  agencies should: (1) report financial information for awards  involving Intragovernmental Transfers (IGTs); (2) report financial  assistance award records containing personally identifiable  information (PII); and (3) provide agency SAO assurance  regarding quarterly submissions to USASpending.gov. OMB  staff also stated that they sent an email announcement to  agency senior accountable officials to clarify that information  submitted to USASpending.gov is subject to plain language  requirements.

As we previously reported, OMB stated that each agency  is responsible for determining whether it is subject to the DATA  Act. To help agencies make that determination, OMB published  guidance in the form of frequently asked questions and stated  that the agencies may consult with OMB for additional counsel.  In response to our recommendation, OMB staff told us they have  reached out to federal agencies to identify which agencies have  determined that they are exempt from reporting under the DATA  Act and prepared a list of such agencies. However, OMB has not  provided us the list or the procedures for reviewing agency  determinations and compiling the results. In addition, OMB has  not established procedures for ensuring non-exempt agencies  are reporting spending data as required.
