The congressional defense committees recognize that these groups need some carryover to ensure a smooth work flow from one fiscal year to the next. However, the committees have previously raised concern that the amount of carryover may be more than is needed. GAO was asked to determine if (1) the Naval Air Warfare Center's (NAWC) reported actual carryover was reliable for fiscal years 2003 through 2006 and (2) NAWC was utilizing the required triannual review process to improve the reliability of its carryover information and underlying financial data."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO's analysis of NAWC reports determined that NAWC's reported carryover information was not reliable. Since DOD changed its carryover policy in December 2002, NAWC reports showed that while under the ceiling for fiscal year 2006, it exceeded its carryover ceiling by tens of millions of dollars from fiscal year 2003 through fiscal year 2005, as shown in the following table. To the extent that carryover is too high, Congress can redirect the customers' funds for other priorities. GAO's analysis of accounting information on customer orders and discussions with NAWC officials determined that its fiscal year 2003 and 2004 carryover information was unreliable due to (1) NAWC converting to a new accounting system in fiscal year 2003 and (2) NAWC not performing reviews of obligations, including the required DOD triannual reviews. To better manage carryover and improve the reliability of carryover information, starting in fiscal year 2005, NAWC (1) issued guidance on the acceptance of orders at year end and (2) began reviewing orders to correct its old financial records. While the reliability of carryover information improved in fiscal years 2005 and 2006, GAO determined that problems still exist. For example, GAO found that funds on some customer orders totaling $19.5 million were deobligated at fiscal year end and then reobligated at the beginning of the next fiscal year on these same orders. This artificially lowered reported NAWC carryover at fiscal year end. Further, even though DOD's 1996 guidance required NAWC as well as other activities to conduct triannual reviews of its financial information, NAWC did not perform these reviews until fiscal year 2006. If implemented properly, these reviews would improve the reliability of reported carryover information and the underlying financial data. In addition, as of September 2006, the two NAWC divisions were still not fully complying with several of the 16 specific DOD tasks required as part of the triannual reviews. For example, because the two divisions were not always effectively reviewing some obligations, especially dormant obligations (obligations over 120 days old), their reported actual carryover was overstated. Also, effective triannual reviews would help NAWC validate its financial records before it implements a new system that is scheduled to be installed in October 2007."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["According to the Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) fiscal year 2007 budget  estimates, working capital fund activity groups (depot maintenance,  ordnance, and research and development) will have about $6 billion of  funded work that will be carried over from fiscal year 2007 into fiscal year  2008. The congressional defense committees recognize that these activity  groups need some carryover to ensure a smooth flow of work during the  transition from one fiscal year to the next. However, past congressional  defense committee reports raised concerns that the level of carryover may  be more than is needed. Excessive amounts of carryover financed with  customer appropriations are subject to reductions by DOD and the  congressional defense committees during the budget review process.

In  December 2002, DOD revised its carryover policy to eliminate the 3-month  across-the-board standard for allowable carryover. Under the new policy,  the allowable amount of carryover (known as the carryover ceiling) is to  be based on the outlay rate of the customers\u2019 appropriations financing the  work. This means that in determining allowable carryover, the first year  outlay rate of the customers\u2019 appropriations financing the work is used for  new orders received in the current year (first year of the work order).  However, we reported in June 2006 that the military services have not  consistently implemented DOD\u2019s revised policy in calculating carryover.  Instead, the military services used different methodologies for calculating  reported actual and allowable amounts of carryover since DOD changed  its carryover policy in December 2002.

Customers use appropriated funds to  finance orders placed with the working capital fund. According to the  Navy\u2019s fiscal year 2007 budget, the Navy Working Capital Fund will earn  about $23.4 billion in revenue during fiscal year 2007. The Navy Working  Capital Fund consists of the following five major activity groups: supply  management, depot maintenance, transportation, base support, and  research and development. The Navy\u2019s research and development working  capital fund activity group is Navy\u2019s largest activity group in terms of  expected revenue with $10.1 billion in fiscal year 2007.

Carryover consists of both the  unfinished portion of work started but not completed, as well as requested  work that has not yet begun. Some carryover is necessary at fiscal year  end if working capital funds are to operate efficiently and effectively. For  example, if customers do not receive new appropriations at the beginning  of the fiscal year, carryover is necessary to ensure that the working capital  fund activities have enough work to ensure a smooth transition between  fiscal years. Too little carryover could result in some personnel not having  work to perform at the beginning of the fiscal year. On the other hand, too  much carryover could result in an activity group receiving funds from  customers in one fiscal year but not performing the work until well into  the next fiscal year or subsequent years. By optimizing the amount of  carryover, DOD can use its resources in the most effective manner and  minimize the \u201cbanking\u201d of funds for work and programs to be performed  in subsequent years.", "Decision makers, including the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense  (Comptroller) and congressional defense committees, use reported  carryover information to make decisions concerning whether working  capital fund activities, such as NAWC, have too much carryover. If NAWC  has too much carryover, the decision makers may reduce the customers\u2019  budgets and use these resources for other purposes. For example, during  its review of the fiscal year 2003 budget, the Office of the Under Secretary  of Defense (Comptroller) determined that the Navy research and  development activities\u2019 carryover had been steadily increasing from about  $2.2 billion in fiscal year 1997 to about $3.4 billion in fiscal year 2003. Since  a significant portion of the carryover was related to work that was to be  contracted out, the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller)  reduced the customer funding by $161.1 million, because these efforts  could be funded in fiscal year 2004 with no impact on performance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Revised Its Carryover Policy", "paragraphs": ["In 1996, DOD established a 3-month carryover standard for working  capital fund activities.

According to Office of the  Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) officials, DOD provided verbal  guidance concerning its new carryover policy for working capital fund  activities in December 2002. Subsequently, DOD included its revised  carryover policy in its DOD Financial Management Regulation 7000.14-R,  Volume 2B, Chapter 9, dated June 2004, which eliminated the 3-month  standard for allowable carryover.

Specifically,    when working capital fund activities, such as NAWC, accept customer  orders, obligations are created in the customers\u2019 accounting records, and  the activities become the \u201cfund holders\u201d; and   as work is performed and customers are billed, both the unliquidated  obligation balances in the customers\u2019 accounting records and the working  capital fund activities\u2019 reported carryover balances are reduced.", "DOD included the triannual review requirements in its Financial  Management Regulation. DOD Financial Management Regulation 7000.14- R, Volume 3, Chapter 8, requires fund holders, such as NAWC, to provide  written confirmation that they have completed 16 specific tasks during  their reviews. For example, the regulation requires fund holders to  confirm, among other things, that they have (1) traced the obligations and  commitments that are recorded in their accounting systems back to source  documentation and (2) conducted adequate follow-up on all dormant  obligations and commitments over 120 days old to determine if they are  still valid. Additionally, the regulation requires fund holders to (1) identify  the problems that were noted during their reviews; (2) advise management  of whether, and to what extent, adjustments or corrections were taken to  remedy noted problems; (3) summarize, by type, the actions or corrections  remaining to be taken; (4) indicate when such actions/corrections are  expected to be completed; and (5) identify the actions that have been  taken to preclude identified problems from recurring in the future.

NAWC aircraft and weapons division officials  stated that their fiscal year 2003 carryover information was unreliable as a  result of NAWC\u2019s conversion to SIGMA in fiscal year 2003. According to  NAWC aircraft and weapons division officials, immediately after the  conversion to SIGMA between January and March 2003, NAWC personnel  began experiencing problems with the reliability of the data. This resulted  from the lack of subject matter expertise and user training on the new  system, and system configuration problems between the previous system,  called the Defense Industrial Financial Management System, and SIGMA.  Further, due to the system not operating for approximately 3 months and  system-related problems, NAWC experienced significant backlogs in  processing financial documents during fiscal year 2003. For example,  NAWC weapons division officials noted that their personnel spent the first  2 months of fiscal year 2004 processing fiscal year 2003 customer bills.  Due to the delays in processing billing transactions, NAWC\u2019s work-in- process balances at the end of fiscal year 2003 (a key component in the  carryover calculation) were about 10 times (aircraft) and 8 times  (weapons) higher than its fiscal year 2002 reported amount.

However, some data reliability problems continued to exist. The NAWC  aircraft and weapons divisions\u2019 comptrollers noted problems with the  reliability of some of their financial information presented in the fiscal  year 2004 financial statements. In fiscal year 2004, NAWC aircraft and  weapons division officials stated that, at the request of the Naval Air  Systems Command Comptroller, a team of consultants and analysts  conducted a review of SIGMA\u2019s processes to address its multitude of data  integrity issues and its inability to provide accurate financial statements.  The team developed a detailed plan of action and milestones to fix these  problems with timelines that extended into fiscal year 2006. Further, for  most of fiscal year 2003 and 2004, NAWC aircraft and weapons division  officials stated that SIGMA lacked carryover management reports that  would allow NAWC program managers to monitor the status of each order  (funding document) and make informed decisions to control its carryover.  In the executive summary to the NAWC aircraft division\u2019s fiscal year 2004  financial statements, the division reported that the implementation of  SIGMA resulted in the nonavailability of specific carryover reports  necessary for managing carryover at the program level. NAWC aircraft and  weapons division officials stated that while the reports became available  late in fiscal year 2004, they were of limited utility because of continuing  data integrity issues and NAWC\u2019s inability to review and validate both aged  and current financial records."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NAWC Took Steps to Better Manage Carryover and Improve the Reliability of Carryover Information", "paragraphs": ["Beginning in fiscal year 2005 and continuing into fiscal year 2006, NAWC  issued guidance on the acceptance of orders at fiscal year end in an  attempt to better manage carryover and avoid exceeding its carryover  ceiling for the third straight year. Specifically, in an August 2005  memorandum that contained fiscal year 2005 NAWC carryover guidance,  NAWC estimated that its year-end carryover balance would be $95 million  over its authorized level. The memorandum placed strict controls over  acceptance of year-end orders including (1) the rejection of noncritical  new orders, (2) the acceptance of requests for reversion of funds back to  customers, and (3) before the NAWC accepts any critical workload that  would result in additional unexpended carryover, the division must obtain  approval from the NAWC aircraft division or weapons division commander  and offset the outstanding carryover amounts by reversions of funds to the  customer of an equal or greater amount. Further, the NAWC comptrollers  were directed to provide program managers with a list of projects or tasks  that had 25 percent or less of authorized funding executed as a potential  source for reversion or offsets. Finally, the NAWC weapons division  provided its business financial management community with tools to give  them the capability to better manage carryover. For example, one tool  provided the business financial managers (BFM) with the capability to  compare planned carryover data to actual carryover data for individual  orders and at the summary level on a weekly basis to determine if actual  carryover may exceed the carryover ceiling at year end. If actual carryover  may exceed the ceiling at year end, the weapons division can use the tool  to identify problems\u2014such as a significant delay in a major program\u2019s  start date\u2014and begin working on solutions to mitigate them. Even with  these stronger management controls over new orders and the increased  efforts to validate old accounts, NAWC\u2019s reports showed that it still  exceeded the carryover ceiling in fiscal year 2005 by $51.7 million.

NAWC  officials informed us that they continued to emphasize the management of  carryover during fiscal year 2006 by reviewing orders and issuing  additional guidance. Key elements of this guidance include the following.", "The aircraft division issued additional carryover guidance in September  2006 to reiterate several requirements cited in fiscal year 2005.  Furthermore, an aircraft division official noted that the increased focus  resulting from the prior GAO report recommending that the research and  development subactivity groups report their carryover balances separately  in the Navy\u2019s annual budget encouraged NAWC management to more  closely monitor and manage its carryover.", "The weapons division issued carryover guidance in August 2006, which  continued to stress the reviews of customers\u2019 orders that are financed with  appropriations that are canceling or expiring. The guidance states that  such reviews would (1) improve the quality of the year-end carryover and  (2) validate the records, which is an essential task for accomplishing a  smooth financial conversion to the new Navy ERP system planned for  October 2007. The guidance further provided that funds accepted during  the remainder of the fourth quarter should not negatively impact the  division\u2019s carryover position. Otherwise, the division should notify the  customer that the order cannot be accepted and renegotiate, if possible,  the amount of the order that can be accomplished using the DOD  carryover guidance on outlay rates.", "Furthermore, starting primarily in fiscal year 2005, the aircraft and  weapons divisions began reviewing certain types of orders to validate old  financial records and reduce carryover. According to NAWC aircraft and  weapons division officials, most of these reviews were not done in fiscal  years 2003 and 2004 because of NAWC\u2019s conversion to SIGMA and the  problems, mentioned earlier, it encountered with implementing the system  and the reliability of the data in the system. Some of the reviews  performed by the aircraft or weapons divisions include (1) reviews of  funding documents (orders) citing appropriations that are canceling at  the end of each fiscal year (such reviews have been done since the 1990s),  (2) reviews of funding documents citing accounts that were to expire at  the end of the fiscal year (these reviews started in fiscal year 2005), and  (3) a fiscal year 2006 review of unused funds with work completion dates  of September 30, 2005, and before. According to NAWC officials, these  reviews resulted in correcting millions of dollars in unsupported or  unneeded funds on orders, and greatly improved the reliability of the  financial data. For example, according to a NAWC aircraft division official,  as of August 2005, this division had 14,353 orders that were still open on its  books when it converted to SIGMA in fiscal year 2003. As a result of the  aircraft division\u2019s review of these orders from August 2005 through  November 2006, this number was reduced to 7,053 open orders\u2014a  reduction of about 50 percent\u2014and $10 million of unneeded funds were  removed from its books."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some Customer Orders Were Reduced at Year End, which Artificially Lowered Carryover", "paragraphs": ["While we are encouraged by NAWC\u2019s actions to review and validate its  financial records and better manage its carryover, we identified some  cases where NAWC deobligated millions of dollars of funds at fiscal year  end on orders for work it still planned to perform. NAWC then reobligated  funds at the beginning of the next fiscal year to perform the work. This  action artificially lowered NAWC\u2019s actual year-end carryover balances in  fiscal years 2004 and 2005 that were reported to DOD and congressional  decision makers.

We found a total of $19.5 million  was deobligated at the end of fiscal year 2004 or 2005 and reobligated at  the beginning of the next fiscal year. These actions had the effect of  reducing carryover even though the requirement for the funds still  remained at the time the funds were returned to their customers. We  reported on a similar problem in fiscal year 2003 on our review of the  Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command. The following examples  illustrate the orders that were deobligated at the end of fiscal year 2004 or  2005, which had the effect of reducing reported carryover even though the  requirement for the funds still remained but the work could not be  completed by the end of the fiscal year.", "Aircraft division officials stated that they did not know why adjustments  totaling $10.5 million on 14 orders were made to deobligate customer  funds at the end of fiscal year 2004 or 2005 and why the funds were  reobligated at the beginning of the next fiscal year on these same orders.  They said that lack of documentation, turnover of personnel, and  difficulties implementing SIGMA hindered their ability to determine why  these year-end adjustments were made. For example, from December 1,  2003, to September 23, 2004, the NAWC aircraft division accepted a work  order and related amendments from the Naval Air Systems Command  totaling approximately $2.1 million for engineering support for the CH-53E  helicopter program. Accounting records showed that $404,435 was  deobligated in September 2004\u2014at the end of the fiscal year\u2014and that this  same amount was reobligated 1 month later in October 2004\u2014at the  beginning of the next fiscal year.

The tests were originally scheduled to be completed in  fiscal year 2005, but were delayed into fiscal year 2006 due to weather and  instrumentation problems.

The  NAWC weapons division\u2019s comptroller officials stated that the return of  funds to customers is appropriate when mission support requirements slip  from one fiscal year to the next and the tasking to be accomplished is  severable, as in this case. On September 23, 2005, the U.S. Army Space and  Missile Defense Command issued an amendment to each order  deobligating a total of $4.85 million.

We selected obligations that were old (over 120  days) and did not have any recent financial activity (no activity for at least  1 year) since these obligations were more likely to have unneeded funds  and because a review of these obligations was, therefore, more likely to  identify problems with the triannual review procedures.", "We obtained data on accrued expenditures related to carryover at the end  of fiscal year 2005 and June 2006. From these data, we selected and  analyzed 17 accrued expenditures to determine if the accrued expenditure  balances were correct.

We selected accrued expenditures that were over 1  year old and showed no financial activity for at least 1 year since these  accrued expenditures were more likely to have unneeded funds and  because a review of these orders was, therefore, more likely to identify  problems with the triannual review procedures.", "We performed our work at or obtained information from headquarters  offices of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) and the Assistant  Secretary of the Navy (Financial Management and Comptroller),  Washington, D.C.; the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River,  Maryland; the Naval Air Warfare Center, Aircraft Division, Patuxent River,  Maryland and Lakehurst, New Jersey; and the Naval Air Warfare Center,  Weapons Division, China Lake and Point Mugu, California. To assess the  reliability of the data used in this report, we (1) reviewed and analyzed the  factors used in calculating carryover, (2) analyzed the NAWC aircraft and  weapons divisions\u2019 fiscal years 2003 through 2006 financial statements,   (3) analyzed the NAWC aircraft and weapons divisions\u2019 fiscal year 2006  triannual review confirmation statements, (4) interviewed NAWC officials  knowledgeable about the carryover data, and (5) reviewed obligations and  accrued expenditures to determine if they were adequately supported by  documentation.", "The carryover information in this report was obtained from official Navy  budget and accounting documents. We conducted our work from July 2006  through April 2007 in accordance with U.S. generally accepted government  auditing standards.

For the transactions we reviewed, we determined that the two  divisions did not perform adequate reviews on some of their dormant  obligation and accrued expenditures. If the aircraft and weapons divisions  had performed adequate triannual reviews as required, NAWC could have  significantly improved the reliability of the carryover balances reported to  the Department of Defense (DOD) and congressional defense committees."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "More Effective Reviews of Dormant Obligations Could Result in Better Use of Customer Funds and Reduce Reported Carryover", "paragraphs": ["A key element of the triannual reviews is the requirement to follow up on  all obligations that have been dormant for more than 120 days to  determine if unused funds are still needed. The task is one of the 16 DOD  triannual review requirements and is important because it will facilitate  the (1) identification and recording of work performed on these orders,  thereby reducing NAWC\u2019s reported carryover and, in turn, the likelihood  of customers\u2019 budget cuts; and (2) identification and return of unneeded  funds to customers so that the customers can reuse the funds for other  purposes if they are returned before they expire. Furthermore, this task is  especially important for NAWC as it is scheduled to convert to a new  system\u2014Navy Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)\u2014in October 2007, and  reviewing and validating its records to help ensure they are accurate  before converting to the new system would help ensure a smooth  transition.", "The task of validating obligations to determine if they are still needed is  especially important for NAWC\u2019s aircraft and weapons divisions. NAWC\u2019s  September 30, 2006, report on obligations related to carryover showed that  $252 million was associated with orders received from customers. Our  analysis of the obligation report showed that about $59 million of the $252  million, or 23 percent, was over 120 days old as of September 30, 2006, and  $27 million of the $252 million, or about 11 percent, was over 1 year old.", "As previously discussed, NAWC\u2019s aircraft and weapons divisions did not  perform the required triannual reviews of obligations to determine their  validity prior to fiscal year 2006. Even though the two divisions did not  begin reviewing dormant obligations until fiscal year 2006, both divisions  certified that adequate follow-up was conducted on all dormant  obligations over 120 days old in the January and May 2006 reports.  However, after we began our review, the two divisions did not provide  written confirmation that adequate follow-up reviews of dormant  obligations over 120 days old to determine if they were valid were  conducted in their respective September 2006 reports.", "To identify problems and actions that could be taken to fix these problems  if the NAWC had performed the triannual reviews, we selected and  reviewed 41 outstanding obligations totaling about $4.1 million that were  more than 120 days old and had not had any recent financial activity  (sometimes no activity for years). For the obligations we reviewed, we  determined that the aircraft and weapons divisions did not perform  adequate reviews on some of their obligations. In addition, obligations  were overstated, which means that the year-end carryover for this work  was also overstated by varying amounts for several years. In reviewing the  41 obligations, we found that 14 obligations totaling about $3 million were  valid, and 27 obligations totaling about $1.1 million overstated carryover.  The following provides a breakout of the obligations that overstated  carryover.", "Eight obligations totaling $467,786 were for work that had been performed  but (1) no payments had been made to liquidate the obligations and (2) no  accrued expenditures were recorded for the work that was performed.", "Eleven obligations totaling $273,628 had no work completed on them or  NAWC was in the process of deobligating the funds.", "Ten obligations totaling $312,727 were for work that had been performed  and paid for but (1) the payment had either not been correctly recorded or  matched to the obligations in order to liquidate the obligations and (2) no  accrued expenditures were recorded for the work performed.", "The following are some examples of the problems we identified with the  dormant obligations that we reviewed.", "In March 2004, the NAWC aircraft division obligated $172,552 for the  inspection of flight test propellers. Since May 2004, no financial activity  occurred for this obligation (such as payments made or accrued  expenditures recorded for work performed). According to NAWC aircraft  division officials, the accounting department reviewed this obligation prior  to our visit and confirmed that this appeared to be a valid outstanding  obligation since they had not received a bill for this work. As part of our  review, we requested that the business financial manager (BFM) review  the status of the dormant obligation. Further research performed by the  BFM disclosed that while the work had been completed by July 15, 2004,  the vendor had not submitted a bill. At the time we performed our work,  the NAWC aircraft division was in the process of paying the contractor  and liquidating the obligation. If the triannual review had been effectively  performed, this problem could have been identified years earlier and  NAWC could have reduced its year-end obligations and carryover by  $172,552 for fiscal years 2004, 2005, and 2006.", "In February 2004, the NAWC aircraft division obligated $25,000 for ship  installation drawings for an aircraft carrier. Since that time, no financial  activity had occurred. Due to a schedule change regarding the availability  of the aircraft carrier, the shipyard was unable to gain access to the ship in  order to develop the technical drawings. Consequently, the NAWC aircraft  division was unable to perform the work and use the funds. NAWC  officials agreed that this obligation should have been closed out several  years ago and the funds returned to the customer. According to these  officials, they did not review this obligation as part of the division\u2019s  triannual review because they lacked the time and resources to review all  transactions below $50,000. As a result of not deobligating the funds from  the records, the NAWC aircraft division overstated its reported year-end  obligations and carryover by $25,000 for fiscal years 2004, 2005, and 2006.", "In fiscal year 2002, the NAWC weapons division obligated $30,000 for  updating electronic software in EP-3 planes. As of September 2006, the  weapons division\u2019s accounting records showed that $22,798 of the  obligation remained on the accounting records. As part of our review of  NAWC carryover, we requested that the BFM review the status of this  dormant obligation. The BFM found that (1) the work was completed in  2002, (2) the contractor processed about $18,986 in invoices but only  $7,305 in invoices were recorded as being paid, and (3) about $11,014 of  the original $30,000 was not used by the contractor. The BFM agreed that  the accounting records were in error and, as a result of our inquiry, NAWC  weapons division officials are researching the invoice difference of  $11,681 ($18,986 less $7,305) and plan to return the remaining unused  amount of $11,014 to the customer. As a result of this failure to match  invoices with the obligation and revert unused funds back to the customer  in a timely manner, the NAWC weapons division overstated reported year- end obligations and carryover by $22,798 in fiscal years 2003, 2004, 2005,  and 2006 while also precluding the customer from using some of these  funds for some other purpose because the funds had expired."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "More Effective Reviews of Dormant Accrued Expenditures Could Improve Reliability of Reported Carryover", "paragraphs": ["At the conclusion of their triannual reviews, fund holders are required to  provide written confirmation that they have conducted adequate research  on all accrued expenditures that are more than 120 days old to determine  if they are valid. This task is important because  large accrued expenditures balances in general, and large dormant  accrued expenditure balances in particular, can indicate either serious  accounting problems or ineffective procedures for developing accrued  expenditure schedules; and    accrued expenditures reduce reported carryover balances, and overly  optimistic accrued expenditures can, therefore, cause reported carryover  to be understated.", "The task of validating accrued expenditures is especially important for the  aircraft and weapons divisions because NAWC\u2019s report on accrued  expenditures related to carryover showed that it had about $138 million of  accrued expenditures as of June 30, 2006, that were associated with orders  received from customers over the years. Accurately accounting for  accrued expenditures is important from a carryover standpoint since  NAWC recognizes revenue and bills customers based on accrued  expenditures. The Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller)  has also recognized the importance of accrued expenditures in its review  of Navy working capital fund activities. During its review of the Navy\u2019s  working capital fund research and development fiscal year 2008 budget,  the Comptroller\u2019s Office questioned the large amount of recorded accrued  expenditures. As a result, the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense  (Comptroller) reduced the Navy\u2019s working capital fund research and  development fiscal year 2008 budget for three research and development  subactivity groups, including NAWC, by $214.7 million.", "Our analysis of NAWC\u2019s accrued expenditures report showed that about  $85 million of the $138 million of accrued expenditures, or 62 percent,  were over 120 days old as of June 30, 2006. Further, $45 million of the $138  million, or about one-third of the reported accrued expenditures, were  over 1 year old. NAWC officials informed us that when NAWC  implemented SIGMA in fiscal year 2003, the system did not produce an  accrued expenditure report. Since the new system did not produce a  report, the NAWC aircraft division designed and developed its own  accrued expenditure report. The first report was issued in September  2005\u2014over 2 years after the implementation of the new system. As a  result, comprehensive reviews of accrued expenditures were not  performed for fiscal years 2003, 2004, and 2005. The two divisions began  performing reviews of accrued expenditures during fiscal year 2006 but  they did not have any written procedures for such reviews. The following  summarizes the fiscal year 2006 results.", "The aircraft division provided written confirmation that adequate follow- up was conducted on all dormant accrued expenditures over 120 days old  in its January, May, and September 2006 triannual review reports. Our  analysis of the aircraft division\u2019s accrued expenditure report as of June  2006 showed that $70 million of the $113 million of the accrued  expenditures\u2014or 62 percent\u2014were over 120 days old and about $35  million of the $113 million, or 31 percent, were over 1 year old.", "The weapons division provided written confirmation that adequate follow- up was performed in its January and May 2006 reports but it did not  provide written confirmation that adequate follow-up reviews were done  of dormant accrued expenditures over 120 days old in its September 2006  report. Our analysis of the weapons division\u2019s accrued expenditure report  as of June 2006 showed that $14.7 million of the $24.5 million of the  accrued expenditures\u2014or 60 percent\u2014were over 120 days old and $10.6  million of the $24.5 million, or 43 percent, were over 1 year old.", "To identify problems and actions that could be taken to fix these problems  if the NAWC had performed the triannual reviews, we selected and  reviewed 17 accrued expenditures totaling about $4.4 million that were  over 1 year old as of June 30, 2006, and did not have any recent financial  activity (sometimes no activity for years). Since accrued expenditures  represent the amount of paid and unpaid expenditures for services  performed by employees or contractors, accrued expenditures that remain  outstanding for long periods of time are an indication of a potential  problem with the accuracy of recorded accrued expenditure data because  the work should have already been performed and payment made. In most  of the cases we reviewed, we determined that the aircraft and weapons  divisions did not perform adequate reviews of their accrued expenditures.  Specifically, we found that    no work was performed on 10 accrued expenditures totaling about $2.2  million (about half the dollar amount reviewed);   work was performed for 4 accrued expenditures totaling about $1 million  and while the contractor had billed NAWC, the payment was not correctly  recorded in the accounting system to liquidate the accrued expenditure; for 4 accrued expenditures totaling about $1 million, the accrued  expenditures were so old that neither we nor NAWC officials could  determine their status; and   documentation for 2 accrued expenditures totaling about $100,000 showed  they were correctly recorded.", "The following are examples of the problems we identified with the  accrued expenditures that we reviewed including their impact on reported  NAWC carryover balances.", "On July 7, 2003, the NAWC weapons division obligated $232,318 on a  contract with Northrop Grumman Field Support Services to provide  engineering services in support of the F-14 Weapons System Support  Activity. On September 29, 2003, the weapons division recorded an  accrued expenditure in its system totaling $201,651\u2014the balance  remaining unpaid to the contractor that was obligated in fiscal year 2003.  As part of the weapons division\u2019s May 2006 triannual review, the BFM that  had responsibility for this contract determined that the accrued  expenditure recorded in fiscal year 2003 was unsupported. NAWC  weapons division officials stated that the final invoice for this contract  was processed on September 20, 2006. In October 2006, the administrative  contracting officer issued an amendment to the contract that deobligated  these funds which had expired. One month later, the weapons division  reversed the accrued expenditure and returned the funds to its customer.  As a result of the erroneous accrued expenditure, our analysis showed  that the weapons division understated its carryover in fiscal years 2003,  2004, 2005, and 2006 by $201,651 and billed its customer for work that was  not performed.", "As of March 2002, the NAWC aircraft division obligated $226,901 on an  order with Northrop Grumman to provide engineering design data  services. In fiscal year 2003, the contractor billed and received payment of  $5,626, leaving a remaining balance of $221,275. Our analysis of the aircraft  division\u2019s June 2006 accrued expenditure report indicated that the aircraft  division recorded accrued expenditures in its accounting system for  $221,275\u2014the outstanding balance\u2014over 3\u00bd years ago. Although no  further work was performed on this order, the accrued expenditure of  $221,275 remained outstanding until August 2006. In August 2006, NAWC  reversed the remaining accrued expenditure of $221,275 and deobligated  the funds because the customer appropriation financing the order was  canceling at the end of the fiscal year. By not performing the triannual  reviews prior to fiscal year 2006 which would have identified this problem,  the aircraft division recognized revenue and billed its customer $221,275  for work that was not performed and understated its carryover by this  amount in fiscal years 2003, 2004, and 2005.", "In March 1996, the NAWC weapons division issued an order to the  Electronic Proving Ground totaling $333,000 to provide funding for Global  Positioning System test support.

In February 1997, a  payment totaling $123,195 was processed against these funds. The  remaining accrued expenditure amount ($209,805) has been outstanding  since it was recorded in 1996. These transactions were recorded in a  financial management system that has been replaced twice. Many details  associated with these transactions are no longer available. Because of the  limited data available, we could not determine the validity of the accrued  expenditure amount. However, if the weapons division had performed the  triannual reviews as required by DOD regulation, the records may have  been available to either reverse the outstanding accrued expenditure  amount or liquidate the accrued expenditure amount against vendor  payments.", "In July 2003, the NAWC aircraft division increased funding on a task order  by $126,477 to provide software support services for the Navy\u2019s HE-2K  aircraft tactical systems program. In July 2004, the NAWC aircraft division  recorded an accrued expenditure in its accounting system totaling  $126,477\u2014the entire balance for the software support services to be  performed. According to a BFM, the work for the software support  services was never performed. In January 2006, an amendment to this task  order decreased excess funds for the entire $126,477 that was previously  obligated for the additional software support services. However, the  NAWC aircraft division did not reverse the accrued expenditure until  August 2006\u2014about 2 years after it had recorded the accrued expenditure.  As a result, we determined that the NAWC aircraft division recognized  revenue and billed its customers $126,477 for work that was not performed  and understated its carryover by this amount in fiscal years 2003, 2004, and  2005.", "Between March 1997 and April 1998, the NAWC weapons division issued  an order and three amendments totaling $505,000 to the 46th test group at  Holloman Air Force Base for work on the radar cross section of the QF-4E  range targets.

Thus, an accrued expenditure totaling approximately  $353,926 remains outstanding. If the NAWC weapons division had  performed its triannual review as required by DOD regulation, the  weapons division could have reduced its end of fiscal year outstanding  accrued expenditures by $353,926 for fiscal years 2001 through 2006.
