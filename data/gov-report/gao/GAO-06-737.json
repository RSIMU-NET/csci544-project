At various times, we received estimates ranging from 66,000 to 69,000 American and non-American personnel. In addition, State estimated that there are approximately 78,000 U.S. government positions overseas, as of December 2005. State Department (State) officials said that they are working on a unified database which, if periodically updated by posts, will provide an accurate depiction of the overseas presence. State officials indicated that the database will be completed later this year. Because of the importance of having accurate data on overseas staffing and the length of time it has taken to develop this data, management oversight may be needed to ensure completion of this task. Several agencies reported that they have added staff overseas as a result of new mission requirements, and other agencies reported that they have repositioned their personnel to better meet mission needs and in response to rightsizing efforts. State established the congressionally mandated Office of Rightsizing the United States Government Overseas Presence (Office of Rightsizing) in 2004, which, after a slow start, has begun to provide overall direction to the government-wide rightsizing process. Some of the office's activities have included coordinating staffing requests of U.S. government agencies, developing guidance for and analyzing post rightsizing reviews, and formulating a rightsizing review plan. We found that coordination on rightsizing issues between State and other agencies with an overseas presence was initially slow, but has since improved. Nevertheless, non-State agencies have voiced a number of concerns regarding their interaction with the Office of Rightsizing, including their desire to be more included in the rightsizing process. Congress requires Chiefs of Mission to conduct rightsizing reviews at every overseas post at least once every 5 years. Between late 2004 and summer 2005, about 35 posts participated in the first cycle of reviews. However, the Office of Rightsizing provided limited guidance to posts on how the reviews should be conducted and did not have a systematic process for reporting the outcomes of the reviews. In fall 2005, officials in the Office of Rightsizing developed more comprehensive guidance, which posts we interviewed found useful. We found that cost was not considered a key element in the post reviews. Nevertheless, the Office of Rightsizing reported over $150 million in cost savings or avoidance to the U.S. government based on its analysis of these reviews. Although we have not been able to independently assess the Office of Rightsizing's estimates, it has presented evidence to show that some major cost avoidance and cost savings have occurred. Management officers identified various challenges to the review process, such as resistance from non-State agencies and a lack of time to conduct the review. It is unclear how posts will implement the rightsizing review decisions, such as elimination of duplicative functions, according to post officials and officials in State's regional bureaus."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["After the 1998 terrorist attacks on two U.S. embassies in Africa, two key  studies recommended that the U.S. government evaluate and realign the  number and location of U.S. personnel working at embassies and  consulates overseas, and consider staff reductions where practical to  reduce security vulnerabilities. In 2001, the administration showed its  support for the realignment of personnel and stressed the importance of  security, efficiency, and accountability in U.S. government staffing overseas  by identifying the rightsizing of embassies and consulates as one of the  President\u2019s management priorities. Rightsizing initiatives include  establishing mechanisms and processes to align the number and location of  staff assigned overseas with foreign policy priorities, and security and cost  constraints; moving administrative functions away from posts to remote  locations; and eliminating duplicative functions at posts. In 2002 we  developed a framework for assessing embassy staff levels to help support  rightsizing initiatives for existing facilities overseas. Our framework  identified critical elements of embassy operations\u2014physical security,  mission priorities and requirements, and cost\u2014and also included  rightsizing options for consideration. According to the State Department\u2019s  (State) Office of Inspector General, rightsizing is likely to remain at the top  of State\u2019s management agenda in the coming years because of high  construction and operating costs overseas, security vulnerabilities, and  continuing problems in assigning U.S. government personnel overseas.", "Over the past five years, we have provided the subcommittee with  numerous reports and testimonies on staffing and operations at U.S.  embassies and consulates overseas (see app. II for a list of these reports).

In addition to the databases from Washington,  D.C., posts have created their own databases, resulting in information not  being uniform from post to post. Moreover, a State official reported that  some agencies have failed to provide human resources data to individual  posts.

Officials with whom we spoke with  at several agencies said that they have increased staff overseas as a result  of the global war on terror, border security activities, and efforts to combat  drug trafficking and weapons of mass destruction. For example, officials in  the Department of Justice said that the department\u2019s various components  have increased their overseas presence due to these factors, and, in fact,  U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration officials reported that they  increased their presence by almost 10 percent between 2000 and 2005. In  addition, Customs and Border Protection officials told us that they have  been increasing their personnel overseas since 2002 due to requirements  for the Container Security Initiative program. While a number of agencies  have been increasing their presence overseas, a few agencies have  decreased or are projected to maintain the current level of their overseas  presence due to cuts in program budgets. For example, the Foreign  Commercial Service reported that it reduced its overseas staffing levels by  approximately 13 percent since the beginning of fiscal year 2001. In  addition, Foreign Agricultural Services officials said that their overseas  presence is likely to remain static.", "A number of agencies we spoke with cited that costs of overseas  operations, which include increasing Capital Security Cost Sharing  program and ICASS costs, have caused them to examine their overseas  presence. Department of Commerce officials reported that, while Capital  Security Cost Sharing costs represented 7 percent of their overseas costs in  fiscal year 2006, by fiscal year 2009 the cost is expected to be 21 percent of  the agency\u2019s overseas costs. In addition, agency officials said that, because  the Capital Security Cost Sharing costs are based on every existing or  planned authorized overseas position, regardless of whether the position is  filled or not, agencies have effectively been encouraged to eliminate vacant  positions or keep their projected numbers low. For example, Department  of Commerce officials said that costs associated with Capital Security Cost  Sharing has forced the agency to keep its projected overseas numbers low  rather than develop more realistic projections since program costs are  based in part on projected as well as existing staffing numbers, and they do  not want to estimate and pay for positions that might not be needed in the  future. Some agency officials also indicated that rising ICASS costs have  affected their budgets and caused them to reevaluate their overseas  presence. For example, Department of Homeland Security officials said  that because of the high costs of using ICASS, they are currently  reevaluating their use of the services and stressed the importance of having  flexibility to opt out of ICASS services.", "Some agency officials with whom we spoke raised several concerns about  the impacts of Capital Security Cost Sharing and ICASS costs on staffing  configurations. For Capital Security Cost Sharing, officials expressed  concern that it is difficult for them to accurately project their overseas  staffing numbers, since potential unforeseen events overseas, such as  natural disasters, could necessitate a reduction or increase in personnel.  Some agency officials expressed concern that, as the Capital Security Cost  Sharing costs increase, they might be priced out of an overseas presence or  have to tap into their program funds to sustain such a presence. Table 2  depicts the Capital Security Cost Sharing charges for fiscal year 2007 that  appear in the President\u2019s budget for the agencies that we spoke with.", "Moreover, in order to mitigate the effects of ICASS fees coupled with  agency budget cuts, some agency officials indicated that officials overseas  are doing more administrative activities themselves, which takes time away  from accomplishing their mission. In addition, agencies have sought other  cost-effective ways of operating overseas, including hiring family members  of staff, hiring local Americans, or utilizing locally employed staff (this final  option has limitations, however). For example, according to the U.S.  Marshals Service, utilizing locally employed staff over U.S. direct hires has  resulted in considerable savings to the agency, and it estimates that the  savings in relocation expenses, foreign housing, and other foreign  entitlements, which direct hires receive but locally employed staff do not,  would exceed $1 million every 3\u20134 years. However, agency officials  indicated that there are limitations to using locally employed staff at posts  to carry out some duties due to national security concerns. For example,  Department of the Treasury officials said that they are not able to utilize  locally hired foreign nationals to carry out the work of U.S. direct hires due  to the sensitive investigative nature of their work and privacy laws. In  addition, officials in the Departments of Homeland Security and Justice  indicated that, due to the sensitive nature of their work, they can only allow  American citizens with a security clearance to perform most of their  overseas duties. As an alternative to sending additional U.S. direct hires to  posts, some agencies employ eligible family members of agency staff or  hire U.S. citizens already living in the host country to carry out some of the  agency functions. Department of Homeland Security officials explained  that utilizing U.S. citizens living in the host country is much cheaper than  sending a U.S. direct hire to a post because the department does not have  to pay benefits such as housing, school costs, and other allowances to  locally hired U.S. citizens."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "State Has Established an Office of Rightsizing, but More Interaction Needed between Office of Rightsizing and Agencies", "paragraphs": ["In early 2004, State established the congressionally mandated Office of  Rightsizing to primarily coordinate all agency staffing requests, administer  rightsizing and staffing reviews, and work with State entities and other  agencies on rightsizing.

The office identified many of the removed desk positions in  cooperation with posts and regional bureaus. According to the Office of  Rightsizing, these desks represent significant partially or fully avoided  costs. Of the 145 reduced positions, 50 were U.S. direct hires.

For example, the information  presented within the reports varied from post to post, and the rightsizing  elements that the posts evaluated and reported were not consistent. Some  posts provided narratives discussing various rightsizing elements, such as  outsourcing and post security, while other posts did not. Furthermore, we  found that none of the posts showed that they had conducted a cost  analysis as part of the post\u2019s rightsizing efforts. In addition, we found that  the Office of Rightsizing did not have a systematic process to quantify costs  saved or avoided as a result of post staffing reductions stemming from  reviews in the spring 2005 cycle. The Director of the Office of Rightsizing  agreed that the office needs to implement a systematic process of  collecting data and determining cost savings and cost avoidance for future  rightsizing cycles, and has asked the rightsizing analysts in the office to  document the positions that are eliminated or costs saved due to posts  taking rightsizing measures into consideration. Finally, we also found that,  although the goal of the President\u2019s Management Agenda and the Office of  Rightsizing is to limit the overseas presence to the minimum level  necessary to accomplish the U.S. government\u2019s mission, overseas staffing is  increasing. Our analysis of the 20 reviews from the spring 2005 cycle  revealed that net staffing numbers will increase for 15 posts. Increased  levels in staffing abroad can be attributed to high-priority national security  interests, such as the global war on terror, anti-narcotics efforts, and  HIV/AIDS projects, which have implications on U.S. staffing and space at  posts abroad, according to the Office of Rightsizing as well as post  management officers.", "The Director of the Office of Rightsizing agreed that the first round of  reviews was not conducted systematically, and said that the process and  format has evolved since the initial guidance was provided to posts for the  spring 2005 cycle.

All  management officers that we interviewed at 20 posts which had conducted  a review as part of the second cycle in fall 2005 stated that the guidance  was either very useful or moderately useful, and several commented that  the guidance was clear, succinct, and easy to discern.

For  example, a management officer posted in Eurasia stated that the review  was an interesting and useful process, which helped the post focus on parts  of the Mission Performance Plan that they would otherwise not have  concentrated their efforts on. The Office of Rightsizing reported over $100  million in costs saved or avoided to the U.S. government based on their  analysis of the fall 2005 cycle of reviews. The estimate was based on an  analysis that the Office of Rightsizing conducted of post reviews  representing 21 missions. According to the office, its rightsizing efforts for  the fall 2005 cycle will result in a potential reduction of 683 total desk  spaces in new embassy compounds, of which 170 are U.S. direct hires. The  Office of Rightsizing estimated that each eliminated U.S. direct-hire  position would result in a cost avoidance of about $400,000. The actual cost  avoidance achieved will depend upon whether offsetting costs can be  avoided and whether recommended staff reductions are implemented. In  addition, the Office of Rightsizing reported that the rightsizing actions for  the fall 2005 cycle have resulted in approximately $90 million in savings to  the Bureau of Overseas Buildings Operations in capital security  construction costs, which includes cost saved by not needing to build four  annexes.

Management officers said that their posts did not participate because,  among other reasons, they did not find it necessary; other posts did not  have the technological capabilities to participate. Moreover, several posts  did not participate in a digital video conference because officials did not  think that the Office of Rightsizing required it. Nonetheless, the Director of  the Office of Rightsizing stated that he found that those posts that took  advantage of this option had more success with their rightsizing reviews;  thus, starting with the spring 2006 cycle, the office will require that every  post participate in a conference. He also stated that he hopes other non- State agencies will participate in video conferences as posts conduct their  rightsizing reviews. Moreover, State, as well as the Office of Management  and Budget, expects all agencies at each post to understand that rightsizing  is government-wide and not just a State-oriented process.

Consolidation of services proved to be a common challenge at posts, as 14  of the 20 management officers we interviewed identified duplication of  post services or programs, such as motor pool and cashiering, as a result of  the rightsizing review. Although these posts have identified duplicative  services or programs, 10 of 20 management officers stated that the post has  not taken action on consolidating the services and programs.

According to an official in the Bureau of Overseas Buildings  Operations, it is important for posts to have an implementation plan of how  they will reconfigure their staffing, particularly for those posts that will be  moving into a new embassy compound, because the new embassy or  consulate will be built based on the staffing numbers approved by the  Office of Rightsizing for that post."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["Progress has been made in implementing the President's Management  Agenda initiative to rightsize the U.S. government\u2019s overseas presence at  embassies and consulates.

Moreover, after a slow start,  State\u2019s Office of Rightsizing is beginning to achieve momentum in  coordinating government-wide rightsizing efforts. However, more needs to  be done. Of foremost importance is the need to develop accurate staffing  data with which to measure staffing trends and the effects of rightsizing  activities. We recognize that efforts are currently under way to develop  accurate data; however because of the importance of having accurate data  on overseas staffing and the length of time it has taken to develop this data,  management oversight may be needed to ensure completion of this task.

In addition, we spoke with an official in the Office of  Management and Budget to determine the methodology used to report the  size and cost of the overseas presence. To determine the U.S. government\u2019s  efforts to rightsize its overseas presence we spoke with officials at a  number of agencies in Washington, D.C., that have a presence at overseas  posts. We spoke with officials from the the Departments of Agriculture,  Commerce, the Treasury, Defense, Homeland Security, and Justice; as well  as officials from the General Services Administration and the U.S. Agency  for International Development.

We also spoke with  officials in each State regional bureau\u2014Western Hemisphere Affairs,  European and Eurasian Affairs, African Affairs, East Asian and Pacific  Affairs, Near Eastern Affairs, and South and Central Asian Affairs\u2014to  gauge their involvement with post rightsizing reviews and their interaction  with the Office of Rightsizing. In addition, we spoke with officials in State\u2019s  Office of Global Support Services and Innovation about State\u2019s initiatives  on regionalization and shared services. To determine costs saved or  avoided as a result of rightsizing exercises, we reviewed cost data from  State\u2019s Office of Rightsizing and the Bureau of Overseas Buildings  Operations. To assess the reliability of State\u2019s data, we interviewed officials  in the Office of Rightsizing and the Bureau of Overseas Buildings  Operations to ascertain how the data were captured and analyzed and  whether there were any limitations to the data.

However, we analyzed only those reviews for which we  had received both the post rightsizing review as well as the corresponding  analysis of the review conducted by the Office of Rightsizing. Between  February 2006 and March 2006 we administered 20 structured interviews  regarding post rightsizing review experiences. The interviews were  conducted by telephone primarily with management counselors or officers  at embassies. In one case we spoke with the Deputy Chief of Mission at the  post. The interviews involved 20 of the 22 posts that were part of the fall  2005 cycle and which had completed their rightsizing reviews by the time  we talked to the post. The posts were located in: Asuncion, Baku, Bandar  Seri Begawan, Bucharest, Bujumbura, Colombo, Harare, Jakarta,  Islamabad, Kiev, Warsaw, Maputo, N\u2019djamena, Pretoria, Reykjavik, Rome,  Santo Domingo, Moscow, Taipei, and Tunis.

We developed the interview questions based on our review of  rightsizing documentation and discussions with post officials during our  fieldwork in Mexico City and Valletta. We provided an early version of the  questions to the Office of Rightsizing and the Office of Global Support  Services and Innovation for their review and comment, and we also  pretested the interview with three current management officers to ensure  that the questions were clear and could be answered. We modified the  interview questions on the basis of the pretest results and an internal  expert\u2019s technical review. We provided the management officers and  Deputy Chief of Mission with the interview questions in advance to allow  them time to gather any data or information necessary for the interview. We  initiated follow-up discussions with 13 posts by telephone. We  subsequently sent posts follow-up questions by E-mail if we were not able  to reach them by telephone.

We chose these posts because  both Mexico City and Valletta had been asked by the Office of Rightsizing  to conduct a rightsizing review as part of the spring 2005 cycle. We chose to  visit Frankfurt because the consulate had conducted an informal  rightsizing exercise in response to a report from State\u2019s Office of Inspector  General and because it is a regional hub in Europe. At each post we met  with State officials as well as other agency officials involved in the  rightsizing process to discuss their approach and outcomes of the review.  In addition, we met with the Ambassadors in Mexico City and Valletta, as  well as the Consul General in Frankfurt to understand their views and  involvement in the rightsizing process.", "We conducted

We modified our text to show that, although we have not been able to  independently assess the Office of Rightsizing\u2019s estimates, it has  presented evidence to show that some major cost avoidance and cost  savings have occurred. 2. We recognize that State has a standard methodology by which it  performs cost analyses using the International Cooperative  Administrative Support Services software. However, when we talked  with management officers at posts that had conducted a rightsizing  review, we were informed that these posts did not have comparable  cost data for each service provider. In addition, we were informed that  the posts did not have the necessary tools to make informed decisions  about how to conduct analysis to determine the most cost effective  service provider. 3. We provided the draft report to State on May 18, 2006. About two weeks  later, State instructed posts to develop implementation action plans. We  believe that the action that the Office of Rightsizing has taken largely  addresses our recommendation. However, until the Office of  Rightsizing has received all implementation action plans with the posts\u2019  milestones, due on July 18, 2006, the office will not know what  additional action might still be needed to ensure that posts meet the  agreed-upon outcomes of their rightsizing reviews. 4. We understand that if a position is eliminated at a post it is not counted  as part of Capital Security Cost Sharing. Our statement was simply  meant to illustrate that eliminated or vacant positions could be  reflected in databases used to count overseas staffing numbers. 5. Our statement reflects non-State agency views. We have amended the  draft by attributing the statement to non-State agency officials. In  addition our statement reflects information we obtained from a  February 2006 State cable to all posts about staffing data and position  charges under Capital Security Cost Sharing.  6. We have modified our text to illustrate the varying estimates of the size  of the U.S. overseas presence. We have received numerous conflicting  estimates on the number of U.S. government officials overseas. One  source estimated that there are approximately 66,000 U.S. government  personnel under chief of mission authority, while another indicated that  there are approximately 69,000. We understand that some of the  numbers may come from different estimates and data sources. State\u2019s  discussion on staffing data illustrates the difficulty of obtaining an  accurate count of overseas personnel. We recognize that that there are  vacant positions and that the total number of positions is higher than  the number of filled positions. We also note in our report that State is in  the process of eliminating vacant positions. It is important that State  continue to update its staffing database to ensure that a more accurate  accounting of U.S. government personnel overseas is available.  7. We acknowledge that State has sent several messages since 2004 to  posts instructing them that Post Personnel is the official database for  documenting all U.S. government staffing overseas. However, in  February 2006, State reported that not all posts are using Post  Personnel as their main human resources system. In addition, we were  told that the guidance provided to posts did not include accountability  mechanisms for ensuring that the staffing information is updated and  complete.", "8.", "It is important that all components of each agency receive information  from the Office of Rightsizing that pertains to rightsizing review efforts  and initiatives.

The Department of Homeland  Security and the Office of Rightsizing share responsibility in ensuring  that agency components are receiving the necessary information to  ensure that rightsizing efforts are understood. We have modified the  text to indicate that the Office of Rightsizing was asked by the  Department of Homeland Security to coordinate through one focal  point. 9. We believe that the actions and measures that the Office of Rightsizing  is taking, particularly the Interagency Rightsizing Summit, are useful  steps to implementing our recommendation.
