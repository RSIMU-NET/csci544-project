Reaffirmation agreements between debtors and creditors are required, by law, to formally disclose to debtors the terms of the agreement, such as the amount of debt reaffirmed. Some requirements differ for credit unions, such as an exemption for reporting debtor financial information when the debtor's attorney signs the agreement. The Reform Act required GAO to study the bankruptcy reaffirmation process. This report discusses (1) the extent to which required Reform Act disclosures and other information have been incorporated into reaffirmation agreements, (2) the types of debts reaffirmed and the percent this debt comprised of debtors' overall debt burden, and (3) how reaffirmed and original interest rates compare. GAO reviewed a representative sample of bankruptcy files with agreements in five bankruptcy courts (in AL, CA, IL, TX, and WV) selected by, among other things, filing volume and geographic dispersion. Estimates from our sample cannot be generalized to all bankruptcy courts, but can be generalized to each of the selected bankruptcy courts."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Most reaffirmation agreements across the five districts included Reform Act disclosure statements and other required information. For example, for the five districts, the required disclosure statement for the \"Annual Percentage Rate\" was included in an estimated 86 to 97 percent of agreements and the disclosure statement for the \"Amount Reaffirmed\" and the amount was included in an estimated 87 to 98 percent of agreements. We also estimate that, for the five districts, 67 to 88 percent of non-credit union agreements included monthly income, expense, and net income information--conversely, 12 to 33 percent were missing this information. This information helps to inform debtors, debtor attorneys, creditors, and court officials of the potential inability of the debtor to make payment on reaffirmed debt. In May 2007, a federal judiciary advisory committee proposed the use of a reaffirmation agreement coversheet that, if approved, would make it mandatory for debtors to provide required financial information to determine an undue hardship. If approved, the coversheet would appear to address the issue of missing financial information. For the five districts, debts secured by assets, such as an automobile, were the most frequently reaffirmed type of debt--comprising an estimated 90 percent or more of all reaffirmations. Unsecured debt--such as credit card debt--was reaffirmed infrequently in reaffirmation agreements, occurring in an estimated 2 percent to 10 percent among all agreements in the five districts. For the five districts, we estimate that in approximately two-thirds of cases the reaffirmed debt burden comprised 25 percent or less of the debtors' total debts. In those cases where an original interest rate was provided, rates on reaffirmed debt were generally less than or equal to the original rate. Specifically, the interest rates were equal to the original rate in an estimated 56 to 84 percent of reaffirmed debts for the five districts, less than the original rate for 10 to 44 percent of debts, and greater in 0 to 8 percent of debts. (The margin of error for these estimates is at most plus or minus 16 percent at the 95 percent confidence level.)"]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Individuals may file for personal bankruptcy in federal bankruptcy courts  to reduce their debts by having their eligible debts discharged by the  bankruptcy court. Bankruptcy filers may voluntarily reaffirm\u2014that is,  agree to pay\u2014certain debts with creditor firms in an effort to retain  assets. Debtors may, for example, be motivated to reaffirm one or more  debts through a reaffirmation agreement with a creditor to retain an asset  that secures a debt, such as an automobile, home, or household good that  otherwise would likely have to be surrendered to the creditor if the debtor  did not reaffirm the debt. A debtor may also choose to reaffirm a debt that  is not secured by an asset, such as credit card debt or a line of credit from  a bank. In the late 1990s, several reports, including a 1997 National  Bankruptcy Review Commission report, expressed concern over  questionable practices that may have led some individuals filing for  bankruptcy to take actions that were not in their best interests\u2014by  entering, for example, into agreements with creditors that were financially  burdensome.", "Between 2001 and 2004, an average of more than 1.5 million people  annually filed for personal bankruptcy protection. In April 2005, the  Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005  (referred to in this report as the Reform Act) was enacted and contained  provisions designed to better inform debtors and assist them in making  decisions about reaffirming debt. Under the Reform Act, a reaffirmation  agreement is required to contain specified disclosure statements that,  among other things, are designed to inform debtors of the terms of the  reaffirmation agreement as well as the debtor\u2019s rights and responsibilities.  For example, the amount reaffirmed and the annual percentage rate for  that amount must be conspicuously disclosed in the agreement.  Statements, among other prescribed narratives, must also be included to  inform debtors of their right to rescind a reaffirmation agreement within a  certain time period and that the debtor or creditor must file the agreement  with the court. The required disclosure statements are designed to help  ensure that debtors make decisions about reaffirming a debt that are in  their best interests.", "The Reform Act required that GAO study the bankruptcy reaffirmation  agreement process. This report addresses the following questions  regarding reaffirmation agreements in cases filed over a 1 year period  beginning October 17, 2005, when the reaffirmation provisions of the  Reform Act took effect:  1.  To what extent have required Reform Act disclosure statements and  other required information (such as the annual percentage rate for the  reaffirmed debt) been incorporated into reaffirmation agreements?  2.  What types of debts were reaffirmed and to what extent did reaffirmed  debt amounts comprise debtors\u2019 overall debt burden when they filed  for bankruptcy?  3.  How did the reaffirmed and original interest rates compare?", "To answer these questions, we reviewed a representative sample of  bankruptcy case files with reaffirmation agreements in each of five district  bankruptcy courts: Alabama Northern (AL-N), California Central (CA-C),  Illinois Northern (IL-N), Texas Northern (TX-N), and West Virginia  Southern (WV-S). The districts were selected based on the following  criteria: a range of filing volume, proportion of Chapter 7 filings within the  bankruptcy courts, whether cases were overseen by the U.S. Trustee  Program or the Bankruptcy Administrator program, and courts in  dispersed geographic locations. From January 1, 2001, to June 30, 2006, the  average quarterly filing volume for the nation\u2019s 90 district bankruptcy  courts was 385,424. The five districts we selected collectively represented  about 12 percent of those average quarterly filings. When determining  which districts to include in our study, we selected the 2001 to 2006 time  period to gather sufficient historical filing data to determine the average  number of filings each district had over time. Each sample of cases within  these districts was selected from the universe of cases that were filed in  the five districts between October 17, 2005, and October 17, 2006\u2014the first  year the Reform Act\u2019s reaffirmation provisions were in effect\u2014and also  contained at least one reaffirmation agreement. Each universe of cases  with at least one reaffirmation agreement was drawn from a database  maintained by the bankruptcy courts. We determined that these data were  sufficiently reliable to develop the universe of cases for each of the five  district bankruptcy courts from which we selected a representative sample  of bankruptcy cases. To determine the reliability of the bankruptcy data  we reviewed documentation about the system that maintained them and  interviewed agency officials knowledgeable about the data to discuss the  procedures they used in collecting and maintaining these data. On the  basis of our samples of bankruptcy cases with at least one reaffirmation  agreement from the five selected bankruptcy court districts, we generated  estimates of percentages, means, and medians to generalize sample results  to each district\u2019s bankruptcy court. All percentage estimates in this report  have a margin of error of plus or minus 10 percent or less, unless  otherwise noted. Some percentage estimates we present have a margin of  error greater than plus or minus 10 percent. This occurred for percentage  estimates based on a small number of cases in the district samples with  specific characteristics that were unavailable to us prior to sampling. For  instance, when we present percentage estimates for reaffirmation  agreements made with credit unions, the small number of agreements  made with credit unions in the samples results in larger margins of error.  Mean and median estimates have a relative error of 20 percent or less,  unless otherwise noted. Some mean and median estimates we present in  this report have a great deal of variance, resulting in large percentages of  relative error. For instance, when we discuss the mean and median  amount of the debt reaffirmed per reaffirmation agreement, individual  reaffirmation agreement debts range from very low amounts (such as a  small outstanding balance for an automobile) to much higher amounts (as  with the outstanding balance for the mortgage on a home); these large  variations result in larger percentages of relative error.", "Our case file review was performed using a data collection instrument that  included uniform questions to ensure data were collected consistently. We  relied on data presented in bankruptcy documents filed with the courts by  debtors, creditors, and debtor attorneys. Bankruptcy courts, bankruptcy  administrators, and the U.S. Trustee Program manage bankruptcy cases  and perform some measures to verify data that help ensure the reliability  of information provided. For example, bankruptcy court officials have  measures to ensure that data entered into information systems are  accurate. Also, as a part of the bankruptcy process, the U.S. Trustee  Program verifies selected debtor-reported financial data, such as income  and assets. On the basis of these measures, we believe the bankruptcy data  we reviewed to be sufficiently reliable for our purposes. In addition to  reviewing case files in each district, we interviewed bankruptcy court  clerks, U.S. Regional Trustees, case trustees, and the Bankruptcy  Administrator for the Northern District of Alabama to determine the  availability of reaffirmation agreement data and to learn about the  reaffirmation process. We interviewed four creditors that we identified  during our case file review as the creditors that most frequently entered  into reaffirmation agreements in the five selected districts. We also  interviewed debtor and creditor attorneys, bankruptcy consumer  advocates who represented the interests of debtors during development of  the Reform Act, and academics specializing in bankruptcy issues.", "The Reform Act provides that disclosures (with the exception of the terms  \u201cAmount Reaffirmed\u201d and \u201cAnnual Percentage Rate\u201d) may be made in a  different order and may use terminology different from those set out in the  Reform Act and that such disclosure requirements shall be satisfied if the  required disclosures are given in good faith. This report discusses how the  reaffirmation process was working under the Reform Act in selected  bankruptcy court districts, not whether agreements were in compliance  with the Reform Act. Furthermore, we did not determine the reason that  individual reaffirmation agreements did not include required disclosures  or other information.

Creditors, debtors, debtor attorneys, and the courts each have  reaffirmation agreement roles. The process begins when a debtor in  bankruptcy decides to reaffirm a debt or the creditor proposes a  reaffirmation agreement and forwards it to a debtor. Officials at four credit  institutions that frequently engaged in reaffirmation agreements we  reviewed stated that once they receive notice of a debtor filing for  bankruptcy, the creditors generally send the debtor or the debtor\u2019s  attorney their proposal for a reaffirmation agreement. Under the Reform  Act, certain certifications may be required such as an attorney certification  that certifies that the agreement does not impose an undue hardship on  the debtor. Also, under the Reform Act, the court is to review agreements  where debtors are not represented by an attorney and those that have a  presumed undue hardship. A presumption of undue hardship is triggered  when a debtor\u2019s monthly net income (including expected monthly  payments on post-bankruptcy debt) is not sufficient to pay the proposed  monthly reaffirmed payment. A debtor may try to counter this  presumption in writing. After these reviews, the court may approve or  disapprove the agreement. Figure 1 provides more detailed information  about the reaffirmation agreement process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reform Act Provisions Related to Reaffirmation Agreements", "paragraphs": ["Described as representing the most comprehensive set of reforms in more  than 25 years, the Reform Act addressed, among other things, the  reaffirmation agreement process. The Reform Act added new disclosures and  court review requirements with respect to reaffirmation agreements designed  to help ensure that reaffirmation agreements are consistent with the debtor\u2019s  best interests. The reaffirmation agreement requirements include, among  other things, disclosures notifying debtors of reaffirmed terms. Agreements  must also include the debtor\u2019s monthly income and expenses to determine if a  presumption of undue hardship exists and certification by the debtor\u2019s  attorney that the agreement represents a fully informed and voluntary  agreement by the debtor and that the agreement does not impose an undue  hardship. Table 1 summarizes key reaffirmation agreement disclosure  requirements under the Reform Act. Appendix II provides the full text of the  disclosure statements required by the Reform Act.", "The Reform Act allows for some flexibility in the disclosures required in  reaffirmation agreements and provides that the disclosure requirements  shall be satisfied if the disclosures were provided to the debtor in good  faith. Almost all of the disclosures can be made in a different order and  with different terminology than what is set forth in the law. In addition,  one creditor official we interviewed stated that his organization uses a  standardized form created by the creditor to comply with the Reform Act.  However, according to the official, his company has 32 versions of the  form designed to comply with individual bankruptcy court requirements.", "The AOUSC, which provides administrative, legal, and other support to the  federal judiciary, issued a reaffirmation agreement form that incorporates  the required and recommended language in the Reform Act. The form was  issued on October 2005 and was revised in August 2006 and in January  2007. Because of the requirement for flexibility in disclosure language,  creditors and debtors are not required to use the AOUSC form and may  use other forms. According to AOUSC, one of the primary reasons the  federal judiciary did not impose a specific reaffirmation form was because  the law allows for different reaffirmation agreement forms. The federal  judiciary also took other factors into consideration, according to AOUSC,  including the many variations of statutory requirements that are  dependent upon the debtors\u2019 circumstances, and the fact that a creditor  and debtor might want to include language in addition to what the law  requires."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Court Review of Reaffirmations under the Reform Act", "paragraphs": ["The Reform Act also specifies in what circumstances reaffirmation  agreements are to be reviewed by the courts during the bankruptcy  process.

If a  presumption of undue hardship exists, the court is required to review and  approve or disapprove the agreement based on whether the presumption  is countered by debtor explanations for how the debtor can afford the  reaffirmation payment.", "The Reform Act makes certain provisions for reaffirmation agreements  that do not include a debtor attorney signature. Reaffirmation agreements  might not include a debtor attorney signature because the debtor has  opted to undergo the bankruptcy process without an attorney, which is  known as a pro se bankruptcy filing. Also, in some instances, debtor  attorneys might not sign the agreement because he or she believes the  agreement imposes an undue hardship on the debtor. All agreements that  are not signed by debtor attorneys must be submitted to the court for  review and approval or disapproval, with the exception of reaffirmed  consumer debt secured by a lien on real property such as a home.

While most requirements for reaffirmation  agreements are uniform across all types of lenders, the Reform Act\u2019s  presumption of undue hardship provisions are not applicable to  agreements with credit unions. This exemption is evident in several  Reform Act provisions. For example, while reaffirmation agreements  where the creditor is a credit union are to include a debtor statement in  support of the reaffirmation agreement when the agreement is signed by a  debtor attorney, the statement is not, however, required to include the  income and expense information otherwise used to calculate whether  there is a presumption of undue hardship. Instead, such a debtor\u2019s  statement in support of the agreement is required to include that the  reaffirmation is in the debtor\u2019s financial interest, that the debtor can afford  the reaffirmation payments, and that the debtor received a copy of the  required disclosures and has completed and signed the agreement. In  addition, when the debtor is represented by an attorney, with respect to  credit unions, a required debtor notification is to explain the reaffirmation  process and state that the reaffirmation agreement is effective upon filing  with the court.

As  mentioned previously, under the Reform Act credit union reaffirmation  agreements have different requirements than reaffirmation agreements  with other types of creditors. The debtor notification statement explaining  the reaffirmation agreement process is generally the same as the statement  for other types of creditors. However, the debtor notification statement for  credit union reaffirmation agreements indicates that the agreement is  effective upon filing with the court (for non-credit unions, the debtor  notification statement indicates that the agreement is effective upon filing  with the court unless the reaffirmation is presumed to be an undue  hardship). For the five districts, reaffirmation agreements with credit  unions included the complete credit union debtor notification statement  that explained the reaffirmation agreement process and stated that  reaffirmation agreements with credit unions are effective upon filing with  the court in an estimated 61 percent to 96 percent of agreements. Another  difference for agreements with credit unions is that the Reform Act does  not require an agreement with credit unions to include debtors\u2019 monthly  income, expense, and net income information in the debtor statement in  support of the agreement (unless the agreement does not include a debtor  attorney signature). Instead, the disclosure statement indicates that the  debtor believes the agreement is in his or her financial interest and that he  or she can afford to make the reaffirmation payments.

Reaffirmation agreements had some variation in disclosure language, as is  allowed by the Reform Act, but the variations were generally minor  alterations to the disclosure that did not affect the disclosure content.
