Under this MOU, VA has established reimbursement agreements with IHS and tribal health programs to pay for care provided to AI/AN veterans. In 2013 and 2014, GAO issued two reports on VA and IHS implementation and oversight of the MOU.", "GAO was asked to provide updated information related to the agencies' MOU oversight. This report examines (1) VA and IHS oversight of MOU implementation since 2014, (2) the use of reimbursement agreements to pay for AI/AN veterans' care since 2014, and (3) key issues identified by selected VA, IHS, and tribal health program facilities related to coordinating AI/AN veterans' care.", "To conduct this work, GAO reviewed VA and IHS documents, reports, and reimbursement data from 2014 through 2018. GAO interviewed VA and IHS officials at the headquarters level, and officials at 15 VA, IHS, and tribal facilities in four states\u2014Alaska, New Mexico, North Carolina, and Oklahoma\u2014selected based on factors including the number of reported AI/AN veterans served, and geographic diversity.

Since GAO's last report on the topic in 2014, VA and IHS have continued to jointly oversee the implementation of their MOU\u2014for example, through joint workgroups and quarterly meetings and reports\u2014but they lack sufficient measures for assessing progress towards MOU goals. Specifically, while the agencies established 15 performance measures, they did not establish targets against which performance could be measured. For example, while the number of shared VA-IHS trainings and webinars is a performance measure, there is no target for the number of shared trainings VA and IHS plan to complete each year. GAO's work on best practices for measuring program performance has found that measures should have quantifiable targets to help assess whether goals and objectives were achieved by comparing projected performance and actual results. VA and IHS officials said they are currently in the process of revising the MOU and updating the performance measures used. However, officials have not indicated that any revised measures will include targets.", "Total reimbursements by VA for care provided to AI/AN veterans increased by about 75 percent from fiscal year 2014 to fiscal year 2018. This increase mainly reflects the growth in reimbursement from VA to tribal health program facilities\u2014facilities that receive funding from IHS, but are operated by tribes or tribal organizations. Similarly, the number of VA's reimbursement agreements with tribal health programs and the number of AI/AN veterans served under the reimbursement agreements also increased during this period.", "The VA, IHS, and tribal facility officials GAO spoke with described several key challenges related to coordinating care for AI/AN veterans. For example, facilities reported conflicting information about the process for referring AI/AN veterans from IHS or tribal facilities to VA, and VA headquarters officials confirmed that there is no national policy or guide on this topic. One of the leading collaboration practices identified by GAO is to have written guidance and agreements to document how agencies will collaborate. Without a written policy or guidance about how referrals from IHS and tribal facilities to VA facilities should be managed, the agencies cannot ensure that VA, IHS, and tribal facilities have a consistent understanding of the options available for referrals of AI/AN veterans to VA specialty care. This could result in an AI/AN veteran receiving, and the federal government paying for, duplicative tests if the veteran is reassessed by VA primary care before being referred to specialty care."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making three recommendations\u2014one each to VA and IHS to establish measurable targets for performance measures and one to VA to establish written guidance for referring AI/AN veterans to VA facilities for specialty care.

VA and IHS each operate their own health care  facilities. AI/AN veterans also may receive care from facilities that are  operated by tribes or tribal organizations, known as tribal health programs  (THPs), which received about 54 percent of IHS\u2019s budget in 2017.", "In 2010, VA and IHS expanded upon a 2003 memorandum of  understanding (MOU) to improve the health status of AI/AN veterans  through coordination and resource sharing among VA, IHS, and tribes.  This 2010 MOU outlined mutual goals for VA and IHS collaboration and  coordination of resources and health care services provided to AI/AN  veterans. For example, it included provisions for joint contracts and  purchasing agreements, sharing staff, ensuring providers in VA and IHS  could access the electronic health records of shared patients, and the  development of reimbursement policies and mechanisms to support care  delivered to AI/AN veterans eligible for care in both systems.

We selected a mix of both IHS  and THP facilities, and ensured they reflected geographic diversity as well  as variation in the number of AI/AN veterans they served (according to  VA reimbursement data through September 2017). We selected the 4  VA facilities because they were the facilities with which our selected IHS  and THP facilities had signed reimbursement agreements.

When  needed services are not available at VA facilities or within required driving  distances or time frames, VA may purchase care from non-VA providers  through its community care programs, such as the Veterans Choice  Program. Eligibility for VA health care is based on several factors,  including the veteran\u2019s period of active service, discharge status, the  presence of service connected disabilities or exposures, income, and  other factors. VA uses factors such as these to categorize eligible  veterans into eight enrollment priority groups\u2014established to manage the  provision of care.

For fiscal year 2014, 2,965 AI/AN veterans  received services reimbursed by VA at IHS facilities, which decreased  slightly to 2,829 in fiscal year 2018. In comparison, 885 veterans received  services reimbursed by VA at THP facilities in fiscal year 2014, which  nearly tripled to 2,531 veterans in fiscal year 2018.", "Prescriptions filled. Similar to increases in the numbers of AI/AN  veterans served under the reimbursement agreements, AI/AN veterans\u2019  utilization of VA\u2019s Consolidated Mail Outpatient Pharmacy program has  also increased. Prescriptions filled through this program more than  doubled\u2014from more than 440,000 prescriptions in fiscal year 2014 to  nearly 886,000 prescriptions in fiscal year 2018. (See fig. 4.) VA and IHS  annual reports indicate that the pharmacy program has been one of the  most successful collaborations between VA and IHS for AI/AN veterans,  providing more than 2 million prescriptions for VA-IHS patients since the  pharmacy program collaboration began in 2010. While this program was  originally limited to AI/AN veterans served at IHS facilities, in December  2016, VA and IHS entered into an Interagency Agreement that extended  the program to THPs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "IHS and THP Facilities Viewed the Reimbursement Agreements as Beneficial, but Identified Some Concerns", "paragraphs": ["Officials from the majority of IHS and THP facilities we contacted said  they were generally pleased with the reimbursement agreements. Among  those, officials from one THP noted that the revenue received from their  reimbursement agreement freed up other resources that allowed them to  hire an additional part-time worker to conduct VA outreach activities.  Additionally, a representative of a national tribal organization noted that  IHS and THP facilities\u2019 funding is limited and this revenue helps them  extend services to eligible AI/AN veterans.", "However, officials from a number of IHS and THP facilities also had  concerns about the agreements, including the lack of reimbursement for  PRC program services provided by IHS and THP facilities, the length of  time it took to enter into the agreements, and the time frames of the  agreements:  Lack of reimbursement for PRC program services. Officials at most  IHS and THP facilities we contacted said they believed VA should  reimburse facilities for services from external providers paid through the  PRC program. Officials at some facilities said they have had to deny PRC  services due to a lack of program funds. According to some facility and  IHS area office officials, this issue is particularly relevant in states where  Medicaid was not expanded under the Patient Protection and Affordable  Care Act (PPACA). In states where Medicaid eligibility was expanded,  more AI/AN individuals may therefore be eligible for Medicaid\u2014potentially  freeing up PRC funds. For example, an IHS official noted that prior to  Medicaid expansion in his state they would have to limit PRC funds to be  used only in life or death scenarios after May or June of each year, but  that currently his facility was not limiting any PRC services. Given the  limitations in PRC program funds, officials from a national tribal  organization and some THPs noted they have raised the possibility of  including the PRC program in the reimbursement agreements with VA,  although the program was ultimately not included.", "VA officials noted that there is no statutory requirement for them to  include the PRC program in the reimbursement agreements and also  identified several other reasons for not including it. For example, they said  that VA does not want to pay for services externally that it already offers  internally and that it would prefer to coordinate the patient\u2019s care within  VA\u2019s existing programs, such as VA\u2019s own programs for purchasing care  from external providers\u2014like the Veterans Choice Program.", "The length of time to enter into an agreement. Officials from a few  THP facilities and one national tribal organization we spoke with noted  concerns about the amount of time it took to enter into reimbursement  agreements. Our analysis of VA reimbursement agreement data shows  that the median amount of time that it took to enter an agreement with  THPs was over 1 year (about 403 days). We found that the number of  days from the first contact by a THP to the actual signing of the  agreement ranged from 96 days (over 3 months) to 1,878 days (more  than 5 years).", "According to VA records and interviews, there were reasons for delays in  completing reimbursement agreements, including lengthy negotiations,  incomplete submission of information from the THPs, lapses in  communication between VA and the THP, and a THP\u2019s lack of medical  certification or accreditation. VA officials explained that the amount of  time increases if the THP does not want to use the VA-approved  reimbursement agreement template or wants to change the terms of the  agreement. For example, an official from one THP facility said that it took  2.5 years to finalize its reimbursement agreement due, in part, to internal  challenges with their legal counsel and external challenges with  negotiating the terms of the agreement during a time when the VA was  developing a national reimbursement agreement template. VA officials  also explained that entering the agreement with IHS was simpler than  entering agreements with THPs because it was a national agreement  between two federal agencies and, for example, did not require having a  contracting officer review the agreement\u2014an extra step needed for  agreements with non-federal agencies.", "The length of time reimbursement agreements are in effect. Officials  from a few THP facilities expressed a desire for longer reimbursement  agreements that would permit greater planning ability. The agreement  between VA and IHS was initially set for 3 years. It was then extended  twice, once for 2 years and once for 1.5 years. The time frames for THP  agreements have generally been extended consistent with extensions to  the national agreement. Officials from one THP we spoke with said that  having short-term reimbursement agreements causes problems with  internal organizational planning and it would be beneficial to have a  longer term non-expiring agreement that can be cancelled so that THPs  do not continue to expend resources to complete new agreements or  amendments every 2 years. In June 2018, VA and IHS signed an  amendment to extend the terms of the national reimbursement agreement  through June 30, 2022. VA officials said they are currently in the process  of working with THPs to similarly extend their agreements."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Facilities Cited Varying Levels of Coordination, and Key Challenges Included Making Referrals from IHS and THP Facilities to VA", "paragraphs": ["In speaking to officials at selected VA, IHS, and THP facilities about key  issues related to coordinating care for AI/AN veterans, we found that the  extent of coordination they reported varied widely. For example, three IHS  and THP facilities said they had little to no care coordination with their  local VA partners; noting, for example, that they rarely refer veterans to  VA since they offer more services than the closest VA facilities. Other  facilities described more extensive and formalized care coordination,  including shared funding of certain VA and THP employees, or VA  employees on site at THP facilities to manage veterans\u2019 care and  referrals to and from VA. In Alaska, for example, where services offered  by VA are very limited, VA instead has formal sharing and reimbursement  agreements established with 26 THPs, which provide the majority of  services to AI/AN veterans, as well as some non-Native veterans. Two of  the THP facilities we spoke with in Alaska have VA employees working on  site to help coordinate veterans\u2019 care. VA and IHS headquarters officials  indicated that the MOU was intended to allow for variation in the level of  coordination at the local, facility level not to create demands or obligations  on facilities. One VA official noted that as the new MOU is developed,  both VA and IHS want to continue to allow VA, IHS, and THP facilities to  engage in whatever level of coordination makes sense.", "Despite variation in the extent of coordination, officials identified several  common challenges regarding coordination between local VA, IHS, and  THP facilities:  Referring patients to VA facilities. Officials from 9 of the 15 VA, IHS,  and THP facilities we contacted reported conflicting information about the  process for referring AI/AN veterans from IHS and THP facilities to VA  facilities for specialty care. For example, 4 of the IHS and THP facilities  we spoke with said that AI/AN veterans generally could not be referred  directly to VA specialty care by IHS or THP providers without first being  seen and referred by a provider at VA. These facility officials indicated  that this practice was a barrier to care. These officials also noted that this  could result in the patient receiving, and the federal government paying  for, duplicative tests. However, officials at another IHS facility indicated  that IHS and THP facilities should be able to refer patients directly to VA  specialty care. Additionally, during an interview at a VA facility, local and  regional officials had differing understandings of whether IHS and THP  facilities could refer patients directly to VA specialty care.", "VA and IHS headquarters officials both reported that in general, IHS or  THP facilities cannot refer a patient to VA specialty care without that  patient first being seen in VA primary care. However, VA officials reported  that there is no national policy or written guidance on how to refer patients  from an IHS or THP facility to a VA facility. VA officials said that the  coordination process is left to the local VA facility and the respective IHS  or THP facilities and the process can vary from one facility to another\u2014 explaining why differing information was reported by facility officials. Our  past work on interagency collaborative mechanisms identifies that it is a  leading collaboration practice to have written guidance and agreements to  document how agencies will collaborate. Without a written policy or  guidance about how referrals of AI/AN veterans from IHS and THP  facilities to VA facilities may be managed, VA and IHS cannot ensure that  VA, IHS, and THP facilities have a consistent understanding of the  options available for these referrals.", "Information technology interoperability and access. Officials at 10 of  the 15 VA, IHS, and THP facilities we contacted cited challenges related  to accessing each other\u2019s health information technology systems. Most  stated that a lack of interoperability of their electronic health records  caused challenges, while a few IHS and THP facilities also mentioned  that the lack of access to VA systems makes it difficult to verify a  veteran\u2019s eligibility or determine the services for which VA will reimburse.  For example, one THP noted that if an AI/AN veteran was sent to VA for a  service, the THP provider would not receive the veteran\u2019s follow-up  records as quickly as if they had access to each other\u2019s systems.  Improving systems\u2019 interoperability was a focus area identified in the  MOU, and an IHS official indicated that while the agencies had some  initial work on the topic, no systematic solutions were identified. We have  previously identified VA\u2019s lack of systems interoperability\u2014particularly  with the Department of Defense\u2014as a contributor to the agency\u2019s  challenges related to health care.", "VA and IHS officials identified some potential workarounds to this lack of  interoperability, although they noted that some of the described  workarounds could be time consuming and may not be feasible for all  facilities:", "An IHS headquarters official said that IHS and VA each have the  ability to request the sharing of information from an individual  electronic health record held by the other agency through secure  emails\u2014although the official noted that this is not as fast or efficient  as being able to log in to each other\u2019s systems.", "VA officials also reported that VA belongs to the eHealth Exchange\u2014 a national health information exchange\u2014and said that IHS or THPs  could join that, through which they would be able to access  information about common veteran patients. However, IHS reported  that although the agency explored connecting to the eHealth  Exchange several years ago, testing and onboarding costs to  participate were prohibitive. IHS noted that several individual facilities  across the IHS system have elected to invest in connections with  regional health information exchanges. Similarly, two THPs we spoke  with reported being a part of other, more locally-based health  information exchanges, but noted that VA was not part of these  exchanges.", "A VA official noted that there is an enrollment guide that details how  enrollment and eligibility verification will be managed between IHS,  THP, and VA facilities. This guide describes how IHS or THP facilities  can request veterans\u2019 enrollment and eligibility information from the  VA Health Eligibility Center using a templated spreadsheet that sends  requests via email through a secure data transfer service. VA\u2019s Health  Eligibility Center verifies the list and returns the completed  enrollment/eligibility excel spreadsheet to the IHS or THP facility  securely. IHS and THP facilities can also contact the VA Health  Eligibility Center directly by telephone for fewer than five veterans per  call, or their local VA medical center by telephone to verify one AI/AN  veteran\u2019s enrollment and eligibility per call.", "IHS or THP facilities could also enter an arrangement with a local VA  facility to have VA employees or co-funded employees on site at IHS  or THP facilities, or to have VA-credentialed employees that can  access VA systems to share information. However, these options may  not be systemic solutions that work at all facilities. An IHS  headquarters official noted, for example, that not all IHS or THP  facilities have the type of relationship with their local VA facility that  would lead to the establishment of such arrangements.", "In terms of the potential for improving interoperability in the future, VA is  in the process of implementing a new electronic health record system,  and we have previously reported that VA has identified increased  interoperability as a key expected outcome of its decision to switch  systems. Officials from two VA and THP facilities were hopeful that this  new system will help improve interoperability since some THPs use an  electronic health record system from the same company that VA has a  contract with. Additionally, an IHS headquarters official said that IHS is  also reevaluating its information technology platform and one requirement  of any new IHS system will be to enhance interoperability with VA,  pending the funding to do so. IHS also reported that the agency will  consider health information exchange participation as part of the agency\u2019s  information technology modernization efforts.", "Staff turnover. Officials from 9 of 15 facilities identified staff turnover at  VA, IHS, and THP facilities as an impediment to having better or  consistent coordination. VA, IHS, and THP facility officials described  situations in which the coordination between facilities was dependent on  specific staff or facility leadership. According to officials, when there was  turnover among these staff or positions went unfilled, or were eliminated,  the coordination decreased or came to a halt. For example, officials at  one VA facility said that they have found that if a sitting tribal government  expresses interest in VA collaboration, they have to act quickly and work  with the tribe before there is turnover and new tribal leadership comes in  with different priorities. Additionally, officials from one IHS facility  described a situation in which they had previously coordinated with their  local VA facility through that facility\u2019s AI/AN liaison. However, the  coordination lapsed when the liaison left VA and the position went  unfilled. Similarly, a THP official stated that coordination with VA was  previously led by a nurse case manager on site who was a joint VA and  THP employee. The official said that since that person\u2019s retirement, she  did not know who to contact at VA to coordinate veterans\u2019 care.", "Officials at one IHS facility noted that due to turnover and attrition they  would like to see more education for front line staff at both IHS and VA,  so they can more efficiently obtain care for patients at the VA. VA  headquarters officials acknowledged that staff turnover and retraining is a  challenge that they will need to continually address as the MOU is carried  out. In our prior work related to IHS and VA, we have found that both  agencies face challenges related to staff turnover and training.", "VA Co-Payments. Officials at 3 of the 11 IHS and THP facilities we  contacted, as well as IHS headquarters officials and representatives of  two national tribal organizations said that the copayments that VA  charges veterans represented a barrier to AI/AN veterans receiving care.  While AI/AN veterans do not have any cost-sharing for care provided at  IHS or THP facilities, they are subject to the same copayments as other  veterans when they receive care from VA facilities. VA data shows, for  example, that of the 80,507 VA-enrolled self-identified AI/AN veterans in  in fiscal year 2017, about 30 percent were charged copayments,  averaging about $281.56 billed per veteran. Officials from one THP noted  that this kind of financial liability may discourage AI/AN veterans from  getting care at VA, or lead them to return to the THP after they realize  they will have to pay for care at VA.", "While some of our interviewees suggested that VA should waive  copayments for AI/AN veterans, a VA official said they do not have the  legal authority to do this. The official said that their statute specifies the  categories of veterans for which they must charge copayments and VA is  not authorized to waive the copayments for AI/AN veterans on the basis  of their AI/AN status without statutory exemptions. While certain AI/AN  veterans may qualify for waived copayments based on their inclusion in  other statutory categories, AI/AN veterans are not specifically listed as a  category for which copayments can otherwise be waived. VA officials  also cautioned that because AI/AN veterans may qualify for waived  copayments through these other categories, the possibility of copays  should not discourage IHS or THP facilities from referring AI/AN veterans  to VA."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Since 2014, VA and IHS have continued to work together to oversee and  implement their MOU aimed at improving the health care provided to  dually eligible AI/AN veterans.

VA and IHS are now updating the  MOU, and plan to revisit the related performance measures. This gives  the agencies an opportunity to evaluate how well their existing oversight  mechanisms have been working, and to improve these mechanisms  accordingly in the future. Regardless of these updates, the agencies need  to have effective performance measures. While the agencies took steps  to improve MOU performance measures in response to one of our prior  reports, these steps were not sufficient and the measures they set lack  important attributes, including measurable targets. VA and IHS have  indicated that they plan to reevaluate performance measures as they  update the MOU, but have not indicated that these new measures will  identify targets. Absent targets, VA and IHS are limited in their ability to  measure progress towards MOU goals and ultimately make strategic  decisions about how and where improvements should be made.", "At the local level, care for AI/AN veterans relies on coordination among  individual VA, IHS, and THP facilities. However, variations in relationships  among these many facilities and staff turnover creates challenges, which  heightens the importance of clear and consistent guidance from the  national level.
