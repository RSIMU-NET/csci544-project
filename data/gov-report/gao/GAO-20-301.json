NDA reviews are complex, and may involve not only an initial review, but also reviews of resubmissions if the initial review does not result in approval.

For example, 6 percent of the NDAs reviewed by the dermatology and dental division had a priority designation, compared to 56 percent for the anti-infective division. FDA has reported that some divisions, such as the oncology divisions, generally regulate products for conditions that are more likely to be serious or life-threatening, and, therefore, those products may be more likely to qualify for priority designation and other expedited programs.", "GAO found that FDA's divisions differed in the average number of days they took to complete an initial review of NDAs, and these differences largely reflected the key features of the NDAs they reviewed. GAO's analysis shows that the time FDA took to complete an initial review of NDAs was affected by (1) the target time frame for completion of the review under the agency's PDUFA goals, (2) the number of expedited programs for which the NDA qualified, and (3) the division performing the review. GAO also found that the target time frame for review was largely responsible for differences in initial review times. Specifically, NDAs with key features that resulted in shorter target time frames for review under FDA's PDUFA goals had shorter initial review times. Controlling for the effects of these target time frames and the number of expedited programs for which the NDA qualified, GAO found that most of the divisions' average review times were similar to (within 2 weeks of) each other."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Getting safe, effective drugs to market in the United States typically  involves a lengthy drug development process.

The applicant can respond in a resubmission, initiating a  new cycle of review.", "Because drug sponsors must collect evidence to demonstrate the safety  and effectiveness of new drugs, and these efforts represent a major  component of drug development time and cost, the amount and nature of  the evidence needed can be an important determinant of when and  whether new therapies become available to the public. The issue of what  constitutes sufficient evidence to support NDAs has been debated by  FDA, the scientific community, industry, and others. FDA has typically  required NDAs to include safety and effectiveness evidence for new  drugs from two adequate and well-controlled clinical trials. However,  under certain circumstances, drug sponsors can use different sources of  evidence to show that a new drug is safe and effective for its intended  use. The 21st Century Cures Act (Cures Act), enacted in 2016, directed  FDA to evaluate and facilitate the use of these different sources of  evidence by FDA reviewers and drug sponsors to inform the agency\u2019s  assessment of drug safety and effectiveness.", "FDA has published evidence showing that review times differ between  divisions. In light of this evidence, you asked us to examine NDA review  times across FDA\u2019s divisions, as well as FDA\u2019s use of certain tools to  inform the agency\u2019s assessment of drug safety and effectiveness. This  report examines  1.  differences between FDA divisions in the proportion of NDAs they  review with key features;  2.  differences between FDA divisions in the time taken to complete initial  reviews and the extent to which the key NDA features contribute to  these differences; and  3.  actions FDA has recently taken to evaluate and facilitate the use of  different sources of evidence to support NDAs.", "To address our first two objectives, we analyzed data from FDA regarding  637 NDAs\u2014the NDAs that were initially submitted from fiscal years 2014  through 2018.

Our examination  excluded NDAs that were withdrawn by the applicant before FDA  completed an initial review, as well as NDAs for which FDA had not  completed a review by March 31, 2019. For some analyses, we also  excluded five NDAs, as described in appendix I, bringing the count of  NDAs to 632. We reviewed the reliability of the data by conducting a  series of electronic and logic tests to identify missing data or other  anomalies and worked with FDA to correct information when we identified  discrepancies. We determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for  our purposes. In addition, although our focus was on initial review times,  we also collected information about total review times\u2014review times  across all completed cycles of review; appendix II includes information  about these total review times. Finally, we interviewed FDA officials about  the agency\u2019s review process and these review times.", "To examine recent FDA actions to evaluate and facilitate the use of  different sources of evidence to support NDAs, we identified initiatives  FDA started implementing as a result of the enactment of the Cures Act in  late 2016. We focused our analysis on initiatives that (1) involve NDAs  reviewed by CDER divisions and (2) could affect a variety of diseases  and populations. We spoke with FDA officials and reviewed FDA  documentation to learn about the initiatives and determine steps FDA has  taken to implement the initiatives. We also interviewed two stakeholder  groups (Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America and  Biotechnology Innovation Organization) that represent drug sponsors  about the initiatives.", "We conducted this performance audit from July 2018 to February 2020 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

PDUFA authorized FDA to collect user fees from drug  sponsors to supplement its annual appropriation for salaries and  expenses. PDUFA has been reauthorized every 5 years since 1992;  most recently PDUFA VI reauthorized the prescription drug user fee  program from fiscal year 2018 through fiscal year 2022. As part of each  reauthorization process, FDA identifies goals in a commitment letter to  Congress. In general, these goals identify a percentage of certain types of  applications that FDA is expected to review within specified time frames,  including goals for the time the agency takes to complete reviews of  different types of NDAs upon initial submission and resubmission. For  example, in its commitment letters for PDUFA V and VI, FDA committed  to completing its initial review of 90 percent of priority NDAs that involve  previously marketed or approved active ingredients within 6 months of  receipt.", "As previously noted, four key features of NDAs are linked to drug  development and review processes. For initial NDA reviews, the time  frames for FDA\u2019s review that would meet its PDUFA V and VI  commitments\u2014its PDUFA goals\u2014vary and are linked to three key  features of the NDA. (See table 1.) The target time frame for the initial  review of any specific NDA under these user fee commitments reflects  the goals associated with all three of the key features.", "The fourth key feature of NDAs is whether they qualify for one of FDA\u2019s  expedited programs. Whether designated as priority or standard, FDA  may determine that NDAs for drugs intended to treat serious or life- threatening conditions qualify for development and review under one or  more expedited programs. These programs confer specific benefits with  the potential to help reduce the development or review time needed to  bring a drug to market.  For example, some expedited programs provide  for more intensive drug development guidance from FDA officials or allow  the applicant to submit completed sections of the NDA for review before  submitting the entire application. FDA\u2019s expedited programs include  accelerated approval, breakthrough therapy designation, and fast track  designation. (See table 2.)", "NDAs must include substantial evidence of a drug\u2019s effectiveness, which  is typically drawn from clinical trials. In traditional clinical trials, patients  receiving a new drug are often compared with patients receiving a  placebo or a different drug. To maximize data quality, these clinical trials  are usually randomized (patients are randomly assigned to either the  group receiving the new drug or a comparison group) and double-blinded  (neither the patients nor the investigators know who is receiving a  particular treatment). According to FDA, although this type of study  design is often the most powerful tool for evaluating the safety and  effectiveness of new drugs, many traditional clinical trials are becoming  more costly and complex to administer. Additionally, according to FDA,  many new drugs are not easily evaluated using traditional approaches.  For example, drugs intended for patients with rare diseases are difficult to  evaluate due to the limited number of patients affected by the disease  and available for study.", "The Cures Act was enacted on December 13, 2016, to accelerate the  discovery, development and delivery of new treatments\u2014including  drugs\u2014for patients. Among other things, the Cures Act includes  provisions for FDA to evaluate and facilitate the use of evidence from  sources other than traditional clinical trials to support safety and  effectiveness determinations for new drugs. For example, FDA was  directed to evaluate the potential use of evidence based on data that is  routinely collected outside of traditional clinical trials from sources such as  electronic health records, medical claims data, and disease registries;  evidence from such data sources is referred to as real-world evidence. In  the commitment letter associated with PDUFA VI, which was enacted on  August 18, 2017, the agency agreed to certain goals relating to the use of  real-world evidence in regulatory decision-making and also agreed to  certain activities intended to facilitate the development and application of  an additional source of evidence known as model-informed drug  development. Although these nontraditional sources of evidence were  included in NDAs prior to the enactment of the Cures Act and PDUFA VI,  at the time this legislation was enacted, most of them were not widely  used. For example, according to FDA officials, the NDAs that included  real-world evidence were generally for drugs to treat oncology diseases  or rare diseases."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FDA Divisions Differ in Proportions of NDAs Reviewed with One or More Key Features", "paragraphs": ["Our analysis of the 637 original NDAs submitted from fiscal years 2014  through 2018 indicates that divisions differed in the proportions of NDAs  they reviewed that had any one of three key features that are linked to  time frames for initial review under FDA\u2019s PDUFA goals.

The panel on the right shows the estimated average review  times, after accounting for key application features, that is, what the  review times would have been if each division had reviewed equal  numbers of applications with these key features.", "We asked FDA officials what might contribute to somewhat faster review  times by the hematology and oncology divisions, and FDA officials told us  that a number of variables could have contributed to these differences.  For example, the officials told us that applicants differ in their level of  experience, which can affect the quality of the NDA or the speed of  response to FDA\u2019s requests for information; applications differ in  complexity; and the oncology and hematology divisions could differ from  others in their risk/benefit considerations. As previously noted, some  divisions, such as the oncology divisions, regulate products for conditions  that are more likely to be serious or life-threatening compared with other  divisions, such as the dermatology and dental division, and risk/benefit  considerations can differ across conditions that vary in how serious or life- threatening they are. For example, the potential benefits of drugs that  carry substantial risks for dangerous side effects would likely be weighed  differently if the drug is intended to address a life-threatening illness for  which there is no other treatment than if the drug is intended to address  an illness that is not life-threatening or for which there is an alternative  treatment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FDA Is Implementing Initiatives to Evaluate and Facilitate the Use of Different Evidence Sources to Support NDAs", "paragraphs": ["FDA has several initiatives underway to evaluate and facilitate FDA  review divisions\u2019 and drug sponsors\u2019 use of evidence derived from  sources other than traditional clinical trials to support NDAs.

FDA officials also said that although complex  innovative trial designs might replace traditional clinical trials as evidence  in NDAs, real-world evidence is more likely to be used to supplement  clinical trial data.", "Although the initiatives are not restricted to any particular type of disease  or patient population, according to FDA officials, some initiatives may be  more relevant for certain types of diseases or patient populations than  others. For example, according to FDA officials:  real-world evidence may be most relevant for diseases that have  outcomes that are consistently collected in the health care system.  clinical outcome assessments (one aspect of patient-focused drug  development) may be most relevant for diseases that are chronic,  symptomatic, or affect functioning and activities of daily living.  complex innovative trial designs may be most relevant for situations in  which the population size is small or limited, such as pediatric  populations, or where there is an unmet medical need, such as rare  diseases.", "Our review of FDA documentation and interviews with FDA officials show  that FDA has taken steps to implement each of these five initiatives.  These steps include conducting public workshops with key stakeholders,  issuing guidance for industry and FDA staff, initiating pilot programs, and  developing FDA staff capacity, including by providing training and other  educational resources.

It is important to note that an array of factors might be  expected to influence review times, including not just those factors that  were captured in our analysis, but also factors such as state of the  science and quality of the application.", "With data from 632 NDAs distributed unevenly across 15 divisions,  meaningful tests of additional variables or their interactions were not  possible. Nonetheless, we conducted exploratory analyses that included  other potentially relevant variables in addition to the target time frame for  review under FDA\u2019s PDUFA goals, number of expedited programs, and  division. In separate regression analyses, we examined (a) the fiscal year  in which FDA received the NDA and (b) whether the application was a  BLA, an NDA based on information from studies conducted by the  applicant, or an NDA based on at least some information from studies not  conducted by or for the applicant. We did not find evidence of a  consistent effect of either of these additional factors on review times, but  in light of the number of NDAs, we cannot exclude the possibility that one  or more of these factors affects review times.
