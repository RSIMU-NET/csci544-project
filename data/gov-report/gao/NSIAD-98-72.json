The Air Force followed by announcing a strategy to privatize-in-place five prototype depot maintenance workloads at the two closing centers. Since then, there has been a continuing debate between Congress and DOD over where and by whom the workloads at the closing depots would be performed. Central to this debate are concerns about the excess facility capacity that exists at the Air Force\u2019s three remaining depots and the legislative requirement that workloads exceeding $3 million dollars in value be subject to a public-private competition before being moved to the private sector. Appendix II provides a more detailed description of the closure history for the two logistics centers.", "In response to congressional concerns regarding the appropriateness of its privatization-in-place plans, the Air Force revised its strategy to allow the public depots to participate in public-private competitions for the closing depot workloads.

This adjustment made Warner Robins\u2019 total evaluated cost about $42 million less than the lowest private sector offeror\u2019s cost. Accordingly, the $153-million overhead adjustment became the primary determining factor of the competition. The adjustment was large because the evaluation showed that Warner Robins, due to its excess capacity, could absorb the additional C-5 workload with no significant increase in total overhead costs and that the overhead was primarily a fixed-cost that would be incurred with or without the additional workload for the 7-year period. The savings were determined by calculating the reduced overhead charges to existing workloads resulting from adding the C-5 workload over the 7-year period.", "Industry officials questioned Warner Robins\u2019 ability to achieve these savings. According to one private sector offeror, the Air Force did not clearly explain how the public offeror could achieve such large savings relative to the proposed cost for performing the workload. Additionally, while stating that some savings may be achievable, contractors said the overhead savings estimate in the Air Force\u2019s cost evaluation was too high. Further, they considered this adjustment a reward for maintaining existing depot inefficiency. One private sector offeror characterized the overhead savings adjustment as the one factor that most favored the public depots, and said that unless this factor is changed, they may not participate in future public-private competitions.", "The evaluation records show that the cost evaluators questioned the overhead savings initially proposed by Warner Robins and made downward adjustments to that amount. For example, the evaluators deleted workload hours included in the Warner Robins\u2019 savings calculations for work on the KC-135 aircraft because that requirement had not been committed to the Warner Robins facility. After extensive discussions with the offeror concerning the proposed overhead savings, the evaluators calculated that $153,935,160 in savings could be attributed to the other workloads to be performed at the public facility during the performance of the C-5 requirement. These savings were primarily due to the more efficient use of the existing workforce and facilities, which before the addition of the C-5 workload had been underused.", "We have reported that Air Force depots have significant excess capacity and that significant savings could be achieved by reducing this excess capacity. The excess capacity consists of both people and facilities. In addition to downsizing and streamlining depot operations, excess capacity can be reduced by bringing in additional workloads to achieve savings by spreading personnel and facility costs over a larger workload base. We also have reported that over $200 million in overhead savings could be achieved annually by consolidating the closing San Antonio and Sacramento depots\u2019 workloads into remaining DOD depots.", "In calculating the overhead savings, the Air Force assumed that the excess capacity and overhead cost condition at Warner Robins would not otherwise be significantly reduced over the 7-year period.

Under this factor, the SSA concluded that offeror B had the best approach to transferring performance of the workload to its proposed facility, with an exceptional technical rating and low proposal risk. Offeror A was next, with an acceptable technical rating and a low proposal risk. Warner Robins followed with an acceptable rating and a moderate risk.

The SSA concluded that offeror A \u201cfar exceeded\u201d the RFP minimum standard and merited an exceptional rating by proposing a significant reduction in the \u201cflow days\u201d (i.e. , time required to perform the work) needed to maintain the aircraft over the life of the requirement. In addition, the SSA assigned the offeror a low-risk rating for its approach to the performance of the workload. Offeror B received an acceptable rating with low risk for its approach. The SSA assigned Warner Robins a marginal rating with moderate risk.

The SSA concluded that while close monitoring could overcome these difficulties, the production schedule could be disrupted. Accordingly, the SSA determined that the potential for problems in the paint/depaint facility should be reflected or dollarized as an added cost in the evaluation. The cost associated with the potential problems related to the PDM facility was, according to the SSA, already reflected in Warner Robins\u2019 cost proposal, and thus, was not added as a \u201cdollarized\u201d cost in the evaluation. In sum, the SSA concluded that the reduced flow days proposed by both offeror A and Warner Robins were significant discriminators and merited a downward dollarization cost adjustment in the determination of total evaluated cost. The evaluation of Warner Robins\u2019 cost was, in addition, to include an estimated cost increase for the potential paint/depaint problems in its dollarization evaluation.

Neither 10 U.S.C. 2469 nor the other statutes governing public-private competitions for depot workloads prescribe the specific elements that constitute a competition.

The Air Force issued a competitive solicitation in accordance with FAR parts 12 and 15, which provided for the participation of a public sector depot. Overall, the evaluation process appeared to be reasonable, fair, and consistent with the evaluation scheme in the solicitation, the Depot Competition Procedures, and the CCH.", "The private sector has raised several specific concerns about the conduct of the C-5 competition. The concerns are that (1) there is an inherent inequity in public-private depot competitions created by the solicitation of offers on a fixed-price basis, since the government often pays for any cost overruns incurred by a public sector source from public funds; (2) Warner Robins was unfairly advantaged during the cost evaluation by the large cost credit representing projected overhead savings in its other workloads; and (3) the selection did not account for, or dollarize, identified risks and weaknesses in the proposals."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Public-Private Cost Comparison", "paragraphs": ["Private sector representatives stated that the Air Force\u2019s solicitation of offers on a fixed-price basis revealed the inequity inherent in the procedures used in the C-5 public-private competition.

On the other hand, public sector offerors are subject to no contractually enforceable cost risk, as any overruns will simply be paid for by the government from public funds.", "Public and private sector entities are fundamentally different; therefore, it is unlikely that a completely equal comparison of the projected costs of public and private sector performance of a particular function could be achieved. However, the cost comparison aspect of a public-private competition needs to be conducted in as fair a manner as practicable. To this end, our decisions involving public-private competitions have held that, to ascertain whether a public depot\u2019s costs are fairly stated and reasonable, an agency must make a reasoned judgment of the actual cost the government will incur if work is to be performed by the depot.

Recognizing the concerns now being raised in the context of the C-5 competition, we have observed that, because a public source\u2019s cost overruns are paid for by the government, its arrangement to perform work is more closely analogous to a cost reimbursement type contract than to the fixed-price contract a private sector offeror is bound to perform. As a result, we have stated that in a solicitation for a fixed-price type contract, an agency must treat the public sector offer as if it were one for a cost type contract and subject it to a cost realism analysis in accordance with FAR 15.805-3.

Both the solicitation and the Depot Competition Procedures contained a number of provisions designed to ensure that Warner Robins\u2019 full costs were disclosed and supported. For example, the solicitation required the public sector offeror to certify that its offer represented the full cost of performance, subject to criminal penalties for false statements. Warner Robins included this certification in its proposal.", "Also, under the Depot Competition Procedures, DCAA is required to provide an opinion that a public depot\u2019s proposal complies with the CCH, is not materially understated, and is acceptable for evaluation. These requirements are not applicable to private sector offers. In fact, the procedures state that proposals \u201csubmitted by private firms will generally not require auditing.\u201d In addition, the procedures mandate that proposals from both public and private offerors be supported by systems and procedures maintained by the offeror that are in accord with generally accepted accounting principles.", "The evaluation record for the C-5 competition shows that the Air Force conducted an extensive realism analysis of the Warner Robins proposal, consistent with FAR 15.805-3 and the previously cited decisions. In this connection, the Air Force developed a pre-solicitation estimate of what it would cost to perform the requirement. The evaluators compared this figure with the overall cost proposed by the depot and reviewed individual cost elements. In addition, DCAA reviewed Warner Robins\u2019 disclosure statement and the depot\u2019s accounting and estimating systems.

Specifically, both sources provided for an adjustment to be made to a public or private sector proposal for \u201cidentified and reasonable\u201d overhead savings to other government workloads performed by the offeror that would be realized during the 7-year period.", "The evaluation records show that the cost evaluators questioned the overhead savings initially proposed by Warner Robins and made downward adjustments in the amount originally proposed. For example, the evaluators deleted workload hours included in the Warner Robins\u2019 savings calculations for work on the KC-135 aircraft because that requirement had not been committed to the Warner Robins facility. After extensive discussions with the offeror concerning the proposed overhead savings, the evaluators calculated that $153,935,160 could be attributed to the other workloads to be performed at the public facility during the performance of the C-5 requirement. These savings were primarily due to the more efficient use of the existing workforce and facilities, which before the addition of the C-5 workload had been underused.", "The overhead savings credit was provided for in the solicitation and the Depot Competition Procedures, and the Air Force followed the evaluation scheme in calculating the savings proposed by Warner Robins. The size of the savings and their significance in Warner Robins\u2019 selection were due to the excess capacity that existed in Warner Robins\u2019 facilities and the underutilization of the existing workforce, to the fact that the savings were to be applied to a 7-year performance period, and to the fact that offeror A did not propose any similar overhead savings."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Dollarization of Evaluated Risks", "paragraphs": ["Private sector firms raised concerns about the Air Force\u2019s failure to consider some of the evaluated risks in the respective proposals in its final selection decision.", "The evaluation records show that under the two highest priority management factors, transition and production operations, offeror A received a low-risk rating while the public offeror\u2019s approach was rated as representing a moderate risk.

In the final selection decision, the SSA did not dollarize or quantify the risk differences or all the strengths or weaknesses but only included adjustments that represented discriminators based upon reduction of flow days and a lack of capacity at one of Warner Robins\u2019 proposed facilities. The result was that all of the superior risk or strength ratings given offeror A did not enter into the calculation of its total evaluated cost and were not a factor in the final selection.", "The RFP provided that the calculation of an offeror\u2019s total evaluated cost would include \u201cthe dollarized impact of significant discriminators based on identified proposal strengths, weaknesses and risks.\u201d Since the RFP stated that these elements would be considered for inclusion in the dollarization, the Air Force had to do so. However, an agency has discretion to decide whether any particular feature of an individual proposal should or should not enter into cost calculations, and such decisions generally will not be questioned as long as they are fair, reasonable, and consistent with the solicitation. (See Universal Shipping Co., Inc., B-223905.2, Apr. 20, 1987, 87-1 CPD 424.) In our view, the dollarization approach adopted by the Air Force represented a reasonable exercise of its discretion under the RFP.", "As noted previously, some evaluated risks for the two highest priority management factors were dollarized and reflected in the final selection decision, and some were not. Under the transition factor, the SSA noted that Warner Robins met the minimum standard, but that its approach of operating dual locations\u2014Kelly and Robins Air Force Bases\u2014for work performed during the transition period posed a moderate risk because of the close monitoring that would be required to avoid schedule disruption and performance degradation. On the other hand, the SSA stated that offeror A merited a low-risk rating because it had experience managing the type of transition it proposed. The SSA noted that the strength of offeror A\u2019s approach increased confidence that the transition would be successful, but did not offer \u201cspecific cost impacts or savings.\u201d The SSA expressed concern regarding Warner Robins\u2019 approach but concluded that close monitoring should ameliorate any cost impact. The SSA determined that while offeror A\u2019s approach involved less risk than Warner Robins\u2019 plan, the difference would not have an impact on the cost of performance.", "Under the production operations factor, the SSA concluded that offeror A far exceeded the minimum standard by proposing a low-risk approach that would significantly reduce the flow days needed to perform the work on the aircraft. The SSA considered this approach to be a significant discriminator offering a cost benefit to the Air Force. Thus, the offeror was given a dollarized cost credit in the evaluation. Similarly, Warner Robins was given an estimated cost reduction in the dollarization evaluation for its proposal to reduce flow days in processing the aircraft. This was tempered by a corresponding dollarization because the SSA concluded that the public offeror\u2019s moderately risky approach could in one respect\u2014potential schedule conflicts in the use of its paint/depaint facility\u2014result in a negative cost impact during performance. A similar problem involving potential schedule conflicts in the use of another Warner Robins\u2019 facility was not dollarized because the SSA concluded that the potential cost impact was already reflected in the proposed costs.", "As these facts demonstrate, the Air Force evaluators took a conservative approach in implementing the dollarization concept announced in the RFP. The evaluation record indicates that they included only those elements that were judged to be discriminators among the proposals and would offer \u201cspecific cost impacts or savings.\u201d For example, if a proposal offered a plan to reduce a specific number of flow days, a feature that could be readily quantified, it was dollarized. On the other hand, more subjective elements of the evaluation, such as the overall risk of a particular approach, were not as susceptible to quantification and were not dollarized.", "In our view, while the Air Force could have taken a more expansive approach to dollarization, it was within its discretion under the RFP to take the approach that it did. The RFP did not explain in any detail how dollarization was to be accomplished; the determination of an appropriate approach was left to the Air Force. Further, our review of the evaluation record disclosed nothing to suggest that the Air Force applied the dollarization approach it selected unevenly or unfairly. For example, both offeror A and Warner Robins were given dollarization credit for their plans to reduce the flow days needed to maintain the aircraft. Considering the subjective nature of such evaluation judgments and the discretion procuring agencies have in this area, we believe that the Air Force\u2019s approach to dollarization was consistent with the solicitation and reasonable.
