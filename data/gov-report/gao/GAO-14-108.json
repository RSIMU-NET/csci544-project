Most--but not all--of the auctions resulted in contracts with relatively small dollar value awards--typically $150,000 or less--and a high rate of awards to small businesses. The four agencies steadily increased their use of reverse auctions from fiscal years 2008 through 2012, with about $828 million in contract awards in 2012 alone. GAO was not able to analyze data from a fifth agency, the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), because it collected only summary level information during fiscal year 2012. DLA guidance states that the reverse auction pricing tool should be used for all competitive purchases over $150,000.", "Four agencies used the same commercial service provider to conduct their reverse auctions and paid a variable fee for this service, which was no more than 3 percent of the winning bid amount. DLA conducts its own auctions through a purchased license. Regardless of the method used, according to agency officials, contracting officers are still responsible for following established contracting procedures when using reverse auctions.", "GAO found that the potential benefits of reverse auctions--competition and savings--had not been maximized by the agencies. GAO found that over one-third of fiscal year 2012 reverse auctions had no interactive bidding, where vendors bid against each other to drive prices lower. In addition, almost half of the reverse auctions were used to obtain items from pre-existing contracts that in some cases resulted in agencies paying two fees--one to use the contract and one to use the reverse auction contractor's services. There is a lack of comprehensive governmentwide guidance and the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), which is the primary document for publishing uniform policies and procedures related to federal acquisitions, does not specifically address reverse auctions. As a result, confusion exists about their use and agencies may be limited in their ability to maximize the potential benefits of reverse auctions."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) take steps to amend the FAR to address agencies' use of reverse auctions and issue government-wide guidance to maximize competition and savings when using reverse auctions.

Our prior  work found that government agencies were increasingly using reverse  auctions as a means to drive down prices.

This report examines (1)  what agencies are buying through reverse auctions and trends in their  use; (2) how agencies are conducting reverse auctions; and (3) the extent  to which the potential benefits of reverse auctions are being maximized.", "To conduct our work, we identified the agencies that used the greatest  number of reverse auctions in fiscal year 2012 by reviewing contract  award information in Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps.gov).  The award information identifies when reverse auctions were used;  however, not all contract award actions are required to be announced in  FedBizOpps. Over 99 percent of the fiscal year reverse auctions listed in  FedBizOpps showed that the agencies used the same contractor, FedBid,  Inc. (FedBid), to conduct their reverse auctions. Because the federal  agencies did not maintain the level of detailed information needed for our  review, we obtained reverse auction data from FedBid. We used this data  to: (1) confirm that the Departments of the Army (Army), Homeland  Security (DHS), the Interior (DOI), and Veterans Affairs (VA) were primary  users of reverse auctions; (2) determine the types of products and  services acquired by these agencies; (3) compute the fees charged by  FedBid for its services; and (4) analyze the savings. By relying on the  FedBizOpps data, we also selected the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA)  for examination because it had the greatest number of reverse auctions  that did not use FedBid.

Agency officials told us that  providing the data for each auction would require them to review all  contract files to determine whether a reverse auction had been used.

We also spoke with organizations  representing government contractors to obtain their positions on the  federal government\u2019s use of reverse auctions. To understand how  contracting officers conducted market research, determined government  estimates, and made source selections, we selected a random sample of  119 contract files for acquisitions that used reverse auctions in fiscal year  2012 for the Army, DHS, DOI, and VA and reviewed the contract files.  The results of our sample are generalizable to the entire population of  19,688 reverse auctions conducted at the four agencies during fiscal year  2012.

Unlike a traditional auction, in which multiple buyers bid against one  another to push the price up, reverse auctions enable a buyer to evaluate  proposals submitted from multiple sellers, in which sellers compete  against one another to provide the lowest price or highest-value offer.  After considering all offers, the buyer selects the winning proposal, often  at a reduced price. Figure 1 compares these two types of auctions.", "Prior to 1997, auctioning techniques were prohibited in the federal  government under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) procedures  for negotiated procurements. Agencies were prohibited from advising an  offeror of where its bid stood compared with those of other offerors and  furnishing information about other offerors\u2019 prices, both of which are key   tenets of a reverse auction. In 1997, the FAR Council rewrote Part 15 of  the FAR to eliminate these prohibitions as part of an overall effort to make  the source selection process more innovative, simplify the process, and  facilitate a best value acquisition approach. Currently, while the FAR  does not specifically address reverse auctions, several provisions  facilitate agencies\u2019 use of them, such as allowing the use of innovative  strategies and electronic commerce. OFPP has considered the necessity  for government-wide guidance on reverse auctions numerous times since  1997, when the auctions prohibition was removed from the FAR. In  October 2000, the FAR Council issued a notice in the Federal Register  requesting information from the acquisition community to help determine  the best approach to inform thinking regarding the use of reverse auction  techniques. In 2007, when responding to the Conference Report  accompanying the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year  2006, OFPP conducted a survey of both sellers and buyers to assess  how federal government buying activities could most effectively use  reverse auctions to increase savings. According to OFPP officials, neither  of these efforts resulted in guidance being provided to federal agencies.", "In 2001, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued guidance on acquiring  commercial items that stated where competition exists, the reverse  auction environment results in driving down the sellers\u2019 offered prices.  Since then, several reviews have addressed agencies\u2019 use of reverse  auctions. In 2003, the Army Corps of Engineers concluded that the  method was useful for commodities purchases but was not suitable for  construction services acquisitions. In 2004, we reported that the U.S.  Postal Service claimed over $5.9 million in savings by using reverse  auctions in fiscal year 2003; however, we found that $2.1 million of the  claimed savings was questionable because of incorrect baseline data. We  also noted that the Postal Service may not have obtained the lowest  prices possible when, in about a quarter of the auctions, it received only  one bid.

While the FAR is silent on  reverse auctions specifically, agency officials told us contracting officers  are required to follow other applicable acquisition procedures as outlined  in the FAR and agencies\u2019 specific acquisition regulations when deciding  to use a reverse auction and then throughout the auction and award  process. For example, the program office or contracting officers are  required to conduct market research for acquisitions above the simplified  acquisition threshold (currently $150,000) or, for acquisitions below that  threshold, when adequate information is not available and the  circumstances justify its cost. The contracting officer is also expected to  determine whether an acquisition will be set aside for small businesses if  it generally has an estimated value exceeding $3,000 but not over  $150,000, and to follow simplified acquisition procedures to the greatest  extent possible for all purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition  threshold. When using a reverse auction, contracting officers can utilize  an existing contract vehicle, such as the GSA Schedule, or set aside the  procurement for certain small business communities, where appropriate  under applicable regulations. Contracting officers determine other  features as well, including the length of the auction and the amount of  information available to bidders about each other\u2019s bids.

When the reverse auction ends and the  contracting officer receives the results, the bids, which already include  FedBid\u2019s fee, are ranked from lowest to highest. According to agency  officials, contracting officers are then responsible for determining that the  results of the reverse auction have met the competition, savings, and  other criteria for the procurement, selecting a winning vendor from those  results, and awarding the contract. When the agency receives the goods  or services, it pays the entire bid amount to the selected vendor, including  the reverse auction fee. FedBid then sends an invoice to the selected  vendor for the reverse auction fee. FedBid caps its fee at 3 percent of the  winning vendor\u2019s bid, but the fee may be less depending on the specifics  of FedBid\u2019s contract with the agency.

Agency officials stated that savings can be calculated using  multiple methods. According to a DLA official, for its reverse auctions,  DLA calculates savings in some situations by calculating the difference  between the award price and the auction\u2019s first bid.", "Using FedBid\u2019s approach, savings from fiscal year 2012 reverse auctions  for the Army, DHS, DOI, and VA totaled more than $98 million. See figure 11 for calculated savings based on the level of interactive bidding.", "However, it is also unclear whether savings due to reverse auctions are  accurate. For example, the estimated savings may be too high since it  includes $24 million in savings from auctions where vendors did not bid  against each other to drive prices lower. Additionally, the accuracy of the  calculated savings depends on the validity of the agency\u2019s target price.  Based on our contract file reviews, we found that most contracting officers  relied on their market research or government independent cost estimate  to establish the target price. However, our analysis shows that the target  price may have been set too low in some cases, because in 1,111  auctions that had interactive bidding among vendors in fiscal year 2012,  the final award price was higher than the target price. For example, VA  conducted a reverse auction to obtain medical equipment and 4,418  vendors were notified. For this reverse auction, two vendors submitted a  total of eight bids, all of which were higher than the target price. A  contracting official stated that since it was best value procurement, the  lowest bid was accepted even though the bid was above the target price."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agencies Lack Data to Independently Evaluate Fees Paid and in Some Cases Pay Two Fees", "paragraphs": ["Four of the agencies we reviewed do not collect their own data, but rather  rely on FedBid to identify their reverse auction activity. We found that  these agencies do not track how much they pay in reverse auction fees.  Without independently collecting or verifying this information, agencies  are not able to independently assess the cost effectiveness of reverse  auctions. In addition, we found that agencies sometimes pay two sets of  fees when using an existing contract vehicle in conjunction with a reverse  auction. When an agency limits a reverse auction to a group of vendors  under a certain contract vehicle, the agency can pay one fee for the  auction and a separate fee for the use of the contract vehicle. For the  agencies in our review, 47 percent of acquisitions using reverse auctions  in fiscal year 2012 were ordered under pre-existing contracts resulting in  $6.5 million in reverse auction fees paid to FedBid. For example, for  reverse auctions resulting in orders under Schedule contracts, the  selected agencies in fiscal year 2012 paid $1.3 million to GSA and VA for  the use of pre-existing contracts and another $2.8 million to FedBid in  reverse auction fees."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Regulations and Guidance Do Not Comprehensively Address Reverse Auctions", "paragraphs": ["The degree to which agencies are able to maximize the benefits of  reverse auctions are hindered by a lack of comprehensive government- wide regulations and guidance. Standards for internal control in the  federal government identify the need for documenting policies and  procedures to ensure appropriate measures are taken to address risk.  Accordingly, the federal government publishes uniform policies and  procedures for federal acquisitions in the FAR, which provides guidance  to federal agencies and that the public, to include vendors, may read to  better understand the federal acquisition process. However, as noted  above, the FAR does not specifically address reverse auctions. Agencies  have developed their own guidance, which generally encourages the use  of reverse auctions for certain types of procurements and highlights the  benefits of competition and savings from reverse auctions. But most  agency guidance does not provide contracting officers with information on  what to do in certain situations, for example, when only one vendor  submits a bid. Only one agency out of five\u2014VA\u2014addresses what action  should be taken when auctions fail to generate interactive bidding, but  even then only requires that contracting officers document that  occurrence in their contract files.", "VA has taken action to gain greater insight into its use of reverse  auctions. In an effort to determine the effect of reverse auctions on the VA  supply chain, in March 2012 the VA Senior Procurement Executive halted  the use of reverse auctions until an assessment of their effect could be  completed. Subsequently, in April 2012, VA issued guidance requiring  contracting activities to develop internal controls and standard operating  procedures to establish independent oversight of reverse auction  procurements, such as determining savings and fees paid. In conducting  our file reviews, we found examples of cases where the contract files are  now including this information. DLA, which manages its own reverse  auction activity, independently collects summary information from its  buying commands on use and savings obtained.", "We found agency officials and vendors were uncertain about how reverse  auctions fees are paid. For example, an Army contracting official  incorrectly believed the vendors are charged the fee by FedBid, and  another Army official stated that vendors may be confused about fees  charged by FedBid, with some vendors believing they are paying the  reverse auction fee, even though it is the procuring agency that does so.  In another case, an Army procurement official told us he believed that if  an auction does not generate any savings, FedBid would not charge a  fee. However, we found that in fiscal year 2012, the selected agencies  paid fees in 33 percent of auctions that did not generate any savings.  Industry representatives also told us that their members were uncertain  who pays the auction fee (it is paid by the ordering agency to the vendor,  who is later invoiced by FedBid).", "Confusion also exists about how reverse auctions are managed. Several  vendors stated that FedBid\u2019s interface creates an additional layer  between the vendor and the end user that can inhibit their efforts to clarify  details in the solicitation\u2014such as the type of material an agency  requires\u2014 that are important in setting a bid price. While questions can  be submitted through FedBid, some vendors told us their questions  concerning the requirements are sometimes ignored if they do so. In fact,  although vendor questions are posted on the FedBid website, it is the  sole responsibility of the contracting officer\u2014not FedBid\u2014to respond to  them.FedBid\u2019s system only invited GSA Schedule holders currently registered  with FedBid to submit bids. However, according to FedBid officials all  GSA Schedule holders are automatically invited to bid, but must register  with FedBid to submit bids. An agency official stated that vendors had  concerns over security and privacy. Another agency official added that  some vendors did not want to register with another contractor, which can  reduce the level of competition and may not result in lower prices.  Additionally, several vendors expressed concerns that the reverse auction  system usually identifies the lowest bidder and is awarded the contract. In  fact, it is the contracting officer\u2019s responsibility to award the contract and,  as discussed above, we estimated that about a quarter of the auctions did  not result in awards to the lowest bidder.", "Further, some contracting officers incorrectly thought that  Government acquisition officials and vendors told us that government- wide guidance on the use of reverse auctions would be useful in clearing  up some of the confusion about the role that reverse auctions play in the  acquisition process. OFPP is responsible for providing overall direction for  government-wide procurement policies, regulations and procedures, and  to promote economy, efficiency, and effectiveness in acquisition  processes. OFPP officials told us that in 2012 they requested agencies to  submit any existing guidance they had, but have yet to determine their  next step. The lack of government-wide guidance addressing the use of  reverse auctions and the confusion within the vendor community about  the process may limit the potential benefits from the use of reverse  auctions."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Recent trends clearly indicate that agencies\u2019 use of reverse auctions is on  the rise. Because the FAR is silent on reverse auctions, agencies are left  to decide when and how to use them. While most reverse auctions have  been used to acquire commercial items of relatively small dollar value,  this is by no means the case across the board. And some agencies are  now considering expanding their use of reverse auctions to buy more  services and for complex auctions. Further, some agencies are directly  encouraging use of reverse auctions for certain procurements without full  information about whether they are, in fact, gaining the intended benefits  from the auctions in terms of competition and savings.", "Confusion about the functions and responsibilities of the reverse auction  contractor and the government, and a lack of transparency regarding the  fees the contractor is charging, suggests that guidance is needed. We  found confusion about who is making final award determinations and the  basis for those determinations. Further, some vendors expressed concern  that they were not able to contact the contracting officer directly with  questions pertinent to a given requirement. And while we found that the  contractor did not charge a fee in about 20 percent of fiscal year 2012  auctions, it is troubling that agencies are not aware of the fees they are  paying\u2014including paying more than one fee under certain circumstances.  More transparency about the reverse auction fees could help contracting  officers determine whether use of an auction is the best tool for a given  procurement.", "Certain issues that are not addressed by agencies and could be included  in government-wide guidance are whether reverse auctions should be limited to commercial items; be used only for simple services acquisitions; and be used only for items of a relatively low dollar value ($150,000 or  less).", "In addition, factors that could be considered in government-wide guidance  to help ensure that the intended benefits of reverse auctions are  maximized include:  steps, if any, contracting officers should take when only one bid is  received;  factors contracting officers should consider when deciding whether to  use a reverse auction to place orders under certain contract vehicles,  such as the GSA Schedule; and whether contracting officers should be urged to examine whether the  lowest price, plus any applicable fee(s), actually results in a savings  below the target price when deciding to follow through with an award."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To help mitigate confusion about the use of reverse auctions in federal  acquisitions, we recommend that the Director of the Office of  Management and Budget take the following two actions:  (1) Take steps to amend the FAR to address agencies\u2019 use of reverse  auctions.

The award information identifies when reverse auctions were used;  however, not all contract award actions are required to be announced in  FedBizOpps. Over 99 percent of the reverse auctions for fiscal year 2012  listed in FedBizOpps showed that the agencies used the same contractor,  FedBid, Inc. (FedBid), to conduct their reverse auctions. Because the  federal agencies did not maintain the level of detailed information needed  for our review, we obtained reverse auction data from FedBid. We used  this data to: (1) confirm that the Departments of the Army (Army),  Homeland Security (DHS), the Interior (DOI), and Veterans Affairs (VA)  were primary users of reverse auctions; (2) determine the types of  products and services acquired by these agencies; (3) compute the fees  charged by FedBid for its services; and (4) analyze the savings. We used  the data for Army, DHS, DOI, and VA to determine how agencies used  reverse auctions in their acquisitions; these agencies comprised  approximately 69 percent of government-wide reverse auction activity  based on FedBid data. By relying on the FedBizOpps data, we also  selected the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) for examination because it  had the greatest number of reverse auctions that did not use FedBid.  Together, these five agencies represented approximately 70 percent of  government-wide reverse auction activity during fiscal year 2012 based  on FedBid and FedBizOpps data. We were not able to perform detailed  analysis of DLA data for fiscal year 2012, because the agency collected  only summary level information. Agency officials told us that providing the  data for each auction would require reviewing the contract file to  determine whether a reverse auction had been used. We determined that  it would not be good use of DLA\u2019s resources to conduct that review.  However, we interviewed DLA officials and obtained their summary level  information to assess the agency\u2019s use of reverse auctions.", "To determine the reliability of the data obtained, we selected a random  sample of all contract files for acquisitions where reverse auctions were  used in fiscal year 2012 for the four agencies and compared the data  obtained by the service provider, FedBid, with the information contained  in the contract files and determined that the data was sufficiently reliable  for our purposes. Table 1 shows the number of contract files reviewed at  each of the four selected agencies. We relied on FedBid to determine if a  vendor used automatic-rebid to lower its original bid. According to  FedBid officials, automatic-rebids are not counted as new bids but are  considered part of the original bids. The use of automatic-rebids  information was not included in the contract files and therefore, we were  not able to independently verify this information.", "We randomly selected 119 reverse auctions from the set of all auctions  conducted in fiscal year 2012 by the Army, DHS, DOI, and VA. The  results of our sample are generalizable to the entire population of 19,688  reverse auction conducted at the four agencies during fiscal year 2012.  All percentage estimates from the file review have margins of error at the  95 percent confidence level of plus or minus 7 percentage points or less,  unless otherwise noted. Because we followed a probability procedure  based on random selections, our sample is only one of a large number of  samples that we might have drawn. Since each sample could have  provided different estimates, we express our confidence in the precision  of our particular sample\u2019s results as a 95 percent confidence interval  (e.g., plus or minus 7 percentage points).

We obtained documentation from  the contract files concerning the independent government cost estimate  and market research information to determine how the auction\u2019s target  price was established. We also requested information on whether small  business participants were considered, why decisions were made to use  reverse auctions, the technical and price evaluation, and the source  selection decisions. We also determined if the contract was awarded to  the lowest bidding vendor and if the file contained documentation showing  the estimated savings and fees for using reverse auctions. We did not  systematically assess the relationship between auction outcomes and the  selected acquisition strategy or specific design features.
