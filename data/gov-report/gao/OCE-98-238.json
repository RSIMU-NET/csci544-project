According to the rating agencies, taxes levied on a broader range of goods, services, and population are stronger and less volatile than those derived from narrower bases. The current tax structure that was established in fiscal year 1995 to provide financing for predevelopment activities for the proposed new center is comprised of the hotel occupancy tax, hotel sales tax, corporate franchise, unincorporated franchise, restaurant meals, alcoholic beverages, and automobile rental taxes.20, 21 On June 16, 1998, the D.C. City Council approved a change to the dedicated tax structure that will be available effective October 1, 1998, to guarantee the repayment of revenue bonds issued to finance the construction of the new center. After the Council changes become effective, WCCA will essentially rely on taxes levied on hospitality industries to finance the construction costs of the project. The District\u2019s hotel sales tax rate was increased from 13 percent to 14.5 percent, of which WCCA will receive 4.45 percent. WCCA\u2019s existing rate is 2.5 percent.

As a result of the change to the dedicated tax structure, 71 percent of WCCA\u2019s total dedicated tax revenues are expected to come from the hotel sales tax and the remaining 29 percent from the restaurant sales and automobile rental taxes. Convention centers in Dallas, Baltimore, and New Orleans have been funded primarily by a hotel sales tax.", "Historical performance of the revenue stream. The rating agencies analysis also includes a review of multiyear historical data for collections of the dedicated revenues. According to the rating agencies, 5 years of historical data are usually a good indicator of how the tax is likely to perform in the future. Table 4 shows the collection history of the taxes currently dedicated to the project.", "Table 4 shows that during fiscal years 1993-1997, total tax collections grew by an average annual rate of about 8.7 percent. The hotel sales, restaurant, and automobile rental taxes\u2019 combined annual rate of growth averaged 6.6 percent over the same period. These taxes experienced rate increases in fiscal year 1995. According to the District, the increase in collections also reflects improvement in the District\u2019s economy, including the increase in the number of tourists to the District. WCCA\u2019s tax receipt data for fiscal year 1998 shows receipts being about $4.6 million higher through May 1998 than for the same period of time last year.", "Underlying economic strength. Since economic conditions are an important factor for the future stream of dedicated taxes, rating agencies evaluate the underlying strength of those parts of the economy most relevant to the dedicated taxes. For example, if the dedicated tax is mainly generated by local residents, such as the restaurant tax, the evaluation would focus on the strength of the local economy. If the tax is mainly generated by visitors, such as the hotel sales tax, the evaluation would include the economies of the areas from which visitors come. In cities like Washington, D.C., which attracts visitors from all over the country and the international community, the future stream of hotel sales tax is likely to be influenced by the strength of the national economy.", "WCCA\u2019s financing plan assumes 1 percent growth in dedicated tax revenues under the new dedicated tax structure beginning in fiscal year 1999. According to WCCA\u2019s chief financial officer, the 1 percent growth assumption is conservative when compared to historical trends in collections. To evaluate the reasonableness of WCCA\u2019s tax projection, we reviewed the historical trends, as discussed above, the underlying strength of the economy most relevant to the dedicated taxes and the District of Columbia government\u2019s and Coopers & Lybrand\u2019s methodologies and assumptions used in projecting the future stream of revenues.", "The U.S. economy is projected to grow at a moderate rate over the next decade.

The District forecasts average annual growth in revenues for the hotel and restaurant taxes combined over fiscal years 1999 to 2007 to be about 2.1 percent, while Coopers\u2019 forecast reflects combined average annual growth of about 3.4 percent. These estimates are substantially less than the combined average annual growth rate of 6.6 percent in these same taxes between fiscal years 1993 and 1997.", "To evaluate the reasonableness of Coopers\u2019 projected revenues from the hotel tax, we reviewed its key assumptions and its U.S. lodging industry forecast model. The model estimates future hotel room demand, hotel room starts, and hotel room rate inflation. Key predictors for these variables are real GDP, the inflation-adjusted average daily rate, and the lagged occupancy level, respectively. Based on the WEFA forecasts discussed above, the Coopers\u2019 report assumed that the U.S. economy will continue to grow at about 2.3 percent. It also assumed that the District\u2019s lodging market will not experience significant demand or supply shocks during this period. The Coopers\u2019 lodging industry forecast model for the District is driven by the U.S. forecast model. Coopers estimates that hotel room demand between 1999-2001 in the District will increase at or slightly above the U.S. industry trend growth. Beyond the year 2001, hotel room demand growth is expected to decrease to levels at or slightly below those for the U.S. lodging industry as a whole. The growth in total hotel room revenue to the District during 1998-2007 is expected to average 4.7 percent annually.", "Based on an analysis of historical data, Coopers determined that the number of District households and the District\u2019s gross income can predict restaurant taxable sales. They estimate that during 1999-2007, restaurant sales will increase at an annual rate of about 1.6 percent, lower than the projected rate of inflation. The estimate is based on the assumption that the District\u2019s gross income will grow slightly in nominal terms. Coopers assumed that the number of households will continue to decline but at a lower rate than the previous years.", "Coopers\u2019 assumptions are generally consistent with the outlook provided by independent sources discussed above. Accordingly, the projected rate of growth in dedicated taxes appears to be reasonable.", "The District\u2019s Office of Tax and Revenue (OTR) projections are derived from a time-series forecasting model. Using a standard time-series model, OTR estimates future hotel and restaurant tax revenues using monthly historical tax collection data. These estimates were then fine-tuned using projected inflation and personal income under the assumption that these variables will influence the future trend of tax revenues. Based on the DRI forecasts, OTR assumed an annual inflation of 2.4 percent and an annual growth in personal income of 2.5 percent during 1997-2002. OTR assumed no major changes in the District\u2019s economic circumstances and in the future success of collection practices. Overall, OTR\u2019s methodology and assumptions appear to be conservative as reflected in their estimated projected growth rates of the hotel and restaurant taxes discussed above.", "Based on our analysis of trends in collections of hotel sales, restaurant and automobile rental taxes, the national/local economic outlook, the District\u2019s and Coopers & Lybrand\u2019s assumptions, WCCA\u2019s growth assumption of 1 percent to support the bond financing seems conservative. Assuming that the District\u2019s forecast of annual average growth of about 2 percent holds true, WCCA stands to gain an additional $63 million for fiscal years 1999 through 2007, which could be used to retire the bonds earlier than their stated maturity dates.", "Absence of legislative risk.

The $10 million anticipated for utility relocation work is expected to be financed with a Community Development Block Grant made available to the District by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. However, until the federal budget is adopted, it is uncertain whether federal funds will be available. Therefore, there is a legislative risk to the financing plan of about $35 million.

WCCA now anticipates entering the bond market in September 1998. Due primarily to the delay in entering the market and because tax revenue collections through May 1998 had been higher than anticipated, WCCA\u2019s available cash for use could be about $15 million higher than the $110 million assumed in the financing plan. Based on dedicated tax collections and expenditures as of May 31, 1998, if WCCA\u2019s projected expenditures are substantially accurate, by September 1, it would have spent an additional $15 million\u2014for a total of about $52 million\u2014on preconstruction activities and would have $73.6 million cash-on-hand to satisfy the reserve requirements.", "Construction Fund Earnings. Based on a preliminary construction draw schedule, the financing plan assumes that about $62.7 million can be generated in interest earnings on bond proceeds of about $550 million. The bond proceeds would be deposited in a construction fund. During the construction period, funds that are not drawn from the account would earn interest at a rate of 5 percent. The interest rate assumption appears reasonable when compared to the rate of earnings on WCCA\u2019s dedicated tax revenue investments over the past 3 years. When analyzing this type of funding mechanism, the rating agencies\u2019 primary concerns are whether the construction estimate is reasonable and what source of funds would be used to address the shortfall should the earning assumption fall short. According to WCCA\u2019s underwriter, at the time of bond issuance, WCCA plans to obtain a fully flexible investment agreement, which will include guaranteed investment earnings and conditions that stipulate that there would be no penalty should additional funds be required to satisfy project needs.", "Reserve Requirements. The financing plan assumes that about 15 percent, or $126 million of the $846 million funds identified, will be used to establish the following reserves: debt service, operations and marketing, renewal and replacement, and rate/revenue stabilization. Reserves are established to strengthen the bond transaction. We spoke with rating agencies\u2019 officials regarding the adequacy of WCCA\u2019s reserves. There appear to be no established guidelines regarding the level of funding for each reserve. The actual character and amount of each reserve is shaped by several factors: the quality of the dedicated tax revenues, anticipated ongoing needs of the facility, economic projections, availability of funds, and bond insurers and rating agency concerns. WCCA\u2019s underwriter states that the estimated reserve requirements are more than adequate and necessary to achieve the lowest possible cost of borrowing."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Site Selection Process Has Long History", "paragraphs": ["Discussion about building a larger convention center was underway at the time the existing convention center opened in 1983. The site at Mount Vernon Square was identified as a preferred site as early as 1986. Since that time, a number of studies have examined alternative sites in various parts of the city, with the Mount Vernon Square site repeatedly being selected as the most viable site, given its location in the downtown core, amidst the kind of amenities that make possible a thriving convention center, with its associated economic benefits.", "Research results included in our February 1998 report demonstrated that convention centers generally cannot earn enough direct revenues to cover all of their recurring operating costs or their construction costs. However, cities sponsor convention centers with the expectation for significant direct and indirect economic benefits to the area, from spending by out-of-town convention delegates, that will increase local tax revenues to offset operating losses and construction costs of convention centers. In addition, based on Coopers & Lybrand\u2019s Analysis for the Proposed Washington Convention Center, the proposed convention center is estimated to generate approximately $1.1 billion of total output in year 2002 within the metropolitan D.C. area, increasing to about $1.4 billion in 2006. Further, results indicated that the most important factor to a convention center\u2019s success in attracting a large number of out-of-town delegates who spend a significant amount of money is location in a desirable city and near hotels, restaurants, and shopping.", "WCCA determined that Mount Vernon Square was the most advantageous site selected because it offered a variety of favorable attributes: proximity to existing hotels, restaurants, and museums, the presence of an existing Metrorail station, and entertainment venues and other tourist points of interest.", "Section 215 of the Washington Convention Center Authority Act of 1994 (1994 Act), states that Mount Vernon Square was where the new convention center \u201cshould be located.\u201d In the same section, it says that the Mayor \u201cmay evaluate\u201d other sites and \u201cshould specifically evaluate 2 sites:\u201d Northeast No. 1 and the site located at the Anacostia Metro.", "When the 1994 Act was passed, the latter two sites had already been evaluated (along with nine others) in a financial feasibility study conducted between 1991 and 1993 by Deloitte and Touche. In 1996, Northeast No. 1 and the Anacostia Metro were again evaluated by WCCA along with 14 other sites when it prepared a study regarding the project. WCCA determined that both the Northeast site and the Anacostia Metro site did not compare favorably with Mount Vernon Square, largely because of their isolated locations, distance from hotels, and other amenities. When a final Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) was prepared for the National Capital Planning Commission in April 1997, it rated the Mount Vernon Square site as more acceptable.", "In June 1997 the federal Commission of Fine Arts gave its preliminary approval to a design for the convention center at Mount Vernon Square.
