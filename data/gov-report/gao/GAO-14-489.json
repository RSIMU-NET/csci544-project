This can slow  collaboration on telehealth services, and tribes that do not use the IHS  or VA platform would need to obtain the necessary technology. For  example, in one site visit area, integration of THP and VA telehealth  has been challenged by differences in technical connectivity and  information security policies.

While there are currently  over 130 facilities covered under such agreements, as of April 8, 2014  only 86 had received reimbursement for services provided in fiscal  year 2014. According to agency officials, although many agreements  are in place, it may take some time before reimbursement will begin at  some IHS and THP facilities. Before reimbursement can begin,  eligible Native American veterans must be identified as such.  However, the previously mentioned challenges of a lack of data that  identifies veterans as Native Americans and high staff turnover among  IHS facilities have hindered efforts to identify these eligible individuals,  according to officials. VA officials said that it takes time to firmly  establish the procedures for providing and transmitting complete  claims information. For example, some THP facilities do not have the  ability to file electronic claims and therefore the process for submitting  claims needs to be worked out at each THP, sometimes using paper  filing. Officials also said that in some cases the time required to  establish reimbursement procedures is extended as a result of staff  turnover at THPs. In one case it took a year before the THP\u2019s staff  consistently provided the necessary information on submitted claims  forms.", "Obstacles to establishing agreements with additional THPs:  Factors such as the time it may take to establish a reimbursement  agreement as well as the perceived lack of need for agreements may  discourage some THPs from pursuing such agreements. Officials said  that while the reimbursement agreement between VA and IHS applies  to all IHS facilities, VA\u2019s agreements with THPs need to be negotiated  individually and are based on each tribal facility\u2019s specific  circumstances, such as whether it has the accreditation status  required by VA to provide care for veterans, and assessment of these  unique situations will require time and resources. VA and IHS  officials said that some THPs may choose not to invest the time and  resources needed to establish agreements for a variety of reasons.  For example, the THP may be located near a VA facility and not  believe it is necessary to establish such an arrangement. One THP  official we interviewed noted that it can take a long time to develop a  reimbursement agreement with VA. THP officials cited a range of  issues that need to be worked out in these agreements, such as the  reimbursement rate, requirements for provider credentialing and  privileging, and whether electronic health records would be  exchanged. VA has created a template for agreements with THPs  which addresses these issues and may expedite the process of  finalizing agreements. However, VA officials noted that THPs may  propose changes to the template language, and each agreement  requires a legal review and a contracting officer\u2019s review and  signature.

This is demonstrated in a number  of ways. First, according to officials, the Joint Implementation Task Force  has not created any written policy or guidance that specifically defines  roles and responsibilities for agency staff under the MOU. Moreover, key  members of the Joint Implementation Task Force attributed their lack of  tracking and oversight of the MOU activities in part to their perception that  other work-related responsibilities had a higher priority than some of their  MOU related responsibilities. The leaders of the Joint Implementation  Task Force from both agencies reported that MOU responsibilities were  not their top priority, and that resource constraints have affected their  ability to focus attention on oversight of MOU implementation. For  example, officials from ORH reported that, while it is the lead office within  VA responsible for MOU-related activities, it is also responsible for many  other initiatives. The office experienced staff turnover in 2012 and 2013,  replacing 4 of its 11 staff members, including members of the leadership  team. As a result, current leadership and some staff have only been in  their current positions since April 2013 or later and have not had time to  fully focus on MOU implementation and oversight. Similarly, an IHS  official stated that IHS has limited resources, that agency staff are  stretched in order to complete their primary responsibilities, and that  activities related to the MOU are a part of their additional  responsibilities.", "VA and IHS officials reported that they have plans to examine efforts to  implement the MOU by looking at the effectiveness of the work group  structure. Specifically, VA and IHS have entered into an agreement to  have VA\u2019s National Center for Organization Development undertake an  assessment of the views of work group members about their experience  and about whether they think the goals of the MOU are being met. The  assessment is scheduled to be completed by May 2014 and, according to  officials, will be used to identify best practices for improved efficiency and  effectiveness, or the need for adjustments to organizational structure or  processes.

At the same time, many of the 12 site  visit interviews we conducted also included one or more positive  comments about cultural competency.

Moreover,  many Native American veterans and their representatives we contacted  believed that the agencies need to build upon actions already taken to  improve access for Native American veterans.
