Data from a 2003 DOD-wide survey suggests that servicemembers who were deployed for at least 30 days reported similar levels of financial health or problems as those who had not deployed. For example, of junior enlisted personnel, 3 percent of the deployed group and 2 percent of the nondeployed group indicated that they were in \"over their heads\" financially; and 13 percent of the deployed group and 15 percent of the nondeployed group responded that they found it \"tough to make ends meet but keeping your head above water\" financially. However, problems receiving family separation allowance and communicating with creditors may result in financial difficulties for some deployed servicemembers. Based on DOD pay data for January 2005, almost 6,000 of 71,000 deployed servicemembers who had dependents did not obtain their family separation allowance in a timely manner. Furthermore, problems communicating with creditors--caused by limited Internet access, few telephones and high fees, and delays in receiving ground mail--can affect deployed servicemembers' abilities to resolve financial issues. Additionally, some financial products marketed to servicemembers may negatively affect their financial condition. DOD has taken a number of steps to assist servicemembers with their financial needs, although some of this assistance has been underutilized. These steps include PFM training for servicemembers, which is required by all four military services. DOD also provides free legal assistance on purchase contracts for large items and other financial documents. However, according to the attorneys and other personnel, servicemembers do not make full use of available legal services because they may not take the time to visit the attorney's office or they fear information about a financial problem would get back to the command and limit their career progression. In addition, each service has a relief or aid society designed to provide financial assistance through counseling and education as well as financial relief through grants or no-interest loans. Some servicemembers in our focus groups stated that they would not use relief from a service society because they take too long, are intrusive, require too much in-depth financial information, or may be career limiting if the command found out. Servicemembers may use non-DOD resources if they do not want the command to be aware of their financial conditions or they need products or support not offered through DOD, the services, or the installation. Although DOD has taken these steps to assist servicemembers with their financial needs, it does not have the results-oriented departmentwide data needed to assess the effectiveness of its PFM programs and provide necessary oversight. Without an oversight framework requiring evaluation and a reporting relationship between DOD and the services, DOD and Congress do not have the visibility or oversight needed to assess the effectiveness of DOD's financial management training and assistance to servicemembers."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss the financial service needs of  military personnel and their families.

DOD\u2019s Social Compact, which is part of its human capital  strategic plan, notes that mission readiness and quality of life depend on  whether servicemembers use their financial resources responsibly. Some  adverse effects that may result when servicemembers experience serious  financial problems include loss of security clearances, criminal or  nonjudicial sanctions, or adverse personnel actions including possible  discharge from the military. Servicemembers with serious financial issues  may also have an adverse impact on the readiness of the unit. For  example, servicemembers\u2019 financial problems may take the  servicemembers and possibly their unit commanders away from their  primary duties in order to address problems with creditors.

Among other  things, the PFM programs provide financial literacy training to  servicemembers, particularly to junior enlisted personnel during their first  months in the military. The group-provided financial literacy training is  supplemented with other types of financial management assistance, often  on a one-on-one basis. For example, servicemembers might obtain one-on- one counseling from staff in their unit or legal assistance attorneys at the  installation.", "In May 2003, the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel  and Readiness, DOD\u2019s policy office for the PFM programs, established its  Financial Readiness Campaign, with objectives that include increasing  personal readiness by, among other things, (1) increasing financial  awareness and abilities and (2) increasing savings and reducing  dependence on credit. The campaign attempted to accomplish these  objectives largely by providing on-installation PFM program providers  with access to national-level programs, products, and support.", "To minimize financial burdens on servicemembers, DOD has requested  and Congress has increased cash compensation for active duty military  personnel. For example, the average increases in military basic pay  exceeded the average increases in private-sector wages for each of the 5  years prior to when we issued our April 2005 report. Also, in April 2003,  Congress increased the family separation allowance from $100 per month  to $250 per month and hostile fire/imminent danger pay from $150 per  month to $225 per month for eligible deployed servicemembers. The  family separation allowance is designed to provide compensation to  servicemembers with dependents for the added expenses (e.g., extra  childcare costs, automobile maintenance, or home repairs) incurred  because of involuntary separations such as deployments in support of  contingency operations like Operation Iraqi Freedom. Hostile  fire/imminent danger pay provides special pay for \u201cduty subject to hostile  fire or imminent danger\u201d and is designed to compensate servicemembers  for physical danger.

The family separation allowance  of $250 per month is designed to compensate servicemembers for extra  expenses (e.g., childcare costs) that result when they are involuntarily  separated from their families. Delays in obtaining this allowance could  cause undue hardship for some families faced with such extra expenses.  We previously reported similar findings for the administration of family  separation allowance to Army Reserve soldiers and recommended that the  Secretary of the Army, in conjunction with the DOD Comptroller, clarify  and simplify procedures and forms for implementing the family separation  allowance entitlement policy.", "The services had different, sometimes confusing, procedures that  servicemembers performed to obtain their family separation allowance.  DOD officials suggested other factors to explain why some eligible  servicemembers had not received their family separation allowance on a  monthly basis. These factors included servicemembers might not have  been aware of the benefit, they may not have filed the required eligibility  form, or errors or delays might have occurred when their unit entered data  into the pay system.

In addition, some Army servicemembers told us that they  (1) could not call stateside toll-free numbers because the numbers were  inaccessible from overseas or (2) incurred substantial costs\u2014sometimes  $1 per minute\u2014to call stateside creditors.

These products usually provided a small amount of  additional death benefits and had much higher premiums than those for  the government insurance. These products also had provisions to use  accumulated savings to pay the insurance premiums if the  servicemembers stopped making payments.
