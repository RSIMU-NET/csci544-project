While academic studies indicate that it is difficult to quantify the funds used as incentives, particularly given differing definitions of incentives, the use of federal funds for such purposes appears to be more limited than the use of state and local funds. Although academic studies question the overall role and significance of incentives in firms' decisions to (re)locate, researchers with whom GAO spoke noted that incentives could influence firms that already had narrowed their choices. Nine of the 17 large federal economic development programs restrict the use of program funds to support employer relocation. Seven are grant programs, and two are loan guarantee programs. In many grant programs, initial recipients of funds (states and local governments) provide funds to others (e.g., businesses) to facilitate economic development; in loan guarantee programs, third-party lenders approve businesses for eligibility to receive funds. All nine programs prohibit using federal funds to support a business relocation that causes unemployment, but the thresholds for job loss differ. For example, a single lost job would trigger the provision for six programs, but for the other three programs, the job loss threshold is higher. Federal agencies administering the nine programs with a nonrelocation provision used various procedures, including screening applicants and monitoring recipients, to help ensure compliance, but the extent to which these procedures specifically addressed nonrelocation provisions was limited. The two loan guarantee programs emphasized screening procedures to help ensure compliance, and both programs had written guidance and other mechanisms that specifically addressed nonrelocation provisions. Screening may be effective for helping to ensure compliance in loan guarantee programs because federal agencies know at the time of initial application which businesses are requesting funds and how they plan to use them. In contrast, because of the way grant programs are structured, at the time of initial application, grant applicants do not always know which businesses later will apply for or receive assistance. As a result, officials administering grant programs relied more extensively on monitoring than screening to help identify instances of potential noncompliance. Despite this greater reliance on monitoring, only one of the grant programs GAO reviewed had written monitoring guidance that specifically addressed business relocation restrictions. Without formal policies and procedures, federal agencies have limited assurance that grant recipients and subrecipients are complying with statutory requirements that restrict the use of program funds to support employer relocations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["State and local governments are estimated to spend billions of dollars  annually in business incentives\u2014financial assistance, tax concessions, and  other benefits\u2014in an effort to attract and retain jobs.

In response to concerns about state and local  governments using federal funds to attract jobs to one U.S. community at a  loss of jobs to another community, Congress began to impose restrictions  in the 1950s on some federal programs to prevent funds from being used to  relocate businesses.", "In 1997, we provided an overview of eight major federal programs that  states and localities used at that time for economic development  purposes. However, relatively little is known about how many other  federal economic development programs state and local governments  currently use as incentives to attract employers or about the extent to  which restrictions exist against using funds to support an employer\u2019s  relocation. You noted that in recent years the controversy about the costs  and benefits of using limited government funds to recruit businesses has  been growing and expressed concerns about efforts to help ensure  compliance with restrictions on the use of federal funds.

We also searched the Congressional Research Service\u2019s (CRS)  2006 Tax Expenditure Compendium for economic development tax  expenditure programs with reported estimated tax revenue losses of $500  million or more for fiscal year 2006. We then narrowed the list according  to criteria that enabled us to identify the largest programs most likely to be  candidates as a business incentive. Further, we reviewed the Web sites for  each of the 50 states\u2019 economic development agencies to identify federal  programs typically marketed as business incentives. To identify the  programs with nonrelocation provisions, we reviewed relevant statutes  and regulations and focused on those programs that we identified as the  largest based on our review of CFDA and the CRS Tax Expenditure  Compendium. To assess the completeness of our search results, we  interviewed representatives of selected federal agencies, economic  development trade associations, and policy groups. To assess the extent to  which federal agencies had procedures in place to help ensure compliance  with nonrelocation provisions, we obtained documents from federal  agencies that described the procedures for helping to ensure compliance  and then conducted limited testing of these procedures (typically a  nongeneralizable sample of 10 cases for each program) to determine their  implementation. We did not conduct an overall evaluation of the  programs, evaluate how well the programs served their intended purposes,  or evaluate how nonrelocation provisions affect the relative success of the  programs in achieving their intended purposes.

Proponents maintain that economic  development incentives are an effective means by which states and  communities can compete for jobs. Opponents contend that the dollars  spent to provide incentives would be better used to support activities  believed to have more impact on a community\u2019s economic development,  such as improvements to infrastructure and investments in education to  develop a competitive labor pool.", "While states and localities compete with one another to attract businesses,  some states and localities have attempted to curtail the use of economic  development funds to relocate jobs. According to two policy groups  promoting accountability in economic development, three cities\u2014Austin,  Texas; Gary, Indiana; and Vacaville, California\u2014and nine states\u2014 Alabama, Connecticut, Florida, Iowa, Maryland, New Mexico, New York,  Ohio, and Wisconsin\u2014prohibit using city and state resources, respectively,  to relocate jobs within their boundaries. For example, both policy groups  state that the Gary, Indiana, city ordinance prohibits tax abatements for  the relocation of existing jobs from outside the corporate limits of the city.  One of the groups also said that in Puerto Rico, the governor may refuse  any business application for tax incentives if doing so would adversely  affect the business\u2019 employees in any state in the United States. Regional  entities also have established formal and informal agreements to curtail  the competition for businesses and jobs within their boundaries.

According to the  Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), employers reported that a total of  894,739 workers lost their jobs because of extended layoffs in 2006 that  resulted from a variety of economic factors, such as bankruptcy and  reorganizations. A BLS survey of employers found that 20,199 of these  losses (about 2 percent) occurred because of business relocations within  the United States, the majority across state lines. Another source\u2014the  National Establishment Time Series (NETS)\u2014uses proprietary Dun &  Bradstreet data on U.S. companies to track business relocations.  According to a representative of the company that maintains the NETS  data, more than 2.8 million businesses have relocated since 1990 and about  100,000 of these (or almost 4 percent) occurred across state lines.", "A number of federal programs fund or support economic development  activities.

For example, according to USDA officials, EZs  and ECs often leverage federal program resources to obtain other funds,  thereby attracting businesses. Similarly, businesses located in EZs and  ECs can claim various state and federal tax credits, including IRS\u2019s Work  Opportunity Tax Credit, which provides tax credits to employers hiring  individuals residing in an EZ or EC. According to our January 2007 report  on the New Markets Tax Credit program, these credits can be packaged  with other types of incentives, such as EZ/EC incentives or state and local  tax abatements, to make the investments in economically distressed  communities more attractive to investors such as banks. We previously  have reported that more than one-fourth of New Markets Tax Credit  projects were located in federally designated EZs. State and local  governments also can use federal economic development funds to support  economic development activities, thereby freeing up state and local funds  for business incentives or other uses.", "Based on our review of state economic development Web sites, states  appear to market all but 3 of the 17 programs (Community Facilities Loans  and Grants, Farm Ownership Loans, and Farm Operating Loans being the  exceptions). The programs that appear to be marketed more than others  are the CDBG programs, SBA\u2019s 7(a) and 504 loan guarantees, and private  activity bonds (at least 19 states appear to advertise each of these as  incentives). Benefits from EZs, ECs, or Renewal Communities, and job- training programs funded with WIA funds were the next most marketed  incentives, with at least nine states offering them. This appears to be  somewhat consistent with what site-selection consultants told us about  the specific federal incentives they see in business incentive packages. The  consultants told us that they see CDBG loans funded with Entitlement and  State block grants, private activity bonds, EZ/EC benefits and,  increasingly, customized job-training funds in incentive packages. In  contrast to the results of our Web site reviews, the consultants did not cite  SBA loans as being among federal resources included in business  incentive packages."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Use of Federal Funds as Business Incentives Appears to Be More Limited Than Use of State and Local Funds", "paragraphs": ["Although federal programs are marketed as business incentives, the  amount of federal funds used as incentives appears to be more limited  than the amount of state and local funds used. While the precise amount of  federal funds used as incentives is not available, the Congressional Budget  Office (CBO) estimated that the federal government spent $27.9 billion to  support commerce and business in addition to $2.2 billion on credit  programs in 1995. CBO also indicated that the federal government  provides the bulk of its support to businesses through tax provisions. CBO  estimated tax revenue losses of at least $32.2 billion for the provision of  the tax code that yielded the largest amount of direct support for  businesses\u2014depreciation of capital assets in excess of the alternative  deprecation system\u2014but did not provide total estimates of foregone  revenue associated with all tax provisions. It is not clear from the CBO  report whether and to what extent state and local governments also used  these programs and tax provisions as incentives. We reviewed academic  studies on economic development business incentives offered from 1995  to 2005 and interviewed the authors of these studies. The academic  literature on economic business incentives generally focuses on state and  local government incentives rather than federal incentives. Academic  studies estimate that state and local governments spent from $20 to $50  billion annually on business incentives. While the amount of federal funds  used as business incentives has not been measured to any great extent,  some researchers with whom we spoke said that the amount of federal  funds used as business incentives is likely limited compared to the amount  of state and local funds used as incentives.", "One limitation in developing estimates of federal, state, and local funds  spent on incentives is defining what constitutes a business incentive. For  example, a state or local government might offer indirect benefits, such as  infrastructure improvements, to attract or retain businesses, but these  might not be counted in estimates as business incentives. Moreover,  although the amount of federal economic development funds available as  incentives appears to be limited, money can be fungible, or freely  interchangeable, at the state and local level. Thus, even though the amount  of federal funds used as incentives might be limited, state and local  governments could leverage those funds to free up their own resources for  incentives or for other purposes that support businesses.", "Furthermore, state and local governments have less discretion over the  use of federal resources than they do over their own, but the degree of  discretion varies with the program. For at least four of the programs  (SBA\u2019s 7(a) and 504 loan programs, USDA\u2019s B&I loan program, and IRS\u2019s  New Markets Tax Credit), state and local governments have no direct role  in funding decisions. For these programs, third-party lenders, development  corporations, or the federal government decide which businesses receive  funds. In contrast, other programs provide states with more discretion  over how they can use funds. For example, under WIA, states and local  areas can use the discretionary and statutory funding from Labor to  develop job training and employer service programs, including customized  job training, which we previously have reported can be an important  factor in a company\u2019s decision to locate in a particular area.", "Finally, the academic literature we reviewed questioned the importance of  incentives in location or relocation decisions. These studies, as well as  published articles in site selection industry magazines, indicate that other  considerations might outweigh economic development incentives when  companies decide where to locate. The studies explained that the critical  factors in deciding were more likely to be the size and education of the  labor force; local infrastructure such as telecommunication lines;  transportation options, such as access to ports, roads, and rail; and access  to consumer markets.

The remaining  three\u2014HUD\u2019s CDBG Entitlement and State programs and SBA\u2019s 504  program\u2014have higher job loss thresholds. In addition to job loss, these  three programs specify other conditions for applying a nonrelocation  provision, such as requiring that the relocations occur across  geographically defined areas.", "HUD regulations for the CDBG Entitlement and State programs make  business relocations ineligible for funding if they involve certain job  losses. Any relocation involving the loss of 500 or more jobs is prohibited.  In contrast, relocations involving the loss of 25 or fewer jobs are exempt  from the nonrelocation provision. For relocations involving between 25  and 500 jobs, the nonrelocation provision applies if the number of jobs lost  equals or exceeds one-tenth of one percent of the number of employed  persons in the labor market experiencing the loss. The CDBG program\u2019s  statute does not specify a job loss threshold; it only requires that the  agency prohibit funding for business relocations that are likely to result in  a significant loss of employment. According to a HUD official, HUD chose  to exempt any relocation involving 25 or fewer jobs because losses of this  magnitude likely would not significantly affect a labor market of any size.  By exempting these smaller businesses from the nonrelocation provision,  this official said that the CDBG program retains some flexibility for  entitlement and nonentitlement communities to provide funds to  businesses to promote job growth. This official further noted that HUD  also determined that relocations involving 500 or more jobs would be  significant for labor markets of any size.", "SBA\u2019s 504 program, which guarantees the portion of a business loan that  nonprofit certified development companies make to businesses, features  potentially higher job loss thresholds. For example, SBA regulations  would require that applications for loans be denied if the relocation would  result in the business\u2019s reducing its workforce by at least one-third, or  serious unemployment would result in the original business location or  any area of the country. SBA regulations allow for the waiver of these job  loss limits if the relocations would be key to the economic well-being of  the business or if the benefits to the applicant and the receiving  community would outweigh the negative impact to the community from  which the applicant would move.", "As noted previously, three of the programs specify conditions in addition  to job loss for applying the nonrelocation provision, such as relocations  occurring across defined geographic areas and funding thresholds. For  example, HUD\u2019s CDBG regulations for both the Entitlement and State  programs prohibit funding for a business that relocates to a different labor  market area. USDA\u2019s B&I program, through which USDA guarantees up  to 80 percent of a loan that an approved third-party lender makes to  businesses, statutorily prohibits program funds from supporting business  relocations in cases in which USDA assistance exceeds $1 million. Our  review of congressional reports indicates that this minimum funding  threshold is intended to expedite the processing of small business  applications, based on the reasoning that the relocation of small  businesses would pose no threat to the labor force or other businesses in  the original location.", "Congressional approval of the nonrelocation provisions for the nine large  programs was spread over a 40-year period (1958 to 1998).

For example, HUD\u2019s application for Round II of the EZ  program contained a form in which an applicant self-certified that \u201cthe  nominating entities shall comply with state, local, and federal  requirements, and have agreed in writing to carry out the Strategic Plan if  designated.\u201d Similarly, HUD\u2019s CDBG program requires applicants to self- certify their compliance with \u201capplicable laws,\u201d which HUD officials said  includes the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, as  amended, which contains the nonrelocation provision. According to the  officials, HUD saw no need or statutory basis to add a special certification  for the nonrelocation provision, particularly since not all states or  entitlement communities use CDBG funding for economic development  purposes. Labor\u2019s statement of compliance, included in WIA state strategic  plans, requires the governor of each state to assure that WIA funds \u201cwill be  spent in accordance with the Workforce Investment Act and the Wagner- Peyser Act and their regulations, written Department of Labor guidance  implementing these laws, and all other applicable federal and state laws  and regulations.\u201d Labor officials noted that this general statement of  compliance covers compliance with the nonrelocation provision.

In-turn, Labor sends the form to  state-level workforce agencies, where the business\u2019 competitors are  located, for analysis and direct solicitation of the competitor\u2019s comments.  According to USDA officials, Labor must complete this third-party  verification before USDA can approve a B&I loan guarantee request.

For example, under the CDBG programs, there is a  two-step process. First, businesses receiving CDBG assistance must  submit a written statement to the recipient (entitlement community or  state), subrecipient, community-based development organization, or  nonprofit providing the assistance whether the activity will result in the  relocation of jobs from one labor market area to another. Second, if the  assistance will not result in the relocation of jobs covered by the statutory  prohibition, the business must provide a certification that it has no plans  to relocate jobs (in a manner that would violate the nonrelocation  provision). However, these statements are not included in a recipient\u2019s  application for funding (action plan), and thus HUD does not review them  during the action plan review process. HUD officials noted that it would  not be possible for an entitlement community to provide these statements  to HUD with an action plan because, as previously noted, most entitlement  communities do not know at that time which businesses will apply for  CDBG assistance. Similar to HUD, Labor\u2019s regulations for WIA require that  local workforce investment boards conduct a pre-award review of  businesses seeking job training funds, which includes obtaining a written  certification from the business indicating whether WIA assistance is being  sought in connection with past or impending job losses at other facilities.", "Our review of 10 approved WIA grants indicated that businesses had  completed the required statements of compliance for each of those grants.  With respect to HUD\u2019s CDBG program, we did find one case in which a  HUD CDBG entitlement community recipient we contacted told us that its  subrecipient (a nonprofit development corporation) was not obtaining the  required written statements of compliance. An official from the  entitlement community said that neither the entitlement community nor  the subrecipient had developed formal procedures to help ensure  compliance with the regulatory requirement. In addition, neither HUD nor  Labor require that recipients provide copies of completed written  statements to HUD or Labor, although a HUD official noted that the  written statements would be available to on-site reviewers during  monitoring visits.

The guide also states that it is critical to identify, prioritize,  and manage potential at-risk subrecipients to ensure that grant goals are  reached and resources are properly used. Due to inherent limitations in  using the screening process to help ensure compliance with nonrelocation  provisions, other procedures, such as monitoring activities, become key  controls. Having established, written procedures in place helps to ensure  that agencies achieve their monitoring objectives and that staff are  consistently implementing monitoring procedures.", "Officials at some of the agencies we reviewed told us that they rely on  complaints as a mechanism to monitor compliance with the employer  nonrelocation provision. A HUD official said that an employer relocation  that resulted in significant job loss and involved the use of federal funds  likely would result in the affected community or state raising a complaint  to the federal agency or to their congressional representatives. HUD,  Labor, SBA, and USDA officials all reported receiving few if any of these  complaints, in some cases over the course of many years. For this reason,  some officials did not consider the risk of noncompliance to pose a  significant risk to the programs. However, this complaint-based approach  is reactive and does not necessarily provide reasonable assurance of  compliance. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government  states that an agency\u2019s monitoring activities should be performed  continually and be ingrained in agency operations. As shown in table 5,  the four agencies administering programs with nonrelocation provisions  used various other mechanisms, including on-site review, to monitor fund  recipients. All of the agencies had formal written guidance covering the  monitoring of program participants. However, only one program\u2014HUD  for its EZ program\u2014had a monitoring procedure that specifically  addressed the nonrelocation provision.", "To effectively leverage limited staff resources, HUD and Labor told us that  their respective agencies conduct on-site monitoring reviews in  accordance with risk-based procedures intended to focus monitoring  resources on areas requiring the most attention. For example, HUD\u2019s  procedures for the EZ program specify factors for reviewers to consider  when determining the scope of a review. These factors include funding  amount, outstanding complaints related to noncompliance with a legal  requirement, and unresolved monitoring or assessment issues. Similarly,  for the CDBG program, reviewers consider factors such as the complexity  of a state or entitlement community\u2019s activities and use of subrecipients to  carry out funded activities. According to HUD CDBG officials, on-site  monitoring is the most effective way to identify potential violations of the  nonrelocation provision for the CDBG program. Labor also conducts on- site monitoring of states and a sample of local workforce investment  agencies. As part of Labor\u2019s risk-based procedures, reviewers may  consider factors such as the number of federal grants a state administers,  a history of disallowed costs or administrative findings in previous  reviews, and percentage of grant funds subcontracted.", "USDA\u2019s monitoring for the EZ/EC program involves two staff members\u2014 one in a state office and the other in the national office\u2014reviewing  requests for drawdown that EZ/ECs make several times during the year.  Drawdown requests include a specification of how an EZ or EC will use its  funds. Prior to disbursing requested funds, USDA staff members review  the request to ensure that the funds will be used to carry out the  community\u2019s strategic plan (which includes a certification form that  specifically refers to the nonrelocation provision and which USDA reviews  at the time of initial application). In addition to reviewing drawdown  requests, USDA staff in both the state and national offices review  mandatory annual reports describing a community\u2019s progress in  implementing its strategic plan. According to USDA officials, the review of  annual reports also includes a review of any updates to the strategic plan  to ensure that no relocation support has crept into the plan since the initial  review. A USDA official added that USDA staff have made on-site  monitoring visits to all of the rural EZ/ECs.", "Officials of SBA\u2019s 504 and USDA\u2019s B&I program told us that they do not  monitor for compliance with the nonrelocation provision because, unlike  federal grant programs, in loan guarantee programs, a federal agency can  determine which specific businesses will receive assistance and for what  purpose (relocation, equipment purchase, etc.) before an agency  guarantees a loan. SBA officials explained that SBA and certified  development companies (CDC) approve a project for 504 financing before  construction begins, but SBA does not disburse loan funds or issue a  debenture guarantee until after the project is completed. According to  SBA officials, CDC staff review the completed project before closing on a  loan, at which time loan funds are disbursed and a debenture guarantee  issued. Similarly, USDA officials told us that their field staff verify uses for  loan proceeds when they review a loan closing package, specifically the  settlement statement, before guaranteeing a loan. USDA officials  explained that once a loan is fully disbursed, subsequent monitoring of the  use of loan proceeds for compliance focuses on other issues, such as the  number of jobs created, rather than compliance with the nonrelocation  provision, because the loan proceeds already have been used for their  intended purposes. The emphasis on screening rather monitoring seemed  appropriate for the two loan guarantee programs since the federal  agencies know which specific businesses are requesting funds and the  purposes for which the funds will be used.", "HUD\u2019s EZ program was the only program we reviewed that had written  monitoring guidance specific to the nonrelocation provision at the time of  our review. As of July 2007, HUD had used this monitoring guidance in  four on-site reviews. HUD\u2019s guide for the review of Round II EZ strategic  plan compliance calls for review staff to determine whether there is \u201cany  evidence to indicate that the EZ is complying with the prohibition against  assisting a business to relocate.\u201d The guide did not provide specific  procedures or steps that staff should follow to make the assessment of  compliance, but rather referred to the program\u2019s implementing regulation  for the nonrelocation provision. HUD officials said that under current  procedures, on-site reviewers rely on receiving complaints of  noncompliance or on information obtained by asking open-ended  questions about compliance to determine whether communities are  complying. For the four reviews in which HUD had used the guidance at  the time of our review, the narrative supporting the reviewer\u2019s assessment  of compliance indicated that approved implementation plans, discussions  with EZ staff regarding standard operating procedures, and a review of  loan file documents were among the bases on which HUD reviewers  determined that EZs were complying with the program\u2019s nonrelocation  provision. HUD officials said that for additional on-site reviews planned  for fiscal year 2007, the agency is considering reviewing implementation  plans to specifically check for compliance with the nonrelocation  provision. HUD officials said that they would focus on plans involving  sites with potential for commercial development to determine whether  HUD-approved activities or projects involving marketing or promotional  efforts encouraged relocations to an EZ.", "HUD and Labor officials told us that their agencies were developing  monitoring guidance specific to the nonrelocation provision for the CDBG  and WIA programs, respectively, but that such guidance is in draft form.  As of July 2007, HUD and Labor had not finalized this guidance or used it  in a monitoring review. HUD officials said that HUD expects to finalize the  monitoring guidance tailored to the nonrelocation provision by December  31, 2007. The officials explained that HUD was developing monitoring  guidance for inclusion in a forthcoming revision to a monitoring handbook  that HUD uses for all of its major Office of Community Planning and  Development grant programs, including the CDBG and EZ programs. HUD  undertook the revisions because the current version of the handbook was  issued prior to the promulgation of the CDBG program\u2019s nonrelocation  provision in December 2005. HUD CDBG officials stated that including a  question on compliance with the nonrelocation provision is intended to  ensure that compliance reviews by HUD staff in this area would be  consistent. Labor officials explained that their monitoring handbook for  employment and training grant programs, including WIA programs, is  generic and limited to examining core activities found in all of Labor\u2019s  employment and training programs. In contrast, Labor\u2019s formula grant  supplement to the monitoring handbook, currently under development and  in draft form, will provide a more detailed examination of statutes, rules,  and regulations specific to the formula-based programs once finalized.

Although it is difficult to determine the  extent to which state and local governments use federal funds as business  incentives, 9 of 17 large federal economic development programs contain  statutory restrictions against using program funds to relocate jobs if the  use of such funds creates unemployment. Thus, for these nine federal  programs, the agencies charged with their administration are responsible  for helping to ensure that program funds are used for intended purposes  and in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, including  compliance with nonrelocation provisions.", "Each of the four agencies that administer the programs with nonrelocation  provisions used screening and monitoring mechanisms to help ensure that  fund recipients were eligible to participate in the programs, meeting  program goals, and complying with legal requirements. The two agencies  administering the loan guarantee programs we reviewed\u2014SBA for the 504  program and USDA for the B&I program\u2014relied primarily upon screening  mechanisms to help ensure that applicants would not use loan proceeds to  relocate businesses and jobs. For these two programs, screening  mechanisms may be sufficient since the agencies can determine which  specific businesses will receive assistance and how the loan proceeds will  be used. In such cases, a screening process can determine if loan funds  will be used to support a business relocation. In contrast, officials from the  other programs we reviewed, particularly those that administer grant  programs, noted limitations in using screening mechanisms for such  programs. For example, with grant programs, fund recipients (e.g., states  and local communities) do not always know which businesses will apply  for or receive funding at the time the recipient submits an initial plan or  application for funding.", "Acknowledging the limitations of screening for helping to ensure  compliance with nonrelocation provisions, agency officials regarded on- site monitoring as the most effective way to detect an instance of potential  noncompliance in their grant programs. However, officials also noted that  they targeted their limited monitoring resources on recipients that posed  the greatest risk. Furthermore, they maintained that noncompliance with  nonrelocation provisions did not present a significant risk to the programs  they administered because they received few or no complaints over the  years and regarded complaints as a barometer for undertaking monitoring  activities.", "We recognize that there are costs associated with monitoring program  recipients for compliance with nonrelocation provisions. Nevertheless, a  reactive approach in which agencies assume there are no problems  because outside parties do not report them, by itself, is an insufficient  means to help ensure that problems do not exist and federal internal  control standards state that monitoring should be performed continually  and be ingrained in agency operations. Further, USDA EZ/EC program  officials said that they have rejected applications for zone designation  because intent to relocate jobs was evident in the applications, providing  evidence that applicants do sometimes seek to use program funds to lure  businesses away from one community to another.", "Given the relatively large size of some federal grant programs and their  complicated funding structure (including the number of recipients and  subrecipients involved in the process), it is important that agencies  develop and use cost-effective approaches to identify, prioritize, and  manage potential at-risk recipients. Specific monitoring guidance and  procedures would provide staff impetus and direction in their monitoring  roles and help ensure consistent monitoring efforts across locations.  Moreover, written guidance would provide recipients and subrecipients  with specific information on the types of business support activities  allowed under each program. For example, we learned that there are HUD  CDBG subrecipients who may be unaware of the requirement that  businesses receiving assistance under the program must provide written  statements of compliance with the nonrelocation provision.

The Adult and Dislocated Workers programs  provide similar services, but differ in their eligibility requirements. The  Youth program is designed to prepare high school students for  employment or postsecondary education. All three programs require that  states and local areas use a one-stop center approach, which consolidates  16 categories of programs under four agencies (Labor, Education, HHS,  and HUD) to provide services for several employment and training  programs. In addition to employee services, state and local workforce  investment boards may use WIA funds from the three programs to provide  services to employers, including helping employers identify and recruit job  candidates. States and local boards can also offer various job training  programs, such as classroom-based, on-the-job, or customized training to  meet employer needs. According to CFDA, fiscal year 2006 estimated  obligations for the WIA Adult, Dislocated Workers, and Youth programs  were $857 million, $1.181 billion, and $926 million, respectively.", "Labor oversees all three WIA programs, but states and local boards have  flexibility over how they use WIA funds.

The states can then set aside up to 15 percent of the funds as  discretionary funds to support state employment activities. (For the  dislocated worker program, the state can set aside no more than 25  percent of the funds for rapid response activities, such as notifying  workers on how to access unemployment and one-stop center benefits in  the event of mass layoffs.)", "The remainder of the funds are distributed to local areas based on a  formula.
