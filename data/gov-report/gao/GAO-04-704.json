After several rescue mishaps that resulted in the deaths of civilians and station personnel, Congress recognized a need to improve performance at stations and appropriated additional funds to increase stations' readiness levels. For fiscal year 2003, the Coast Guard received designated funds of $15.7 million specifically to increase spending for stations' staffing, personal protection equipment (such as life vests and cold weather protection suits), personnel retention, and training needs.

However, this statement cannot be made with certainty, because the Coast Guard's databases do not fully identify expenditures at the station level. GAO worked with the Coast Guard to develop expenditure estimates for the stations, using budget plans and available expenditure data, and this effort produced full or partial estimates for three of the four categories--staffing, personal protection equipment, and personnel retention efforts. For these three categories, fiscal year 2003 expenditure estimates were at least $20.5 million more than the previous year, or about $4.8 million more than the $15.7 million designated appropriation. Although estimates could not be developed for training expenditures, other available information indicates that training levels increased in fiscal year 2003. Taken together, these results suggest that the Coast Guard complied with Congress' direction to increase spending for stations by $15.7 million. Federal management guidelines and internal control standards call for greater accountability for designated--earmarked--appropriations than was provided by the processes the Coast Guard had in place to track these funds. The purpose of an earmark is to ensure agencies spend a certain amount of their appropriated funds for a specific purpose. Guidelines and standards indicate that agencies should account for the obligation and expenditure of earmarked appropriations--a step the Coast Guard thoroughly implemented only for personal protection equipment. Coast Guard officials developed a plan showing how they planned to spend the earmark, but such a plan, while useful as an indication of an agency's intentions, is not sufficient to show that the earmark was expended in accordance with congressional direction."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The nearly 200 Coast Guard multimission stations that dot the nation\u2019s  coastline and interior waterways play an important role in two main Coast  Guard missions\u2014finding and rescuing mariners in danger on the water  and protecting the nation\u2019s coastline as part of the overall homeland  security effort. In 2001, a review conducted after a series of search and  rescue mishaps found that readiness at these stations was decreasing. In  response, Congress began a multiyear funding effort designed to increase  staffing, training, and equipment levels at the stations. As part of this  effort, Congress provided a $15.7 million earmark in the Coast Guard\u2019s  fiscal year 2003 appropriation specifically to support multimission station  operations. In doing so, Congress also directed us to review Coast Guard  expenditures to determine if fiscal year 2003 outlays (levels of effort) for  stations had increased compared with fiscal year 2002 levels by this  amount.

In 2001, Congress directed the  Department of Transportation\u2019s Office of Inspector General (OIG) to  conduct a thorough review of the operational readiness capability of  stations, following a series of accidents involving search and rescue efforts  initiated at these stations. The OIG reported that readiness levels at  stations had been deteriorating for more than 20 years and were  continuing to decline. In response, Congress provided an earmarked  appropriation in fiscal year 2002 and directed the Inspector General to  review the use of the earmarked funds. The OIG found that the Coast  Guard generally complied with the intent of the earmark but also  concluded that improving operational readiness at stations would require  a substantial and sustained investment. The OIG also recommended that  to improve congressional oversight of expenditures, the Coast Guard  should make improvements to its accounting system to allow for the  tracking of certain station expenditures.", "Since the additional funding efforts began, in fiscal year 2002, Coast Guard  officials told us they have, among other actions, added approximately  1,100 personnel to stations, increased levels of personal protection  equipment for station personnel, and started to replace old and  nonstandard boats with new standard boats. In December 2002 the Coast  Guard also developed, in response to a recommendation from the OIG in  its 2001 report and at the direction of the Senate Appropriations  Committee, a draft strategic plan to guide the recruiting and hiring of  personnel.

However, through a combination of data runs and unit surveys performed  at our request, the Coast Guard was able to estimate staffing and  personnel retention expenditures, and develop actual expenditure data for  personal protection equipment (PPE). Within these three categories, the  Coast Guard estimates it spent at least $291 million in fiscal year 2003.

Officials  told us the Coast Guard has separate databases that track costs  incurred by the national training centers, but do not have a database  that can identify training costs expended on personnel after they have  been assigned to stations. Further, expenditures incurred by stations in  providing on-the-job training (a significant component of total training  provided to station personnel) were not available because the Coast  Guard, like many agencies, does not track time spent on this type of  training.", "Using fiscal year 2002 data derived through similar analyses, we  determined that estimated station expenditures for fiscal year 2003  exceeded fiscal year 2002 levels by at least $20.5 million\u2014or $4.8 million  more than the $15.7 million earmarked appropriation. Table 1 shows the  differences in estimated expenditures (levels of effort) by fiscal year for  the three categories that had available data. Only partial data were  available on personnel retention, and no data were available on training  expenditures. Although expenditure data for all personnel retention efforts  were not available, the Coast Guard was able to provide annual  expenditure data for reenlistment bonuses offered to selected  multimission station personnel. Other information we gathered in  discussions with Coast Guard personnel indicates that the Coast Guard\u2019s  levels of effort in station training also increased during fiscal year 2003. In  fiscal year 2003, the Coast Guard increased the number of instructors and  classrooms at two national training centers, which provide training to  station and other personnel, in order to increase the number of total  students graduated. Appendix I describes our methodology for developing  these estimates, and appendix II contains a more detailed description of  the data in each category.", "Because complete comparative data could not be identified for all four  categories, we cannot say with certainty that Coast Guard expenditures  for multimission stations in fiscal year 2003 were at least $15.7 million  above fiscal year 2002 levels.

The purpose of an earmark is to direct an  agency to spend a certain amount of its appropriated funds for a specific  purpose. Federal guidelines and government internal control standards  indicate that agencies should account for the obligation and expenditure  of earmarked appropriations both as a sound accounting practice and to  demonstrate compliance in the event of an audit. The expectation that  agencies will be able to effectively demonstrate compliance in their use of  earmarked funds stems from the following:    Office of Management and Budget Circulars: These circulars hold that  agencies\u2019 management controls should reasonably ensure that laws and  regulations are followed.", "The Federal Managers\u2019 Financial Integrity Act: This act establishes  specific requirements regarding management controls and directs  agency heads to establish controls to reasonably ensure that  obligations and costs comply with applicable laws.", "Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government: These  standards specify that internal controls should provide reasonable  assurance that an agency is in compliance with applicable laws and  regulations.

In response to a recommendation  made in our recent report on the reprogramming of Federal Air Marshal  Service funds, DHS has agreed to make this a requirement.", "The Coast Guard told us at the onset of our review that it did not have  adequate processes in place to collect data with respect to earmarked  expenditures. Although officials had taken steps to account for PPE  expenditures (because purchase receipts could be easily tracked), they  did not have adequate processes in place to account for earmarked funds  spent on staffing and training needs at the station level. Consequently, the  Coast Guard could not demonstrate conclusively that it was complying  with the earmark. Basically, the Coast Guard\u2019s databases were not  designed for this purpose and would have to be modified to provide actual  expenditure data for stations, according to Coast Guard officials. On the  basis of lessons learned from the OIG\u2019s audit in fiscal year 2002, which  faulted the Coast Guard for not having cost accounting systems in place to  allow for the tracking of certain multimission station expenditures, Coast  Guard officials developed a plan to show how various allocations would  add up to $15.7 million if expended. The plan, although useful as an  indicator of the Coast Guard\u2019s intentions, is not sufficient to show that the  Coast Guard had expended the earmarked appropriation as directed.

Because Congress directed that we  review the amount of general appropriations expended on station  readiness needs, we did not review expenditures of funds received  through supplemental appropriations. We determined at the outset of our  work that Coast Guard databases did not contain information that would  allow us to fully report on station expenditures for the four earmark  categories. To identify available information and possible limitations of  the information, we worked extensively with Coast Guard headquarters  officials from the Offices of Budget and Programs; Financial Analysis; Boat  Forces; Resource Management; Workforce Management; Personnel  Command; and Workforce Performance, Training and Development. We  also obtained documentation from headquarters, stations, groups, and  districts.", "After reviewing the reliability of available data and the feasibility of Coast  Guard officials\u2019 proposals for gathering additional data, we agreed on a  combination of expenditure and allocation data, which would be collected  through special data runs, analyses, and unit surveys. Coast Guard officials  provided data for three of the four categories. Although officials attempted  to develop information on training costs, they were not able to produce  reliable data. Some of the information we needed was obtained not at  headquarters but at specific Coast Guard sites, which we judgmentally  selected according to size, location, and type.", "The specific data and analyses used to develop estimates on each of the  four categories, were as follows:    Staffing: To determine the number and cost of personnel assigned to  multimission stations, we requested Coast Guard personnel  expenditure data for fiscal years 2002 and 2003, but we were told that  expenditure data were not available at the station level. To develop  estimated staffing costs, Coast Guard officials merged information  from personnel and position databases to identify the number of  personnel assigned to stations and then applied a personnel cost  formula to arrive at total estimated costs. Developing estimates was  complicated because the fiscal year 2002 data were developed from a  different database than the fiscal year 2003 data, and because the Coast  Guard has more personnel assigned to stations than actual authorized  (or funded) positions, a variance that requires periodic adjustment of  the databases. However, after discussing these factors at length with  Coast Guard officials, we determined that the data developed by the  Coast Guard were sufficiently reliable for the purpose of providing  estimates of expenditures for fiscal years 2002 and 2003. The  methodology and process for developing the data were contributed to  by the following Coast Guard offices: Budget and Programs, Resource  Management, Workforce Management, and Personnel Command.", "PPE: To obtain fiscal year 2003 expenditure data for this category, we  asked the Coast Guard to survey all 188 stations and their oversight  units. Each station and unit was asked to provide the total amount of  fiscal year 2003 funds spent on PPE for personnel assigned to the  station during the year. These totals included expenditures made for  station personnel at the group and district levels as well. To verify the  accuracy of these data, we reviewed original expenditure  documentation for a judgmentally selected sample of 29 stations. On  the basis of this documentation, we independently quantified PPE  expenditures for each station. Our count of total PPE purchases at the  29 stations was 9 percent higher than the total provided by the Coast  Guard (our count was 4 percent less than the Coast Guard\u2019s after  removing expenditures for one outlier station). Coast Guard officials  attributed the difference to errors made by station personnel when  compiling the expenditure data. As a result of these differences,  however, we refer to the total expenditure for fiscal year 2003 as an  estimate. Because Coast Guard officials considered gathering  expenditure data for fiscal year 2002 as too labor intensive for station  personnel, given their current workloads, we used the Coast Guard\u2019s  data on planned PPE expenditures for fiscal year 2002. After reviewing  possible limitations in the PPE data provided, we determined that the  data provided were sufficiently reliable for the purpose of providing  estimates of expenditures. The PPE planning data were provided to us  by the Offices of Boat Forces and Budget and Programs.", "Personnel retention: We were not able to determine total retention  expenditures because the Coast Guard does not specifically track these  costs, and retention efforts encompass a diverse array of direct and  indirect activities.

During 2003 the Coast  Guard had added another $2.6 million of the earmarked funds, bringing the  total to $5.6 million."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Personnel Retention", "paragraphs": ["Reenlistment bonuses issued to boatswain\u2019s mates and machinery  technicians assigned to stations increased by $1.1 million from fiscal year  2002 to fiscal year 2003. During fiscal year 2002, the Coast Guard issued  $4.8 million in bonuses to the two classes of station personnel; the amount  issued in fiscal year 2003 rose to $5.9 million. Expenditures for other, more  indirect, forms of retention activities, such as station infrastructure  improvements, are not tracked annually and therefore are not available for  comparative purposes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Training", "paragraphs": ["The Coast Guard was not able to identify training costs for multimission  station personnel for fiscal year 2002 or fiscal year 2003 despite extensive  efforts. Officials told us the Coast Guard has separate databases in place  to track training costs by national training center, but it does not have a  database that identifies costs for station personnel. The Coast Guard  conducted several queries from available databases but the resulting data  were not accurate. The lack of available training cost data precluded us  from making a comparison of annual expenditure data in this area.  However, some information indicates that levels of effort expended on  training station personnel increased in fiscal year 2003. For example,  Coast Guard\u2019s boatswain\u2019s mate training school increased its training  output by over a third in fiscal year 2003."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to those named above, Cathleen A.
