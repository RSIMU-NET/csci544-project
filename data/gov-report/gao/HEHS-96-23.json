We also obtained information during interviews with OCR officials on interpretations and explanations of the documents we obtained. Our study was limited to OCR activities related to complaint investigations and compliance reviews in postsecondary schools that involved title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

Its primary responsibility is to ensure that recipients of federal financial assistance do not discriminate\u2014on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, disability, or age\u2014against students, faculty, or other individuals in educational programs and activities. OCR is responsible for enforcing the following federal civil rights laws as they relate to schools at all levels: title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin; title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in education programs and activities; section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability; the Age Discrimination Act of 1975, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of age; and title II of the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990, which prohibits public entities from discriminating on the basis of disability.", "The civil rights laws OCR enforces extend to a wide range of recipients of federal funds. These recipients include all state education and rehabilitation agencies as well as nearly every school district and postsecondary school; thousands of proprietary schools, libraries, museums, and correctional facilities; and other institutions that receive federal financial assistance from Education.", "To ensure equal opportunity in the nation\u2019s schools, OCR carries out its civil rights responsibilities through a variety of compliance activities. OCR\u2019s principal activity is the resolution of discrimination complaints. Most of OCR\u2019s staff resources are devoted to such activities as processing, conciliating, and investigating complaints. In an effort to ensure that recipients of federal financial assistance meet their civil rights compliance responsibilities, OCR also conducts compliance reviews, monitors corrective action plans, and provides technical assistance.", "Compliance reviews differ from complaint investigations in that they are initiated by OCR; they usually cover broader issues; and they affect significantly larger numbers of individuals. OCR selects review sites on the basis of information from various sources that indicates potential compliance problems, including survey data and information provided by complainants, interest groups, the media, and the general public.", "In fiscal year 1995, OCR\u2019s staff ceiling was 833 full-time-equivalent positions and its total funding level was $58.2 million. During fiscal year 1994, about 5,300 complaints were filed with OCR. Of these, 27 percent were filed against postsecondary schools.", "Until fiscal year 1994, the number of compliance reviews that OCR was able to conduct was inversely related to the number of complaints received and the workload engendered. Because OCR\u2019s complaint workload increased from fiscal years 1988 to 1993, the number of compliance reviews OCR initiated declined from 247 in fiscal year 1988 to 138, 32, 41, 77, and 101 in succeeding years.", "During fiscal year 1994, OCR started 153 compliance reviews, with about 25 percent directed at postsecondary schools. Of the 153, 62 percent involved race or national origin issues; 17 percent involved gender issues; 8 percent involved disability and other issues; 7 percent involved other issues; and 6 percent involved solely disability issues.

OCR has policies in place delineating the documents that should be included in the official case files in the regional offices. OCR had no similar policies with regard to the official case files in headquarters. Actions that took place in headquarters were not always documented and included in regional case files. According to OCR officials, records pertaining to headquarters activity for these 13 cases were maintained in a chronological filing system\u2014rather than a case file system\u2014that suited the needs of headquarters staff. The lack of documentation hindered our ability to determine the reasons for delays in completing complaint investigations and compliance reviews.", "Generally, while the 13 cases were in the OCR regional offices, the official case files were relatively complete, with documents periodically updated to describe investigation and review activities and the results of these efforts. When an investigation or review reached the point at which OCR headquarters became actively involved, however, the official regional files were seldom updated with pertinent notations or documents. Furthermore, official case files were not developed or maintained in OCR headquarters. As a result, we could not trace the full chronology of events for these cases by examining case files. In addition, even when the official case files were updated with documents, we could not always determine what decisions were made or why extended delays occurred because the documents often did not include such information. Because of such gaps in knowledge, the full chronology of many of the cases could not be developed. (See app. II for a brief description of each of the 13 cases; see table II.1 for a summary of the 13 cases.)", "Eleven of the 13 cases involved Asian-American men and women; one was a complaint by a white woman; and another was a complaint by a white man. In addition, several of the cases, although focusing primarily on Asian-Americans or Asian-Indians, also dealt with other minority groups.", "In analyzing how these 13 cases were investigated and resolved, we found that OCR generally followed its established policies and procedures. But OCR did not always meet timeliness standards, which is discussed in detail in appendix II. As of September 1995, two complaint investigations remained open. Of the 13 cases, only 4 were closed within OCR\u2019s time frames. The cases that took the most time to complete were admissions compliance reviews, which generally involve complex issues and take more resources to complete, or complaints that dealt with complicated or controversial issues, such as admissions or race-targeted financial aid.", "Two admissions cases demonstrate the demands that individual cases can make on resources because of the volume of data that must be gathered and analyzed: (1) the compliance review of the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) undergraduate schools concerning discrimination against Asian-Americans and the affirmative action program, and (2) the complaint investigation of the University of California at Berkeley undergraduate programs concerning discrimination against white students. Both cases involved premier schools of the University of California system. The two schools enroll, between them, 67,000 students annually. Both investigations entailed several site visits, comprehensive statistical analyses of data for tens of thousands of applicants, and extensive interviewing and reviews of applicant files. Both schools completely changed their admissions processes during the course of the investigations, necessitating additional extensive investigation.", "The same regional office that conducted both investigations also completed, during the same time, a compliance review involving admission to the UCLA graduate schools. To complete that review, the regional office investigated, in detail, 40 individual admissions programs; reviewed 2,000 applicant files; and interviewed more than 200 witnesses. The demands of class admissions cases, such as these, impose unique challenges."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OCR Took More Time to Respond to Asian-American Cases but Found More Violations", "paragraphs": ["During fiscal years 1988 to 1994, OCR\u2019s overall workload, as well as that for complaints under title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, increased.

OCR does not have a standard definition of an \u201coverage\u201d case, but it uses 180 days as a benchmark for assessing timeliness. However, the average time to resolve complaints and complete compliance reviews concerning Asian-Americans in postsecondary schools generally was longer than the averages for cases concerning other minority groups. For complaint investigations, Asian-American cases took longer to complete, on average, than those for any other minority group. For compliance reviews, only cases involving class actions (cases affecting groups of students) and multiple title VI issues (one complaint alleging multiple issues, namely race and national origin) took more time, on average, to complete than Asian-American cases. Data indicated that this occurred partly because (1) Asian-Americans were involved with admissions cases more often than other minority groups and (2) admissions cases generally require more resources and time to complete than other types of cases. In addition, according to the data, OCR\u2019s investigations and reviews involving Asian-Americans resulted in relatively more violation findings leading to remedial action or changes by postsecondary schools.", "In providing the information and statistics concerning these complaint investigations and compliance reviews, OCR cautioned that the data do not represent the various factors that may affect case resolution. These factors include the volume of data that must be collected and data analyses that must be conducted; the scope, complexity, and number of issues in a case; and the availability of information needed to resolve the issues.

The average time to complete complaint investigations involving admissions issues was higher for all minority groups than for investigations that did not involve admissions issues.", "We examined these data further to determine the extent to which the OCR investigations found violations and resulted in benefits to the complaining party or in changes by postsecondary schools to remedy violations. OCR data included four categories as benefiting the complainant or resulting in changes by the postsecondary schools: (1) remedial action agreed to by the complainant, the school, and OCR; (2) remedial action completed by the school; (3) complaint withdrawn by the complainant with changes made by the school; and (4) administrative closure by OCR after changes were made by the school. We found that of the total 1,511 cases, 214 (14 percent) resulted in findings supporting the complainants\u2019 allegations or resulting in changes.

She noted that OCR data show that since the administrative changes were undertaken, the number and percentage of cases for all levels of education pending over 180 days have decreased, not only those for postsecondary schools. She also provided statistical evidence covering fiscal years 1990-94 to show that as a result of the administrative changes, even though the total number of complaints received and compliance reviews started have both increased, OCR has resolved greater numbers of both and in a more timely manner than in the past. Because our review focused only on complaint investigations and compliance reviews under title VI of the Civil Rights Act involving postsecondary schools, we did not revise our report to include these data on OCR\u2019s overall operations.", "The Assistant Secretary also provided technical comments on specific statements and facts included in our draft report, and where appropriate we used the information to clarify and update our report.", "Unless you publicly announce its contents earlier, we plan no further distribution of this report until 7 days from its issue date.

In particular, OCR found that the department had discriminated against five Asian-American applicants who, if provided equal treatment under admissions standards articulated by the department, should have been accepted. OCR deemed UCLA\u2019s three different explanations of admissions decisions given over more than a year to be pretext for discrimination.", "UCLA disagreed with OCR\u2019s findings. UCLA asserted that OCR (l) misunderstood the department\u2019s initial evaluation rating system, which was just a recommendation to the vice-chair, and (2) failed to interview the vice-chair who actually made the admissions decisions but was on sabbatical when OCR first visited the Mathematics Department in 1989 and 1990. UCLA expanded the statistical analysis and produced statistics showing no difference in admission rates for whites and Asian-Americans for numerical applications when they were grouped with ratings of \u201c3.0 and above\u201d and \u201cbelow 3.0.\u201d OCR had limited its comparison to a group of whites who had been admitted and a group of Asian-Americans who had been denied admission. In UCLA\u2019s expanded group comparison, UCLA showed that there were 22 white applicants in the same rating range (that is, ratings of 2.4 and above) as the three OCR-identified Asian-Americans who were denied admission based on the use of the same criteria. UCLA maintained that three admitted whites in that group had substantially higher academic qualifications than the three rejected Asian-Americans OCR identified.", "OCR based its violation LOF partially on the fact that the different explanations by UCLA officials regarding admissions decisions were a pretext for discrimination. Just days before the LOF was issued, OCR officials learned that the vice-chair who had actually made the admissions decisions had not been interviewed; UCLA\u2019s first and second explanations concerning admissions to the Mathematics Department program were provided by officials who knew little about the actual admissions criteria used. OCR interviewed the vice-chair before the LOF was issued, but found that his explanations could not fully account for all admissions decisions. OCR issued the LOF without bringing its concerns to UCLA\u2019s attention for further explanation.

In particular, the review was expanded to consider unsuccessful white applicants and successful Asian-American applicants.", "OCR found that the admissions decisions were cumulative in nature, with various objective and subjective factors weighed against each other by the vice-chair. OCR also found that overall undergraduate grade point average was of little or no consequence, although it was used in the ratings. The grade point average for math courses was pertinent, and grades received in particular math courses were very important. The applicant\u2019s \u201cstatement of purpose\u201d was also important because the department rejected applicants who suggested that their ultimate career goals were outside math. In addition, applicants from less renowned schools were at a competitive disadvantage. They needed strong letters of recommendation from professors known to UCLA faculty.", "The supplemental investigation showed that OCR had not fully understood the criteria it was given by UCLA officials in September 1990. For example, one of the criteria given was that an applicant\u2019s stated interest in applied mathematics would enhance the applicant\u2019s position. The October 1990 LOF stated that OCR\u2019s examination of files had not verified this criterion. However, during the supplemental examination, OCR discovered that the boost was not for all candidates interested in applied math, but only for certain subareas, particularly for applicants in computational fluid dynamics and those already working in the defense industry. Also, the supplemental examination found that master\u2019s degree applicants were not held to the same standard as Ph.D. applicants by the department.", "The regional office found at the outset that it had received the wrong information from university and Mathematics Department officials. In reexamining files and expanding the examination to files of lower ranked Asian-Americans admitted, OCR found that lower ranked Asian-Americans also benefited from the application of subjective admissions criteria. Further review showed only two possible examples of discrimination.", "Both of these involved students within the range of white applicants admitted and white applicants rejected. Both cases of possible discrimination were vulnerable to being rejected, one because the applicant had a lower quantitative Graduate Record Examination (GRE) score by a substantial degree than anyone admitted and the other because the applicant had a combination of low GRE scores, a degree from an unknown school, and a stated interest in obtaining a certified public accountant license, a career goal outside mathematics.", "The regional office submitted a revised investigative report to headquarters on July 23, 1991, in which it concluded that UCLA\u2019s Mathematics Department was not in violation of title VI and recommended the withdrawal of the violation LOF.

The court found that the plaintiff simply did not meet the university\u2019s law school admissions criteria. His grade point average and LSAT score were below the median, that is, far below those of other accepted applicants. No one, including those admitted under the preadmissions program, had an LSAT score as low as the plaintiff\u2019s. Furthermore, he was from a noncompetitive school.", "Two months later, on March 11, 1993, OCR administratively closed the case. Under OCR\u2019s Investigative Procedures Manual, a case should be closed if OCR (1) obtains information indicating that the issue raised has been resolved in a manner consistent with title VI of the Civil Rights Act and (2) determines that there are no remaining issues appropriate for investigation. Section IV.A.2(d) of the manual states that cases in which the same issues involving the same complainant have been subject to a decision by a federal court may be closed. OCR actually closed the case under section IV.A.(2)(g), which states that if OCR obtains information indicating that the issues raised by the complaint have been resolved, OCR should determine if there are current issues appropriate for investigation; if not, the case should be closed. OCR determined that the issues raised in the OCR complaint had been resolved in accordance with title VI standards and that there were no outstanding issues in the complaint that had not been addressed.", "OCR officials indicated that the case was closed because (1) the judge determined that the complainant lacked standing because of low LSAT scores and a poor academic record to challenge the preadmissions program and (2) this was an individual complaint.", "Although OCR could have continued the class issue of whether the preadmissions program violated title VI, it was not required to do so. The complainant had not made any specific allegation on behalf of individuals other than himself. OCR did not reach any conclusion regarding whether any admissions program was legal or illegal. OCR officials stated that the allegations the complainant presented were insufficient to raise a class issue by themselves or to show that a practice existed that was discriminatory.

The LOF was issued on March 21, 1994.", "Part of the delay in closing this case occurred because the Deputy Assistant Secretary was concerned about the affirmative action plan at the university; he wanted to make sure that the plan had not influenced the university\u2019s decision to reject the complainant, OCR headquarters officials explained. The case file included complete documentation and explanations of case activity from when the complaint was filed until November 1992. However, the official case file, which is kept in the regional office, included no other documents until the no-violation LOF was issued in March 1994.", "OCR exceeded the established time frames for this case. The standard in effect at the time the case was initiated was that an LOF be completed within 135 calendar days; this investigation took about 28 months to complete.

He criticized the university\u2019s affirmative action program. He also alleged that underrepresented minority students were being segregated into the UCLA and UC Berkeley campuses and away from the other UC campuses.", "Originally, the investigation initiated in May 1989 was to cover the academic years beginning in 1987, 1988, and 1989. As time went by, however, additional years were added to the investigation because the university changed its admissions policies and OCR\u2019s preliminary findings were no longer current.

In the letter, OCR stated that it had found insufficient evidence to support the first two individual allegations but that it would make a separate determination on the third allegation, which is a class issue.", "OCR officials said that these cases were delayed because they dealt with race-targeted financial aid issues, which OCR was in the process of reexamining. OCR headquarters officials explained that the OCR regional office was directed to hold its LOF until the policy statement was issued.

Our point in this section was that OCR did not have a complete official file for every case that included documentation on all phases of a complaint investigation or compliance review, including actions and decisions by OCR headquarters officials. Education, in its comments, said that records pertaining to OCR headquarters activity in the 13 cases were maintained in a chronological filing system, rather than a case file system, that suited the needs of headquarters staff. At headquarters, however, activities involving these cases, like teleconferences and data analysis, are not captured in the chronological files. Moreover, while documents on individual cases may be filed chronologically, the documents did not usually explain delays. As a result, we had to rely on oral statements by OCR headquarters staff for much of the information on the chronology of events while the cases were worked on in OCR headquarters. 2. We acknowledged that for some cases, documents prepared by OCR headquarters were sometimes included in the regional office files. As we reported, however, often the actions, decisions, and deliberations that occurred in headquarters that led to the issuance of a letter of findings or other documents reflecting OCR\u2019s official position on an issue were not included in the case files made available to us. Furthermore, reasons for delays of investigations and reviews were seldom documented at OCR headquarters; therefore, we had to rely largely on oral statements by headquarters officials for this information. 3. We agree that individual cases that took a long time to resolve would skew OCR\u2019s average time for completing complaint investigations and compliance reviews. We also acknowledge that in reporting information and statistics on OCR\u2019s timeliness in resolving its cases, we do not fully discuss all the factors that may affect the resolution of each case; for example, the legal complexities of a precedent-setting case or the great amount of analysis necessary in an admissions case.
