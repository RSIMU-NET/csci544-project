HUD provides rental housing assistance-about $21 billion in fiscal year 1996\u2014that enables about 4.7 million low-income households to obtain safe, decent, and affordable housing. HUD assists about two-thirds of these households through its Section 8 housing assistance program. HUD\u2019s estimate of new budget authority to renew expiring Section 8 tenant-based and project-based contracts increases from $3.6 billion in fiscal year 1997 to $18.1 billion in fiscal year 2002. For the tenant-based portion of the Section 8 program, HUD provides housing subsidies through nearly 4,300 contracts with local housing agencies and state housing finance agencies. Housing agencies receive a fee from HUD for administering the tenant-based program and working with households to determine eligibility, verify income, and ensure that units meet quality standards. Because a significant number of the Section 8 tenant-based contracts will expire over the next 5 years, the estimated cost to renew contracts in the tenant-based program alone will rise from about $2.5 billion in fiscal year 1997 to $10.5 billion in fiscal year 2002. To identify unexpended funding that could offset this growing renewal cost, HUD recently undertook aggressive efforts to reconcile its records in the tenant-based program."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "1.4 Million Households Benefit From HUD\u2019s Tenant-Based Rental Assistance", "paragraphs": ["Tenant-based assistance is an important part of the federal government\u2019s commitment to providing safe, decent, and affordable housing to low-income people. In fiscal year 1996, HUD spent about $7 billion to provide tenant-based rental assistance. HUD\u2019s tenant-based assisted housing programs\u2014the Section 8 certificate and voucher programs\u2014provide direct rental assistance to about 1.4 million households. These programs are designed to allow low-income households to live in decent and affordable private rental housing of their choice, as long as the units meet HUD\u2019s rent and quality standards. Generally, under the certificate program, an assisted household pays 30 percent of its adjusted income for rent. In contrast, households with vouchers may elect to pay more or less than 30 percent of their income for rent, depending on the rent charged for the unit in which they elect to live. In turn, the voucher program assists the household by making a subsidy payment to the landlord equal to the difference between 30 percent of the household\u2019s adjusted income and a payment standard for the housing unit based on the fair market rent for a unit of a similar size in the area.", "To operate the certificate and voucher programs, HUD enters into contracts with local and state housing agencies, including public housing agencies. These housing agencies certify applicants for eligibility, inspect units found by the tenant for compliance with housing standards, and verify that the lease terms meet HUD\u2019s requirements. In addition, the housing agencies pay the rent subsidies to owners of private rental housing for the assisted households. HUD also pays the housing agency a statutorily determined administrative fee for managing the program."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Section 8 Tenant-Based Contracts", "paragraphs": ["When the Section 8 program began in 1974, HUD entered into long-term contracts with housing agencies to provide tenant-based assistance. Initially, contract terms for tenant-based assistance were for 15 years. As the federal budget deficit grew larger, HUD reduced contract terms to reduce the amount of budget authority it needed to set aside to fully fund the contracts over their whole terms. HUD subsequently shortened the contract terms to 5 years and, later, to 3 years. Finally, beginning in fiscal year 1995, Section 8 tenant-based contracts were written for 1-year terms, thus minimizing the amount of budget authority HUD needs to fund contract renewals. HUD\u2019s actions have resulted in contract lengths ranging from as long as 15 years to as short as 1 year."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Nearly a Fivefold Increase in Section 8 Tenant-Based Assistance Is Expected Within 5 Years", "paragraphs": ["HUD estimates that the cost of Section 8 contract renewals for the tenant-based program alone will increase from $2.5 billion in fiscal year 1997 to $10.5 billion in fiscal year 2002\u2014nearly a fivefold increase in the amount of budget authority needed to fund Section 8 tenant-based contract renewals. The increase in budget authority is attributable to the large growth in the number of expiring Section 8 tenant-based contracts. This growth reflects the renewal of the initial expiration of long-term contracts, as well as the re-renewal of shorter term contracts begun in the 1990s. To offset the budget authority requirements for Section 8 contract renewals, the Congress encouraged HUD in 1995 to begin using available unexpended budget authority that had accumulated over the years in the housing agencies\u2019 program reserve accounts to extend the funding of expiring Section 8 contracts.", "The Congress provides budget authority for HUD\u2019s Section 8 tenant-based assistance to (1) renew expiring contracts to maintain existing subsidies (called contract renewals), (2) create new contracts to increase the number of assisted households (called incremental assistance), and (3) provide additional funds for existing contracts when the remaining contract funds are insufficient to pay subsidies over the remaining life of the contract (called contract amendments). Renewal assistance represents the vast majority of Section 8 tenant-based assistance.", "HUD and the Congress have worked together during recent years to renew every expiring contract. However, renewing these contracts will require a sharp increase in budget authority over the next few years because the number of expiring contracts is increasing dramatically. The sharp growth in expirations has two causes. First, the number of contracts expiring for the first time will increase sharply in the coming years. These consist of 15-year contracts issued in the late 1970s and early 1980s and short-term (5 years or less) tenant-based contracts issued since the early 1990s. Second, HUD must renew an increasing number of contracts that it has renewed at least once previously, a circumstance that has begun to occur more frequently as contract terms have grown shorter. Renewing expiring contracts will require a sharp increase in budget authority over the next several years, as shown by figure 1.1.", "In 1995, the Congress encouraged HUD to use available unexpended funds in the Section 8 program to offset the budget authority requirements for contract renewals. Budget authority appropriated for Section 8 tenant-based contract renewals is \u201cno-year\u201d money and does not expire if it is not expended. These unexpended funds have been obligated to the housing agencies but will not be needed to meet planned requirements; the funds are, in effect, credited to housing agencies\u2019 program reserve accounts. In fiscal year 1995, HUD began to draw on unused budget authority from previous years to extend the terms of expiring contracts.", "To identify unexpended balances to help offset the cost of Section 8 contract renewals, HUD began in February 1996 an extensive examination, called \u201creconciliation,\u201d of the Section 8 tenant-based program\u2019s reserve accounts at all housing agencies. The results of this examination were not completed until 1997. In addition, in November 1996 HUD identified approximately $1.6 billion that had not been obligated to the tenant-based program\u2014and therefore was also unexpended. HUD called this amount \u201ccarryover\u201d and used it to offset the Department\u2019s fiscal year 1998 contract renewal needs. Identifying this carryover occurred too late in the budget process to have an impact on HUD\u2019s fiscal year 1997 budget request.", "Therefore, HUD reflected it in the Department\u2019s fiscal year 1998 budget request by reducing the estimate of Section 8 tenant-based contract renewals by $1.6 billion.", "At the request of the Chairman of the Subcommittee on VA, HUD, and Independent Agencies, House Committee on Appropriations, we reviewed HUD\u2019s fiscal year 1998 budget request for Section 8 contract renewal funding. In February 1997, we briefed the Subcommittee and provided testimony for the Subcommittee\u2019s hearing on March 18, 1997.  We informed the Congress that HUD had a significant amount of unexpended funds in the Section 8 tenant-based program and that once HUD completed its examination of the housing agencies\u2019 accounts, the likely total amount of available unexpended funds would far exceed the $1.6 billion that HUD disclosed in its fiscal year 1998 budget request. In chapter 2, we discuss HUD\u2019s actions to further identify the unexpended budget authority in the tenant-based program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Accumulation of Unexpended Budget Authority in the Section 8 Tenant-Based Program", "paragraphs": ["The accumulation of unexpended funds in housing agencies\u2019 reserve accounts resulted from HUD\u2019s method of estimating budgets since the beginning of the program. According to HUD officials, at the outset of the Section 8 tenant-based program, HUD intentionally established program reserves during the early years of a multiyear housing assistance contract to help fund the program in the later years. This practice was, in part, required by law.", "To build up reserves, HUD based its estimate of the amount of budget authority needed to fund the program on two conservative assumptions. First, HUD assumed that tenants would make a contribution of zero toward their rent. Therefore, as tenants had income and contributed to their rent the amount of budget authority the housing agency drew down from the program was less than budgeted, and program reserves began to grow. Second, HUD assumed that all certificates were in constant use, even though the leasing of housing units would necessarily take some time to accomplish while prospective tenants shopped for housing and the housing agencies determined the tenants\u2019 eligibility and ensured that the selected units met quality standards. Thus, reserves accumulated during the time housing units were not leased because housing agencies did not make housing subsidy payments for unleased units. As a result, the larger housing agencies, especially those receiving new certificates every year, developed significant reserves.", "While HUD began to consider tenants\u2019 income in its contract renewal budget requests for fiscal year 1991, it continued to assume that all units were fully leased. For instance, currently, a statutory requirement exists that once a household discontinues its need for and use of a certificate or voucher and returns it to the housing agency, the housing agency must wait 3 months before reissuing that certificate or voucher to another eligible household. However, HUD does not factor the effect of this requirement into its budget estimates for Section 8 tenant-based assistance. Therefore, during this 3-month period, reserves accumulate in the housing agencies\u2019 reserve accounts because the agencies do not make housing assistance payments to landlords for housing units not under lease."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Long-Standing Problems With HUD\u2019s Budget Estimating Process", "paragraphs": ["The build-up of reserves in HUD\u2019s Section 8 tenant-based program is indicative of long-standing problems with HUD\u2019s budget estimating process. According to HUD\u2019s Office of Inspector General (OIG), HUD, for years, has been unable to estimate accurately the budget authority it needs for Section 8 contract renewals and amendments. Historically, HUD\u2019s accounting and information systems did not contain reliable, complete, or accurate data on Section 8 contracts. This situation occurred because of poor systems design and serious deficiencies in the controls, policies, and procedures associated with the input and maintenance of Section 8 contract and accounting data. As a result of these problems, HUD had to continually revise its Section 8 estimates and often request additional funding. While HUD has taken action to correct these problems, budget estimating problems still remain.", "In response to congressional concerns about HUD\u2019s budget estimating problems, HUD and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) formed a joint team to evaluate HUD\u2019s fiscal year 1992 contract renewal and cost amendment estimates and to find ways to improve the process in the future. The team determined that HUD was unable to accurately estimate Section 8 contract renewal and amendment needs because HUD\u2019s data systems were inadequate for the timely retrieval of accurate information.", "Furthermore, the team reported that estimating the number of expiring Section 8 contracts\u2014and the budget authority required to renew them\u2014had been a recurring problem for HUD since 1989. For example, HUD had to re-estimate its contract renewal needs for fiscal years 1990 and 1991 because of inadequate financial management systems and inaccurate forecasting. Specifically, HUD\u2019s financial management systems did not provide summary information to determine the number of expiring Section 8 contracts. In addition, HUD\u2019s cost estimates for contract renewal were based on assumptions about average costs that proved to be inaccurate.", "In 1992, HUD\u2019s OIG reported that the Department continued to experience problems in submitting reliable Section 8 budget requests to the Congress.Specifically, the OIG concluded that serious deficiencies existed in (1) the controls and procedures in HUD\u2019s Section 8 accounting and budgeting systems and (2) the input and maintenance of contract and accounting data in the Department\u2019s information systems. As a result, HUD could not assure the Congress that its Section 8 budget requests for fiscal years 1992 and 1993 were reasonably accurate. Because HUD\u2019s management relied on the Department\u2019s inadequate Section 8 financial management systems to develop the budget requests and because the estimate of the cost to fund expiring contracts turned out to be inaccurate, HUD had to increase its Section 8 contract renewal estimates for fiscal years 1992 and 1993. In addition, the OIG reported that HUD\u2019s original estimates for Section 8 amendments for fiscal years 1992 and 1993 may have been materially overstated. However, the OIG believed that the accuracy of the Department\u2019s tenant-based contract renewal estimate for fiscal year 1993 appeared improved over the fiscal year 1992 estimate.", "To determine HUD\u2019s progress in improving its Section 8 budgeting systems and processes, HUD\u2019s OIG conducted a follow-up audit in 1995. The OIG found that HUD\u2019s program offices had developed and implemented interim budgeting procedures that had improved the Department\u2019s ability to formulate Section 8 contract renewal budget estimates. Nevertheless, the OIG found that HUD continued to experience problems developing accurate and reliable Section 8 contract renewal and amendment estimates. For example, the OIG found that because of a breakdown in the budgeting process, the Department\u2019s budget office did not use more reliable estimates developed by the program offices for the Department\u2019s initial fiscal year 1996 budget submission to OMB. The OIG also concluded that HUD\u2019s fiscal year 1994 amendment estimate was materially overstated and believed that the estimates for fiscal years 1995 and 1996 also appeared to be overstated. In response, the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing pointed out that the tenant-based program had included a \u201ccushion\u201d in its amendment estimates to cover shortfalls in budget authority that could not be estimated by the Department\u2019s systems.", "To help correct the deficiencies with its accounting and budgeting for Section 8 contracts, HUD implemented a new Section 8 tenant-based information system in fiscal year 1995. Besides containing primary information for estimating contract renewal needs, the system contains the actual cost incurred by each housing agency for providing rental assistance.

As a result, the Chairman asked us to review HUD\u2019s financial management of the Section 8 tenant-based program.

After HUD reported this large unexpended balance, the Congress rescinded $4.2 billion, and after other adjustments of about $2.2 billion, the current balance is about $3.5 billion, which remains in a congressionally established Section 8 Reserve Preservation Account. To identify this programwide unexpended balance, HUD conducted in 1996 and 1997 a financial data reconciliation of all of its tenant-based housing assistance contracts. Until completing the reconciliation process and making recent improvements to its information system, the Department could not accurately report its excess balances in the tenant-based program.

In contrast to the first estimate, HUD calculated its revised estimate by using data exclusively from its Section 8 tenant-based information system to compare total unexpended budget authority with the housing assistance requirements for that budget authority. By subtracting projected program requirements of $10.2 billion and other adjustments of $0.6 billion from the total unexpended budget authority of $20.7 billion, HUD concluded that the amount of unexpended budget authority that was not needed to meet existing housing assistance needs at the beginning of fiscal year 1998 would be $9.9 billion, as shown in table 2.1.", "Price Waterhouse LLP assisted HUD in evaluating its revised estimate and determined the estimate to be accurate.

In response to this direction, HUD recaptured $7.7 billion of the excess budget authority and placed it in the Preservation Account. Of the $2.2 billion not recaptured, about $1.2 billion was left in the participating housing agencies\u2019 accounts as a reserve for contingencies equal to about 2 months of assisted housing payments to landlords.

This error was caused by an ineffective internal budget process that lacked adequate oversight and did not make effective use of actual expenditure data for the program. For example, insufficient review of the estimating methodology led to double-counting a large component of the average cost per assisted housing unit. Because this cost is a key variable in determining HUD\u2019s contract renewal needs, the double-counting caused HUD to greatly overstate its estimate for renewing expiring contracts. In addition, HUD\u2019s estimate contained contingency costs that could not be justified on the basis of program experience."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Budget Process Erred in Developing Unit Cost", "paragraphs": ["In its fiscal year 1998 budget submission of February 1997, HUD used a value of $6,386 as the average unit cost for renewing tenant-based housing assistance contracts. Although this value is based on the program\u2019s actual expenditure data for fiscal year 1996, it also includes several supplementary amounts for administrative fees paid to housing agencies, contingent or unexpected costs, and increased program expenditures caused by residents losing their welfare assistance in 1997 and 1998.", "However, we and HUD determined that adding these three amounts to the average unit cost either could not be justified or was not necessary. For the first amount\u2014the administrative fee\u2014HUD officials had already included this fee in the baseline unit cost; adding it again resulted in double-counting it. Specifically, the program\u2019s fiscal year 1996 expenditure data that HUD obtained from the accounting system represented the total cost to HUD of providing rental assistance and, therefore, necessarily included the administrative fee. However, to develop the final fiscal year 1998 average unit cost, HUD added the fee again, resulting in raising the contract renewal estimate by approximately $700 million. We found, and program officials agree, that better coordination and oversight among the officials in the program office, the office of the comptroller, and the departmental budget office could have prevented this error. For example, the program office\u2019s comptroller reviewed the actual disbursement data obtained from the accounting system but did not review the final average unit cost calculation until after HUD submitted its budget to the Congress. Moreover, departmental budget officials accepted the program office\u2019s estimate without an independent review of the added costs and underlying basis for the estimate.", "The second supplementary amount was for covering unknown costs or contingencies. For this supplement, HUD added approximately $204 to the unit cost, or 2 weeks of disbursements. However, at the time that HUD developed this estimate, almost all housing agencies participating in the tenant-based program already had individual reserve accounts equal to at least 2 months of disbursements. These reserves could be used to cover contingencies such as rent increases and decreases in tenants\u2019 income. Section 8 program officials stated that they added the 2-week reserve as another safeguard against the risk that families might lose rental assistance because of unexpected increases in program costs. The officials said, however, that they could not determine whether housing agencies actually needed additional funding or were using available reserves for unanticipated costs. They said that because the tenant-based information system could give them only 1 year\u2019s worth of complete and reliable information on the use of reserves, a sufficient basis did not exist for making informed decisions about the need for contingency funding.", "The third supplementary amount that HUD used to develop its fiscal year 1998 unit cost was for mitigating the anticipated impact of welfare reform on Section 8 costs. For 1998, HUD valued the welfare supplement at $138 per unit ($46 in 1997 and $92 in 1998). However, after submitting its budget estimate to the Congress in February 1997, HUD determined that this amount was unnecessary. HUD found that its assumption that housing agencies would begin to feel a significant impact from welfare reform starting in 1997 was not borne out by what was happening across the country. Instead, the states\u2019 early experiences with the impact of welfare reform showed little or no increased cost to the program as a result of the falling incomes of assisted housing residents. As a result, adding a cost factor to address the impact of welfare reform was not necessary.", "In addition to the inflated unit cost estimate, HUD\u2019s fiscal year 1998 contract renewal estimate contained a line item requesting a contingency allowance of $162 million. Although program officials said that the funding was needed to cover unanticipated costs in the program, they could not provide supporting information to justify their request. Subsequently, HUD adjusted its fiscal year 1998 budget request and removed this request for funding.

Generally, amending contracts refers to the process of changing specific housing assistance contracts to add more funding. These contracts might need additional funding because the budget authority initially obligated to them\u2014as long ago as 15 years\u2014may not have been sufficient to provide adequate rental assistance over the life of the contract. In addition to the fiscal year 1998 budget request for amendment funding, HUD\u2019s budget submission also predicted that the need for amendments to the tenant-based contracts through the year 2002 would be approximately $600 million.", "Although HUD has supporting documentation for its need for amendment funding for fiscal year 1998, the Department\u2019s prediction of needing future amendment funding is not consistent with the significant changes HUD has made to its contracting practices. In fiscal year 1995, HUD began reducing the terms for renewed expiring contracts from 3 to 5 years to 1 year. Therefore, under this policy HUD will renew the contracts receiving amendment funding in fiscal year 1998 for 1 year after their expiration. This change to shorter contract terms has made estimating contract renewal needs more certain because changes in housing costs or tenants\u2019 incomes could be predicted more easily over the shorter period. In addition, a HUD official told us that the tenant-based information system more accurately estimates funding needs 1 year at a time and, therefore, greatly lowers the risk of underfunding contracts and could ultimately eliminate the need for amendment funding. They also said most of the tenant-based contracts should have 1-year terms by fiscal year 2003.

However, after obtaining the estimated costs, HUD did not compare these estimates with the actual cost of that assistance for the most recently completed year. As a result, HUD overfunded many tenant-based contracts, and the excess funding contributed to the accumulation of program reserves.

In addition, according to HUD\u2019s Director of the Office of Budget, HUD submitted its fiscal year 1999 contract renewal estimate to OMB in September 1997 with limited analysis. He also said that because of time constraints, his office was limited to reviewing the budget estimates for their numerical accuracy and could not question the estimates\u2019 reasonableness or their underlying basis. For example, he stated that the Budget Office was unaware of the program office\u2019s budgeting assumption that all tenant-based certificates are in constant use. This assumption, however, does not reflect the current practice of housing agencies that administer the tenant-based program. As stipulated by current appropriations law, after a certificate is turned in by the current holder, the housing agency must wait 90 days before reissuing it to a new household. But because the budget estimate assumes constant use, the effect is to estimate more funding than will actually be needed although HUD could recapture such excess funding when it analyzes the housing agency\u2019s reserve account at the end of the year.", "HUD\u2019s Office of the CFO also is leading the effort to improve HUD\u2019s financial management performance by linking HUD\u2019s budget functions with performance measures and program delivery.
