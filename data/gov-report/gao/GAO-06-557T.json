This testimony, which is based primarily on GAO's September 2005 report on passenger rail security (GAO-05-851), provides information on (1) the security practices that domestic and selected foreign rail transit operators have implemented to mitigate risks and enhance security; (2) the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) and the Department of Transportation's (DOT) funding of rail transit security and use of risk management in funding decisions; and (3) the steps DHS and DOT have taken to improve coordination on rail transit security matters. As part of its 2005 report, GAO contacted 32 U.S. rail transit operators and 13 passenger rail operators in seven European and Asian countries."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Domestic and foreign rail transit operators GAO contacted have taken similar actions to help secure their systems, including implementing customer awareness programs, increasing the number and visibility of their security personnel, and upgrading security technology. Also, both domestic and foreign operators have used risk assessments to guide security-related activities and spending. However, GAO also observed security practices that were used by certain foreign passenger rail operators, but were not employed in the United States at the time of GAO's review. For example, some foreign rail operators use covert testing to help keep employees alert to security threats or randomly screen passengers. Centralized clearinghouses on rail security technologies, such as chemical sensors, and best practices are also maintained in some foreign countries. While introducing any of these security practices into the U.S. rail system may pose political, legal, fiscal, and cultural challenges, the practices may nevertheless warrant further examination. Both DHS and DOT help fund rail transit security investments, and DHS has promoted risk-based funding decisions in the allocation of transit security grants. DHS's Office of Grants and Training is the primary source of security funding for passenger rail systems, providing over $320 million in grants to rail transit agencies for fiscal years 2003 to 2006. The Office of Grants and Training has leveraged its grant-making authority to promote risk-based funding decisions for passenger rail by requiring, for example, that operators complete a risk assessment to be eligible for a transit security grant. As we have noted in previous reports, using assessments of risk to target resources to the highest priority is especially critical given the competition for resources within the rail transit sector, and between the rail transit sector and the other modes of transportation. DOT's Federal Transit Administration (FTA) also helps fund rail transit security efforts by providing financial assistance to transit agencies and requiring that they spend 1 percent of their urbanized area formula funds on security improvements. To improve coordination on transportation security matters, including rail transit security, DHS and DOT signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) in September 2004. DHS and DOT also signed a transit security annex to the MOU in September 2005 that delineates specific security-related roles, responsibilities, resources, and commitments for transit issues. In GAO's view, these actions are positive steps forward in addressing the coordination problems GAO previously identified. For instance, federal and rail industry officials raised questions about the feasibility of implementing and complying with TSA's May 2004 security directives, citing limited opportunities to collaborate with TSA to ensure that industry best practices were incorporated. Effective coordination between DHS and DOT will continue to be important as both departments move forward with existing programs and new security initiatives."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for inviting me to participate in today\u2019s hearing on rail transit  security. The London rail bombings that took place in July 2005\u2014resulting  in over 50 fatalities and more than 700 injuries\u2014made clear that even  when a variety of security precautions are in place, rail transit systems  that move high volumes of passengers each day remain vulnerable to  terrorist attack. While securing the U.S. rail transit system is a daunting  task\u2014a shared responsibility requiring coordinated action on the part of  federal, state, and local governments and the private sector\u2014it is  important nonetheless to take the necessary steps to identify and mitigate  risks to rail transit systems.", "As we have reported previously, the sheer number of stakeholders  involved in securing these systems can lead to communication challenges,  duplication of effort, and confusion about roles and responsibilities. Key  federal stakeholders with critical roles to play within the rail sector  include the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), which is  responsible for transportation security overall, and the Office of Grants  and Training,which provides grant funds to rail operators and conducts  risk assessments for passenger rail agencies, both within the Department  of Homeland Security (DHS); and the Federal Transit Administration  (FTA) and Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), both within the  Department of Transportation (DOT). One of the critical challenges facing  these federal agencies, and the rail system operators they oversee or  support, is finding ways to protect rail systems from potential terrorist  attacks without compromising the accessibility and efficiency of rail  transit.", "At the federal level, another significant challenge to securing rail systems  involves the allocation of resources. Rail transit systems represent one of  many modes of transportation\u2014along with aviation, maritime, and  others\u2014competing for limited federal security resources. Within the rail  transit sector itself, there is competition for resources, as federal, state,  and local agencies and rail operators seek to identify and invest in  appropriate security measures to safeguard these systems while also  investing in other capital and operational improvements. Moreover, given  competing priorities and limited homeland security resources, difficult  policy decisions have to be made by Congress and the executive branch to  prioritize security efforts and direct resources to the areas of greatest risk  within the rail transit system, among all transportation modes, and across  other nationally critical sectors.", "To help federal decision makers determine how to best allocate limited  resources, we have advocated, the National Commission on Terrorist  Attacks Upon the United States (the 9/11 Commission) has recommended,  and the subsequent Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of  2004 requires, that a risk management approach be employed to guide  security decision making. A risk management approach entails a  continuous process of managing risks through a series of actions,  including setting strategic goals and objectives, assessing and quantifying  risks, evaluating alternative security measures, selecting which measures  to undertake, and implementing and monitoring those measures. In July  2005, in announcing his proposal for the reorganization of DHS, the  Secretary of Homeland Security declared that as a core principle of the  reorganization, the department must base its work on priorities driven by  risk.", "My testimony will cover three areas: (1) the security practices that  domestic and selected foreign rail transit operators have implemented to  mitigate risks and enhance security, and any differences in these practices;  (2) DHS\u2019s and DOT\u2019s funding of rail transit security and use of risk  management in funding decisions; and (3) the steps DHS and DOT have  taken to improve coordination on rail transit security matters. My  comments today are based on our body of work on passenger rail security  issues, including our September 2005 report to the Chairman of the House  Transportation and Infrastructure\u2019s Subcommittee on Railroads, Senators  Snowe and Boxer, and Representative Castle.  For this report, we  contacted 32 U.S. rail transit operators and 13 passenger rail operators in  seven European and Asian countries.  These domestic and foreign rail  agencies and the areas they serve are listed in appendix I.  All of the  reports on which this statement is based were prepared in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards.", "Domestic and foreign rail transit operators we contacted have taken  similar actions to help secure their systems, such as implementing  customer awareness programs, upgrading security technology, and  tightening access controls.  Also, both domestic and foreign operators  have used risk assessments to guide security-related activities and  funding.  However, we also observed rail security practices in foreign  countries that were not in use domestically at the time of our review.   For example, some foreign rail operators use covert testing to help  keep employees alert to security threats or randomly screen  passengers.  In addition, centralized clearinghouses on rail security  technologies, such as chemical sensors, and best practices are  maintained in some foreign countries. While introducing any of these  security practices into the U.S. rail system may pose political, legal,  fiscal, and cultural challenges, the practices may nevertheless warrant  further examination.  In our September 2005 report on passenger rail  security, we recommended, among other things, that the Secretary of  Homeland Security, in collaboration with DOT and the passenger rail  industry, determine the feasibility, in a risk management context, of  implementing certain rail security practices used in foreign countries,  including covert testing and random screening, an information  clearinghouse for security technologies and best practices, and  practices that integrate security into infrastructure design.  DHS and  DOT generally agreed with the report\u2019s recommendations.", "Could Help Transit Agencies Address Security Challenges, GAO-03-263 (Washington, D.C.:  Dec. 13, 2002). through the Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI) and the Transit  Security Grant Programs.  The Office of Grants and Training has  leveraged its grant-making authority to promote risk-based funding  decisions for passenger rail by requiring, for example, that operators  complete a risk assessment to be eligible for a transit security grant.   Using assessments of risk to target resources to the highest priority is  especially critical given the competition for resources within the rail  transit sector, and between the rail transit sector and the other modes  of transportation.  Moreover, as the 2005 London rail bombings  dramatically illustrated, even when a variety of security precautions are  put in place, passenger rail systems remain vulnerable and attractive  targets given their open designs and the high volumes of passengers  they transport each day.  Thus, it is important that limited resources  are targeted to security activities that have the greatest impact on  reducing overall risk.  DOT\u2019s FTA also helps fund rail transit security  efforts through the financial assistance it provides to transit agencies.   In addition, FTA requires that a certain percentage of federal funds be  devoted to security activities.  Specifically, transit agencies are  required to spend 1 percent of their urbanized area formula funds on  security improvements.", "To improve coordination on transportation security matters, including  rail transit security, DHS and DOT signed a memorandum of  understanding (MOU) in September 2004.  The MOU defines broad  areas of responsibility for each department.   The two departments also  signed a transit security annex to the MOU in September 2005 that  delineates the specific security-related roles, responsibilities,  resources, and commitments for transit issues.  We believe these  actions are positive steps forward in addressing the coordination  problems we have previously identified.  For instance, in 2004, TSA  issued emergency security directives to domestic rail operators after  terrorist attacks on the rail system in Madrid. However, federal and rail  industry officials raised questions about the feasibility of implementing  and complying with these directives, citing limited opportunities to  collaborate with TSA to ensure that industry best practices were  incorporated.  Effective coordination between DHS and DOT will  continue to be important as both departments move forward with  existing programs and new security initiatives.  For example, to avoid  duplication and confusion, it will be important that TSA coordinate the  oversight activities of its rail inspectors with those of the state auditors  from FTA\u2019s State Safety Oversight program and FRA\u2019s rail safety  inspectors."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Each weekday, 11.3 million passengers in 35 metropolitan areas and 22  states use some form of rail transit\u2014that is, heavy, commuter, and light  rail. Heavy rail systems\u2014subway systems like New York City\u2019s transit  system and Washington, D.C.\u2019s Metro\u2014typically operate on fixed rail lines  within a metropolitan area and have the capacity for a heavy volume of  traffic. Commuter rail systems generally operate on railroad tracks and  provide regional service (e.g., between a central city and adjacent  suburbs)\u2014and are traditionally associated with older industrial cities,  such as Boston, New York, and Chicago.  Light rail systems are typically  characterized by lightweight passenger rail cars that operate on track that  is not separated from vehicular traffic for much of the way.  Figure 1  identifies the geographic location of rail transit systems within the United  States.", "According to rail transit officials and experts, certain characteristics of rail  transit systems make them inherently vulnerable to terrorist attacks and  therefore difficult to secure. By design, rail transit systems are open (i.e.,  have multiple access points, hubs serving multiple carriers, and, in some  cases, no barriers) so that they can move large numbers of people quickly.  In contrast, the U.S. commercial aviation system is housed in closed and  controlled locations with few entry points. The openness of rail transit  systems can leave them vulnerable because operator personnel cannot  completely monitor or control who enters or leaves the systems. Other  characteristics of some rail transit systems\u2014high ridership, expensive  infrastructure, economic importance, and location (e.g., large  metropolitan areas or tourist destinations)\u2014also make them attractive  targets for terrorists because of the potential for mass casualties and  economic damage and disruption. Moreover, some of these same  characteristics make rail transit systems difficult to secure. For example,  the numbers of riders that pass through a subway system\u2014especially  during peak hours\u2014may make the sustained use of some security  measures, such as metal detectors, difficult because their use could result  in long lines that could disrupt scheduled service. In addition, multiple  access points along extended routes could make the cost of securing each  location prohibitive. Balancing the potential economic effects of security  enhancements with the benefits of such measures is a difficult challenge.", "Securing the nation\u2019s rail transit systems is a shared responsibility  requiring coordinated action on the part of federal, state, and local  governments; the private sector; and the passengers who ride these rail  systems. Since the September 11 attacks, the role of federal government  agencies in securing the nation\u2019s transportation systems, including rail  transit, have continued to evolve. Before September 11, DOT\u2014namely,  FTA\u2014was the primary federal entity involved in rail transit security  matters. In response to the attacks of September 11, Congress passed the  Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA), which created TSA  within DOT and defined its primary responsibility as ensuring security in  all modes of transportation. The act also gave TSA regulatory authority  for security over all transportation modes. ATSA does not specify TSA\u2019s  roles and responsibilities in securing the maritime and land transportation  modes at the level of detail it does for aviation security. Instead, the act  broadly identifies TSA as responsible for ensuring the security of all  modes of transportation. With the passage of the Homeland Security Act of  2002, TSA was transferred, along with over 20 other agencies, to DHS.   While TSA is the lead federal agency for ensuring the security of all  transportation modes, FTA conducts nonregulatory safety and security  activities, including safety- and security-related training, research,  technical assistance, and demonstration projects. In addition, FTA  promotes safety and security through its grant-making authority."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "U.S. and Foreign Rail Transit Operators Have Taken Similar Actions to Secure Rail Systems, and Opportunities for Additional Domestic Security Actions May Exist", "paragraphs": ["U.S. rail transit operators have taken numerous actions to secure their rail  systems since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, in the United  States and the March 11, 2004, attacks in Madrid. These actions included  both improvements to system operations and capital enhancements to  system facilities, such as track, buildings, and train cars. All of the U.S. rail  transit operators we contacted have implemented some security  measures\u2014such as customer awareness programs and more, and more  visible, security personnel\u2014that were generally consistent with those we  observed in Europe and Asia. We also identified three rail security  practices\u2014covert testing, random screening of passengers and their  baggage, and maintaining a centralized clearinghouse on rail security  technologies\u2014used in foreign countries but not, at the time or our review,  domestically."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "U.S. and Foreign Rail Operators Employ Similar Security Practices", "paragraphs": ["Both U.S. and foreign rail transit operators we contacted have  implemented similar improvements to enhance the security of their  systems.  To guide security actions and spending, domestic and foreign  operators\u2014even the privatized foreign systems\u2014consider risk  assessments, budget constraints, and other factors.  For example, one  foreign rail operator with a daily ridership of 2.3 million passengers used a  risk management methodology to assess risks, threats, and vulnerabilities  to rail in order to guide security spending.  According to the operator, the  methodology employs a \u201crisk informed\u201d approach to support  management\u2019s business decision process regarding security.  A summary  of domestic and foreign security practices follows.", "Customer awareness: Customer awareness programs we observed used  signs and announcements to encourage riders to alert train staff if they  observed suspicious packages, persons, or behavior. Of the 32 domestic  rail operators we interviewed, 30 had implemented a customer awareness  program or made enhancements to an existing program. Foreign rail  operators we visited also attempt to enhance customer awareness. For  example, 11 of the 13 operators we interviewed  had implemented a  customer awareness program. Similar to programs of U.S. operators, these  programs used signs, announcements, and brochures to inform passengers  and employees about the need to remain vigilant and report any suspicious  activities.", "More, and more visible security personnel: Of the 32 U.S. rail  operators we interviewed, 23 had increased the number of security  personnel they used since September 11, to provide security throughout  their system or had taken steps to increase the visibility of their security  personnel. For example, several U.S. and foreign rail operators we spoke  with had instituted policies such as requiring their security staff to wear  brightly colored vests and patrol trains or stations more frequently, so they  are more visible to customers and potential terrorists or criminals. These  policies make it easier for customers to contact security personnel in the  event of an emergency, or if they have spotted a suspicious item or person.  At foreign sites we visited, 10 of the 13 operators had increased the  number of their security officers throughout their systems in recent years  because of the perceived increase in the risk of a terrorist attack.", "Increased use of canine teams: Of the 32 U.S. rail transit operators we  contacted, 21 had begun to use canine units, which include both dogs and  human handlers, to patrol their facilities or trains or had increased their  use of such teams. In foreign countries we visited, rail transit operators\u2019  use of canine units varied. In some Asian countries, dogs were not  culturally accepted by the public and thus were not used for rail security  purposes. Most European rail transit operators used canine units for  explosives detection or as deterrents.", "Employee training: All of the domestic and foreign rail operators we  interviewed had provided some type of security training to their staff,  either through in-house personnel or an external provider. In many cases,  this training consisted of ways to identify suspicious items and persons  and to respond to events once they occur. For example, the London  Underground and the British Transport Police developed the \u201cHOT\u201d  method for Underground employees to identify suspicious items in the rail  system. In the HOT method, employees are trained to look for packages or  items that are Hidden, Obviously suspicious, and not Typical of the  environment. If items meet all of these criteria, employees are to notify  station managers, who are to call in the authorities and potentially shut  down the station or take other action. According to London Underground  officials, the HOT method has significantly reduced the number of system  disruptions caused when a suspicious item was identified. Several rail  transit operators in the United States and abroad have trained their  employees in the HOT method. It is important to note that such training is  not designed to prevent acts of terrorism like the July 2005 London  attacks, in which suicide bombers killed themselves rather than leaving  bombs behind.", "Passenger and baggage screening practices: Some domestic and  foreign rail operators have trained employees to recognize suspicious  behavior as a means of screening passengers. Eight U.S. rail transit  operators we contacted were using some form of behavioral screening.  For example, the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA),  which operates Boston\u2019s T system, has adopted a behavioral screening  system to identify passengers exhibiting suspicious behavior. The  Massachusetts State Police train all MBTA personnel to be on the lookout  for behavior that may indicate someone has criminal intent, and to  approach and search such persons and their baggage when appropriate.  Abroad, we found that 4 of the 13 operators we interviewed had  implemented forms of behavioral screening similar to MBTA\u2019s system.  All  of the domestic and foreign rail operators we contacted have ruled out an  airport-style screening system for daily use in heavy traffic.  According to  the operators, such a system, in which each passenger and the passenger\u2019s  baggage are screened by a magnetometer or X-ray machine, raised  concerns about cost, staffing, and customer convenience, among other  factors.", "Upgrading technology: Many rail operators we interviewed had  embarked on programs designed to upgrade their existing security  technology. For example, we found that 29 of the 32 U.S. operators had  implemented a form of closed-circuit television (CCTV) to monitor their  stations, yards, or trains. While these cameras cannot be monitored closely  at all times, because of the large number of staff the operators said would  be required, many rail operators told us the cameras act as a deterrent,  assist security personnel in determining how to respond to incidents that  have already occurred, and can be monitored if an operator has received  information that an incident may occur at a certain time or place in a  system. One rail operator, New Jersey Transit, had installed \u201csmart\u201d  cameras, which were programmed to alert security personnel when  suspicious activity occurred, such as if a passenger left a bag in a certain  location or a boat docked under a bridge. According to the New Jersey  Transit officials, this technology was relatively inexpensive and not  difficult to implement. Several other operators said they were interested in  exploring this technology. Abroad, all 13 of the foreign rail operators we  visited had CCTV systems in place. As in the United States, foreign rail  operators use these cameras primarily to deter crime and to respond to  incidents after they occur, because they do not have enough staff to  monitor all the cameras continuously.", "Most rail operators we spoke with had not installed equipment for  detecting chemical or biological agents because of the costs involved, but  a few operators had this equipment or were exploring its purchase. For  example, the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA),  in Washington, D.C., has installed these sensors in some of its stations,  thanks to a program jointly sponsored by DOT and the Department of  Energy that provided this equipment to WMATA because of the high  perceived likelihood of an attack in Washington, D.C. Also, at the time of  our review, at least three other domestic rail operators we spoke with  were exploring the possibility of partnering with federal agencies to install  such equipment in their facilities on an experimental basis.  Also, as in the  United States, a few foreign operators had implemented chemical or  biological detection devices at rail stations, but their use was not  widespread. Two of the 13 foreign operators we interviewed had  implemented these sensors, and both were doing so on an experimental  basis. In addition, police officers from the British Transport Police\u2014 responsible for policing the rail system in the United Kingdom\u2014were  equipped with pagers to detect chemical, biological, or radiological  elements in the air, allowing them to respond quickly in case of a terrorist  attack using one of these methods. The British Transit Police also have  three vehicles carrying devices to determine if unattended baggage  contains explosives.  These vehicles patrol the system 24 hours per day.", "Access control: Tightening access procedures at key facilities or rights- of-way is another way many rail operators have attempted to enhance  security. A majority of domestic and selected foreign passenger rail  operators had invested in enhanced systems to control unauthorized  access at employee facilities and stations. Specifically, 23 of the 32 U.S.  operators had installed a form of access control at key facilities and  stations. This often involved installing a system requiring employees to  swipe an access card to gain access to control rooms, repair facilities, and  other key locations. All 13 foreign operators had implemented some  system to control access to their critical facilities or rights-of-way.", "Rail system design and configuration: In an effort to reduce  vulnerabilities to terrorist attack and increase overall security, rail transit  operators in the United States and abroad have been, or are now beginning  to, incorporate security features into the design of new and existing rail  infrastructure, primarily rail stations. For example, of the 32 domestic rail  operators we contacted, 22 had removed their conventional trash bins  entirely, or replaced them with transparent or bomb-resistant trash bins,  as TSA directed in May 2004. Foreign rail operators had taken steps to  remove traditional trash bins from their systems. Of the 13 operators we  visited, 8 had either removed their trash bins entirely or replaced them  with blast-resistant cans or transparent receptacles.", "Many foreign rail operators are also incorporating aspects of security into  the design of their rail infrastructure. Of the 13 operators we visited, 11  have attempted to design new facilities with security in mind and have  attempted to retrofit older facilities to incorporate security-related  modifications. For example, one foreign operator we visited is retrofitting  its train cars with windows that passengers can open in the event of a  chemical attack. In addition, the London Underground, one of the oldest  rail systems in the world, incorporates security into the design of all its  new stations as well as of modifications to existing stations. We observed  several security features in the design of Underground stations, such as  the use of vending machines that have no holes that someone could use to  hide a bomb, and sloped tops to reduce the likelihood that a bomb can be  placed on top of the machine. In addition, stations are designed to provide  staff with clear lines of sight to all areas of the station, such as underneath  benches or ticket machines, and station designers try to eliminate or  restrict access to any recessed areas where a bomb could be hidden.", "In the United States, several rail transit operators said they were taking  security into account when designing new facilities or remodeling older  ones. Twenty-two of 32 rail operators we interviewed told us that they  were incorporating security into the design of new or existing rail  infrastructure. For example, New York City Transit and Port Authority  Trans-Hudson (PATH) officials told us they are incorporating security into  the design of its new stations, including the redesigned Fulton Street  station and the World Trade Center Hub that were damaged or destroyed  during the September 11 attacks. In addition, in June 2005, FTA issued  guidelines for use by the transit industry encouraging the incorporation of  particular security features into the design of transit infrastructure. These  guidelines include, for example, increasing visibility for onboard staff,  reducing the areas where someone could hide an explosive device on a  transit vehicle, and enhancing emergency exits in transit stations.  Figure 2  illustrates several security measures that we observed in rail transit  stations both in the United States and abroad. It should be noted that this  figure represents an amalgam of stations we visited, not any particular  station."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Three Foreign Rail Security Practices Are Not Currently Used in the United States", "paragraphs": ["While many of the security practices we observed in foreign rail systems  are similar to those U.S. rail transit operators are implementing, we  encountered three practices in other countries that were not currently in  use among the domestic rail transit operators we contacted as of June  2005, nor were they performed by the U.S. government. These practices  are discussed below.", "Covert testing: Two of the 13 foreign rail systems we visited use covert  testing to keep employees alert about their security responsibilities.  Covert testing involves security staff staging unannounced events to test  the response of railroad staff to incidents such as suspicious packages or  alarms. In one European system, security staff place suspicious items  throughout their system to see how long it takes operating staff to respond  to the items. Similarly, one Asian rail operator\u2019s security staff break  security seals on fire extinguishers and open alarmed emergency doors  randomly to see how long it takes staff to respond. Officials of these  operators stated that these tests are carried out daily and are beneficial  because the staff know they could be tested at any moment  and are  therefore more likely to be vigilant about security.", "Random screening: Of the 13 foreign operators we interviewed, 2  conducts some form of random screening of passengers and their baggage.  In the systems where this practice is used, security personnel can  approach passengers either in stations or on the trains and ask them to  submit their persons or their baggage to a search. Passengers declining to  cooperate must leave the system. For example, in Singapore, rail agency  officials rotate the stations where they conduct random searches so that  the searches are carried out at a different station each day. Before the July  2005 London bombings, no rail transit operators in the United States were  randomly screening passengers or baggage every day. However, during the  Democratic National Convention in 2004, MBTA began randomly  screening every 11th passenger at certain stations and times of the day,  asking the passenger to provide his or her bags to be screened. Those who  refused were not allowed to ride the system. MBTA officials recognized  that it is impossible to implement such a system comprehensively  throughout the rail network without major staffing increases, and that  even doing random screening regularly would be a drain on resources.  However, officials stated that such a system is workable during special  events and times of heightened security but would have to be designed  very carefully to ensure that passengers\u2019 civil liberties were not violated.  After the July 2005 London bombings, four rail transit operators\u2014PATH,  New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority, New Jersey Transit, and  Utah Transit Authority in Salt Lake City\u2014implemented limited forms of  random baggage screening in their system.", "National government maintains clearinghouse on technologies and  best practices: According to passenger rail operators in five countries we  visited, their national governments have centralized the process for  performing research and developing passenger rail security technologies  and maintaining a clearinghouse on these technologies and security best  practices. According to these officials, this practice allows rail operators  to have one central source for information on the merits of a particular  passenger rail security technology, such as chemical sensors, CCTVs, and  intrusion detection devices. No federal agency has compiled or  disseminated best practices to rail operators to aid in this process.  Some  U.S. rail operators we interviewed expressed interest in there being a more  active centralized federal research and development authority in the  United States to evaluate and certify passenger rail security technologies  and make that information available to rail operators. We have also  previously reported that stakeholders have stated that the federal  government should play a greater role in testing transportation security  technology and making this information available to industry  stakeholders. Currently, many operators said they informally ask other  rail operators about their experiences with a certain technology, perform  their own research via the Internet or trade publications, or perform their  own testing.  TSA and DOT agree that making the results of research  testing available to industry stakeholders could be a valuable use of  federal resources because it would reduce the need for multiple rail  operators to perform the same research and development efforts, but they  have not taken steps to implement this practice.", "Implementing these three practices\u2014covert testing, random screening,  and a government-sponsored clearinghouse for technologies and best  practices\u2014in the United States could pose political, legal, fiscal, and  cultural challenges because of the differences between the United States  and these foreign nations. For instance, many foreign nations have dealt  with terrorist attacks on their public transportation systems for decades,  compared with the United States, where rail transportation has not been  specifically targeted during terrorist attacks. According to foreign rail  operators, these experiences have resulted in greater acceptance of  certain security practices, such as random searches, which the U.S. public  may view as a violation of their civil liberties or which may discourage the  use of public transportation. The impact of security measures on  passengers is an important consideration for domestic rail transit  operators, since most passengers could choose another means of  transportation, such as a personal automobile. As such, security measures  that limit accessibility, cause delays, increase fares, or otherwise cause  inconvenience could push people away from transit and into their cars. In  contrast, the citizens of the European and Asian countries we visited are  more dependent on public transportation than most U.S. residents and  therefore, according to the rail operators we spoke with, may be more  willing to accept more intrusive security measures, simply because they  have no other choice for getting from place to place. Nevertheless, in  order to identify innovative security measures that could help further  mitigate terrorism-related risk to rail assets it is important to at least  consider assessing the feasibility and costs and benefits of implementing  in the United States the three rail security practices we identified in  foreign countries. Officials from DHS, DOT, passenger rail industry  associations, and rail systems we interviewed told us that operators would  benefit from such an evaluation. Furthermore, the passenger rail  association officials told us that such an evaluation should include  practices used by foreign rail operators that integrate security into  infrastructure design.", "Differences in the business models and financial status of some foreign  rail operators could also affect the feasibility of adopting certain security  practices in the United States. Several foreign countries we visited have  privatized their passenger rail operations. Although most of the foreign rail  operators we visited\u2014even the privatized systems\u2014rely on their  governments for some type of financial assistance, two foreign rail  operators generated significant revenue and profits in other business  endeavors, which they said allowed them to invest heavily in security  measures for their rail systems.", "Another important difference between domestic and foreign rail operators  is the structure of their police forces. In particular, England, France,  Belgium, and Spain all have national police forces patrolling rail systems  in these countries. The use of a national police force is a reflection that  these foreign countries often have one nationalized rail system, rather than  over 30 rail transit systems owned and operated by numerous state and  local governments, as is the case in the United States. For example, in  France, the French National Railway operates all intercity passenger rail  services in the country, and the French Railway police provide security.  According to foreign rail operators, the use of one national rail police  force allows for consistent policing and security measures throughout the  country. In the United States, by contrast, some transit agencies maintain  individual polices forces, while others rely on their city or county police  forces for security."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DHS and DOT Help Fund Security Efforts, and Some Funding Decisions Are Risk- Based", "paragraphs": ["Both DHS and DOT help fund rail transit security investments, and DHS  has promoted risk-based funding decisions in the allocation of transit  security grants.

In carrying out its mission, the Office of Grants and Training provides  training, funds for the purchase of equipment, support for the planning and  execution of exercises, technical assistance, and other support to assist  states, local jurisdictions, and the private sector to prevent, prepare for,  and respond to acts of terrorism.  Through the UASI grant program, the  Office of Grants and Training has provided grants to urban areas to help  enhance their overall security and preparedness level to prevent, respond  to, and recover from acts of terrorism.  In 2003 and 2004, $65 million and  $50 million, respectively, were allocated to rail transit agencies through  the UASI program.  In addition, the DHS Appropriations Act of 2005  appropriated $150 million for rail transit, intercity passenger rail, freight  rail, and transit agency security grants.  This funding has allowed the  Office of Grants and Training to build upon the work under way through  the UASI program and create and administer new programs focused  specifically on transportation security, including the Transit Security  Grant Program.

A risk  management approach entails a continuous process of managing risk  through a series of actions, including setting strategic goals and objectives,  performing risk assessments, evaluating alternative actions to reduce  identified risks by preventing or mitigating their impact, selecting actions  to undertake by management, and implementing and monitoring those  actions.  We have concluded that without a risk management approach,  there is limited assurance that programs designed to combat terrorism are  properly prioritized and focused.  Targeting resources to the highest  priority is especially critical given the competition for resources within the  rail transit sector, and between the rail transit sector and the other modes  of transportation.  Moreover, as the 2005 London rail bombings  dramatically illustrated, even when a variety of security precautions are  put in place, passenger rail systems remain vulnerable and attractive  targets given their open designs and the high volumes of passengers they  transport each day.  Thus, it is important that limited resources are  targeted to security activities that have the greatest impact on reducing  overall risk.", "DHS\u2019 Office of Grants and Training has leveraged its grant-making  authority to promote risk-based funding decisions for passenger rail.

In response  to a GAO recommendation, DOT and DHS entered into an MOU to better  coordinate their activities and have embarked on a number of initiatives to  improve their coordination with each other and with industry  stakeholders.

For example, as previously mentioned, FTA provides  financial assistance to rail transit agencies, and some of this funding can,  and in some cases must, be used for security activities.  In addition, FTA  has regulatory authority for state safety oversight of rail fixed-guideway  systems and for a drug and alcohol program, and FRA has regulatory  authority for rail safety over commuter rail operators.  As we have  previously reported, it could be difficult to distinguish DOT\u2019s role in  maintaining and improving transportation safety from DHS\u2019s role in  securing the transportation system because security is often intertwined  with safety.  Moreover, FTA and FRA are continuing their rail transit  security efforts as TSA moves ahead with its rail transit security  initiatives.", "We have previously reported that coordination between DHS and DOT, as  well as between DHS and rail transit stakeholders, could be improved. For  example, in our September 2005 report on rail security, we noted that TSA  provided limited opportunities for other federal agencies and the rail  industry to collaborate in the development of its passenger rail security  directives, which were issued in May 2004 to provide a consistent baseline  standard of protective measures for all passenger rail operators.  Federal  and rail industry officials have raised questions about the feasibility of  implementing and complying with the directives, noting, among other  things, that the directives do not reflect a complete understanding of the  rail transit environment or necessarily incorporate industry best practices.   In addition, in 2003, we noted that representatives from several  associations told us that they have received conflicting messages from the  federal agencies involved in transportation security, including rail transit.  We further noted that representatives from several associations also stated  that their members were unclear about which agency to contact for their  various security concerns and which agency has oversight for certain  issues.  We concluded that a lack of clearly defined roles and  responsibilities can lead to problems such as duplication and conflicting  efforts, gaps in preparedness, and confusion.  Moreover, a lack of  coordination can strain intergovernmental relationships, drain resources,  and raise the potential for problems in responding to terrorism.  Therefore,  we recommended that DHS and DOT use a mechanism, such as a  memorandum of agreement, to clearly delineate their roles and  responsibilities.  At a minimum, we recommended that this mechanism  establish the responsibilities of each entity in setting, administering, and  implementing security standards and regulations; determining funding  priorities; and interfacing with the transportation industry, as well as  define each entity\u2019s role in the inevitable overlap of some safety and  security activities.", "In response to our 2003 recommendation, DHS and DOT signed a  memorandum of understanding (MOU) in September 2004 to develop  procedures through which the two departments could improve their  cooperation and coordination in promoting the safe, secure, and efficient  movement of people and goods throughout the transportation system. The  MOU defines broad areas of responsibility for each department. For  example, it states that DHS, in consultation with DOT and affected  stakeholders, will identify, prioritize, and coordinate the protection of  critical infrastructure. The MOU between DHS and DOT represents an  overall framework for cooperation that is to be supplemented by  additional signed agreements, or annexes, between the departments.  These annexes are to delineate the specific security-related roles,  responsibilities, resources, and commitments for mass transit, rail,  research and development, and other matters.  The annex for mass transit  security was signed in September 2005.  According to DHS and DOT  officials, this annex is intended to ensure that the programs and protocols  for incorporating stakeholder feedback and making enhancements to  security measures are coordinated. For example, the annex requires that  DHS and DOT consult on such matters as regulations and directives that  affect security.   The annex also identifies points of contact for  coordinating this consultation.", "In addition to their work on the MOU and related annexes, DHS and TSA  have taken other steps to improve collaboration with DOT and industry  stakeholders. In April 2005, DHS officials stated that better collaboration  with DOT and industry stakeholders was needed to develop strategic  security plans associated with various homeland security presidential  directives and statutory mandates, such as the Intelligence Reform and  Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, which required DHS to develop a  national strategy for transportation security in conjunction with DOT.  Responding to the need for better collaboration, DHS established a senior- level steering committee in conjunction with DOT to coordinate the  development of this national strategy. In addition, senior DHS and TSA  officials stated that industry groups would also be involved in developing  the national strategy for transportation security and other strategic plans.  Moreover, according to TSA\u2019s assistant administrator for intermodal  programs, TSA intends to work with APTA and other industry  stakeholders in developing security standards for the rail transit industry."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Coordination between Federal Agencies Will Continue to Be Important", "paragraphs": ["DOT\u2019s and DHS\u2019s efforts to enhance coordination between their agencies  and with industry stakeholders on security matters are welcome.   Effective coordination between the two departments will continue to be  important as both move forward in implementing existing programs as  well as new security initiatives.  For example, FTA administers the State  Safety Oversight program, which mandates that state-designated agencies  oversee the safety of rail transit agencies.  Although ATSA gave TSA final  regulatory authority over all modes of transportation, including rail transit,  in the program, FTA sets out minimum requirements the state oversight  agencies must ensure that transit agencies meet.  FTA\u2019s mandated  minimum requirements include security components, one of which directs  rail transit agencies to maintain a system security plan that includes  controls to address employee and passenger security and a process for  conducting internal security reviews. Several rail transit operators told us  that they were confused by having to answer to both FTA and TSA for  transportation security matters.  We have ongoing work for the full  Committee examining the State Safety Oversight program\u2014and, as part of  this review, we will be exploring the extent to which FTA and TSA work  together in implementing this program.  We expect to issue our report  later this summer.", "Another area that will require continued coordination is DHS\u2019s and DOT\u2019s  security and safety oversight efforts.  TSA has hired rail inspectors to,  among other things, monitor and enforce compliance with its May 2004  passenger rail security directives. As of March 2006, TSA had filled 99 of  up to 100 inspector positions authorized by Congress. However, TSA has  not yet established processes or criteria for determining and enforcing  compliance.  TSA has also not determined how its rail inspectors will be  used to enforce the directives or how they will coordinate with existing  FRA safety inspectors or state oversight auditors involved in the State  Safety Oversight Program.  The Director of TSA\u2019s Surface Transportation  Inspection Program, which oversees the rail inspectors, and a local rail  inspector program supervisor told us that they looked forward to  coordinating with FTA on the State Safety Oversight program and would  be open to a formalized role in the program, but had not held any  discussions with FTA about what that role would be.  In fact, both the  Director and the local supervisor admitted that they were not familiar with  the program\u2019s requirements.  In addition, the transit security annex to the  MOU between DHS and DOT does not explicitly mention the State Safety  Oversight program as a program for which the two agencies will  collaborate, and officials from several state oversight agencies said they  were unsure what their role would be in overseeing security once the TSA  rail inspectors began their duties.  Also, FRA and TSA officials told us that  the details of how TSA rail inspectors will coordinate with the  approximately 400 existing FRA safety inspectors and 160 state employees  enforcing FRA passenger rail rules and regulations remain to be  determined.  Both FRA and TSA stated that they were committed to  avoiding duplication of effort and would work to communicate their  respective roles and responsibilities to transit agency officials.", "Another area requiring continued coordination is the funding of rail transit  security activities.  Specifically, the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient  Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU) included a  provision mandating that DOT and DHS collaborate on a joint rulemaking  for the Transit Security Grant Program.  The joint rulemaking is to  establish the characteristics of and requirements for transit security  grants, including funding priorities, eligible activities, methods for  awarding grants, and limitations on administrative expenses.

Security cannot be guaranteed.  Nevertheless, it is  important that we take steps to identify and mitigate risks to passenger rail  systems.  While domestic rail agencies have implemented a number of  security practices that are generally consistent with those of foreign rail  operators, they have not adopted some practices used in other countries,  including covert testing, random screening, and information  clearinghouses for new security technologies and best practices.  Despite  the potential political, legal, fiscal, and cultural challenges that  implementing these additional practices in the United States could pose,  we continue to believe that the practices may warrant further  examination, and we stand by our September 2005 recommendations that  DHS, in collaboration with DOT and the passenger rail industry, evaluate  the feasibility of implementing them.", "As we move forward with efforts to enhance rail transit security, it is  important that we do not examine rail transit security actions and funding  in isolation.  Rail transit systems represent one of many modes of  transportation competing for limited federal security resources.  Given  competing priorities and finite resources, difficult policy decisions will  have to be made by Congress and the executive branch to prioritize  security efforts and direct resources to the areas of greatest risk within the  passenger rail system, across all transportation modes, and across other  sectors of the economy.
