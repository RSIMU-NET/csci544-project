Second, the recovery plan proposes a set of actions  that aim to build the infrastructure and systems that support Puerto Rico\u2019s  economy, society, and disaster resiliency, such as addressing  vulnerabilities in Puerto Rico\u2019s electric grid. Finally, the recovery plan  proposes a set of actions that address Puerto Rico\u2019s long-term recovery  goals, such as developing and enhancing Puerto Rico\u2019s visitor economy.", "Most individual actions in the recovery plan include initial and recurring  cost estimates for the time period from 2018 through 2028. The recovery  plan describes all cost estimates as preliminary, and says that more  specific cost estimates require completion of damage assessments and  more details about the implementation of actions.", "To develop Puerto Rico\u2019s disaster recovery plan, FEMA assisted COR3 in  retaining the Homeland Security Operational Analysis Center (HSOAC), a  federally-funded research and development center operated by the RAND  Corporation under contract with DHS. According to FEMA officials, FEMA  provided funding and technical assistance, through contractor support, for  Puerto Rico to develop the recovery plan, but COR3 and Puerto Rico will  be responsible for its implementation. These officials also stated that  Puerto Rico received input and technical assistance from other federal  departments, such as those in the Recovery Support Function Leadership  Group led by FEMA.", "HSOAC developed the recovery plan in consultation with Puerto Rico by  developing a preliminary sector-by-sector assessment of damages and  needs caused by Hurricanes Irma and Maria across Puerto Rico. In  conjunction with Puerto Rico\u2019s stated vision for the recovery process,  HSOAC\u2019s damage assessment report provided the baseline needed to  define, compare, and prioritize actions.", "HSOAC worked in teams of sector-specific experts to develop and refine  the actions by reviewing reports, proposals, best practices, and other  literature. For example, in June 2018, the U.S. Department of Energy  released a report on energy resilience for Puerto Rico\u2019s electric grid,  containing recommendations for Puerto Rico to consider when developing  the Recovery Plan. HSOAC sought feedback from various subject matter  experts and stakeholders while developing the recovery plan. According  to FEMA officials, FEMA\u2019s joint recovery office delivered interim drafts of  the recovery plan to federal agency partners and Puerto Rico for  feedback. HSOAC also sought input from local-level stakeholders,  including Puerto Rico\u2019s municipal governments. For example, HSOAC  commissioned a survey of officials from municipalities to gauge the  challenges they faced in the aftermath of the 2017 hurricanes. According  to FEMA and HSOAC officials, the survey, along with other input provided  by mayors led to the development of actions focused on building the  capacity of municipal governments to support recovery efforts.", "HSOAC officials noted that while the final recovery plan was submitted to  Congress, they will continue to produce products that will assist Puerto  Rico and their stakeholders in recovery implementation. HSOAC intends  to release updated versions of the recovery plan, including updated  damage and needs assessments. Other expected products include  detailed descriptions and cost estimates for each action and a lessons  learned report. The Bipartisan Budget Act also directs Puerto Rico to  develop a public report on the progress made in achieving the recovery  plan\u2019s goals every 180 days after submission.", "FEMA officials explained that the recovery plan serves as a strategic,  direction-setting plan for recovery, and does not provide step-by-step or  site-by-site guidance on the recovery process. FEMA officials also  acknowledged that there may be some overlap between some of the  actions in the recovery plan and some of the permanent work funded  through FEMA\u2019s Public Assistance program, but that it is COR3\u2019s  responsibility to merge and coordinate such recovery efforts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to DHS and the government of Puerto  Rico for review and comment.
