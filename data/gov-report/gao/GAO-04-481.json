The No FEAR Act is similar to the Contract Disputes Act (CDA) of 1978, which holds agencies accountable for payment in contract disputes. Under both laws, federal agencies must reimburse the Judgment Fund, which is administered by the Treasury Department. Before the No FEAR Act, agencies did not have to repay the fund. The No FEAR Act requires GAO to review the financial impact on Treasury of administering that law and CDA. Based on this requirement, this report provides information on (1) Treasury's estimates of its costs to process discrimination claim payments and CDA payments in fiscal year 2003 and its costs to process and seek reimbursement for claim payments under lawsuits covered by the No FEAR Act beginning in fiscal year 2004, (2) differences in claims processing and reimbursement efforts under CDA and the No FEAR Act, and (3) the extent of federal agency compliance with CDA's reimbursement requirements and Treasury's view of how effective its No FEAR Act collection efforts may be. We make no recommendations in this report. Treasury officials had no official comment on the report."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Treasury estimates that it cost about $334,000 to certify, pay, and seek reimbursement for CDA claim payments in fiscal year 2003, and about $240,000 to certify and pay discrimination claims that year. For fiscal year 2004, assuming relatively constant case and processing cost levels, and agency compliance with reimbursement requirements similar to that experienced under CDA, Treasury estimates that it will incur about $171,500 in personnel costs in order to seek reimbursements for No FEAR claim payments. These include recurring costs to set up and administer accounts receivable and seek reimbursement from agencies for claims paid out of the Judgment Fund and a one-time cost for in-house personnel to upgrade computer systems. Although the certification, payment, and accounting processes that Treasury uses for the No FEAR Act are virtually the same as those used for CDA, the procedures Treasury is required to use to seek reimbursement for claims paid under the No FEAR Act will differ. For example, as part of Treasury's effort to seek reimbursement for No FEAR Act claims paid, No FEAR Act regulations require Treasury to record on its public Web site the failure of agencies to make reimbursement or arrange to make reimbursement within a specified time limit. There is no similar requirement under CDA claims. During fiscal years 2001, 2002, and 2003, federal agencies reimbursed Treasury for fewer than one of every five dollars owed under CDA, with at least 18 agencies having unpaid amounts at the end of each fiscal year. According to Treasury, while its No FEAR Act collection efforts are just beginning, reimbursement rates under the act may be as low as under CDA because the No FEAR Act, like CDA, does not impose reimbursement deadlines on agencies, and Treasury has very little authority to enforce reimbursement."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Before the Notification and Federal Employee Antidiscrimination and  Retaliation (No FEAR) Act of 2002 was enacted on May 15, 2002, we and  others expressed concern that federal agencies had an incentive to avoid  settling discrimination and whistleblower protection complaints in order to  have any final judgment against the agency rendered by a court. This  incentive arose from the fact that agencies paid costs from their  appropriations when such complaints were settled without a lawsuit being  filed, but that any money awarded after a suit was filed (whether by  settlement or court judgment) was generally paid from the Judgment Fund,  a permanent, indefinite appropriation administered by the Department of  the Treasury. We estimated that the Judgment Fund paid almost  $43 million for discrimination claims in fiscal year 2000 on behalf of  agencies.", "The Judgment Fund continues to pay money awarded for settlements and  judgments under lawsuits covered by the No FEAR Act. But beginning on  October 1, 2003, the effective date of the act, each federal agency must  reimburse the Treasury for the amounts paid from the fund. As we noted in  testimony describing how the No FEAR Act addresses the need for federal  agency accountability with respect to discrimination and whistleblower  protection cases, Congress faced a similar situation when lawmakers  passed the Contract Disputes Act (CDA) of 1978. Before CDA was enacted,  agencies had an incentive to avoid settling contract disputes so that any  final judgments against an agency occurred in court because the Judgment  Fund paid such court judgments. Under CDA, however, agencies must  reimburse the fund from available appropriations or, if they are not  adequate, seek additional appropriations for this purpose.", "From fiscal year 2001 through 2003 under the Judgment Fund, 1,140  discrimination claim payments were processed and about $656 million was  paid. All of these claims were for court judgments and settlements. During  this period, the fund also processed 304 CDA claim payments and paid  about $713 million. This included payments for court judgments and  settlements and board of contract appeals awards. The fund did not make  any payments for whistleblower protection claims as these payments were  typically made by agencies.", "The No FEAR Act requires that we review the financial impact on the  Treasury of administering both the No FEAR Act and CDA. Based on this  requirement and discussions with committee staff, this report provides  information on (1) Treasury\u2019s estimates of costs to process CDA and  discrimination payments for fiscal year 2003 and its estimates to process  and seek reimbursement for No FEAR Act claim payments in fiscal year  2004, (2) differences in payment processing under CDA and the No FEAR  Act, and (3) the extent of federal agencies\u2019 compliance with CDA\u2019s  reimbursement requirement and Treasury officials\u2019 view of how effective  the reimbursement collection efforts under the No FEAR Act may be.", "We obtained information from Treasury\u2019s Financial Management Service  (FMS), which administers the Judgment Fund, on the costs of processing  Judgment Fund reimbursement payments in fiscal year 2003 and estimated  costs in fiscal year 2004. Since FMS does not track the cost of processing  Judgment Fund claim payments, agency officials could only provide us  with estimates of the costs, based primarily on staff time spent processing  these claims. We reviewed supporting documentation, interviewed  Judgment Fund officials, and compared the estimated personnel costs to  the percentage of claims paid to determine the reasonableness of the cost  estimate (that is, if the estimated costs were disproportionately large when  compared to the number of claims processed). On the basis of our  assessment, we determined that the data provided by Treasury in its  estimates were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our report. We  interviewed FMS officials to determine the differences between the No  FEAR Act\u2019s and CDA\u2019s payment processing and to obtain the officials\u2019 views  of how effective the reimbursement collection efforts allowed under the No  FEAR Act may be. To determine the extent of federal agency compliance  with CDA\u2019s reimbursement requirement, we obtained from FMS  information on the amount of money sought and received from agencies in  fiscal years 2001, 2002, and 2003.

Among other things, the  fund is intended to allow for more prompt payments to claimants, thereby  reducing the assessment of interest against federal agencies (where  allowed by law) during the period between the rendering and payment of  an award. In 1961, legislation was enacted allowing the fund to pay Department of Justice settlements of ongoing or imminent lawsuits against  federal agencies.", "The No FEAR Act requires federal agencies to reimburse the Judgment  Fund for payments of judgments, awards, or settlements that the fund  makes to employees, former employees, or job applicants in connection  with litigation alleging violation of certain federal laws. The Senate  committee report accompanying the No FEAR Act explains that the act is  intended to prompt federal agencies to pay more attention to their equal  employment opportunity and whistleblower complaint activities and act  more expeditiously to resolve complaints before they get to court.  Accordingly, No FEAR Act cases include those brought before federal  courts under discrimination statutes and certain cases brought before the  Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), including discrimination and  whistleblower protection claims. These latter cases, however, typically  result in either a settlement while the case is pending at MSPB or an award  issued by MSPB, both of which are paid out of agency funds, not the  Judgment Fund.", "As provided for under the No FEAR Act, the President designated OPM to  issue regulations to carry out the agency reimbursement provisions of the  law. OPM\u2019s interim final regulations issued earlier this year state that the  procedures that agencies must use to reimburse the Judgment Fund are  those prescribed by FMS.", "Under procedures prescribed by Treasury, FMS Judgment Fund branch  analysts, in consultation with FMS\u2019s Office of the Chief Counsel, certify  whether a judgment, award, or settlement is appropriate for payment and  whether the agency on whose behalf payment was made must reimburse  the fund.

This estimate includes about  $119,500 in costs to set up and administer accounts receivable and seek  reimbursement for No FEAR Act payments. FMS estimates that it will also  incur a one-time start-up cost of about $52,000 for its information  technicians to upgrade computer systems to create and track No FEAR Act  accounts receivable. FMS expects no increase in either the number of  personnel or budgeted funds to handle No FEAR Act reimbursements.", "FMS\u2019s estimates assume that it will pay the same number of discrimination  claim payments under the No FEAR Act in fiscal year 2004 as it paid the  previous year. FMS estimates also assume there will be no increase in the  cost for processing discrimination claim payments in fiscal year 2004.  Treasury\u2019s estimate of fiscal year 2004 costs for No FEAR Act claim  payments also assumed that agency compliance with the No FEAR Act  would be similar to that under CDA.

Payment from the  Judgment Fund is then certified by FMS and made through Treasury\u2019s  Philadelphia Financial Center by check or electronic funds transfer. Once  payment is made, FMS reduces the fund\u2019s balance, records an expense by  the fund, and records an account receivable in its recoveries account for  the federal agency on whose behalf the payment was made. The debtor  federal agency is required to record an account payable to the Judgment  Fund. Those amounts remain a receivable on FMS\u2019s books and a payable on  the agency\u2019s books until it reimburses the fund. FMS sends letters to  agencies to verify account balances quarterly. The agencies must also  review their balances and confirm them to FMS.", "According to FMS, on the basis of the cash receipts history for federal  agencies and the age of some of the Judgment Fund\u2019s accounts receivable,  it expects that a percentage of the money owed by federal agencies will  probably not be paid back. To allow for this, FMS calculates a percentage,  which it calls an allowance factor, based on the age of the receivable and  the agency\u2019s payment history. According to FMS, it applies the allowance  factor to an agency\u2019s outstanding accounts receivable to arrive at a dollar  amount that FMS puts into an allowance account, which is used by FMS to  report on the status of the Judgment Fund in its financial statement.  According to FMS, although it records the debt in the allowance account as  an uncollectible loss, the debt is not written off.

Recognizing that agencies are often  confronted with practicalities of this sort, we have suggested that while an  agency may not be in a position to make CDA reimbursements during the  year in which the fund made payment, we would expect the agency to  manage its budgetary resources to accommodate reimbursement of the  fund before the beginning of the second fiscal year following the fiscal year  in which the award is paid.", "According to FMS, the lack of a reimbursement deadline under CDA and  the No FEAR Act may be one reason that reimbursement rates under the  No FEAR Act may be as low as they have been under CDA.

Like CDA, the No FEAR Act  provides no sanctions that would compel agencies to reimburse the  Treasury, and no Treasury authority to take money owed directly from the  agency. FMS officials recognize that the requirement for FMS to annually  post the names of agencies that fail to make No FEAR Act reimbursements  or make arrangements for reimbursement may provide an incentive for  agencies to comply with the regulations.
