However, DOD continues to believe that its aircraft investment strategy will be affordable.

The purpose of this report is to inform the Congress about the long-term implications and affordability of DOD\u2019s aircraft strategy. To gain a broad understanding of the affordability of DOD\u2019s aircraft investment strategy, we evaluated (1) DOD\u2019s and CBO\u2019s estimates of the annual funding needed for aircraft programs, as a percentage of the overall DOD budget, and compared that percentage to a long-term historical average percentage of the defense budget; (2) the potential long-term availability of funding for DOD\u2019s planned aircraft procurements; and (3) DOD\u2019s traditional approach to resolving funding shortfalls.", "The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1997 required DOD to conduct a Quadrennial Defense Review. As part of the review, DOD assessed a wide range of issues, including the defense strategy of the United States and the force structure required. As a result, DOD may reduce the quantities procured of some weapons programs. The details of how DOD plans to implement the recommendations of the Quadrennial Defense Review will not be available until the fiscal year 1999 budget is submitted to the Congress.

Table 1 describes the 17 aircraft programs and their estimated procurement funding requirements and appendix I provides details on these programs.", "DOD is pursuing these aircraft programs at a time when the federal government is likely to be faced with significant budgetary pressure for the foreseeable future. This pressure comes from efforts to balance the budget, coupled with funding demands for such programs as Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. Consequently, there is likely to be limitations on all discretionary spending, including defense spending, for the long term.", "This report addresses the availability of funding to support DOD\u2019s aircraft investment strategy as planned prior to the Quadrennial Defense Review, but does not address specific aircraft requirements. Our previous reports have questioned the need for and timing of a number of DOD\u2019s aircraft procurements. (A listing of prior reports is provided at the end of this report.)"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Funding Needed for Aircraft Procurement Programs Will Exceed Historical Norms", "paragraphs": ["DOD asserts that its aircraft modernization programs are affordable as planned. On June 27, 1996, DOD officials testified before House Subcommittees that its overall aircraft investment plans were within historical norms and affordable within other service priorities. The officials further explained that the historical norms referred to were based on the aircraft funding experience of the early 1980s.", "Our review indicated that using the early to mid-1980s, the peak Cold War defense spending years, as a historical norm for future aircraft investments is not realistic in today\u2019s budgetary and force structure environment. As shown in figure 1, DOD\u2019s overall appropriations, expressed in fiscal year 1997 dollars, have decreased significantly from their high point in fiscal year 1985, and the amounts appropriated in recent years are at, or near, the lowest point over the past 24 years.", "As shown in figure 1, our review of aircraft procurement funding data from fiscal years 1973 through 1996, showed that funding for DOD\u2019s aircraft purchases as a percentage of DOD\u2019s overall budget fluctuated in relation to the changes in DOD\u2019s overall budget. Funding for aircraft purchases increased significantly as DOD\u2019s overall funding increased in the early 1980s and decreased sharply as the defense budget decreased in the late 1980s and early 1990s. In contrast, DOD\u2019s planned aircraft investment strategy does not follow this pattern and calls for significantly increased funding for aircraft purchases during a period when DOD\u2019s overall funding is expected to remain stable in real terms.", "Funding for DOD\u2019s aircraft purchases was at its highest point, both in dollar terms and as a percentage of the overall DOD budget, during the early to mid-1980s. Figure 2 shows the 24-year funding history for DOD\u2019s aircraft purchases from fiscal years 1973 through 1996. During that period, DOD spending on aircraft purchases fluctuated somewhat but averaged about 4.8 percent of the overall DOD budget. From fiscal years 1982 through 1986, DOD used from 6.0 percent to 7.7 percent of its overall annual funding on aircraft purchases. In contrast, since fiscal year 1973, the next highest level of annual aircraft funding was 5.5 percent in fiscal year 1989 and, in 12 other years, the funding was less than 4.5 percent of the overall DOD funding. Therefore, a long-term average would be more appropriate than early 1980\u2019s historical norms as a benchmark for an analysis of funding patterns, and its use would even out the high aircraft procurement funding of the early 1980s and the lower funding of the post-Vietnam and post-Cold War eras. However, such a benchmark should not be used as a threshold for spending on aircraft purchases because it may not reflect the changed nature of the defense requirements and U.S. strategy that occurred with the end of the Cold War.", "If DOD\u2019s aircraft investment strategy is implemented as planned and the defense budget stabilizes at DOD\u2019s currently projected fiscal year 2003 level (about $247 billion in constant fiscal year 1997 dollars), DOD\u2019s projected funding for aircraft purchases will exceed the historical average percentage of the defense budget for aircraft purchases in all but 1 year between fiscal year 2000 and 2015. For several years, it will approach the highest historical percentages of the defense budget for aircraft purchases. Those high percentages were attained during the peak Cold War spending of the early to mid-1980s.", "In fiscal year 1996, DOD spent $6.8 billion, or 2.6 percent of its overall budget, on aircraft purchases. To implement its aircraft investment strategy, DOD expects to increase its annual spending on aircraft purchases significantly from current levels and to sustain those higher levels for the indefinite future. For example, as shown in figure 4, DOD\u2019s annual spending on aircraft purchases is projected to increase about 94 percent from the fiscal year 1996 level to $13.2 billion by fiscal year 2002. Also, for 15 of the next 20 fiscal years beginning in fiscal year 1997, DOD\u2019s projected spending for aircraft purchases is expected to equal or exceed $11.9 billion annually. For 3 years during this period, DOD\u2019s projected annual spending on aircraft purchases will exceed $16 billion (6.5 percent of the budget) and for 1 of those years, it will exceed $18 billion (7.3 percent of the budget).", "In the current security and force structure environment, the need for that level of additional funding has not been made clear by DOD. Furthermore, other than stating that overall procurement funding in general will be increased, DOD has not identified specific reductions elsewhere within the procurement account or within the other major accounts to offset the significant proposed increases in aircraft procurement funding. Because the overall level of defense funding is expected to be stable, at best, any proposed increase in spending for a particular account or for a project will have to be offset elsewhere within the budget.", "Historically, acquisition programs almost always cost more than originally projected. Figure 4 is a conservative projection of DOD\u2019s aircraft funding requirements because no cost growth beyond current estimates is considered. Research has shown that unanticipated cost growth has averaged at least 20 percent over the life of aircraft programs. For at least one current program, it appears the historical patterns will be repeated. In January 1997, DOD reported that the procurement cost of the F-22 was expected to increase by over 20 percent and devised significant initiatives to offset that growth. We reported about this potential cost growth in June 1997 and concluded that the initiatives to offset the cost growth were optimistic.", "In addition, the projected funding requirements shown in figures 3 and 4 may be understated because they do not include any projected funding for other aircraft programs that have not been approved for procurement. For example, potential requirements exist to replace the KC-135, C-5A, F-15E, F-117, EA-6B, S-3B, and other aircraft. Adding any of these requirements to DOD\u2019s aircraft investment strategy would further complicate the funding problems."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Funding for Increased Procurement Is Uncertain", "paragraphs": ["The amount of funding likely to be available for national defense in the near term has been projected by both the President and the Congress. Both have essentially agreed that the total national defense budget will not increase measurably in real terms through fiscal year 2002.", "While the Congress has not expressed its sentiments regarding the defense budget beyond fiscal year 2002, last year DOD\u2019s long-term planning for its aircraft investment strategy assumed a real annual growth factor of 1 percent. Accordingly, procurement funding to accomplish the aircraft modernization programs was partially dependent on some level of real growth in the defense budget. However, because of commitments to balance the federal budget by both the President and the Congress, it appears likely that the defense budget will stabilize at current levels or decrease further, rather than increase as DOD\u2019s aircraft investment plans have assumed. According to DOD officials, the long-term planning now assumes no real growth in the defense budget. The impact of this change on DOD\u2019s aircraft programs is not yet clear."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Uncertain Savings Available for Additional Procurement", "paragraphs": ["DOD plans to increase overall funding for procurement programs over the next few years, and the aircraft programs are expected to be a prime beneficiary of that increased funding. DOD expects to increase procurement spending to a level of approximately $61.2 billion per year, from the current level of about $44.3 billion per year, while keeping overall defense spending at current levels, at least through fiscal year 2002. Of the $39.0 billion cumulative increase in procurement spending that is expected through fiscal year 2002, about $17.7 billion is projected to be used for DOD\u2019s aircraft investment strategy.", "To increase procurement funding while keeping overall defense spending at current levels, DOD anticipates major savings will be generated from infrastructure reductions and acquisition reform initiatives, as well as increased purchasing power through significantly lower inflation projections. We found, however, that there are unlikely to be sufficient savings available to offset DOD\u2019s projected procurement increases.", "DOD\u2019s planned procurement funding increase was partially predicated on base closure savings of $17.8 billion (then-year dollars) through fiscal  year 2001, a component of infrastructure, and shifting this money to pay for additional procurement. In 1996, however, we found no significant net infrastructure savings between fiscal year 1996 and 2001 because the proportion of infrastructure in the DOD budgets was projected to remain relatively constant through fiscal year 2001. Therefore, through fiscal  year 2001, DOD will have less funds available than expected for procurement from its infrastructure reform initiatives.", "In addition, our ongoing evaluation of acquisition reform savings on major weapon systems suggests that the amount of such savings that will be available to increase procurement spending is uncertain. Our work shows that the savings from acquisition reform have been used by the very programs generating the savings to fund other needs. This raises concern as to whether the latest acquisition reform initiatives will provide savings to realize modernization objectives for other weapons systems within the time frames envisioned. Without the level of savings expected from infrastructure reductions and acquisition reform, DOD will face difficult choices in funding its modernization plans.", "Finally, based on changes in future inflation factors, DOD calculated in its 1997 future years defense plan (FYDP) that its purchases of goods and services from fiscal years 1997 through 2002 would cost about $34.7 billion (then-year dollars) less than it had planned in its 1996 FYDP. The \u201cinflation dividend\u201d allowed DOD to include about $19.5 billion in additional programs in fiscal years 1997-2001 and permitted the executive branch to reduce DOD\u2019s projected funding by $15.2 billion over the same time period. However, using different inflation estimates, CBO calculated the cost reduction at only $10.3 billion, or $24.4 billion less than DOD\u2019s estimate. Because DOD\u2019s projected funding was reduced by $15.2 billion, CBO\u2019s estimate indicates that DOD\u2019s real purchasing power, rather than increasing, may be reduced by about $5 billion. If true, then DOD may have to make adjustments in its programs.", "We recently raised an issue on the Air Force\u2019s F-22 air superiority fighter that further complicates the situation. In estimating the cost to produce the F-22, the Air Force used an inflation rate of about 2.2 percent per year for all years after 1996. However, in agreeing to restructure the F-22 program to address the recently acknowledged $15 billion (then-year dollars) program cost increase, the Air Force and its contractors used an inflation rate of 3.2 percent per year. Increasing the inflation rate by  1 percent added billions of dollars to the F-22 program\u2019s estimated cost. We are concerned that the higher inflation rates could have a significant budgetary impact for other DOD acquisition programs. Similar increases on other major weapon programs would add billions of dollars to the amounts needed and further jeopardize DOD\u2019s ability to fund its modernization plans."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Program Instability Causes Schedule Stretchouts and Higher Unit Costs", "paragraphs": ["The basis for DOD\u2019s projections of total annual procurement funding is the cumulative annual funding needs of multiple weapons programs, each of which has typically been based on optimistic assumptions about procurement quantities and rates. Accordingly, DOD\u2019s projections of total annual procurement funding have been consistently optimistic. DOD\u2019s traditional approach to managing affordability problems is to reduce procurement quantities and extend production schedules without eliminating programs. Such actions normally result in significantly increased system procurement costs and delayed deliveries to operational units.", "We recently reported that the costs for 17 of 22 full-rate production systems we reviewed increased by $10 billion (fiscal year 1996 dollars) beyond original estimates through fiscal year 1996 due to stretching out the completion of the weapons\u2019 production. We found that DOD had inappropriately placed a high priority on buying large numbers of untested weapons during low-rate initial production to ensure commitment to new programs and thus had to cut by more than half its planned full-rate production for many weapons that had already been tested. We also found that actual production rates were, on average, less than half of originally planned rates. Primarily because of funding limitations, DOD has reduced the annual full-rate production for 17 of the 22 proven weapons reviewed, stretching out the completion of the weapons\u2019 production an average of  8 years (or 170 percent) longer than planned. Our work showed that DOD develops weapon system acquisition strategies that are based on optimistic projections of funding that are rarely achieved. As a result, a significant number of DOD\u2019s weapon systems are not being procured at planned production rates, leading to program stretchouts and billions of dollars of increased costs. If DOD bought weapons at minimum rates during low-rate initial production, more funds would be available to buy proven weapons in full-rate production at more efficient rates and at lower costs.", "If DOD\u2019s assumptions regarding future spending for its aircraft programs do not materialize, DOD may need to (1) reduce funding for some or all of the aircraft programs; (2) reduce funding for other procurement programs; (3) implement changes in infrastructure, operations, or other areas; or (4) increase overall defense funding. In other words, the likelihood of program stretchouts and significantly increased costs is very real."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions and Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["As the Nation proceeds into the 21st century faced with the prospect of a constrained budget, we believe DOD needs to take action now to address looming affordability problems with its aircraft investment strategy. Action needs to be taken now because, if major commitments are made to the initial procurement of all the planned aircraft programs (such as the F/A-18E/F, F-22, JSF, and the V-22) over the next several years, a significant imbalance is likely to result between funding requirements and available funding. Such imbalances have historically led to program stretchouts, higher unit costs, and delayed deliveries to operational units. Further, this imbalance may be long-term in nature, restricting DOD\u2019s ability to respond to other funding requirements.", "DOD needs to reorient its aircraft investment strategy to recognize the reality of a constrained overall defense budget for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, instead of continuing to start aircraft procurement programs that are based on optimistic assumptions about available funds, DOD should determine how much procurement funding can realistically be expected and structure its aircraft investment strategy within those levels. DOD also needs to provide more concrete and lasting assurance that its aircraft procurement programs are not only militarily justified in the current security environment but clearly affordable as planned throughout their entire procurement. The key to ensuring the efficient production of systems is program stability. Understated cost estimates and overly optimistic funding assumptions result in too many programs chasing too few dollars.", "We believe that bringing realism to DOD\u2019s acquisition plans will require very difficult decisions because programs will have to be terminated. While all involved may agree that there are too many programs chasing too few dollars, and could probably agree on the need to bring stability and executability to those programs that are pursued, it will be much more difficult to agree on which programs to cut. Nevertheless, the likelihood of continuing fiscal constraints and reduced national security threats should provide additional incentives for real progress in changing the structure and dominant culture of DOD\u2019s weapon system acquisition process.", "Therefore, we recommend that the Secretary of Defense, in close consultation with the defense and budget committees of the Congress, define realistic, long-term projections of overall defense funding and, within those amounts, the portion of the annual procurement funding that can be expected to be made available to purchase new or significantly improved aircraft. In developing the projections, the Secretary should consider whether the historical average percentage of the total budget for aircraft purchases is appropriate in today\u2019s security and budgetary environment.", "We also recommend that the Secretary reassess and report to the Congress on the overall affordability of DOD\u2019s aircraft investment strategy in light of the funding that is expected to be available. The Secretary should clearly identify the amount of funding required by source, including (1) any projected savings from infrastructure and acquisition reform initiatives and (2) any reductions elsewhere within the procurement account or within the other major accounts.", "We further recommend that the Secretary fully consider the availability of long-term funding for any aircraft program before approving the procurement planned for that system."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In commenting on a draft of this report, DOD partially concurred with our recommendations and stated that it is fully aware of the investment challenge highlighted in this report. DOD stated that its recent Quadrennial Defense Review addressed the affordability of the modernization programs that it believes are needed to meet the requirements of the defense strategy. The Quadrennial Defense Review recommended reductions in aircraft procurement plans. However, even to modernize the slightly smaller force that will result from the Quadrennial Defense Review, DOD believes that procurement funding must also rise to about $60 billion annually by fiscal year 2001, from about $44 billion in fiscal year 1997. Recognizing that overall defense budgets are not likely to increase substantially for the foreseeable future, DOD indicated that the additional procurement funds would be created by continuing efforts to reduce the costs of defense infrastructure and to fundamentally reengineer its business practices.", "Our recent reviews of DOD\u2019s previous initiatives to reduce the costs of defense infrastructure and reengineer business practices indicate that the amount and availability of savings from such initiatives may be substantially less than DOD has estimated. If the projected savings do not materialize as planned, or if estimates of the procurement costs of weapon systems prove to be too optimistic, DOD will need to rebalance the procurement plans to match the available resources. This action would likely result in further program adjustments and extensions.", "Concerning aircraft procurement projections, we continue to believe that a clearer understanding of DOD\u2019s long-term budgetary assumptions\u2014including specific, realistic projections of funding availability and planned aircraft procurement spending\u2014is necessary to determine the overall affordability of DOD\u2019s aircraft investment strategy.

This approach removes any cyclical effects on the investment in aircraft by allowing us to view the overall amount invested, as well as the major subcomponents of that investment.

We continue to believe that this type of long-term projection is needed by both DOD and the Congress to ensure that DOD\u2019s aircraft procurement programs are clearly affordable as planned through the span of procurement. 3. We continue to believe that the $17 billion increased cost of procuring F/18-E/F aircraft compared to F/A-18C/Ds is not warranted by the limited increases in performance that would be obtained. We recognize that, while the F/A-18E/F will provide some improvements over the F/A-18C/D, most notably in range, the F/A-18C/D\u2019s current capabilities are adequate to accomplish its assigned missions. Our rebuttals to DOD\u2019s specific comment are contained in our report, Naval Aviation: F/A-18E/F Will Provide Marginal Operational Improvement at High Cost (GAO/NSIAD-96-98, June 18, 1996). 4. Although procurement rates for F-22s during the planned low-rate initial production period were to be lowered in accordance with the Quadrennial Defense Review report, we continue to believe that the degree of overlap between development and production of the F-22 is high and that procurement of F-22s should be minimized until the aircraft demonstrates that it can successfully meet the established performance requirements during operational testing and evaluation. There has also been congressional concern about the cost and progress of the F-22 program. The Senate has initiated legislation to require us to review the F-22 development program annually. 5. We clarified the language in the report to more explicitly recommend that long-term projections of the availability of funds should be used as a guide to assess the likely availability of funds to carry out a program at the time of the procurement approval decision. The Quadrennial Defense Review recognized that more procurement dollars were being planned to be spent than were likely to be available over the long term. Our intent in making this recommendation is to recognize the difficulty DOD and the Congress face and to suggest some solid analysis that would aid in evaluating the long-term commitments that are inherent in nearer term decisions to procure weapon systems. A better understanding of the long-term budgetary assumptions underlying near-term decisions would clearly aid both DOD and the Congress in ensuring that needed weapon systems are affordable in both the near and long term."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Major Contributors to This Report", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "National Security and International Affairs Division, Washington, D.C.", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Related GAO Products", "paragraphs": ["Combat Air Power: Joint Assessment of Air Superiority Can Be Improved (GAO/NSIAD-97-77, Feb. 26, 1997).", "B-2 Bomber: Status of Efforts to Acquire 21 Operational Aircraft (GAO/NSIAD-97-11, Oct. 22, 1996).", "Air Force Bombers: Options to Retire or Restructure the Force Would Reduce Planned Spending (GAO/NSIAD-96-192, Sept. 30, 1996).", "U.S. Combat Air Power: Aging Refueling Aircraft Are Costly to Maintain and Operate (GAO/NSIAD-96-160, Aug. 8, 1996).", "Combat Air Power: Assessment of Joint Close Support Requirements and Capabilities Is Needed (GAO/NSIAD-96-45, June 28, 1996).", "U.S. Combat Air Power: Reassessing Plans to Modernize Interdiction Capabilities Could Save Billions (GAO/NSIAD-96-72, May 13, 1996).", "Combat Air Power: Funding Priority for Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses May Be Too Low (GAO/NSIAD-96-128, Apr. 10, 1996).", "Navy Aviation: AV-8B Harrier Remanufacture Strategy Is Not the Most Cost-Effective Option (GAO/NSIAD-96-49, Feb. 27, 1996).", "Future Years Defense Program: 1996 Program Is Considerably Different From the 1995 Program (GAO/NSIAD-95-213, Sept. 15, 1995).", "Aircraft Requirements: Air Force and Navy Need to Establish Realistic Criteria for Backup Aircraft (GAO/NSIAD-95-180, Sept. 29, 1995).", "Longbow Apache Helicopter: System Procurement Issues Need to Be Resolved (GAO/NSIAD-95-159, Aug. 24 1995).", "Comanche Helicopter: Testing Needs to Be Completed Prior to Production Decisions (GAO/NSIAD-95-112, May 18, 1995).", "Cruise Missiles: Proven Capability Should Affect Aircraft and Force Structure Requirements (GAO/NSIAD-95-116, Apr. 20, 1995).", "Army Aviation: Modernization Strategy Needs to Be Reassessed (GAO/NSIAD-95-9, Nov. 21, 1994).", "Future Years Defense Program: Optimistic Estimates Lead to Billions in Overprogramming (GAO/NSIAD-94-210, July 29, 1994).", "Continental Air Defense: A Dedicated Force Is No Longer Needed (GAO/NSIAD-94-76, May 3, 1994).", "The first copy of each GAO report and testimony is free.
