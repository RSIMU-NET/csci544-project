These changes were also made, in part, to encourage and support breastfeeding. Specifically, the agency issued revised regulations in 2007, finalized in 2014, that reduced the amount of formula authorized for partially breastfed infants and delayed the age when these infants may begin receiving formula. The regulations also reduced the amount of formula authorized for older fully formula-fed infants because they added infant fruits and vegetables for the first time.", "USDA has not conducted any nationwide studies on the extent of online sales of WIC formula by program participants, but information gathered from state WIC officials and GAO's own limited monitoring suggest that some WIC formula is offered for sale online, though program rules prohibit such sales. In 30 days of monitoring one online classifieds website in four large metropolitan areas, GAO found 2 posts in which individuals attempted to sell formula specifically identified as WIC\u2014among 2,726 that advertised infant formula generally. A larger number, 346 posts, advertised formula matching the brand, type, container volume, and amount provided to WIC participants, but did not indicate the source of the formula. Because WIC participants purchase the same brands and types from stores as non-WIC customers, monitoring attempted online sales of WIC formula can present a challenge. State officials GAO spoke with cited other challenges to monitoring online sales, such as the fact that individuals posting formula for sale online are able to remain relatively anonymous, and their posts may contain insufficient information to allow staff to identify them as WIC participants.", "USDA has taken steps to clarify that attempting to sell WIC formula online is a participant violation but has provided limited assistance to states in preventing and addressing these sales. For example, USDA has not specifically directed states to instruct participants that selling WIC formula is against program rules, which could lead to participants making these sales unknowingly and using program resources inappropriately. GAO's review of 25 state policy and procedure manuals found 7 that did not require local agency staff to inform participants of the prohibition. Further, although states are responsible for controlling participant violations\u2014including sales of WIC benefits\u2014USDA is responsible for determining compliance with the WIC statute and regulations. However, because the department has not required states to describe their procedures for controlling these violations, USDA is unable to both oversee and assess state efforts to ensure program integrity in this area. The department is also unable to assist states' efforts because it has not assessed the national extent of these sales or techniques for addressing them. Through interviews with 19 state and local WIC agency officials from 12 states, GAO found that states vary in their approaches and the amount of resources devoted to monitoring attempted WIC formula sales. In addition, due to monitoring challenges, some officials expressed concerns about the return on investment for these efforts.

Specifically, USDA provides grants to state agencies, which use the funds  to reimburse authorized retail vendors for the food purchased by WIC  participants and to provide services. As part of its monitoring and  oversight obligations, USDA annually reviews the state plan for each  state WIC agency, which describes the agency\u2019s objectives and  procedures for all aspects of administering WIC for the coming fiscal  year. USDA\u2019s review of state plans is one of the federal oversight  mechanisms for the program, and state plans provide important  information about how states administer WIC. For their part, state  agencies are responsible for developing WIC policies and procedures  within federal requirements, entering into agreements with local agencies  to operate the program, and monitoring and overseeing its  implementation by these local agencies. WIC regulations define  participant violations, which include the sale of WIC food benefits, and  require state agencies to establish procedures to control participant  violations. However, the regulations do not specify what steps states  should take to prevent participant violations, such as methods for  identifying attempted sales of WIC food benefits. The regulations also  require state agencies to establish sanctions for participant violations,  and require mandatory sanctions for certain types of violations. For  example, when a state establishes a claim of $100 or more against a  participant who improperly disposed of program benefits\u2014such as  through online sales\u2014it must disqualify the participant for 1 year.

After reviewing the nutritional needs of WIC participants and food  packages in a study contracted by USDA, the IOM recommended  changes to the packages\u2014including those containing formula. USDA  issued revised regulations in 2007\u2014which state agencies were required  to implement at the start of fiscal year 2010\u2014that adopted many of the  recommendations from the IOM report to further encourage and support  breastfeeding among participating mothers. According to USDA, the  revised food packages were developed to better reflect current nutrition  science and dietary recommendations than the food packages they were  replacing. Among other changes, the revised regulations reduced the  amount of formula provided to partially breastfed infants of all ages,  delayed when partially breastfed infants may begin receiving formula, and  reduced the amount of formula provided to older fully formula-fed infants.", "Amount of formula for partially breastfed infants: The revised  regulations authorize maximum formula amounts for infant  participants that vary by the extent to which the infant is breastfed  (see fig. 2). Under the previous regulations, partially breastfed  infants could receive up to the same amount of formula as those  who were fully formula-fed. Under the revised regulations,  \u201cpartially breastfed,\u201d for the purposes of assigning the WIC food  package, means an infant who is breastfed but also receives  formula from the WIC program up to a maximum amount that is  approximately half the amount of formula allowed for a fully  formula-fed infant. USDA stated that this new category is  intended to provide stronger incentives for continued  breastfeeding, such as by providing partially breastfeeding  mothers with additional quantities and types of supplemental  foods\u2014such as whole wheat bread or other whole grains\u2014that  are not provided to non-breastfeeding mothers. Because  partially breastfed infants require less formula than fully formula- fed infants, this change may have reduced the potential for waste  in the program.", "Age at which partially breastfed infants receive formula: To  further support the successful establishment of breastfeeding, the  revised regulations disallow the routine issuance of formula to  partially breastfeeding infants during the first month after birth.  While mothers of partially breastfed infants are not to  automatically receive formula, local agency staff have some  discretion and may determine, based on an assessment of the  nutritional needs of the infant, that it is appropriate to make a  small amount of formula available. According to the IOM, the fact  that partially breastfed infants, under previous regulations, could  receive up to the same amount of formula from birth as fully  formula-fed infants may have interfered with mothers\u2019 milk  production and success at continued breastfeeding. Between  implementation of the revised regulations in fiscal year 2010 and  fiscal year 2014, the number of infant participants who were either partially or fully breastfed increased nearly 4 percent (see fig. 3).", "Formula amounts for older fully formula-fed infants: Under the  revised regulations, fully formula-fed infants 6 through 11 months  of age are authorized to receive less formula than they were  authorized to previously. In addition, to introduce infants of this  age to a variety of nutritious foods, the revised regulations, for the  first time, added infant food fruits and vegetables to their food  packages. Because the addition of fruits and vegetables  provides infants greater amounts of nutrients, in its 2005 report,  IOM determined that less formula is needed for infants that  receive these foods. According to USDA, the revised maximum  formula amount authorized for these infants is based on a  scientific review of the calorie and nutrient needs of infants at this  age.", "While federal regulations specify the maximum amount of formula  different categories of infants are authorized to receive, state and local  agency staff have some flexibility in determining precise amounts to  provide, depending on an infant\u2019s nutritional needs. Staff at local WIC  agencies play a critical role in determining infants\u2019 feeding categories, and  they have the authority to provide them with less formula than the  maximum amount allowed for each category, if nutritionally warranted.  Nutrition specialists, such as physicians or nutritionists, working at the  local agency perform nutritional assessments for prospective participants  as part of certification procedures. They use the nutritional  assessment information to appropriately target food packages to  participants. WIC staff also provide regular nutrition and breastfeeding  education services to established participants. In the guidance USDA  issued in 2009 to assist state and local agency staff in implementing the  provisions of the new food package regulations, staff were directed to  tailor the amount of infant formula to the assessed needs of breastfed  infants rather than to routinely issue food packages with standard  quantities of infant formula to these infants. Further, the guidance stated  that the maximum amount of formula authorized in the regulations is  rarely warranted for partially breastfed infants.", "Even with USDA\u2019s guidance, it is possible that some participants receive  formula that they do not need or cannot use, and state and local policies  on how participants should handle excess formula vary. WIC provided  formula to a monthly average of nearly 1.8 million infant participants in  2013, according to USDA. Although federal regulations define the sale of  WIC food benefits as a participant violation, one USDA official told us  there is no federal guidance that addresses how local agencies should  instruct participants to handle unused formula.

Officials from 7 of the 12 states we  spoke with told us that participants are instructed to return unused  formula to local agencies. Further, officials from the 2 local agencies we  spoke with explained that it is relatively common for participants to return  infant formula to their local agency, and one added that participants often  return formula for health reasons, as pediatricians sometimes prescribe  specialized formula because of food allergies.

One USDA official noted that it is difficult for states  to prove that participants are selling WIC food benefits, which increases  the amount of time and effort state staff need to spend to address these  cases. Officials from one state WIC agency and one local WIC agency  we spoke to said that efforts by state and local agency staff to identify and  address online WIC formula sales result in few confirmed cases and draw  away scarce resources from other aspects of administering the program.

By better tailoring the food packages, USDA has better  aligned the maximum amount of infant formula local agencies are allowed  to provide to certain participants. For example, the reduction USDA made  to the amount of formula that can be provided to partially breastfed infants  reduced the amount of excess formula provided to them, which may have  helped reduce opportunities for sales of excess formula. However, it is  clear that some participants are selling WIC formula online,  inappropriately using program resources. Although the extent of this  activity is unknown, explicitly informing WIC participants that such sales  are against WIC rules could help improve program integrity by preventing  some online sales of WIC infant formula. However, USDA has not  required state agencies to inform participants of this prohibition, and  some states are not requiring local staff to do so. As a result, some  participants may attempt to sell excess WIC formula online without the  knowledge that it is against program rules.", "Monitoring online classified advertisements for attempted sales of WIC  formula is another way to ensure program integrity. As the technological  environment has changed with the increased use of e-commerce, actions  needed to ensure WIC participants do not inappropriately use infant  formula have changed as well. While USDA officials believe that states  monitor for online sales of WIC formula, USDA currently does not collect  information to confirm this. As a result, USDA is unable to effectively  oversee state efforts to control this participant violation, and the agency  lacks assurance that efforts are taking place nationwide. State officials we  spoke to have responded to the inherent challenges involved in  monitoring websites for infant formula sales with varied approaches,  which likely yield varied outcomes, and some officials told us the return  on investment for their monitoring efforts is low. However, because USDA  and state agencies lack information from a national perspective about  online sales of WIC food benefits and cost-effective approaches for  identifying and addressing these sales, states are likely to be poorly  positioned to strike the appropriate balance of costs and benefits when  determining how to target their resources to ensure program integrity."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To better ensure that WIC participants are aware of the prohibition  against selling WIC formula, and to assist states\u2019 efforts to prevent and  address online formula sales, we recommend that the Secretary of  Agriculture direct the Administrator of FNS to take the following three  actions:  Instruct state agencies to include in the rights and responsibilities  statement that participants are not allowed to sell WIC food benefits,  including online.", "Require state agencies to articulate their procedures for identifying  attempted sales of WIC food benefits in their WIC state plans and  analyze the information to ascertain the national extent of state  efforts.", "Collect information to help assess the national extent of attempted  online sales of WIC formula benefits and determine cost-effective  techniques states can use to monitor online classified advertisements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Secretary of Agriculture for review  and comment.

USDA officials noted that because the  regulatory process can be lengthy, in the interim period, the department  will consider issuing guidance recommending these as best practices to  state agencies. Regarding the third recommendation, officials said they  would make it a priority to explore options for using available resources to  assess the extent of online sales of WIC formula and to identify and share  best practices, cost-effective techniques, or new approaches with state  agencies to use in monitoring online advertisements. Specifically, they  may draw on funds designated for addressing high-priority programmatic  issues, and collaborate with stakeholders and other FNS program staff on  monitoring strategies.

We reviewed  relevant federal laws, regulations, and U.S. Department of Agriculture  (USDA) guidance to determine requirements related to the provision of  formula to infants receiving WIC, as well as to identify federal, state, and  local roles related to preventing and addressing online sales of WIC  formula. We also interviewed USDA officials and reviewed USDA\u2019s data  on WIC infant participants who breastfeed, which was available for fiscal  years 2010 through 2014. As part of our interviews with USDA officials,  we assessed the reliability of these data and determined that they were  sufficiently reliable for the purpose of this study. To help us understand  how federal WIC food requirements were recently modified, we also  reviewed a 2005 report published by the National Academies\u2019 Institute of  Medicine, since many of the changes were based on the  recommendations of this report. To determine the role USDA regulations  and guidance play in preventing and addressing online sales of WIC  formula, we reviewed a non-generalizable sample of 25 states\u2019 WIC  policy and procedure manuals to determine how consistent states\u2019  policies and procedures are in preventing and addressing online formula  sales. To obtain some information about the extent of online sales of WIC  formula in four metropolitan areas, we conducted monitoring of online  classified advertisements to sell formula using one popular e-commerce  website. To obtain additional information relevant to our study, we also  interviewed an official from the National WIC Association, as well as 19  state and local WIC officials representing 12 states. In addition, we  assessed USDA\u2019s controls against GAO standards for Internal Control in  the Federal Government.", "We conducted this performance audit from April 2014 through December  2014 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

However, federal regulations do not require state agencies to inform  participants of this type of program violation.

We selected these areas based on (1) high number of births\u2014defined as  over 100,000 or more in the metropolitan area between July 1, 2012 and  July 1, 2013, (2) high state WIC caseloads\u2014defined as over 275,000  participants in fiscal year 2013, and (3) geographic dispersion. Our  monitoring results are not generalizable to all localities across the United  States.", "We conducted our monitoring of potential attempts to sell WIC formula  during a 30-day period, from mid-June 2014 through mid-July 2014.  During that period, we conducted manual search queries of the section of  the website specified for infant- and child-related sales on each non- holiday weekday to detect postings containing the key terms \u201cformula\u201d or  \u201cWIC.\u201d We also conducted manual search queries of the same section of  the website using the name of the formula brand equivalent to the WIC- contracted formula brand specific to the metropolitan area\u2019s state. We  reviewed the text of each posting that contained the term \u201cWIC,\u201d as well  as each posting containing the state-specific WIC-contracted formula  brand. During our reviews of the text of the postings, we also identified  those that met additional criteria generally consistent with WIC formula  provided to participants. Specifically, the formula type and volume of  formula container advertised for sale were equivalent to a type and  volume of formula provided to WIC participants in the state in which the  posting was made, and the amount of formula advertised for sale  represented approximately 85 percent or more of the maximum amount of  formula authorized for fully formula-fed infant WIC participants each  month, averaged across all ages. We included the latter criterion to help  us identify individuals attempting to sell relatively large quantities of  formula. While this provides no information about the individuals\u2019  relationship to the WIC program, we included this criterion because  participants receiving WIC checks or vouchers for formula may be likely  to purchase the infant\u2019s entire monthly allotment of formula at one time.", "This may result in WIC participants having multiple cans of unused  formula, for example, if the infant switches formulas during the month, as  noted in the two posts we found that specifically stated the individuals  were attempting to sell WIC formula online. However, a relatively large  amount of formula could also indicate intent to traffic WIC benefits in bulk  in order to make a profit.", "When designing our monitoring approach, we relied on lessons learned  by the GAO team that recently conducted a study to assess online sales  of other federal nutrition benefits.  For example, we based our decision to  use the popular e-commerce website on the experience of the other GAO  team, which used both that website and a social media website. The team  found that monitoring efforts were most effective when using the e- commerce website. Similarly, the other team used both an automated and  a manual approach to monitor the e-commerce website but found the  manual approach to be more effective\u2014as measured by more postings  indicative of potential sales of these benefits\u2014than the automated   Our monitoring was conducted to provide some information  approach.on the extent to which WIC participants may have attempted to sell WIC  formula in four metropolitan areas over 30 days. As a result, we  conducted our monitoring activities for illustrative purposes, and we did  not intend to use them as evidence for our own investigations into  potential WIC participant violations. However, we provided information to  USDA officials about the two posts that explicitly stated the formula for  sale was from WIC.", "Our monitoring approach had some limitations. In the posts we reviewed,  individuals might have been selling WIC formula, but did not clearly state  in the post that the formula offered for sale was from WIC. As a result, our  finding likely undercounts the number of individuals who offered WIC  formula for sale in the four metropolitan areas during our monitoring  period. Further, because of the general lack of structure to online sales,  our findings on the numbers of posts offering formula for sale that met our  criteria may over- or under-represent the true number. Specifically, while  we excluded duplicate posts we identified on individual days, we were  unable to identify duplicate posts across different days. Therefore, if  someone posted formula for sale that met our criteria on Tuesday, and  then because the formula did not immediately sell, they posted the same  formula for sale on Friday, we would have counted those both as posts  offering formula for sale. As a result, while our methods provide the total  number of formula posts during our monitoring period, excluding duplicate  posts on the same day, we cannot be certain that each post represented  a new offer of formula for sale. In addition, our findings may understate  the total number of posts from individuals attempting to sell WIC formula  online because, although we chose search terms we thought individuals  would be most likely to use, it is possible some individuals used different  terms. We also had to make some assumptions about posts that did not  include sufficient detail in the text of the post. For example, we included in  our findings posts that did not explicitly state the formula brand name,  type, or container volume in the text but included a photo that showed  formula matching the criteria we identified. However, it is possible that the  photo in some posts did not, in fact, match the formula being offered for  sale, resulting in our findings overstating the true number."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgements", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Rachel Frisk (Assistant Director),  Sara Pelton (analyst in charge), and Bryant Torres made key  contributions to this report.
