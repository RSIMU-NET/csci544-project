Since ADL is still a new and evolving tool, systematic evaluative processes have not yet been required. Without clear goals and an effective process for evaluating the results of ADL application, DOD cannot ensure that its program is achieving an appropriate return on investment and other goals. The criteria for converting PME courses and curricula to ADL vary by school and by military service, are based on subjective choices as to which content is suited for online delivery, and are focused solely on nonresident programs. The private sector similarly lacks systematic criteria in its use of ADL. However, DOD's implementation of ADL programs for PME compares favorably with private-sector institutions. Cultural, technological, and resource challenges affect ADL implementation. For example, some military policies reflect a lower estimation of the value of nonresident PME, and many respondents to a survey of ADL students and alumni indicated that its quality and achievement of outcomes did not compare favorably, in their view, with those of resident education programs.

DOD is not alone in this problem\u2014the lack of metrics for  performance effectiveness and learning outcomes is pervasive throughout  all educational institutions. Our prior efforts indicate that most public and  private institutions lack a framework with which to assess implementation  of training and development efforts. However, agencies need clear  information on how training and development efforts affect organizational  performance, and decision makers will likely want to compare the  performance of these programs with that of other programs. Without clear  goals and an effective process for evaluating the results of ADL application,  DOD cannot ensure that ADL is achieving appropriate return on  investment, student retention, student access, and other goals in  comparison with prior efforts.

Generally, the  Air Force requires completion of a corresponding PME level of study  before a candidate is considered for the next promotion level. The Army,  while not as strict as the Air Force, places a high value on PME and  graduate education in promotion decisions. The Navy, placing a higher  premium on operational experience, currently is less inclined to  recognize PME as a credential for promotion.", "Learning Objectives Between Programs\u2014PME officials stated that, as  outlined by Joint Staff policies, learning objectives for nonresident  courses are required to be the same for resident courses, regardless of  the method of delivery.
