As a result, the Program Manager and key stakeholders have  met all five criteria for addressing our high-risk designation, and we are  removing this issue from our High-Risk List. While this progress is  commendable, it does not mean the government has eliminated all risk  associated with sharing terrorism-related information. It remains  imperative that the Program Manager and key departments and agencies  continue their efforts to advance and sustain ISE.

Following the terrorist attacks of 2001, Congress and the executive  branch took numerous actions aimed explicitly at establishing a range of  new measures to strengthen the nation\u2019s ability to identify, detect, and  deter terrorism-related activities. For example, ISE was established in  accordance with the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of  2004 (Intelligence Reform Act) to facilitate the sharing of terrorism-related  information. Figure 1 depicts the relationship between the various  stakeholders and disciplines involved with the sharing and safeguarding  of terrorism-related information through ISE.", "The Program Manager and key departments and agencies met the  leadership commitment and capacity criteria in 2015, and have  subsequently sustained efforts in both these areas.

Key  departments and agencies also continued to allocate resources to  operations that improve information sharing, including developing better  technical capabilities.", "The Program Manager and key departments and agencies also  developed, generally agreed upon, and executed the 2013 Strategic  Implementation Plan (Implementation Plan), which includes the overall  strategy and more specific planning steps to achieve ISE. Further, they have demonstrated that various information-sharing initiatives are being  used across multiple agencies as well as state, local, and private sector  stakeholders. For example, the project manager has developed a  comprehensive framework for managing enterprise architecture to help  share and integrate terrorism-related information among multiple  stakeholders in ISE. Specifically, the Project Interoperability initiative  includes technical resources and other guidance that promote greater  information system compatibility and performance. Furthermore, the key  departments and agencies have applied the concepts of the Project  Interoperability Initiative to improve mission operations by better linking  different law enforcement databases, and facilitating better geospatial  analysis, among other things.", "In addition, the Program Manager and key departments and agencies  have continued to devise and implement ways to measure the effect of  ISE on information sharing to address terrorist and other threats to the  homeland. They developed performance metrics for specific information- sharing initiatives (e.g., fusion centers) used by various stakeholders to  receive and share information. The Program Manager and key  departments and agencies have also documented mission-specific  accomplishments (e.g., related to maritime domain awareness) where the  Program Manager helped connect previously incompatible information  systems. The Program Manager has also partnered with DHS to create  an Information Sharing Measure Development Pilot that intends to better  measure the effectiveness of information sharing across all levels of ISE.", "Further, the Program Manager and key departments and agencies have  used the Implementation Plan to track progress, address challenges, and  substantially achieve the objectives in the National Strategy for  Information Sharing and Safeguarding. The Implementation Plan  contains 16 priority objectives, and by the end of fiscal year 2016, 13 of  the 16 priority objectives were completed. The Program Manager  transferred the remaining three objectives, which were all underway, to  other entities with the appropriate technical expertise to continue  implementation through fiscal year 2019.", "In our 2013 high-risk update, we listed nine action items that were critical  for moving ISE forward. In that report, we determined that two of those  action items\u2014demonstrating that the leadership structure has the needed  authority to leverage participating departments, and updating the vision  for ISE\u2014had been completed. In our 2015 update, we determined that  the Program Manager and key departments had achieved four of the  seven remaining action items\u2014demonstrating that departments are  defining incremental costs and funding; continuing to identify  technological capabilities and services that can be shared collaboratively;  demonstrating that initiatives within individual departments are, or will be,  leveraged to benefit all stakeholders; and demonstrating that  stakeholders generally agree with the strategy, plans, time frames,  responsibilities, and activities for substantially achieving ISE.", "For the 2017 update, we determined that the remaining three action items  have been completed: establishing an enterprise architecture  management capability; demonstrating that the federal government can  show, or is more fully developing a set of metrics to measure, the extent  to which sharing has improved under ISE; and demonstrating that  established milestones and time frames are being used as baselines to  track and monitor progress. Achieving all nine action items has, in effect,  addressed our high-risk criteria.", "While this demonstrates significant and important progress, sharing  terrorism-related information remains a constantly evolving work in  progress that requires continued effort and attention from the Program  Manager, departments, and agencies.

In  addition to DOD\u2019s inventory management, the supply chain management  high-risk area focuses on materiel distribution and asset visibility within  DOD. Based on DOD\u2019s leadership commitment and demonstrated  progress to address weaknesses since 2010, we are removing the  inventory management component from the supply chain management  high-risk area.

Both types of systems are critical to weather forecasters, climatologists,  and the military, who map and monitor changes in weather, climate, the  oceans, and the environment. Federal agencies are planning or executing  major satellite acquisition programs to replace existing polar and  geostationary satellite systems that are nearing or beyond the end of their  expected life spans. The Department of Commerce\u2019s National Oceanic  and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is responsible for the polar  satellite program that crosses the equator in the afternoon and for the  nation\u2019s geostationary weather satellite program; DOD is responsible for  the polar satellite program that crosses the equator in the early morning  orbit.", "Over the last several years, we have reported on the potential for a gap in  satellite data between the time that the current satellites are expected to  reach the end of their lifespans, and the time when the next satellites are  expected to be in orbit and operational.

According to NOAA program officials, a satellite data  gap would result in less accurate and timely weather forecasts and  warnings of extreme events\u2014such as hurricanes, storm surges, and  floods. Such degraded forecasts and warnings would endanger lives,  property, and our nation\u2019s critical infrastructures. Similarly, according to  DOD officials, a gap in space-based weather monitoring capabilities could  affect the planning, execution, and sustainment of U.S. military operations  around the world. In our prior high-risk updates, we reported on NOAA\u2019s  efforts to mitigate the risk of a gap in its polar and geostationary satellite  programs.", "With strong congressional support and oversight, NOAA has made  significant progress in its efforts to mitigate the potential for gaps in  weather satellite data on its geostationary weather satellite program.  Specifically, the agency demonstrated strong leadership commitment to  mitigating potential gaps in geostationary satellite data by revising and  improving its gap mitigation/contingency plans. Previously, in December  2014, we reported on shortfalls in the satellite program\u2019s gap  mitigation/contingency plans and made recommendations to NOAA to  address these shortfalls. For example, we noted that the plan did not  sufficiently address  strategies for preventing a launch delay,  timelines and triggers to prevent a launch delay, and whether any of its mitigation strategies would meet minimum  performance levels.", "NOAA agreed with these recommendations and released a new version  of its geostationary satellite contingency plan in February 2015 that  addressed the recommendations, thereby meeting the criterion for having  an action plan.", "We rated capacity as partially met in our 2015 report due to concerns  about NOAA\u2019s ability to complete critical testing activities because it was  already conducting testing on a round-the-clock, accelerated schedule.  Since then, NOAA adjusted its launch schedule to allow time to complete  critical integration and testing activities. In doing so, the agency  demonstrated that it met the capacity criterion.", "NOAA has also met the criterion for demonstrating progress by mitigating  schedule risks and successfully launching the satellite. In September  2013, we reported that the agency had weaknesses in its schedule- management practices on its core ground system and spacecraft. We  made recommendations to address those weaknesses, which included  sequencing all activities, ensuring there are adequate resources for the  activities, and analyzing schedule risks. NOAA agreed with the  recommendations and the Geostationary Operational Environmental  Satellite-R series (GOES-R) program improved its schedule management  practices. By early 2016, the program had improved the links between  remaining activities on the spacecraft schedule, included needed  schedule logic for a greater number of activities on the ground schedule,  and included indications on the ground schedule that the results of a  schedule risk analysis were used in calculating its durations. In addition,  the program successfully launched the GOES-R satellite in November  2016.", "Oversight by Congress has been instrumental in reducing the risk of  geostationary weather satellite gaps. For example, Subcommittees of the  House Science, Space, and Technology committee held multiple hearings  to provide oversight of the satellite acquisition and the risk of gaps in  satellite coverage.", "As a result, the agency now has a robust constellation of operational and  backup satellites in orbit and has made significant progress in addressing  the risk of a gap in geostationary data coverage.

The  Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s (EPA) ability to effectively  implement its mission of protecting public health and the environment  is critically dependent on assessing the risks posed by chemicals in a  credible and timely manner. EPA assesses these risks under a variety  of actions, including the Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS)  program and EPA\u2019s Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) program.  The IRIS program has made some progress on the capacity,  monitoring, and demonstrated progress criteria. In terms of IRIS  capacity, EPA has partially met this criterion by finalizing a Multi-Year  Agenda to better assess how many people and resources should be  dedicated to the IRIS program. In terms of IRIS monitoring, EPA has  met this criterion in part by using a Chemical Assessment Advisory  Committee to review IRIS assessments, among other actions. In  terms of IRIS demonstrated progress, EPA has partially met this  criterion as of January 2017 by issuing five assessments since fiscal  year 2015.", "The Frank R.

The  new law provides EPA with greater authority and the ability to take  actions that could help EPA implement its mission of protecting  human health and the environment. EPA officials stated that the  agency is better positioned to take action to require chemical  companies to report chemical toxicity and exposure data. Officials  also stated that the new law gives the agency additional authorities,  including the authority to require companies to develop new  information relating to a chemical as necessary for prioritization and  risk evaluation.", "Using both new and previously existing TSCA authorities should  enhance the agency\u2019s ability to gather new information as necessary  to evaluate hazard and exposure risks. Continued leadership  commitment from EPA officials and Congress will be needed to fully  implement reforms.

In addition, in December 2016, two real property reform bills  were enacted that could address the long-standing problem of federal  excess and underutilized property. The Federal Assets Sale and  Transfer Act of 2016 may help address stakeholder influence by  establishing an independent board to identify and recommend five  high-value civilian federal buildings for disposal within 180 days after  the board members are appointed, as well as develop  recommendations to dispose and redevelop federal civilian real  properties.", "Additionally, the Federal Property Management Reform Act of 2016  codified the Federal Real Property Council (FRPC) for the purpose of  ensuring efficient and effective real property management while  reducing costs to the federal government. FRPC is required to  establish a real property management plan template, which must  include performance measures, and strategies and government-wide  goals to reduce surplus property or to achieve better utilization of  underutilized property. In addition, federal agencies are required to  annually provide FRPC a report on all excess and underutilized  property, and identify leased space that is not fully used or occupied.", "In addressing our 2016 recommendation to improve the reliability of  real property data, GSA conducted an in-depth survey that focused on  key real property data elements maintained in the Federal Real  Property Profile, formed a working group of CFO Act agencies to  analyze the survey results and reach consensus on reforms, and  issued a memorandum to CFO Act agencies designed to improve the  consistency and quality of real property data. The Federal Protective  Service, which protects about 9,500 federal facilities, implemented our  recommendation aimed at improving physical security by issuing a  plan that identifies goals and describes resources that support its risk  management approach.

This information is used to provide updated information for weather  observations and models. However, the department was slow to develop  plans to replace the existing satellites that provide this coverage.  Because DOD delayed establishing plans for its next generation of  weather satellites, there is a risk of a satellite data gap in the early  morning orbit.", "The last satellite that the department launched in 2014 called Defense  Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP)-19, stopped providing recorded  data used in weather models in February 2016. A prior satellite, called  DMSP-17, is now the primary satellite operating in the early morning orbit.  However, this satellite, which was launched in 2006, is operating with  limitations due to the age of its instruments.

The Weather System Follow-on\u2014Microwave program does not  address these two highest-priority capabilities and the department has not  yet determined its long-term plans for providing these capabilities. As a  result, the department will need to continue to rely on the older DMSP-17  satellite until its new satellite becomes operational in 2022, and it  establishes and implements plans to address the high-priority capabilities  that the new satellite will not address.

These plans include a greater reliance on  international partner capabilities, exploring options to move a  geostationary satellite over an affected region, and plans to explore  options for acquiring and fielding new equipment, such as satellites and  satellite components to provide the capabilities. In addition, the  department anticipates that the demonstration satellite to be developed  as a precursor to the Weather System Follow-on\u2014Microwave program  could help mitigate a potential gap by providing some useable data.

In response, in May 2010, the Department of the  Interior (Interior) first reorganized its offshore oil and gas management  activities into separate offices for revenue collection, under the Office of  Natural Resources Revenue, and energy development and regulatory  oversight, under the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation  and Enforcement. Later, in October 2011, Interior further reorganized its  energy development and regulatory oversight activities when it  established two new bureaus to oversee offshore resources and  operational compliance with environmental and safety requirements. The  new Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) is responsible for  leasing and approving offshore development plans while the new Bureau  of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) is responsible for lease  operations, safety, and enforcement.", "In 2011, we added Interior\u2019s management of federal oil and gas resources  to the High-Risk List based on three concerns: (1) Interior did not have  reasonable assurance that it was collecting its share of billions of dollars  of revenue from federal oil and gas resources; (2) Interior continued to  experience problems hiring, training, and retaining sufficient staff to  oversee and manage federal oil and gas resources; and (3) Interior was  engaged in restructuring its oil and gas program, which is inherently  challenging, and there were questions about whether Interior had the  capacity to reorganize while carrying out its range of responsibilities,  especially in a constrained resource environment.", "Immediately after reorganizing, Interior developed memorandums and  standard operating procedures to define roles and responsibilities, and  facilitate and formalize coordination between BOEM and BSEE. Interior  also revised polices intended to improve its oversight of offshore oil and  gas activities, such as new requirements designed to mitigate the risk of a  subsea well blowout or spill. In 2013, we determined that progress had  been made, because Interior had fundamentally completed reorganizing  its oversight of offshore oil and gas activities. As a result, in 2013, we  removed the reorganization segment from this high-risk area.", "However, in February 2016, we reported that BSEE had undertaken  various reform efforts since its creation in 2011, but had not fully  addressed deficiencies in its investigative, environmental compliance, and  enforcement capabilities identified by investigations after the Deepwater  Horizon incident.", "BSEE\u2019s ongoing restructuring has made limited progress enhancing the  bureau\u2019s investigative capabilities. BSEE continues to use pre\u2013 Deepwater Horizon incident policies and procedures. Specifically, BSEE  has not completed a policy outlining investigative responsibilities or  updated procedures for investigating incidents\u2014among the goals of  BSEE\u2019s restructuring, according to restructuring planning documents, and  consistent with federal standards for internal control. The use of outdated  investigative policies and procedures is a long-standing deficiency. Post\u2013 Deepwater Horizon incident investigations found that Interior\u2019s policies  and procedures did not require it to plan investigations, gather and  document evidence, and ensure quality control, and determined that  continuing to use them posed a risk to the effectiveness of bureau  investigations. Without completing and updating its investigative policies  and procedures, BSEE continues to face this risk.", "BSEE\u2019s ongoing restructuring of its environmental compliance program  reverses actions taken to address post\u2013Deepwater Horizon incident  concerns, and risks weakening the bureau\u2019s environmental compliance  oversight capabilities. In 2011, in response to two post\u2013Deepwater  Horizon incident investigations that found that BSEE\u2019s predecessor\u2019s  focus on oil and gas development might have been at the expense of  protecting the environment, BSEE created an environmental oversight  division with region-based staff reporting directly to the headquarters- based division chief instead of regional management. This reporting  structure was to help ensure that environmental issues received  appropriate weight and consideration within the bureau.", "Under the restructuring, since February 2015, field-based environmental  compliance staff again report to their regional directors. BSEE\u2019s rationale  for this action is unclear, as it was not documented or analyzed as part of  the bureau\u2019s restructuring planning. Under federal standards for internal  control, management is to assess the risks posed by external and internal  sources and decide what actions to take to mitigate them. Without  assessing the risk of reversing its reporting structure, Interior cannot be  sure that BSEE will have reasonable assurance that environmental issues  are receiving the appropriate weight and consideration, as called for by  post\u2013Deepwater Horizon incident investigations.", "When we reviewed BSEE\u2019s environmental compliance program, we found  that the interagency agreements between Interior and EPA designed to  coordinate water quality monitoring under the National Pollutant  Discharge Elimination System were decades old. According to BSEE  annual environmental compliance activity reports, the agreements may  not reflect the agency\u2019s current resources and needs. For example, a  1989 agreement stipulates that Interior shall inspect no more than 50  facilities on behalf of EPA per year, and shall not conduct water sampling  on behalf of EPA. Almost 30 years later, after numerous changes in  drilling practices and technologies, it is unclear whether inspecting no  more than 50 facilities per year is sufficient to monitor water quality.", "Nevertheless, senior BSEE officials told us that the bureau has no plans  to update its agreements with EPA, and some officials said that a  previous headquarters-led effort to update the agreements was not  completed because it did not sufficiently describe the bureau\u2019s offshore oil  and gas responsibilities. According to Standards for Internal Control in the  Federal Government, as programs change and agencies strive to improve  operational processes and adopt new technologies, management officials  must continually assess and evaluate internal controls to ensure that  control activities are effective and updated when necessary.", "BSEE\u2019s ongoing restructuring has made limited progress in enhancing its  enforcement capabilities. In particular, BSEE has not developed  procedures with criteria to guide how it uses enforcement tools\u2014such as  warnings and fines\u2014which are among the goals of BSEE\u2019s restructuring,  according to planning documents, and consistent with federal standards  for internal control. BSEE restructuring plans state that the current lack of  criteria causes BSEE to act inconsistently, which makes oil and gas  industry operators uncertain about BSEE\u2019s oversight approach and  expectations. The absence of enforcement climate criteria is a long- standing deficiency. For example, post\u2013Deepwater Horizon incident  investigations recommended BSEE assess its enforcement tools and how  to employ them to deter safety and environmental violations. Without  developing procedures with defined criteria for taking enforcement  actions, BSEE continues to face risks to the effectiveness of its  enforcement capabilities.", "To enhance Interior\u2019s oversight of oil and gas development, we  recommended in February 2016 that the Secretary of the Interior direct  the Director of BSEE to take the following nine actions as it continues to  restructure.", "To address risks to the effectiveness of BSEE\u2019s investigations,  environmental compliance, and enforcement capabilities, we  recommended that BSEE complete policies outlining the  responsibilities of investigations, environmental compliance, and  enforcement programs, and update and develop procedures to guide  them.", "To enhance its investigative capabilities, we recommended that establish a capability to review investigation policy and collect and  analyze incidents to identify trends in safety and environmental  hazards; develop a plan with milestones for implementing the case  management system for investigations;  clearly communicate the purpose of BSEE\u2019s investigations  program to industry operators; and  clarify policies and procedures for assigning panel investigation  membership and referring cases of suspected criminal  wrongdoing to the Inspector General.", "To enhance its environmental compliance capabilities, we recommend  conduct and document a risk analysis of the regional-based  reporting structure of its Environmental Compliance Division,  including actions to mitigate any identified risks;  coordinate with the Administrator of the Environmental Protection  Agency to consider the relevance of existing interagency  agreements for monitoring operator compliance with National  Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permits on the Outer  Continental Shelf and, if necessary, update agreements to reflect  current oversight needs; and develop a plan to address documented environmental oversight  staffing needs.", "To enhance its enforcement capabilities, we recommended that BSEE  develop a mechanism to ensure that it reviews the maximum daily  civil penalty and adjusts it to reflect changes in the Consumer Price  Index within the time frames established by statute.", "In its written comments, Interior agreed that additional reforms\u2014such as  documented policies and procedures\u2014are needed to address offshore oil  and gas oversight deficiencies, but Interior neither agreed nor disagreed  with our specific recommendations.

Resolving the role of the federal  government in housing finance will require leadership commitment  and action by Congress and the administration. The federal  government has directly or indirectly supported more than two-thirds  of the value of new mortgage originations in the single-family housing  market since the beginning of the 2007-2009 financial crisis.  Mortgages with federal support include those backed by Fannie Mae  and Freddie Mac, two large government-sponsored enterprises (the  enterprises). Out of concern that their deteriorating financial condition  threatened the stability of financial markets, the Federal Housing  Finance Agency (FHFA) placed the enterprises into federal  conservatorship in 2008, creating an explicit fiscal exposure for the  federal government. As of September 2016, the Department of the  Treasury (Treasury) had provided about $187.5 billion in funds as  capital support to the enterprises, with an additional $258.1 billion  available to the enterprises should they need further assistance. In  accordance with the terms of agreements with Treasury, the  enterprises had paid dividends to Treasury totaling about $250.5  billion through September 2016.", "More than 8 years after entering conservatorship, the enterprises\u2019  futures remain uncertain and billions of federal dollars remain at risk.  The enterprises have a reduced capacity to absorb future losses due  to a capital reserve amount that falls to $0 by 2018. Without a capital  reserve, any quarterly losses\u2014including those due to market  fluctuations and not necessarily to economic conditions\u2014would  require the enterprises to draw additional funds from Treasury.  Additionally, prolonged conservatorships and a change in leadership  at FHFA could shift priorities for the conservatorships, which in turn  could send mixed messages and create uncertainties for market  participants and hinder the development of the broader secondary  mortgage market. For this reason, we said in November 2016 that  Congress should consider legislation establishing objectives for the  future federal role in housing finance, including the structure of the  enterprises, and a transition plan to a reformed housing finance  system that enables the enterprises to exit conservatorship.", "The federal government also supports mortgages through insurance  or guarantee programs, the largest of which is administered by the  Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s Federal Housing  Administration (FHA).

A complete count  of the nation\u2019s population is an enormous challenge as the Bureau seeks  to control the cost of the census while it implements several new  innovations and manages the processes of acquiring and developing new  and modified IT systems supporting them. Over the past 3 years, we have  made 30 recommendations to help the Bureau design and implement a  more cost-effective census for 2020; however, only 6 of them had been  fully implemented as of January 2017.", "The cost of the census, in terms of cost for counting each housing unit,  has been escalating over the last several decennials. The 2010 Census  was the costliest U.S. Census in history at about $12.3 billion, and was  about 31 percent more costly than the $9.4 billion cost of the 2000  Census (in 2020 dollars). The average cost for counting a housing unit  increased from about $16 in 1970 to around $92 in 2010 (in 2020  constant dollars).

Declining mail response rates\u2014a  key indicator of a cost-effective census\u2014are significant and lead to higher  costs. This is because the Bureau sends enumerators to each  nonresponding household to obtain census data. As a result,  nonresponse follow-up is the Bureau\u2019s largest and most costly field  operation. In many ways, the Bureau has had to invest substantially more  resources each decade to match the results of prior enumerations.", "The Bureau plans to implement several new innovations in its design of  the 2020 Census. In response to our recommendations regarding past  decennial efforts and other assessments, the Bureau has fundamentally  reexamined its approach for conducting the 2020 Census. Its plan for  2020 includes four broad innovation areas that it believes will save it over  $5 billion (2020 constant dollars) when compared to what it estimates  conducting the census with traditional methods would cost. The Bureau\u2019s  innovations include (1) using the Internet as a self-response option, which  the Bureau has never done on a large scale before; (2) verifying most  addresses using \u201cin-office\u201d procedures and on-screen imagery rather than  street-by-street field canvassing; (3) re-engineering data collection  methods such as by relying on an automated case management system;  and (4) in certain instances, replacing enumerator collection of data with  administrative records (information already provided to federal and state  governments as they administer other programs). These innovations  show promise for a more cost-effective head count.

To help control census costs, the Bureau plans to significantly  change the methods and technology it uses to count the population, such  as offering an option for households to respond to the survey via the  Internet or phone, providing mobile devices for field enumerators to  collect survey data from households, and automating the management of  field operations. This redesign relies on acquiring and developing many  new and modified IT systems, which could add complexity to the design.", "These cost risks, new innovations, and acquisition and development of IT  systems for the 2020 Census, along with other challenges we have  identified in recent years, raise serious concerns about the Bureau\u2019s  ability to conduct a cost-effective enumeration.

The Bureau stated that it plans to take actions to  address our recommendations.", "It is also critical for the Bureau to have better oversight and control over  its cost estimation process and we have recommended that the Bureau  ensure its cost estimate is consistent with our leading practices. For  example, the Bureau will need to, among other practices, document all  cost-influencing assumptions; describe estimating methodologies used for  each cost element; ensure that variances between planned and actual  cost are documented, explained, and reviewed; and include a  comprehensive sensitivity analysis, so that it can better estimate costs.  We also recommended that the Bureau implement and institutionalize  processes or methods for ensuring control over how risk and uncertainty  are accounted for and communicated within its cost estimation process.

We recommended that OMB provide Congress with results of  metrics on comprehensive timeliness and the quality of investigations and  adjudications. According to ODNI, in October 2016, ODNI began  implementation of a Quality Assessment and Reporting Tool to document  customer issues with background investigations.

Mission- critical skills gaps within the federal workforce pose a high risk to the  nation. Regardless of whether the shortfalls are in such government-wide  occupations as cybersecurity and acquisitions, or in agency-specific  occupations such as nurses at the Veterans Health Administration (VHA),  skills gaps impede the federal government from cost-effectively serving  the public and achieving results. Agencies can have skills gaps for  different reasons: they may have an insufficient number of people or their  people may not have the appropriate skills or abilities to accomplish  mission-critical work. Moreover, current budget and long-term fiscal  pressures, the changing nature of federal work, and a potential wave of  employee retirements that could produce gaps in leadership and  institutional knowledge, threaten to aggravate the problems created by  existing skills gaps. Indeed, the government\u2019s capacity to address  complex challenges such as disaster response, national and homeland  security, and rapidly-evolving technology and privacy security issues  requires a skilled federal workforce able to work seamlessly with other  agencies, with other levels of government, and across sectors.", "We first added strategic human capital management to the High-Risk List  in 2001.

Mission critical  skills gaps were also a factor in making other areas across government  high risk.

Additionally, the revised regulation provides that agency  human capital policies and programs must monitor and address skills  gaps within government-wide and agency-specific mission-critical  occupations by using comprehensive data analytic methods and gap  closure strategies.

Moreover, OPM officials reported that they were still working with  stakeholders to develop a framework to assist agencies in assessing  competencies. We reported, in 2015, that agencies vary in the extent to  which they assess competencies, and thus some agencies have limited  ability to respond to external workforce planning factors, despite the  importance of conducting these assessments.

In 2015, we recommended that OPM work with the CHCO  Council to develop a core set of metrics that agencies should use in  HRstat to track common skills gap challenges, while still allowing  agencies discretion to include metrics that meet their specific needs. In  response to our recommendation, OPM officials stated that they consider  HRstat an agency-centric initiative and that, while OPM has no plans to  prescribe a core set of skills gap metrics that all agencies must use for  HRstat, OPM may recommend metrics for each type of skills gap  challenge (e.g., training, recruitment, staffing, or competency  assessments) that an agency may encounter. OPM has, however, used  its November 2016 guidance to recommend specific metrics to be tracked  in HRstat that are tailored to improving hiring practices. We maintain  that this practice should be applied to skills gaps in general and that an  appropriate core set of metrics would be beneficial because it would (1)  help ensure agencies were monitoring skills gaps with a consistent set of  robust metrics, (2) provide OPM and Congress greater visibility over  government-wide progress in addressing skills gaps, and (3) help OPM  and agencies target government-wide actions toward those areas where  progress is lagging across agencies.", "OPM officials have also said that they have no plans to require agencies  to integrate the work of their FASTs with their HRstat reviews.

OPM previously had a Cross Agency Priority (CAP) goal to  close skills gaps by 50 percent in at least 3 of the government-wide  mission-critical occupations by the end of fiscal year 2013. The CAP Goal  on skills gaps provided important visibility across the government.  Following the expiration of this CAP Goal, the Fiscal Year 2015 Budget  included a 4-year CAP Goal on People and Culture that included  workforce planning elements related to skills gaps but had no  government-wide performance targets for closing skills gaps.

In particular, FEMA\u2019s 2014 competency assessment only covered part  of its IT workforce, and multiple regional offices told us that they faced  shortages in IT staff, such as computer and network engineers.  Without a better understanding of its current IT workforce, FEMA will  be unable to address its workforce planning needs and may not have  the skills needed to respond to major disasters.

Agencies have continued to face  challenges in hiring sufficient staff and in monitoring the competencies  of its workforce in acquisitions, an area we have highlighted in prior  high-risk reports. For instance, DHS\u2019s 2016 staffing assessments did  not take into account all acquisition-related positions, potentially  limiting DHS\u2019s insight into the size and nature of potential staffing  shortfalls. DHS announced plans in December 2016 to pilot new  staffing assessment guidance to be more inclusive of acquisition  positions, but the timing of full implementation is not yet known.  Additionally, in December 2015, we found that while DOD has  assessed workforce competencies for nearly all of its 13 career  acquisition fields, the agency has not established a timeline for  reassessing competencies in 10 of those fields to gauge progress  addressing previously identified gaps. Officials agreed with our  recommendation to work with functional leaders in setting timeframes  for completing future career field competency assessments and,  according to an October 2016 workforce strategic plan, intend to  conduct career field competency assessments at a minimum of every  5 years. Doing so will better allow the agency to track improvements  in the capability of a workforce that oversaw $273.5 billion in contracts  for goods and services in fiscal year 2015.

In September 2016, we found that Interior  continued to face challenges hiring and retaining staff for these  positions and has taken steps to address low salaries and lengthy  hiring times for certain occupations but has not evaluated the  effectiveness of such measures. Moreover, Interior has not  evaluated training needs or the effectiveness of existing training and  has not promoted collaboration across its bureaus to discuss and  address shared hiring and retention challenges. We recommended  that Interior take steps to evaluate its training programs and promote  cross-bureau hiring collaboration.

Without such a tool, VHA will have limited insights into the  abilities of its HR staff and be ill-positioned to provide necessary  support and training.

While FDA has set a goal for reducing this vacancy rate, the  performance measure selected to track progress on this goal includes  both foreign and domestic staff in FDA\u2019s Office of International  Programs. FDA could thus fulfill its overall vacancy goal without  lowering vacancies in foreign offices. The Department of Health and  Human Services (HHS) agreed with our December 2016  recommendation to establish staffing goals by position type at foreign  offices, and FDA indicated that recruiting and hiring have long been  challenges at these offices.

For example, we reported in October  2015 that the Small Business Administration (SBA) did not have an up-to- date agency-wide competency assessment. Officials said that when  SBA centralized its loan processing functions\u2014and thus removed these  functions from the agency\u2019s district offices\u2014as part of a 2004  reorganization, district offices had to take on new responsibilities, and  certain staff no longer had skills that matched their day-to-day work. For  example, employees with financial backgrounds\u2014needed to process  loans\u2014were now asked to perform marketing and business development  tasks. SBA also noted that the skills gap had been compounded by recent  changes in job requirements and new initiatives that required new skill  sets for its employees. SBA agreed with our recommendation to complete  a workforce plan that includes a competency and skills gap assessment,  and in October 2016 SBA indicated it had finalized such an assessment  and would be incorporating it into its strategic workforce planning  process.", "Going forward, agencies will need to continue to monitor these and other  existing and newly emerging skills gap challenges.

Since federal real property  management was placed on the High-Risk List in 2003, the federal  government has given high-level attention to this issue, such as issuing  the National Strategy for the Efficient Use of Real Property (National  Strategy) in 2015, which provides a foundation to further assist agencies  in strategically managing their real property inventories. However, federal  agencies continue to face long-standing challenges in several areas of  real property management, including: (1) disposing of excess and  underutilized property effectively, (2) relying too heavily on leasing, (3)  collecting reliable real property data to support decision making, and (4)  protecting federal facilities. Issues with the reliability of the Federal Real  Property Profile (FRPP) data\u2014particularly the utilization variable\u2014make it  difficult to quantify the overall number of vacant and underutilized federal  buildings.", "In September 2016, we reported on some vacant properties in the  Washington, D.C., area that illustrate the challenges associated with  disposing of or repurposing vacant property.

In 2016, we found that GSA\u2019s recent  attempt to exchange the property for construction services failed when  GSA was unable to obtain sufficient value from the exchange, making  the fate of this unneeded building unclear.", "GSA Warehouses: In 2014, we found that some GSA warehouses  listed in FRPP as used had been vacant for as long as 10 years. GSA  only lists warehouses as unused if they are in the process of being  disposed. Interpreting use this way in FRPP caused GSA to list as  used some warehouses that had been vacant for years. We made a  priority recommendation to GSA, to improve the way GSA manages  its warehouses.

As we  reported in 2014, GSA developed a plan to establish a consolidated  headquarters for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) on the  site in 2009. Since then, GSA has completed construction of a new  headquarters building for the Coast Guard on the campus, but most of  the project has been delayed.

These actions represent key examples of the federal government\u2019s  continued commitment to improve its management of real property. The  federal government has also continued to make progress toward  increasing its capacity, developing an action plan, and monitoring its  progress toward improving real property management and has made  improvements in the demonstrating progress criterion to move it from a  not met to a partially met rating. For example, in June 2016, OMB and  GSA continued efforts to implement our March 2016 recommendation to  improve FRPP data quality by conducting an in-depth survey of agencies  and soliciting information on several data elements that have been known  to be unreliable. GSA issued a memo in December 2016 to Chief  Financial Officer (CFO) Act agencies that revised the definitions to  improve the consistency and quality of several FRPP data elements. GSA  also launched the Asset Consolidation Tool, a software application that  allows federal agency users to generate geospatial information about  assets in close proximity to identify potential candidates for colocation  and consolidation.

Additionally, the Federal  Property Management Reform Act of 2016 codified the Federal Real  Property Council (FRPC) for the purpose of ensuring efficient and  effective real property management while reducing costs to the federal  government.

Beginning in  2008, we recommended that Congress consider a fundamental  reexamination of these programs to clarify federal goals and roles,  establish performance links, and improve investment decision making.  More recently, we found that it can be difficult to determine the extent to  which federal funding has improved system performance. Specifically, in  2016, we found that while the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA)  collects and maintains data on both federal funding for bridge projects  and bridge conditions, it lacks a means of demonstrating the link between  such funding and changes in bridge conditions.

For example, the System  Performance Measure rule includes measures for freight movement,  traffic congestion, and air quality and received over 8,800 public  comments. MAP-21 also required states to report on their progress in  implementing the transportation performance management requirements  to DOT by October 2016 and required DOT to report to Congress on  progress made by October 2017. Because several of the final rules were  recently issued, it is too early for states to report on progress, and thus  DOT provided guidance to states, requesting that they instead report on  their general performance management activities.

We have noted that this fragmentation, overlap,  and duplication introduce significant challenges for efficient and effective  oversight of financial institutions and activities.", "The framework we developed in 2009 for evaluating regulatory reform  proposals noted that an effective regulatory system would address certain  structural shortcomings created by fragmentation and overlap. To help  achieve this, we have suggested that Congress consider whether  additional changes to the financial regulatory structure are needed to  reduce or better manage fragmentation and overlap in the oversight of  financial institutions and activities to improve the efficiency and  effectiveness of oversight. For example, Congress could consider  consolidating the number of federal agencies involved in overseeing the  safety and soundness of depository institutions, combining the entities  involved in overseeing the securities and derivatives markets, transferring  the remaining prudential regulators\u2019 consumer protection authorities over  large depository institutions to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau  (CFPB), and determining the optimal federal role in insurance regulation.", "Congressional leadership also could improve the ability of the U.S.  regulatory system to address systemic risks. Although the Financial  Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) represents advancement in  addressing systemic risk threats to the U.S. financial system, its legal  authorities may not be broad enough to ensure that it can address all  threats effectively. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, FSOC can respond to  certain potential systemic risks primarily through its authority to designate  certain entities or activities that pose a threat to financial stability for  enhanced supervision by a specific federal regulator. We reported in  February 2016 that FSOC\u2019s designation authorities, by statute, cannot be  used to address certain types of risks, such as specific industry-wide  activities involving nonbank financial institutions, and the full scope of  FSOC\u2019s designation authority remains untested and unclear to date.", "FSOC has other nondesignation authorities that allow it to recommend  that individual regulators address specific risks, but these  recommendations are nonbinding. As a result, we suggested that  Congress consider whether legislative changes would be necessary to  align FSOC\u2019s authorities with its mission to respond to systemic risks.  Such actions could include changes to FSOC\u2019s mission, its authorities, or  both, or to the missions and authorities of one or more of the FSOC  member agencies to support a stronger link between its responsibility and  capacity to respond to systemic risks.", "Additional leadership, planning, capacity, and monitoring activities by U.S.  financial regulators also could improve systemic risk oversight. While the  newly created systemic risk and financial research bodies have been  established, we have continued to identify additional steps they need to  take to fully meet their envisioned missions. The Dodd-Frank Act  maintained the independence of the system\u2019s multiple regulators but  created FSOC to identify and respond to systemic risks. We noted in  February 2016 that this approach to systemic risk oversight requires  consistent and highly effective interagency collaboration and the use of  good quantitative and qualitative information. However, we reported then  that FSOC\u2019s Systemic Risk Committee is not fully and consistently  informed by the Office of Financial Research (OFR) and the Federal  Reserve\u2019s monitoring tools or other outputs, and we recommended this  be done.", "In addition, we found that both OFR and the Federal Reserve conduct  broad-based systemic risk monitoring activities that aim to identify threats  across the financial system and recommended that the two agencies  jointly articulate individual and common goals for their systemic risk  monitoring activities, including a plan to monitor progress toward  articulated goals, and formalize regular strategic and technical  discussions around their activities and outputs to support those goals.  Such efforts could help ensure that FSOC more accurately measures the  effect of significant Dodd-Frank Act regulations but also more efficiently  coordinates with its members to leverage retrospective reviews. agencies, to better ensure that the monitoring and analysis of the financial  system are comprehensive and not unnecessarily duplicative. In  addition, to improve the data that council members need to conduct their  responsibilities, FSOC should direct OFR to work with its members to  identify and collect the data necessary to assess the effect of the Dodd- Frank Act regulations on, among other things, the stability, efficiency, and  competitiveness of the U.S. financial markets.", "Financial regulators need to demonstrate further progress by taking  additional actions. Although FSOC\u2019s ability to identify firms whose  financial difficulties could pose threats to the overall financial system is an  important oversight tool, we reported in November 2014 that the  transparency of its process for designating systemically important  nonbank entities could be improved. Designating these entities in a way  that supports public and market confidence could help mitigate the  potential for such entities to endanger the stability of the U.S. financial  system. Thus, we recommended that FSOC take various steps to  improve the tracking of its process and disclose the rationales for its  designations in greater detail. Since then, FSOC has issued supplemental  procedures for nonbank financial company designations that stated its  commitment to continuing to provide the public with an understanding of  the council\u2019s analysis and a subsequent designation document included  additional information compared to prior ones. However, that document  did not fully explain how FSOC concluded that a company\u2019s  characteristics were sufficiently large or significant enough, or had other  attributes, to meet a determination standard.", "Corporation address these weaknesses. In addition, we recommended in  2016 numerous steps the Federal Reserve could take to improve the  stress tests that assess how large financial institutions would be affected  by changes in economic or other conditions.", "Additional progress is needed to address other risks. Although the  Federal Reserve has worked with the two clearing banks for the  repurchase (repo) market to reduce their problematic credit exposures,  the FSOC 2015 annual report notes that the risk of fire sales of collateral  by creditors of a defaulted broker-dealer remains an important financial  stability concern. For instance, many of the creditors may themselves be  vulnerable to runs in a stress event.

In October 2014, we issued a  framework consisting of nine elements that Congress and others can use  as they consider changes to the housing finance system. The  framework has the following elements:  clearly defined and prioritized goals for the housing finance system; policies and mechanisms that are aligned with goals and other adherence to an appropriate financial regulatory framework; government entities with the capacity to manage risks; protections for mortgage borrowers and actions to address barriers to protection for mortgage securities investors;  consideration of the cyclical nature of housing finance and the effect  of housing finance on financial stability;  recognition and control of fiscal exposure and mitigation of moral  hazard; and emphasis on implications of the transition.", "Each element in the framework is critically important in establishing the  most effective and efficient housing finance system. Applying the  elements of this framework would help policymakers identify the relative  strengths and weaknesses of any proposals they consider. Similarly, the  framework can be used to craft proposals or to identify changes to  existing proposals to make them more effective and appropriate for  addressing any limitations of the current system. However, any viable  proposal for change must recognize that sometimes tradeoffs will exist  among and within the nine elements.

However, frequent turnover of leadership in these offices  has hampered efforts to improve Indian education over the years. For  example, in September 2013, we reported that from 2000 through 2013  there were repeated changes in the tenure of acting and permanent  assistant secretaries of Indian Affairs as well as acting and permanent  directors of BIE.

Further, 4 out of 10 regions did not conduct any  inspections during this period. We also found that Indian Affairs did not  systematically evaluate the thoroughness of the school safety inspections  it conducted or monitor the extent to which inspection procedures varied  within and across regions. Without Indian Affairs monitoring whether  safety inspectors in each of its regions are consistently following  appropriate procedures and guidance, inspections in different regions  may continue to vary in completeness and miss important safety and  health deficiencies at schools that could pose dangers to students and  staff. In September 2016, Indian Affairs provided documentation that it  had conducted fiscal year 2016 annual safety inspections at all BIE  schools, but it did not include evidence that it had taken steps to ensure  that its inspection information was complete and accurate.

However, if the resources are held in trust or  restricted status, BIA\u2014through its 12 regional offices, 85 agency offices,  and other supporting offices\u2014generally must review and approve leases,  permits, and other documents required to develop the resources. In  2014, in response to tribal requests for increased coordination and  efficient management of their resources from the numerous federal  regulatory agencies involved with Indian energy development, Interior  took initial steps to form a new office, the Indian Energy Service Center  (Service Center)\u2014with BIA as the lead agency. According to Interior\u2019s  fiscal year 2016 budget justification, the Service Center is intended to,  among other things, help expedite the leasing and permitting processes  associated with Indian energy development. we reviewed identified that BIA\u2019s review and approval process can be  lengthy and increase development costs and project development times,  resulting in missed development opportunities, lost revenue, and  jeopardized viability of projects. For example, according to a tribal official,  BIA took as long as 8 years to review some of its energy-related  documents. In the meantime, the tribe estimates it lost $95 million in  revenues it could have earned from tribal permitting fees, oil and gas  severance taxes, and royalties. In another example, one lease for a  proposed utility-scale wind project took BIA more than 3 years to review  and approve. According to a tribal official, the long review time has  contributed to uncertainty about the continued viability of the project  because data used to support the economic feasibility and environmental  impact of the project became too old to accurately reflect current  conditions. We recommended that Interior direct BIA to develop a  documented process to track its review and response times. In response,  Interior stated it would try to implement a tracking and monitoring  mechanism by the end of fiscal year 2017 for oil and gas leases.

We also found  that in forming the Service Center, BIA did not involve key stakeholders,  such as the Department of Energy\u2014an agency with significant energy  expertise\u2014and BIA employees from agency offices. By not involving key  stakeholders, BIA has missed an opportunity to incorporate their  expertise into its efforts. We recommended that BIA include other  regulatory agencies in the Service Center so that it can act as a single  point of contact or a lead agency to coordinate and navigate the  regulatory process. We also recommended BIA establish formal  agreements with key stakeholders, such as DOE, that identify the  advisory or support role of the office, and establish a process for seeking  and obtaining input from key stakeholders, such as BIA employees, on  the Service Center activities. Interior agreed with our recommendations  and described plans to address them.", "In 2005, Congress provided an option for tribes to enter into an  agreement with the Secretary of the Interior that allows the tribe, at its  discretion, to enter into leases, business agreements, and rights-of-way  agreements for energy resource development on tribal lands without  review and approval by the Secretary. However, in a June 2015 report,  we found that uncertainties about Interior\u2019s regulations for implementing  this option have contributed to deter a tribe from pursuing an agreement.  We recommended that Interior provide clarifying guidance. In August  2015, Interior stated the agency is considering further guidance. As of  December 2016, Interior had not provided additional guidance.", "Limited federal workforce planning. In November 2016, we found BIA  had high vacancy rates at some agency offices and that the agency had  not conducted key workforce planning activities, such as identifying the  key workforce skills needed to achieve agency goals, and assessing any  skill gaps. These workforce issues contribute to BIA\u2019s management  shortcomings that have hindered Indian energy development. Until BIA  undertakes necessary workforce planning activities, it cannot ensure that  it has a workforce with the right skills, appropriately aligned to meet the  agency\u2019s goals and tribal priorities. We recommended that BIA assess  critical skills and competencies needed to fulfill its responsibilities related  to energy development and identify potential gaps. We also  recommended BIA establish a documented process for assessing BIA\u2019s  workforce composition at agency offices taking into account BIA\u2019s  mission, goals, and tribal priorities.

In  June 2015, we found that BIA does not have the necessary geographic  information system (GIS) mapping data for identifying who owns and uses  resources, such as existing leases. Interior guidance states that efficient  management of oil and gas resources relies, in part, on GIS mapping  technology because it allows managers to easily identify resources  available for lease and where leases are in effect. According to a BIA  official, without GIS data, the process of identifying transactions, such as  leases and access agreements for Indian land and resources, can take  significant time and staff resources to search paper records stored in  multiple locations. We recommended BIA should take steps to improve its  GIS capabilities to ensure it can verify ownership in a timely manner.  Interior stated it will enhance mapping capabilities by developing a  national dataset composed of all Indian land tracts and boundaries in the  next 4 years.", "Incomplete and inaccurate data. In June 2015, we found that BIA did  not have the data it needs to verify who owns some Indian oil and gas  resources or identify where leases are in effect. In some cases, BIA  cannot verify ownership because federal cadastral surveys\u2014the means  by which land is defined, divided, traced, and recorded\u2014cannot be found  or are outdated. The ability to account for Indian resources would assist  BIA in fulfilling its federal trust responsibility, and determining ownership  is a necessary step for BIA to approve leases and other energy-related  documents.

A complete count  of the nation\u2019s population is an enormous challenge as the Bureau seeks  to control the cost of the census while it implements several new  innovations and manages the processes of acquiring and developing new  and modified information technology (IT) systems supporting them. Over  the past 3 years, we have made 30 recommendations to help the Bureau  design and implement a more cost-effective census for 2020; however,  only 6 of them had been fully implemented as of January 2017.", "The cost of the census, in terms of cost for counting each housing unit,  has been escalating over the last several decennials. The 2010 Census  was the costliest U.S. Census in history at about $12.3 billion, and was  about 31 percent more costly than the $9.4 billion 2000 Census (in 2020  dollars). The average cost for counting a housing unit increased from  about $16 in 1970 to around $92 in 2010 (in 2020 constant dollars).  Meanwhile, the return of census questionnaires by mail (the primary  mode of data collection) declined over this period from 78 percent in 1970  to 63 percent in 2010. Declining mail response rates\u2014a key indicator of a  cost-effective census\u2014are significant and lead to higher costs. This is  because the Bureau sends enumerators to each non-responding  household to obtain census data. As a result, non-response follow-up  (NRFU) is the Bureau\u2019s largest and most costly field operation. In many  ways, the Bureau has had to invest substantially more resources each  decade to match the results of prior enumerations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "What Remains to Be Done", "paragraphs": ["The Bureau plans to implement several new innovations in its design of  the 2020 Census. In response to our recommendations regarding past  decennial efforts and other assessments, the Bureau has fundamentally  reexamined its approach for conducting the 2020 Census. Its plan for  2020 includes four broad innovation areas that it believes will save it over  $5 billion (2020 constant dollars) when compared to what it estimates  conducting the census with traditional methods would cost. The Bureau\u2019s  innovations include (1) using the Internet as a self-response option, which  the Bureau has never done on a large scale before; (2) verifying most  addresses using \u201cin-office\u201d procedures and on-screen imagery rather than  street-by-street field canvassing; (3) re-engineering data collection  methods such as by relying on an automated case management system;  and (4) in certain instances, replacing enumerator collection of data with  administrative records (information already provided to federal and state  governments as they administer other programs). These innovations  show promise for a more cost-effective head count. However, they also  introduce new risks, in part, because they include new procedures and  technology that have not been used extensively in earlier decennials, if at  all.", "The Bureau is also managing the acquisition and development of new  and modified IT systems, which add complexity to the design of the  census. To help control census costs, the Bureau plans to significantly  change the methods and technology it uses to count the population, such  as offering an option for households to respond to the survey via the  Internet or phone, providing mobile devices for field enumerators to  collect survey data from households, and automating the management of  field operations. This redesign relies on acquiring and developing many  new and modified IT systems, which could add complexity to the design.", "These cost risks, new innovations, and the acquisition and development  of IT systems for the 2020 Census, along with other challenges we have  identified in recent years, raise serious concerns about the Bureau\u2019s  ability to conduct a cost-effective enumeration. Based on these concerns,  we have concluded that the 2020 Census is a high-risk area and have  added it to the High-Risk List in 2017.", "To help the Bureau mitigate the risks associated with its fundamentally  new and complex innovations for the 2020 Census, the commitment of  top leadership is needed to ensure the Bureau\u2019s management, culture,  and business practices align with a cost-effective enumeration. For  example, the Bureau needs to continue strategic workforce planning  efforts to ensure it has the skills and competencies needed to support  planning and executing the census. It must also rigorously test individual  census-taking activities to provide information on their feasibility and  performance, their potential for achieving desired results, and the extent  to which they are able to function together under full operational  conditions. We have recommended that the Bureau also ensure that its  scheduling adheres to leading practices and be able to support a  quantitative schedule risk assessment, such as by having all activities  associated with the levels of resources and effort needed to complete  them. The Bureau has stated that it has begun maturing project  schedules to ensure that the logical relationships are in place and plans  to conduct a quantitative risk assessment. We will continue to monitor the  Bureau\u2019s efforts.", "The Bureau must also improve its ability to manage, develop, and secure  its IT systems. For example, the Bureau needs to prioritize its IT  decisions and determine what information it needs in order to make those  decisions. In addition, the Bureau needs to make key IT decisions for the  2020 Census in order to ensure they have enough time to have the  production systems in place to support the end-to-end system test. To  this end, we recommended the Bureau ensure that the methodologies for  answering the Internet response rate and IT infrastructure research  questions are determined and documented in time to inform key design  decisions. Further, given the numerous and critical dependencies  between the Census Enterprise Data Collection and Processing  (CEDCaP) program\u2014a large and complex modernization program within  the IT Directorate\u2014and 2020 Census programs, their parallel  implementation tracks, and the 2020 Census\u2019s immovable deadline, we  recommended that the Bureau establish a comprehensive and integrated  list of all interdependent risks facing the two programs, and clearly identify  roles and responsibilities for managing this list. The Bureau stated that it  plans to take actions to address our recommendations.", "It is also critical for the Bureau to have better oversight and control over  its cost estimation process and we have recommended that the Bureau  ensure its cost estimate is consistent with our leading practices. For  example, the Bureau will need to, among other practices, document all  cost-influencing assumptions; describe estimating methodologies used for  each cost element; ensure that variances between planned and actual  cost are documented, explained, and reviewed; and include a  comprehensive sensitivity analysis, so that it can better estimate costs.  We also recommended that the Bureau implement and institutionalize  processes or methods for ensuring control over how risk and uncertainty  are accounted for and communicated within its cost estimation process.  The Bureau agreed with our recommendations, and we are currently  conducting a follow-up audit of the Bureau\u2019s most recent cost estimate  and will determine whether the Bureau has implemented them.", "Sustained congressional oversight will be essential as well. In 2015 and  2016, congressional committees held five hearings focusing on the  progress of the Bureau\u2019s preparations for the decennial. Going forward,  active oversight will be needed to ensure these efforts stay on track, the  Bureau has needed resources, and Bureau officials are held accountable  for implementing the enumeration as planned.", "We will continue monitoring the Bureau\u2019s efforts to conduct a cost- effective enumeration.

Its planned  innovations include (1) making greater use of local data, imagery, and  other office procedures to build its address list; (2) improving self- response by encouraging respondents to use the Internet and telephone;  (3) using administrative records to reduce field work; and (4)  reengineering field operations using technology to reduce manual effort  and improve productivity. While the census is under way, the tolerance for  any breakdowns is quite small. As a result, given the new four innovation  areas for the 2020 Census, it will be imperative that the Bureau have  systems and operations in place for the 2018 End-to-End Test.", "Using administrative records is promising but introduces  challenges: Although administrative records\u2014information already  provided to the government as it administers other programs\u2014have been  discussed and used for the decennial census since the 1970s, the Bureau  plans a more significant role for them to reduce the amount of data  collection fieldwork, which has the potential to help significantly limit the  cost increases of the 2020 Census. The Bureau has estimated that using  these records could save up to $1.4 billion compared to traditional census  methods. In 2015, we found that while the Bureau has already  demonstrated the feasibility of using administrative records, it still faces  challenges with using them for the 2020 Census. For example, although  the Bureau has no control over the accuracy of data provided to it by  other agencies, it is responsible for ensuring that data it uses for 2020  Census are of sufficient quality for their planned uses.", "Another challenge we identified is the extent to which the public will  accept government agencies sharing personal data for the purposes of  the census. Related concerns involve trust in the government and  perceptions about burden on respondents as well the social benefits of  agencies sharing data. Moreover, in addition to using administrative  records to reduce fieldwork, the Bureau is considering several additional  opportunities to leverage administrative records to help improve the cost  and quality of the 2020 Census. It will be important for the Bureau to set  deadlines for deciding which records it will use and for which purpose to  help the Bureau monitor its progress and prioritize which activities\u2014or  records\u2014to continue pursuing, or to abandon, if time becomes a  constraint.", "The Bureau needs to identify and analyze root causes of non- interviews during testing: When households do not respond to the  census and when the Bureau does not obtain information about the  household while knocking on doors during its NRFU operation, the  Bureau may have to impute attributes of the household based on the  demographic characteristics of surrounding housing units as well as on  administrative records. We reported in 2016 that during the Bureau\u2019s  2016 Census Site Test, the Bureau experienced about 20 and 30 percent  of its test workload as non-interviews at its two test sites in Harris County,  Texas, and Los Angeles County, California, respectively. According to  the Bureau, non-interviews are cases where no data or insufficient data  are collected, either because enumerators make six attempted visits  without success (the maximum number the Bureau allows), or are not  completed due to, for example, language barriers or dangerous  situations. Identifying root causes of problems is something we look for  when determining progress within a high-risk area. Accordingly, while the  2016 Census Test non-interview rate is not necessarily a precursor to the  2020 non-interview rate, because of its relationship to the cost and quality  of the census, it will be important for the Bureau to better understand the  factors contributing to it.", "Bureau cancelled field tests for 2017: The Bureau plans to conduct  additional research through 2018 in order to further refine the design of  the 2020 Census, but recently had to alter its approach. On October 18,  2016, the Bureau decided to stop two field test operations planned for  fiscal year 2017 in order to mitigate risks from funding uncertainty.  Specifically, the Bureau said it would stop all planned field activity,  including local outreach and hiring, at its test sites in Puerto Rico, North  and South Dakota, and Washington State. The Bureau will not carry out  planned field tests of its mail-out strategy and follow up for non-response  in Puerto Rico or its door-to-door enumeration. The Bureau also  cancelled plans to update its address list in the Indian lands and  surrounding areas in the three states.", "However, the Bureau will continue with other planned testing in fiscal year  2017, such as those focusing on systems readiness and Internet  response. Further, the Bureau said it would consider incorporating the  cancelled field activities elements within the 2018 End-to-End Test. The  Bureau maintains that stopping the 2017 Field Test will help prioritize  readiness for the 2018 End-to-End Test, and mitigate risk. Nevertheless,  as we reported in November 2016, it also represents a lost opportunity to  test, refine, and integrate operations and systems, and it puts more  pressure on the 2018 Test to demonstrate that enumeration activities will  function as needed for 2020."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Critical IT Uncertainties", "paragraphs": ["The Bureau needs to strengthen the management and oversight of  all IT programs, systems, and contractors supporting the decennial:  The redesign of the 2020 Census relies on many new and modified IT  systems.

First, as  our and other organizations\u2019 reports issued over the last 2 decades have  found, DOE\u2019s environmental cleanup decisions are not risk-based and its  risk-based decision making is sometimes impeded by selection of  cleanup remedies that are not appropriately tailored to the risks  presented, and inconsistencies in the regulatory approaches followed at  different sites. We and others have pointed out that DOE needs to take a  nation-wide, risk-based approach to cleaning up these sites, which could  reduce costs while also reducing environmental risks more quickly.  Examples include the following:  In 1995, we found that DOE\u2019s cleanup strategy had been shaped by  site-specific environmental agreements whose priorities and  requirements had not always been consistent with technical or fiscal  realities and that, under severe budgetary constraints, using many  separately-negotiated agreements is not well suited to setting  priorities among sites. We recommended that DOE set national  priorities for cleaning up its contaminated sites. DOE responded at  that time that because of limitations on the science of risk  assessment, it had no intention of developing national, risk-based  priorities for its cleanup work. In a later report, we found that DOE\u2019s  compliance agreements did not provide a means of prioritizing among  sites and, therefore, DOE had not developed a comprehensive,  relative ranking of the risks that it faces across its sites. DOE has  been unsuccessful in its attempts to develop such a methodology in  the past and, as a result, DOE has no systematic way to make  cleanup decisions among sites based on risk. the waste\u2019s origins rather than on its actual radiological risks. The  Academy concluded that by working with regulators, public  authorities, and local citizens to implement risk-informed practices,  waste cleanup efforts can be done more cost-effectively. The report  also suggested that statutory changes were likely needed. In 2011,  the Academy also reported that DOE could realize significant benefits  by providing more realistic safety- and risk-informed analyses.", "In 2015, a review organized by the Consortium for Risk Evaluation  with Stakeholder Participation reported that DOE is not optimally  using available resources to reduce risk. According to the report,  factors such as inconsistent regulatory approaches and certain  requirements in federal facility agreements cause disproportionate  resources to be directed at lower priority risks. The report called for a  more systematic effort to assess and rank risks within and among  sites, including through headquarters guidance to sites, and to  allocate federal taxpayer monies to remedy the highest priority risks  through the most efficient means.", "Second, DOE\u2019s cleanup approach is based primarily on a series of  compliance agreements and consent orders between DOE, the  Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and state regulators. According  to one DOE official, 40 such agreements establish the requirements for  DOE\u2019s cleanup work. We have reported in the past that these agreements  include thousands of associated milestones.

The Air Force also is  in the process of implementing a similar method for setting levels for  reparable items with low demand and is refining an approach for  reparable items with variable demand and conducting additional  analysis before deciding to implement it.", "Fourth, DOD has made progress improving its collaborative  forecasting (i.e., using customer input to forecast demand versus  relying solely on statistical forecasting methods) for spare parts.  Specifically, we found in June 2016 that DLA partnered with the  services to improve collaborative forecasting efforts through an  analytical, results-oriented approach, such as regularly monitoring key  performance metrics. The approach is tailored for each service, and  DOD identified in its follow-on improvement plan that it will analyze  these different approaches and assess areas for improvement in an  effort to further reduce excess inventory and shortages. DLA also  designed an additional metric for its collaborative forecasting program  to more accurately assess and manage the program and plans to fully  implement the metric by July 2017. DOD also is in the process of  designing and adopting metrics to assess the accuracy of inventory  planning factors, such as the accuracy of part lists that are used to  determine the type and quantity of parts to buy for depot maintenance  activities, and plans to implement these metrics by the end of fiscal  year 2018.", "Enhancing the management and oversight of retention stock:  DOD has continued to take actions to improve the management of  retention stock across the department. For example, since fiscal year  2009, DOD has monitored the amount of its retention stock relative to  on-hand inventory, reviewed and updated its policy and guidance for  retention stock, and taken steps to ensure retention stock is managed  consistently across the department. Further, in response to our June  2014 recommendation for the DLA Director to dispose of retention  stock based on the results of an economic analysis, the Director  changed DLA\u2019s on-hand inventory reduction goal, which was leading  DLA to dispose of items that the department\u2019s guidance and DLA\u2019s  analysis showed were more economical to keep. With respect to  \u201ccontingency retention stock\u201d (i.e., items retained to support specific  contingencies, such as disaster relief or civil emergencies), the  department independently assessed its management in March 2011  and implemented resulting recommendations, such as establishing  categories and tracking the reasons for retaining contingency  retention stock.", "Lastly, DOD has used our findings and implemented our  recommendations to improve how it manages inventory. Since May 2006,  we have made 63 recommendations aimed at improving the efficiency  and effectiveness of the department\u2019s inventory management. As of  January 2017, DOD has implemented 42 of those recommendations and  was in the process of taking actions to implement an additional 13  recommendations, which are focused generally on re-assessing inventory  goals, improving collaborative forecasting, and making changes to  information technology systems used to manage inventory. The  remaining eight recommendations were made in fiscal years 2007 and  2009 and focused on improving the management of acquisition lead times  for spare parts and oversight of Army and Navy inventory management,  respectively.

Although DOD lacks a comprehensive action plan for fully  addressing this high-risk area and its root causes, the Better Buying  Power initiatives are a step in the right direction, as DOD has prescribed  a number of concrete changes. DOD has partially met the criteria for  monitoring by issuing a series of annual performance reports on the  portfolio of major defense acquisition programs. In 2016, DOD issued the  fourth report in this series. Continuing and expanding this series of  reports should help DOD measure its progress over time.", "DOD has partially met the criteria for capacity by, for example, updating  some policies to enable better outcomes and assessing the acquisition  workforce. However, we remain concerned about whether DOD will fully  implement its proposed reforms or continue to track progress in meeting  workforce goals, as DOD has, in the past, failed to convert policy into  practice. DOD has partially met the criteria for demonstrating progress as  it relates to the cost and schedules of its weapon programs. Although we  reported in March 2016 on the progress many DOD programs are making  in reducing their cost, as demonstrated by improvements when measured  against cost-growth targets, individual weapon programs are still not  conforming to best practices for acquisition, or implementing key  acquisition reforms and initiatives that could prevent long-term cost and  schedule growth.", "Our work reveals that, while there is still cost and schedule growth in  major defense acquisition programs, DOD is making progress in  decreasing the amount of cost growth realized in the portfolio as a whole.  In March 2016, we reported that the total acquisition cost of DOD\u2019s fiscal  year 2015 portfolio of 79 programs decreased by $2.5 billion from the  previous year. The decrease, however, was due primarily to reductions  in a few programs. The majority of individual programs, 42 of the 79,  increased in cost.", "In terms of schedule, the time it took to deliver initial capabilities to the  warfighter increased, on average, an additional 2.4 months. Our analysis  also showed evidence that DOD made progress in improving efficiencies  in its programs from 2014 to 2015. When we account for increased costs  attributable to increased program quantity, 38 programs improved their  buying power\u2014that is, the amount of goods procured for dollars spent.", "DOD\u2019s major acquisition programs also showed some improvement when  measured against the three cost-growth targets we have used to measure  DOD\u2019s progress in the weapon system acquisition high-risk area since  2011. Most notably, 72 percent of programs meet the threshold for less  than 10 percent growth over the past 5 years, and 76 percent meet the  threshold for less than 2 percent growth in the past year, both an  improvement over past assessments (see figure 18).", "In addition, Congress has been working to reform the process for  acquiring weapon systems for several years. In the National Defense  Authorization Acts (NDAA) for just the past 5 years, for example,  Congress has enacted the following reforms, among others:  In the 2013 NDAA, Congress introduced measures to control costs on  acquisition programs by requiring DOD to limit the use of cost-type  contracts for production, and to open programs to competition at the  subcontract level.", "In the 2014 NDAA, Congress expanded requirements for cost  reporting by requiring DOD to include additional cost and schedule  estimates in its annual reports to Congress.", "In the 2016 NDAA, Congress made numerous reforms to the  acquisition process including requiring more close involvement of the  service chiefs; requiring DOD to report on efforts to streamline the  requirements, acquisition, and budgeting processes; stipulating the  use and contents of an acquisition strategy; and reducing the number  of certifications required for programs at milestone reviews.", "In the 2017 NDAA, Congress enacted reforms to require modular  open system approaches in major programs, further ensure the  achievement and reporting of program goals, modify requirements for  independent cost estimates, and reorganize the acquisition authority  within the Office of the Secretary of Defense."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "What Remains to Be Done", "paragraphs": ["At this point, DOD needs to build on existing reforms\u2014not necessarily  revisiting the process itself but augmenting it by tackling incentives.

DOD stated  that it would analyze affordability as part of an internal deliberative  process culminating in the services\u2019 annual budget request.", "We made one priority recommendation for the Littoral Combat Ship  program in July 2014. This recommendation stated that the program  should successfully complete key tests\u2014such as shock, anti-air  warfare self-defense testing, or final survivability assessments\u2014 before contracting for additional ships. The Navy\u2019s recent decision to  restructure the program alters the timing of our recommendation, but  does not change our intent to ensure that the Navy does not continue  to commit to additional ships until it demonstrates that it has attained  some level of knowledge in key areas, such as ship survivability.", "In September 2013, we made three priority recommendations for the  lead ship in the Ford-class aircraft carrier fleet, designated as CVN  78. DOD should explore capability trade-offs, update the Ford-class  program\u2019s test and evaluation master plan to allot sufficient time for  testing, and adjust the post-delivery test schedule to ensure that  system integration testing is completed prior to operational testing.  DOD has made progress in implementing these recommendations by,  for example, completing a cost-benefit analysis to determine the  acquisition strategy for the follow-on ship. DOD, however, failed to  fully explore capability trade-offs, and it remains to be seen whether  additional time has been allotted to complete testing, as an updated  test and evaluation master plan has not been approved.", "We made two priority recommendations in April 2013 for the Missile  Defense Agency and its programs. We recommended that the agency  both stabilize its acquisition baselines to enable meaningful  comparisons over time and make its cost estimates more  comprehensive by including military services\u2019 operation and support  costs. While DOD generally concurred with our recommendations, the  Missile Defense Agency\u2019s baselines continue to change, and agency  decision makers still have not been informed of full program costs.", "Finally, Congress has an important role to play in advancing weapon  system acquisition reform overall, particularly in what it sanctions via  funding approvals. Programs that propose optimistic or rushed acquisition  strategies represent opportunities for Congress to either maintain or  change the defense acquisition culture\u2014a prevailing set of incentives that  encourages decisions to go forward with programs before they are ready,  and a willingness to accept cost growth and schedule delays as the likely  byproduct of such decisions.

While programs that have recently  passed through major decision points have demonstrated best  practices\u2014such as planning to constrain development times and  achieving design stability\u2014key practices like demonstrating technology  maturity or controlling manufacturing processes are still not being fully  implemented. Of the 17 programs we assessed that had recently passed  through one of three key decision points in the acquisition process, only 3  had implemented all of the applicable knowledge-based practices  applicable for that decision point. The remaining programs will carry  technology, design, and production risks, which increase cost and  schedule risks, into subsequent phases of the acquisition process. In  March 2016, we also reported that implementation of the Better Buying  Power and acquisition reform initiatives varied across programs. While  91 percent of programs successfully implemented \u201cshould-cost\u201d initiatives  and reported significant cost savings, only 67 percent had established  affordability constraints.", "In addition, DOD has not completely implemented the direction to improve  competition.

Specifically, in October 2016, DOD issued its  updated acquisition workforce strategic plan which, among other things,  assessed the current capability of the workforce and identified risks that  DOD needed to manage to meet future needs. DOD acknowledged,  however, that it will need to develop and implement metrics to track  progress towards meeting the four strategic goals identified in its October  2016 strategic workforce plan.

Program officials attributed the cost increase, in part,  to program scope growth and the addition of software upgrade  enhancements. We also reported that this system experienced a 1-year  slippage in its full deployment decision date. Program officials attributed  this slippage to findings identified in the system\u2019s initial operational test  and evaluation report.

Since 2013,  DOD has been successful in reducing excess infrastructure through its  past BRAC rounds and has demonstrated leadership in requesting  additional BRAC rounds. In addition, since 2013, in coordination with the  military services, DOD has developed and implemented more effective  and efficient methods to reduce excess infrastructure, such as through  more proactively managing DOD\u2019s processes to meet historic  preservation and environmental requirements. Additionally, DOD has  worked with host nations to avoid prolonged negotiations over returning  excess infrastructure in foreign countries.", "However, DOD needs to demonstrate additional leadership commitment  to ensuring the success of any future BRAC rounds by agreeing to  implement key actions we have recommended from reviews of the most  recent BRAC round. In March and April 2013, we reported that while the  BRAC process was fundamentally sound, the way DOD implemented the  2005 BRAC round at times limited its ability to estimate costs, potential  liabilities, and savings to achieve desired outcomes. Specifically, we  identified a number of issues with DOD\u2019s process for estimating BRAC  costs and savings, which was hindered in many cases by underestimating  recommendation-specific requirements that were entered in the COBRA  estimation model. For example, the primary reason costs increased for  BRAC 2005 was higher-than-anticipated military construction costs\u2014an  increase of 86 percent from $13.2 billion originally estimated by the BRAC  Commission to $24.5 billion after BRAC implementation ended in 2011.  DOD significantly understated initial requirements inputted into COBRA  for information technology costs (e.g., realigning supply, storage, and  distribution management initially estimated to be $31 million increased to  over $190 million).", "Also, DOD understated the costs of relocating military personnel positions  and equipment, and did not consistently capture all costs associated with  alternatively financed projects. We recommended various actions to  improve the quality of information that forms the basis for the costs  estimates. In written comments to our March 2013 report, DOD officials  did not fully concur with these actions, stating that the COBRA model was  not meant for the purposes we recommended. However, more recently,  they agreed to take additional action to better forecast the initial costs  inputted into COBRA related to military construction, information  technology, and relocating military personnel positions and equipment,  and have already taken some steps to do so, in support of any future  BRAC round. Officials did not agree that liabilities from alternatively  financed projects need to be consistently captured in the COBRA model,  stating that it is difficult to estimate these costs. However, as we stated in  the April 2013 report, in cases where the amount of the liability cannot be  estimated, modifying the model with a capability to note the existence of a  potential liability would provide decision makers with valuable information  to inform their deliberations. DOD officials also cautioned that costs can  increase during implementation of BRAC recommendations which cannot  be easily foreseen, and increases in costs are reported to Congress. We  agree that costs can and have increased during the implementation of  BRAC recommendations. However, the intent of our recommendations  are to improve the information provided to decision makers while they are  comparing competing scenarios and making closure and realignment  decisions, understanding that ultimate costs may differ from these initial  estimates.", "Further, DOD bundled multiple BRAC recommendations into single,  highly complex recommendations without itemizing costs and savings  associated with each separate major action, which limited visibility into  the estimated costs and savings for individual closures and realignments  and complicated the ability of the Defense Base Closure and Realignment  Commission (BRAC Commission) to review the recommendations. We  recommended actions to improve the quality of information that forms the  basis for the cost estimates by limiting the bundling of recommendations,  or if bundling is appropriate, to itemize the costs and savings associated  with each major discrete action. In the March 2013 report, DOD did not  fully concur with these recommendations, stating that actions are bundled  when they relate to a common outcome, and thus need to be viewed  comprehensively rather than individually. More recently, officials agreed  that when bundling is appropriate during any future BRAC round, they  would provide additional details related to costs and savings as needed.  We are encouraged by DOD\u2019s agreement that improvements can be  made in the quality of the information that supports BRAC cost estimates,  and we continue to believe addressing these issues when planning for  any future BRAC rounds will help the department improve initial cost  estimates and provide a means for better evaluating the proposed closure  and realignment recommendations. Improving its planning processes,  including the cost estimates, would also help DOD implement the BRAC  process more effectively towards reducing excess capacity and provide  more confidence to Congress and the public on DOD\u2019s efforts in  implementing BRAC actions.", "With respect to achieving efficiencies in base support, DOD reported  relying on a multitude of efforts and initiatives at the OSD, military service,  and installation levels. We have reported on DOD\u2019s progress in  implementing its joint basing program, one key initiative aimed at  achieving efficiencies in base support. We reported that OSD  demonstrated some leadership commitment to addressing issues  affecting joint bases by issuing a memo to the Secretaries of the military  departments asserting its support for joint basing and clarifying the  program goals, but OSD and the military departments have not yet  provided detailed guidance on how to meet the goals and related  timeframes. DOD\u2019s memo outlined key areas for continual success of the  program, including continuing to consolidate installation support functions  at the bases. While the 2014 memo did not provide detailed guidance on  achieving cost savings and efficiencies or provide for milestones, as we  have recommended, it affirmed the purpose and goals of the joint bases  and demonstrated a commitment to the program.", "Continued leadership by DOD, to include implementing our prior  recommendations in any future BRAC rounds and focusing its efforts to  reduce duplication of support services for its bases, among DOD\u2019s other  efficiency measures, will be important to sustain efforts to more effectively  and efficiently align its infrastructure with its needs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Capacity", "paragraphs": ["DOD partially met the criterion for capacity.

DOD needs to  further implement its Real Property Efficiency Plan, which is aimed at  disposing of longstanding excess infrastructure.", "DOD has improved the way it collects utilization data for its facilities since  our 2015 high-risk update, and has issued a guide for calculating  utilization to help improve completeness and accuracy of the utilization  data. In following up on our September 2014 report recommendations on  DOD\u2019s use of its facilities, we found that DOD has utilization data on  about 97 percent of its facilities as of September 2015, the most recent  data available\u2014increasing from 53 percent as of September 2013.  However, the utilization rates entered into DOD\u2019s database are likely not  reliable, since a majority of the facilities (85 percent) have the highest  possible rate of 100, which indicates full utilization at the same time that  DOD believes it has over 20 percent excess facility capacity. In addition,  of the facilities that have a rating of 100, 24 percent had either no  inspection date or been mostly recently inspected prior to September 30,  1999, which calls into question the accuracy of this data. In December  2016, DOD issued a policy memorandum that provided guidance for  calculating utilization to ensure utilization is measured and reported  consistently throughout DOD, and to maintain current information on  facility utilization. As the guidance is implemented, DOD officials expect  improvement in the accuracy of utilization data as facilities are assessed  and to increase the completeness of utilization data. Implementing the  guidance will help focus DOD\u2019s efforts on reducing excess facility  capacity, and should improve information on the utilization of facilities to  position DOD to better identify excess facility capacity in support of its  efforts to reduce excess infrastructure.", "In addition, we reported in September 2011 that long-standing excess  facilities\u2014those identified prior to DOD\u2019s demolition program in fiscal  2008\u2014accounted for more than half of the excess inventory DOD  identified and may be more costly to eliminate due to historic preservation  of certain facilities and environmental issues. We recommended that  DOD continue to manage reduction of long-term excess facilities, such as  proactively managing processes to meet historic preservation and  environmental requirements and working with host nations to avoid  prolonged negotiations over returning excess infrastructure in foreign  countries. While DOD officials stated that they have been proactively  managing historic preservation and environmental requirements, the  amount of funding dedicated to future demolition is not consistent with the  number of long-standing facilities yet to be demolished. In October 2015,  DOD officials developed a DOD Real Property Efficiency Plan that  describes DOD\u2019s strategic and tactical approach to managing its real  property effectively and efficiently, including reduction targets for fiscal  years 2016 through 2020. The plan further provides for how DOD expects  to dispose of long-standing excess facilities. However, DOD is in the early  stages of implementing the plan, and thus it is too early to assess its  results. If implemented effectively, the plan should help DOD improve its  capacity and ability to identify excess facilities, and to more effectively  and efficiently manage its real property.", "We also reported that DOD has shown capacity to consolidate installation  services at the joint bases. We reported in November 2012 that the joint  bases reported meeting common standards more than 70 percent of the  time in fiscal years 2010 and 2011. Also, in September 2014, we reported  that the joint bases reported partially consolidating 80 percent of their  installation functions. However, we noted that without comprehensively  evaluating whether installation support functions were still suitable for  consolidation, and without identifying and addressing limitations reported  by the joint bases, DOD might not be able to fully consolidate all  installation support functions. We recommended that DOD evaluate the  support functions identified in its joint base guidance to determine which  are still suitable for consolidation, and subsequently identify and make  any appropriate changes.

Specifically, DOD is able to generally monitor excess  infrastructure reduced through past BRAC rounds and ongoing property  reduction efforts, and has improved its cost data monitoring for the joint  bases. For example, DOD has some procedures in place to monitor  excess infrastructure reduced from the 2005 BRAC round, the Freeze  and Reduce the Footprint policies and each service\u2019s efforts at monitoring  its infrastructure. Under the Freeze and Reduce the Footprint policies,  OMB directed federal agencies to limit expansion of property (no new  facilities without disposing of equivalent facilities), provide real property  efficiency plans, and plan for and report on the reduction of property.

Subsequently, in March 2016 we reported  that DOD lacked reliable data to effectively assess how it uses leases.  While DOD is taking some steps to address data issues, it cannot fully  determine the number, size, and costs of its leases for real property  because the real property inventory system that DOD uses to monitor its  leased assets contains some inaccurate and incomplete data. For  example, we reported that about 15 percent of the lease records for fiscal  year 2011 and 10 percent of the records for fiscal year 2013 were  inaccurate. We recommended actions to improve the accuracy and  completeness of this data, such as breaking out the cost and square  footage information on multiple properties included in a single lease. DOD  concurred with our findings, but did not concur with our recommended  method to update DOD\u2019s database. If DOD does not improve the  reliability of its data, the department will continue to be limited in its ability  to monitor its reduction of excess infrastructure, identify opportunities to  consolidate underutilized facilities, and identify opportunities to reduce  reliance on costly leased space by moving DOD organizations into  excess facilities.", "Further, DOD has committed to taking some actions that would improve  the monitoring of costs and savings from any future BRAC rounds,  although some additional actions are needed.

DOD officials acknowledged that they could  improve the initial estimates in future BRAC rounds, and have reported  taking some action to do so, including updating standard factors for  information technology as part of the European Infrastructure  Consolidation effort. However, DOD also needs to consistently capture  liabilities from alternatively financed projects in the COBRA model for any  future BRAC round. These actions would provide for better baseline data  with which to make decisions as well as to track and monitor the results  achieved through any future BRAC rounds.

DOD partially concurred with our recommendation,  and stated that it was working to improve the data\u2019s reliability but found it  impractical to isolate and distinguish joint basing cost savings from the  savings that result from unrelated DOD- or service-wide actions. DOD  provided guidance to the joint bases to correct baseline data and as a  result, the quality of the data improved for fiscal years 2012 and 2013,  resulting in a 2013 analysis showing that the joint bases cost less to  operate than the separate installations.

CDC data also show that the number of  reported multistate foodborne illness outbreaks is increasing. This is  notable because although multistate outbreaks make up a small  proportion of total outbreaks, they affect greater numbers of people. For  example, according to CDC data, 3 percent of reported outbreaks from  2010 to 2014 were multistate, but these outbreaks were associated with  11 percent of illnesses, 34 percent of hospitalizations, and 56 percent of  deaths. CDC cites several potential contributors to the increase in  reported multistate outbreaks, including greater centralization of food  processing practices, wider food distribution, and improved detection and  investigation methods. developing Crohn\u2019s disease, a chronic inflammatory bowel disease.  According to a May 2015 estimate from USDA\u2019s Economic Research  Service, the most common 15 foodborne pathogens together impose an  economic burden related to foodborne illnesses, hospitalizations, and  deaths in the United States of over $15.5 billion annually.

In recent years, FDA has been confronted with multiple  challenges. Rapid changes in science and technology, globalization,  unpredictable public health crises, an increasing workload, and the  continuing need to monitor the safety of thousands of marketed medical  products are among the many challenges with which FDA must routinely  contend. The oversight of medical products was added to our High-Risk  List in 2009 because these obstacles threatened to compromise FDA\u2019s  ability to protect the public health.

FDA met all five  criteria\u2014demonstrating strong leadership commitment, ensuring sufficient  capacity, developing both specific action plans and effective monitoring  tools, and demonstrating progress\u2014for having the high-risk designation  removed for both medical device areas. At that time we also found that  FDA had action plans in place to help it respond to two remaining issues  of high importance: the effect of globalization on FDA\u2019s ability to monitor  medical product manufacturing, and the availability of medically  necessary drugs. In addition, we reported that the agency\u2019s leadership  was committed to and supportive of initiatives in these two remaining  areas.

It has  also improved the accuracy and completeness of information in its  catalog of drug manufacturing establishments subject to inspection (which  we referred to as an \u201cinventory\u201d in previous reports). The availability of  more reliable data should enhance FDA\u2019s oversight and help FDA apply  its risk-based model for selecting drug establishments for inspection. FDA  also has the opportunity to better monitor drug shortages by fully utilizing  a recently implemented tracking system.", "Although these are positive steps, we continue to have concerns in both  areas. The effectiveness of FDA\u2019s foreign offices, which began opening in  2008, has not yet been meaningfully assessed. In addition, persistently  high vacancy rates in these offices suggest that they may lack the  capacity to robustly monitor the global arena as the agency originally  envisioned. As of July 2016, 46 percent of FDA foreign offices positions  were vacant. Moreover, we found that some of the challenges FDA faces  in recruiting staff to work in these offices are the same as those we  reported on in 2010 and 2015.", "With regard to ensuring drug availability, the way FDA monitors its drug  shortage information remains a concern. Although it implemented a new  tracking system\u2014the Shortage Tracker\u2014in March 2016, this is the fourth  approach to monitoring shortages that the agency has taken in 5 years.  According to FDA, it routinely enters data into the system, but the agency  has not yet developed standard reports to help it manage its efforts, nor  has it made plans to use these data to analyze trends or identify patterns  to help it predict future shortages. Similarly, we remain concerned about  the reliability and availability of information that is necessary to monitor  postmarket drug safety.

For  example, the plan does not target vacancies by specific position types.  While FDA recognizes its vacancy rate in its foreign offices is high and  has set a goal of reducing this rate, the measure it has developed targets  all of the staff in OIP, including those who are domestically-based. Thus,  FDA could increase the number of domestically-based staff in OIP and  fulfill its goal without reducing vacancies in its foreign offices. We remain  concerned that, without targeting the foreign offices specifically or the  types of positions most likely to have vacancies, FDA will not have a  meaningful measure reflecting its true staffing needs overseas. In  December 2016, we recommended that FDA establish goals to achieve  the appropriate staffing levels for its foreign offices, which would include  separating foreign office vacancies from the OIP-wide vacancy rate and  setting goals by position type.

In December 2016, we reported that FDA formalized its process  for developing, evaluating, and documenting key decisions about the risk- based model that it will use to select drug establishments to inspect each  year.

According to leading practices for  strategic planning, identifying and using consistent measurable goals in  planning and progress documents is important to assessing  effectiveness. While FDA cited examples of its achievements in  regulatory science in a 2015 report, it cannot assess how those  achievements constitute progress towards its goals. In addition, FDA  lacks information about how funding targeted at regulatory science is  distributed across the priority areas. Decisions to award these funds are  made by individual FDA centers and offices, which generally did not  collect information on the associated priority areas of funded projects.

In  addition, there is a risk of a gap in polar satellite data in the early morning  orbit because DOD has not yet replaced satellites that are nearing the  end of their life spans.

In several recently issued reports, we  found capacity shortfalls in key contract management functions, including  cost and schedule performance evaluation, as well as in oversight of  major projects and programs.

At  that time, we noted that the department did not have the necessary staff  expertise and information systems to monitor contractors. In our February  2015 high-risk report, we found that DOE did not meet this criterion and  noted that an internal DOE review determined that the department had an  extremely low number of contract specialists.

The  Secretary\u2019s December 2014 and June 2015 memorandums\u2014which DOE  has stated serve as its corrective action plan\u2014were generally silent on  capacity issues. The Secretary\u2019s memorandums required the department  to create a Project Leadership Institute and both the ESAAB and PMRC  are to evaluate, among other things, issues related to organization and  staffing if such factors present a risk to a project; however, other capacity  issues, such as those related to contract oversight, were not explicitly  addressed.", "In several recently issued reports, we found capacity shortfalls in key  contract management functions, including cost and schedule performance  evaluation, as well as in oversight of major projects and programs, as  shown in the following examples:  In May 2015, we found that NNSA had not determined whether it has  sufficient, qualified personnel to ensure it used information from CAS  consistently, which include information on contractors\u2019 cost and  schedule performance.

In January 2017, we found that NNSA\u2019s recently developed plan to  improve and integrate financial data to better understand and  compare costs across NNSA programs, contractors, and sites did not  fully incorporate leading strategic planning practices, which limits its  usefulness as a planning tool as well as the effectiveness of NNSA\u2019s  effort to provide meaningful financial information to Congress and  other stakeholders.

We concluded  that having a policy that incorporates existing key internal control  standards and leading industry program management practices may  help ensure that EM and NNSA program offices are better able to  achieve their missions, goals, and objectives.

We recommended that DOE establish  a program management policy addressing internal control standards  and leading practices. DOE had no comments on our  recommendation. After our report was issued, the President signed  the 2016 Program Management Improvement Accountability Act, also  requiring the development of standards, policies, and guidelines for  program and project management across the federal government.

DOE officials stated that the PMRC provides a list of its  recommendations for the ESAAB meetings, but DOE does not track  which PMRC recommendations are implemented. In our ongoing work,  we have identified an example that raises questions about whether the  programs are following the guidance of the PMRC. For the Tank Waste  Characterization and Staging facility at Hanford, DOE estimated a cost  range of $390 million to $690 million. However, we reported in May 2015  that this cost range was not reliable. We also found that EM officials had  estimated that the cost for this facility would range from $1 billion to $1.5  billion, making it a major project and subject to more rigorous oversight  requirements. The PMRC reviewed the cost estimates showing that this  facility should be classified as a major project, but the program office  responsible for the facility did not modify the cost range for the project at  inception, raising questions about the extent of the PMRC\u2019s influence.", "DOE\u2019s new oversight and monitoring efforts are not comprehensive, as  certain activities within EM are not subject to review by the PMRC, even  though together they cost billions of dollars and last for numerous years.

These operations  activities include programs such as groundwater treatment at the Hanford  site, which has annually cost between about $140 million and $185 million  in recent years. of about $64 million and a schedule delay of nearly 9 months, in part  because DOE\u2019s initial estimates to complete the recovery activities did not  follow all best practices and were therefore unreliable. Notably, DOE  estimated it would restart waste operations based on a schedule that  gave DOE less than a 1 percent chance of meeting its restart date. We  recommended that EM revise its protocol to require it to use best  practices in developing cost and schedule estimates. DOE concurred with  our recommendation and stated that EM plans to transition from the  operations activities protocol to a new directive for operations activities,  which will include guidance on using cost and schedule best practices.", "Finally, the effectiveness of DOE\u2019s monitoring of its contracts, projects,  and programs depends upon the availability of reliable enterprise-wide  cost information on which to base oversight activities.

However, meaningful cost analysis\u2014 including comparisons across programs, contractors, and sites\u2014is not  possible because NNSA\u2019s contractors use different methods of  accounting for and tracking costs. NNSA developed a plan to improve  and integrate its cost reporting structures; however, we found in our  January 2017 report that the plan did not provide a useful roadmap for  guiding NNSA\u2019s effort. Until a plan is in place that incorporates leading  strategic planning practices, NNSA cannot be assured that its efforts will  result in a cost collection tool that produces reliable enterprise-wide cost  information that satisfies the information needs of Congress and program  managers, and enables DOE to effectively monitor its progress in  improving how it manages its contracts and programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Demonstrated Progress", "paragraphs": ["As noted earlier, DOE implemented a series of changes to policies and  procedures to improve project management, but the department does not  yet meet the criterion for demonstrating progress.

For the UPF, NNSA has  cancelled its plans for a large uranium facility, and proposed to use both  existing and new smaller facilities and new technologies to meet its  needs.

In addition to the contract management  issues noted earlier, such as acquisition planning for major contracts and  the quality of enterprise wide-cost information, our recent work identifies  additional challenges DOE continues to face in contract management. In  May 2015, we found that NNSA had not established policies or guidance  specific to using information from CAS to evaluate M&O contractor  performance. NNSA did not have policy or guidance on how or to what  extent NNSA officials should use information from CAS in evaluating  M&O contractors\u2019 performance.

Finally, while the agency has taken  steps to demonstrate progress toward improving acquisition outcomes  overall, we found that NASA continues to face significant challenges in its  ability to manage and oversee its most expensive and complex projects,  most notably its human spaceflight development programs. NASA must  ensure that it conducts adequate and ongoing assessments of risks and  understands the long-term costs for its larger human exploration  programs, as the effects of any potential miscalculations could be felt  across NASA\u2019s portfolio.

For example, in July 2016 we found that the  Orion program\u2019s cost estimate met or substantially met 7 of 20 best  practices and its schedule estimate met only 1 of 8 best practices. The  cost estimate lacked necessary support and the schedule estimate did  not include the level of detail required for high-quality estimates. Without  sound cost and schedule estimates, decision makers do not clearly  understand the cost and schedule risk inherent in the program and lack  important information they need to make programmatic decisions. In  October 2015, NASA decided to decentralize its independent assessment  function and deploy the staff to the agency\u2019s centers, in part, to better use  its workforce to meet program needs in areas such as program  management, cost estimating, and resource analysis, and to fill gaps in  program analysis skills at the center level.

In November 2012, we recommended that NASA  update its procedural requirements to include a formal EVM surveillance  program in order to improve the reliability of EVM data collected by NASA  programs. While NASA agreed with our conclusion that EVM data  reliability needed improvement, it has yet to implement a formal  surveillance requirement due to resource constraints. In our December  2015 review of JWST, we found EVM data anomalies and recommended  that project officials require the contractors to explain and document all  such anomalies in their monthly EVM reports. A continuous surveillance  program could have identified these anomalies earlier, allowing the  project to pursue corrective action with its contractors.

Also, NASA inconsistently reports on the  performance of some programs, which masks the full extent of cost and  schedule growth.", "Together, NASA\u2019s three human spaceflight efforts constitute more than  half of NASA\u2019s portfolio development cost baseline, and helped make the  2016 portfolio the most expensive collection of NASA projects in  development since we began our annual assessment in 2009. Although  NASA\u2019s human spaceflight programs are generally better positioned for  success than the agency\u2019s most recent effort to replace the space shuttle,  managing weaknesses\u2014including unreliable cost estimating, overly  ambitious internal deadlines, limited reserves, and operating for extended  periods of time without definitized contracts\u2014have increased the  likelihood that it will incur overruns and schedule delays, particularly when  coupled with the broad array of technical risks that are inherent in any  human spaceflight development.", "Moreover, all three human spaceflight projects will be significantly  challenged in the next 2 years as NASA aims to launch its first exploration  mission by November 2018. This mission, which will not have a crew, will  fly some 70,000 kilometers beyond the moon\u2014using the SLS launch  vehicle, Orion, and EGS. During this time, the human spaceflight  programs will need to resolve a multitude of technical and design  challenges, complete fabrication and testing, and be delivered to the  Kennedy Space Center where they will be integrated with each other and  prepared for launch. Numerous activities along this development path are  sequential and cannot be rearranged to gain back time lost from prior  delays. Other activities can be deleted or performed concurrently, but not  without more risk to the program. If delays materialize during individual  systems integration and testing, they could cause a cascading effect of  cross-program problems. NASA has already made these later phases  more complicated by postponing key activities in order to keep pace with  internal deadlines. In addition, because the agency will be in the final  throes of other major programs, such as JWST, senior leaders\u2019 attention  may be divided amongst many programs in the months leading up to the  first exploration mission.", "Examples of management risk for human spaceflight programs that we  have recently identified include:", "As we found in July 2016, each program manages to an aggressive  internal NASA launch readiness date, which creates an environment  for programs to make decisions based on reduced knowledge to meet  a date that is not realistic. For example, the EGS program has  consolidated future schedule activities to prepare the mobile  launcher\u2014the vehicle used to bring SLS to the launch pad\u2014to meet  this internal goal. The program acknowledged that consolidating  activities\u2014which includes conducting verification and validation  concurrent with installation activities\u2014increases risk because of  uncertainties about how systems not yet installed may affect the  systems already installed. Officials added, however, that this  concurrency is necessary to meet the internal schedule.", "All three programs are operating with limited cost reserves, which limit  each program\u2019s ability to address risks and unforeseen technical  challenges. For example, we found in July 2016 that the Orion  program will maintain very low levels of annual cost reserves until  2018. The lack of currently available cost reserves has caused the  program to defer work to address technical issues to stay within  budget. As a result, the Orion program\u2019s reserves in future years  could be overwhelmed by deferred work\u2014a practice that contributed  to the rebaseline of the JWST program, which included a $3.6 billion  cost increase and a 52-month schedule delay.", "We found in July 2016 that the SLS program has not positioned itself  well to accurately assess progress with the core stage\u2014SLS\u2019s  structural backbone and fuel tank\u2014because it did not have a  performance measurement baseline for that contract. Such a  baseline is necessary to support EVM reporting that can provide early  warning signs of impending schedules delays and cost overrun, and  provide unbiased estimates of anticipated costs at completion. The  lack of an accurate performance measurement baseline stemmed  from different assumptions between NASA and the contractor about  when funding would be available to start different work and ultimately  led to a contract modification. NASA and the contractor signed the  contract replan in May 2016\u2014with a cost increase of approximately  $1 billion\u2014and the program began receiving contractor EVM data in  July 2016, more than 4.5 years after NASA awarded the contract.", "The cost and schedule baselines NASA has established for these  three programs provide little visibility into long-term planning and  costs. The baselines for SLS and EGS are applicable through the first  exploration mission, and the baseline for Orion extends through the  second exploration mission. However, the limited scope that NASA  has chosen for constructing these cost estimates means that these  estimates are unlikely to serve as a way to measure progress and  track cost growth over the life of the projects which are expected to  extend well beyond these first missions.", "In addition to these human spaceflight programs, NASA plans to  reestablish a domestic capability to fly astronauts to the International  Space Station through its Commercial Crew program by the end of 2018.  This is also proving to be an aggressive schedule and NASA\u2019s two  contractors are concurrently developing, testing, and producing their  vehicles in an effort to maintain schedule. Significant delays could lead to  a gap in U.S. access to the International Space Station as NASA has  acquired seats on the Russian Soyuz vehicle only through 2018.", "NASA also continues to have trouble demonstrating progress in executing  two projects that we found in our 2015 high-risk update illustrated  instances in which the agency had either underestimated risks and  potential effects or had not reacted quickly enough to risks when they  worsened:  The Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) project\u2014also  scheduled to launch in 2018\u2014continues to experience issues with its sole  instrument, a laser altimeter. The project may require an additional 10  months or more to resolve technical challenges. The project already  underwent one rebaseline in 2014, resulting in a 37 percent higher  development cost than its original baseline\u2014from $558.9 million to  $763.7 million\u2014which NASA officials at the time primarily attributed to  underestimating the technical complexity of the project\u2019s design.", "The Space Network Ground Segment Sustainment (SGSS) project\u2019s  contractor provided overly optimistic estimates, which\u2014despite project  officials being aware of this issue during project confirmation\u2014 necessitated a rebaseline shortly after the project was confirmed. NASA  approved a new baseline in June 2015, which increased its estimated  cost by $345 million and delayed its estimated completion by 27 months.  In February 2016, NASA reclassified SGSS as a sustainment project  rather than a major project, which reduces reporting and oversight  requirements.", "Finally, as we highlighted in the 2015 high-risk update, the inconsistent  way NASA measures its progress toward reducing acquisition risk masks  true cost and schedule growth for some programs. When NASA reports  on cost and schedule performance for individual projects or across its  portfolio, it uses rebaseline data rather than original project baseline data  for measuring outcomes. Cost and schedule growth that occurred prior to  the rebaseline of a troubled project are excluded from calculations of  overall progress. As a result, when the agency reports program  performance in this manner\u2014as it has for JWST, ICESat-2, and others\u2014 it makes it difficult to track cost and schedule growth compared to the  agency\u2019s original commitment levels."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Benefits Achieved by Implementing Our Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["In November 2012, we found that NASA employee skill sets available  to analyze and implement EVM vary widely from center to center, and  we recommended that NASA conduct an EVM skills gap analysis to  identify areas requiring augmented capability across the agency, and,  based on the results of the assessment, develop a workforce training  plan to address any deficiencies. NASA developed an EVM training  plan in 2014 based on the results of an EVM skills gap analysis that  was conducted in 2013.", "In November 2012, we found that NASA faced cultural and technical  challenges that it must overcome to successfully implement an EVM  system and to use this data on a regular basis to inform decision  making. We recommended that the agency develop an EVM change  management plan to assist managers and employees throughout the  agency with accepting and embracing earned value techniques while  reducing the operational effect on the agency. In response to our  recommendation, in 2014, NASA developed an EVM change  management plan. This plan was approved by the EVM Steering  Committee, which is comprised of senior-level NASA officials who  provide guidance to the agency on implementing EVM. In addition, the  plan was briefed to the EVM Focal Points who are responsible for  implementing the plan within their respective organizations.", "In November 2012, we found that 10 NASA major spaceflight projects  had not yet fully implemented EVM. As a result, NASA was not  taking full advantage of an important tool that could help reduce  acquisition risk. We recommended that NASA establish a time frame  by which all new spaceflight projects will be required to implement  NASA\u2019s newly developed EVM system to ensure that in-house efforts  are compliant with ANSI/EIA-748, accounting for the need to increase  NASA\u2019s institutional capability for conducting EVM and analyzing and  reporting the data. In fiscal year 2013, NASA started a phased rollout  at selected centers to increase the agency\u2019s EVM capacity by  implementing its EVM Capability process at projects at those centers.  According to NASA officials, as future projects at those centers  implement EVM, they expect centers will follow the agency EVM  process, which will better ensure that they are using systems which  are compliant with ANSI/EIA-748.", "In August 2014, NASA addressed concerns we raised about the SLS  by taking actions to balance the program\u2019s cost and schedule risk in  line with agency policies. At the time of our report in July 2014, we  found that NASA\u2019s funding plan for the first test flight of SLS in  December 2017 was insufficient to meet needs.  We recommended  that the program match resources to requirements that would result in  a level of risk in line with NASA policy by\u2014for example\u2014establishing  cost and schedule baselines that supported a joint cost and schedule  confidence level (JCL) of 70 percent. We indicated that NASA could,  for example, increase funding or delay the scheduled launch date to  reduce risks and meet the 70 percent JCL.

Treasury has  requested authority to reduce the current 250-return threshold for  employers electronically filing information returns. In 2014, we suggested  that Congress consider authorizing Treasury to lower the threshold for  electronic filing of W-2s from 250 returns annually to between 5 to 10  returns, as appropriate.", "Math error authority. Providing IRS with correctible authority with  appropriate safeguards to permit it to correct errors in cases where  information provided by the taxpayer does not match information in  government databases, among other things, could help IRS correct  additional errors and avoid burdensome audits and taxpayer  penalties. Congress enacted legislation in December 2015 that  expands the circumstances in which IRS may use math error authority  in some situations for selected refundable tax credits. While  expanding math error authority is consistent with what we have  previously suggested, we had suggested that math error authority be  authorized on a broader basis with appropriate controls rather than on  a piecemeal basis, and that controls may be needed to ensure that  this authority is used properly. Our prior work identified potential  controls, such as requiring IRS to report on its use of math error  authority.", "Paid preparer regulation. Establishing requirements for paid tax  return preparers could improve the accuracy of the tax returns they  prepare. In 2014, we suggested Congress consider granting IRS the  authority to regulate paid tax preparers, if it agrees that significant  paid preparer errors exist. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimated  that legislation to regulate paid preparers would increase tax  compliance by $135 million in revenue through fiscal year 2025.", "Tax reform and simplification. A broader opportunity to address the  tax gap involves simplifying the Internal Revenue Code, as complexity  can confuse taxpayers and provide opportunities to hide willful  noncompliance. Fundamental tax reform could result in a smaller tax  gap if the new system has fewer tax preferences or complex tax code  provisions; such reform could reduce IRS\u2019s enforcement challenges  and increase public confidence in the tax system. Short of  fundamental reform, targeted simplification opportunities also exist.  Amending the tax code to define terms more consistently across tax  provisions could help taxpayers more easily understand and comply  with their obligations and get the maximum tax benefit for their  situations. For example, there are several provisions in the tax code  benefiting taxpayers\u2019 educational expenses, but the definition of what  qualifies as a higher-education expense varies between these tax  expenditures."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Additional Details on What GAO Found", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Enforcement of Tax laws", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Leadership Commitment", "paragraphs": ["IRS has met the criterion of demonstrating a strong commitment to, and  top leadership support for, improving tax compliance and addressing the  tax gap.

Specifically, Medicare\u2019s substantial size and scope result in the current  program having wide ranging effects on beneficiaries, the health care  sector, and the overall U.S. economy. In 2016, Medicare was projected to  spend $696 billion and provide health care coverage to over 57 million  beneficiaries. Medicare pays about 60 percent of the health care costs of  beneficiaries enrolled in fee-for-service (FFS) who do not reside in  institutions. Over 1 million health care providers, contractors, and  suppliers\u2014including private health plans, physicians, hospitals, skilled  nursing facilities, durable medical equipment (DME) suppliers, ambulance  providers, and many others\u2014receive payments from Medicare. Every  year, Medicare pays over a billion claims submitted by these health care  providers. Consequently, Medicare must be closely monitored because  even relatively small changes can have large short-term effects in the  aggregate. For example, Medicare provider payment rates that are set  too high unnecessarily financially burden beneficiaries\u2014through higher  premiums and cost sharing\u2014taxpayers, and the federal budget. Payment  rates that are set too low may diminish providers\u2019 willingness to treat  Medicare beneficiaries and adversely affect their access to appropriate,  high-quality health care.", "Medicare also has an outsize effect on the federal budget, which creates  challenges when the federal government is determining how to prioritize  its spending. The program\u2019s expenditures currently account for about 3.6  percent of the country\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP).The  Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects that in fiscal year 2016,  Medicare outlays will total more than is projected to be spent on defense  ($579 billion) and almost double federal spending on Medicaid ($365  billion).

The Medicare Trustees 2016 report stated that, under current law,  Medicare\u2019s share of GDP would rise to 5.6 percent by 2040. As Medicare  spending grows disproportionately to other federal spending and the  economy, it will put increasing pressure on the federal budget and tend to  squeeze out spending for other programs.", "However, the Trustees have stated that Medicare spending projections,  especially those stretching out over decades, are highly uncertain and  cautioned that future Medicare spending could be substantially higher  than projected. In their 2016 report, they noted that some Medicare cost- reduction provisions may be difficult to sustain.  For example, one set of  Medicare provisions affecting many types of health care providers  reduces the annual payment rate updates to account for economy-wide  productivity growth. However, the productivity growth rates historically  achieved by health care providers have been lower than the economy- wide rates. If health care providers do not realize sufficiently high  productivity growth and these cost-reduction measures are not sustained,  Medicare projected spending could rise to 6.2 percent of GDP in 2040  and 9.1 percent in 2090, according to the Trustees.", "Another uncertainty is whether advances in medical technology will tend  to slow or accelerate Medicare spending growth. Technological advances  may enhance the ability of providers to diagnose, treat, or prevent health  problems. Examples include new drugs, devices, procedures, and  therapies, as well as new applications of existing technologies. Although  new technologies may decrease or increase health care costs, in 2013  we reported that technological change had likely been the dominant  cause (accounting for 36 to 55 percent) of the increases in overall U.S.  health care per capita spending over the past several decades. It should  be noted, however, that a complete assessment of health care spending  for new technologies should also consider the associated value for  individuals, often measured by improved health functioning, increased life  expectancy, or improved economic productivity.", "In the past few years, growth in Medicare spending has slowed, as overall  health care spending has also slowed. Analysts debate whether this  slowdown can be attributed to transitory effects, such as the recent  economic turndown, or broader changes in the health care system that  may be longer lasting. Nonetheless, Medicare\u2019s historical trends, the  aging of the population, and the uncertainties associated with recent  reforms and the effects of advances in medical technology all underscore  the need for continued efforts to moderate spending growth while  ensuring that beneficiaries have appropriate access to high-quality health  care.

CBO estimated that PPACA would reduce  Medicare spending by about $400 billion over 10 years from fiscal year  2010 to fiscal year 2019. Major savings were expected from several  actions, including constraining annual payment updates to certain  Medicare providers, tying Medicare Advantage (MA)\u2014Medicare\u2019s private  plan alternative to the traditional Medicare FFS program\u2014maximum  payment amounts to near or below FFS spending, reducing payments to  hospitals that serve a large number of low-income patients\u2014reflecting the  expectation that PPACA\u2019s health insurance expansion provisions would  result in far fewer uninsured hospital patients\u2014and modifying the high- income threshold for adjusting beneficiary Part B premiums, among other  changes.", "Some PPACA provisions sought to establish financial incentives for  providers to increase the efficiency and quality of Medicare services, or to  test new ways of achieving those goals. For example, PPACA required  the establishment of a national, voluntary pilot program to bundle  payments for physician, hospital, and post-acute care services to improve  patient care and reduce spending. Another provision modified payments  to hospitals that experience patient readmissions related to certain  potentially preventable conditions. Certain PPACA payment changes  seek to provide a strong financial incentive for health care providers to  enhance productivity, improve efficiency, or otherwise reduce their costs  per service. Notably, several of PPACA\u2019s changes seek to implement  value-based purchasing of health care and transform the program into  one that encourages efficiency and quality, instead of simply  compensating providers for the volume of health care services.", "In April 2015, the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015  (MACRA) was enacted, bringing additional changes to the way Medicare  reimburses physicians, among other changes to Medicare. MACRA  repealed the sustainable growth rate (SGR) system\u2014which was first  implemented in 1998 to moderate spending for physician services\u2014and  established a new payment framework to encourage efficiency in the  provision of health care and to reward health care providers for higher  quality of care. Specifically, MACRA created a Merit-based Incentive  Payment System (MIPS) that will be used to increase or decrease certain  physicians\u2019 payments based on their performance. Under MIPS, the  Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) will assess physician  performance in four categories: quality; cost; clinical practice  improvement activities; and advancing care information through the  meaningful use of electronic health records technology. MACRA also  included provisions to incentivize Medicare providers to participate in  alternative payment models, such as qualifying accountable care  organizations. In addition to reforming physician payment, MACRA made  several other changes to Medicare, including making income-related  adjustments to premiums in Medicare Parts B and D.", "It is too early to tell the extent to which these changes in PPACA and  MACRA may help constrain Medicare spending over the long run, as the  changes have only recently been implemented, or their implementation is  ongoing. Moreover, future legislation could modify payment reforms, such  as those established by PPACA and MACRA, and affect their impact on  program spending. In addition, uncertainty about PPACA\u2019s and MACRA\u2019s  effects on spending exists because future spending may also depend on  changes in the rest of the health care system. For example, provisions of  PPACA are designed to increase the number of individuals with health  insurance and reduce the number of uninsured. In 2013, we found that  Medicare beneficiaries who had continuous health insurance coverage  before enrollment in Medicare reported being in better health in the 6  years after Medicare enrollment and, in the first year of Medicare  coverage, had significantly lower Medicare spending.", "Additional spending uncertainty stems from concerns raised by the  Medicare Trustees, CBO, and the Office of the Actuary (OACT) about  whether some of the Medicare cost-containment mechanisms included in  PPACA can be sustained over the long term, such as the provider  productivity payment adjustment, and physician payment updates and  incentives included in MACRA. For example, additional payments for  alternative payment models provided under MACRA will expire in 2025,  and physician payment update amounts, which are not tied to economic  conditions, are not expected to keep pace with average physician cost  increases. The Medicare Trustees report for 2016 projected that,  beginning in 2048, physician payment rates will be lower than they would  have been under the SGR formula and will continue to be lower after that.

Many of the broad-based reforms  being implemented to Medicare\u2019s payment systems in the traditional FFS  program have introduced financial incentives into payment structures to  explicitly reward quality and efficiency, such as creating the Merit-based  Incentive Payment System discussed previously. To help ensure that  physicians are able to respond to these new incentives and are able to  improve their performance, CMS recently began to provide more frequent  feedback to physicians on their performance, as we recommended, to  help them identify opportunities to reduce costs and pinpoint high-cost  beneficiaries who may benefit from enhanced care coordination. MACRA  also required that CMS consider physician and other providers\u2019  improvement and their opportunity for continued improvement when  establishing benchmarks for Merit-based Incentive Payment System  performance measures. As CMS progresses toward fully implementing its  value-based payment system, it will be important for the agency to use  reliable quality and cost measures and methodological approaches that  maximize the number of physicians for whom value can be determined.", "As CMS implements these broad-based payment reforms, we have  identified additional areas where continued monitoring of payment  methods is warranted to encourage efficiency and reduce the risk of  overspending.", "Payment methods for cancer hospitals. Currently, 11 cancer hospitals,  designated in the 1980s and 1990s, that meet certain statutory criteria are  exempt from Medicare\u2019s inpatient prospective payment system (PPS) and  are also receiving payment adjustments under the outpatient PPS. The  Medicare PPS introduced better control over program spending and  provided hospitals with an incentive for efficient resource use. Yet for  decades, as required by law, Medicare has paid these cancer hospitals  differently than PPS hospitals in recognition of their specialized focus and  concerns that reimbursements under PPS would be inadequate to cover  costs for the types of care provided at cancer hospitals. This has  remained the case even as the inpatient PPS methodology has been  refined to better account for variation in the severity and complexity of  beneficiaries and the resource intensity of hospital care.", "The 11 cancer hospitals currently exempted from the inpatient PPS and  receiving payment adjustments under the outpatient PPS are reimbursed  largely based on their reported costs and as such have little incentive for  containing costs. In 2012, we estimated that PPS-exempt cancer  hospitals received, on average, about 42 percent more in Medicare  inpatient payments per discharge than what Medicare would have paid a  local PPS teaching hospital to treat cancer beneficiaries with the same  level of complexity. Similarly, Medicare outpatient payment adjustments  to these cancer hospitals resulted in overall payments that were about 37  percent higher, on average, than payments Medicare would have made to  PPS teaching hospitals for the same set of services. Had beneficiaries of  PPS-exempt cancer hospitals received services at nearby PPS teaching  hospitals in 2012, the Medicare program may have saved almost $500  million. We suggested that Congress require Medicare to pay PPS- exempt hospitals as it pays PPS teaching hospitals, or provide the  Secretary of Health and Human Services the authority to otherwise  modify how Medicare pays these PPS-exempt hospitals. To generate  cost savings, we also suggested that Congress provide that all forgone  outpatient payment adjustment amounts be returned to the  Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund, which funds Medicare Part  B services, such as physician visits, and Medicare Part D services, such  as prescription drugs. The 21st Century Cures Act, enacted in December  2016, slightly reduces the additional payments cancer hospitals receive  for outpatient services and returns savings to the Supplementary Medical  Insurance Trust Fund. However, the law keeps in place the payment  system for outpatient services that differs from how Medicare pays PPS  teaching hospitals. Moreover, the law does not change how PPS-exempt  cancer hospitals are paid for inpatient services. Until Medicare pays  PPS-exempt cancer hospitals in a way that encourages efficiency, rather  than largely on the basis of reported costs, Medicare remains at risk for  overspending.", "Hospital-physician consolidation. Because Medicare often pays more  for services when they are performed in a hospital outpatient department  than when they are performed in a physician\u2019s office, hospitals may have  an incentive to acquire physician practices, hire physicians as salaried  employees, or both\u2014financial arrangements commonly referred to as  vertical consolidations. After hospitals and physicians vertically  consolidate, the same services that were once reimbursed by Medicare at  a lower total payment rate could be classified as hospital outpatient  department services and reimbursed at a higher rate. In our work, we  found that the number of vertically consolidated hospitals increased by  about 20 percent from 2007 through 2013 and the number of physicians  in these arrangements nearly doubled. Some have questioned whether  or to what extent vertical consolidations have contributed to the rapid rise  in Medicare expenditures for hospital outpatient departments, which  increased by more than eight percent annually from 2007 through 2013.  We found that the percentage of evaluation and management (E/M) office  visits performed in hospital outpatient departments was generally higher  in counties with higher levels of vertical consolidation.", "The rise in vertical consolidation exacerbates a financial vulnerability in  Medicare\u2019s payment policy\u2014paying different rates for the same service,  depending on where the service is performed. Estimates from entities  such as the Bipartisan Policy Center and the Medicare Payment Advisory  Commission suggest that equalizing payments rates for E/M office visits  could save nearly $1 billion to $2 billion a year for the Medicare program  and beneficiaries. We suggested that Congress direct the Secretary of  Health and Human Services to equalize payment rates between settings  for E/M office visits and other services as appropriate. Until the disparity  in payment rates for E/M office visits is addressed, Medicare could be  expending more resources than necessary.", "Payments for hospital uncompensated care. Hospital uncompensated  care costs are a long-standing concern because of their potential to  weaken hospitals\u2019 financial stability and thereby hospitals\u2019 abilities to  serve their communities. Both Medicare and Medicaid provide funds to  help offset hospitals\u2019 uncompensated care costs. In fiscal year 2014,  Medicare made over $14 billion in payments to hospitals for  uncompensated care through a variety of payment types, including a  relatively new type of payment called Medicare Uncompensated Care  (UC) payments. We have raised concerns that Medicare UC payments  are largely based on hospitals\u2019 Medicaid workload rather than hospitals\u2019  actual uncompensated care costs, which can result in poor alignment  between payments and uncompensated care costs. This may be  particularly true in states that have expanded Medicaid\u2014that is, coverage  expanded through PPACA to nearly all adults with incomes up to 133  percent of the poverty level\u2014and therefore where lower uncompensated  care costs are expected.", "In an April 2016 proposed rule, CMS announced that it is considering  making hospitals\u2019 actual uncompensated care costs the sole basis for  making Medicare UC payments by fiscal year 2020. Another concern,  however, is that when making Medicare UC payments, CMS does not  account for payments hospitals received from Medicaid, even though the  bulk of Medicare\u2019s payments are made on the basis of Medicaid  workloads, for which hospitals may have also received Medicaid  payments. We recommended that CMS improve the alignment of  Medicare UC payments with hospital uncompensated care costs and  account for Medicaid payments received when making Medicare UC  payments to individual hospitals. HHS concurred with these  recommendations and in its final rule indicated that it planned to  implement them beginning in fiscal year 2021 to allow time for hospitals to  collect and report reliable uncompensated care cost data.", "Physician self-referral. Our work has identified opportunities for CMS to  introduce additional payment method refinements and controls in  Medicare FFS to encourage appropriate use of services. For example,  self-referral\u2014when a provider refers patients to entities in which the  provider or the provider\u2019s family members have a financial interest\u2014 continues to be a concern in relation to the rapid growth of Medicare FFS  expenditures. In recent years, we found that certain services\u2014including  diagnostic imaging, certain cancer treatments, and diagnostic pathology  services\u2014performed by self-referring groups have increased  dramatically. For example, from 2004 through 2010, the number of self- referred magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) services increased by more  than 80 percent; in comparison, the number of non-self-referred MRI  services increased by 12 percent during this time period. We have recommended that CMS determine and implement an approach to ensure  providers appropriately self-refer for advanced imaging services. HHS did  not concur with this recommendation but is in the process of establishing  an appropriate use criteria program for advanced imaging services that  would apply to all physicians\u2014including those that self-refer\u2014and which,  depending on implementation, could address our recommendation. CMS  has yet to take definitive steps to monitor physician self-referral for certain  cancer treatment and diagnostic pathology services, and until it does so,  the Medicare FFS program and its beneficiaries will continue to be at risk  for these rapidly increasing expenditures.", "High-expenditure Part B drugs. In 2014, Medicare spent over $24  billion on drugs covered under Part B. Part B drugs are those commonly  administered by a physician or under a physician\u2019s close supervision,  such as vaccines or some oral cancer drugs. The vast majority of these  expenditures ($21 billion) were based on the drug\u2019s average sales price  (ASP), the amount physicians and other purchasers pay manufacturers  for the drug, which CMS calculates based on sales data reported by drug  manufacturers. Ensuring the accuracy of the data on which CMS bases  payment rates for part B ASP drugs is important given Medicare\u2019s  substantial expenditures for these drugs and given beneficiaries\u2019 general  responsibility to cover 20 percent of Medicare\u2019s payment for these drugs  via cost-sharing requirements, which amounted to about $4 billion in  2014. We found, however, that CMS is not able to assess the accuracy of  all sales price data because not all manufacturers are required to submit  these data. Further, while CMS conducts certain checks to assess the  completeness of the sales data it does receive, the agency does not  verify the accuracy of the data by tracing it to source documents, such as  sales invoices. We suggested that Congress require all manufacturers of  Part B drugs to submit sales price data to CMS and to ensure CMS has  the authority to request source documentation and periodically validate  such data.", "Additionally, the ASP does not account for drug coupon discounts that  manufacturers provide to privately insured patients, which reduce the  effective market price for these drugs. In our work, we found that the ASP  for several part B drugs with drug coupon discounts exceeded the  effective market price that manufacturers ultimately received. As a  result, Medicare may be paying more than necessary for these drugs.  Regular monitoring of the implications of coupon programs for Medicare\u2019s  payment methodology for part B drugs is needed as CMS works to  propose an alternative payment system. CMS, however, lacks the  authority to collect data from drug manufacturers on coupon discounts to  patients because the authority to collect information relating to ASP is  based on manufacturer sales to purchasers. We suggested that Congress  consider granting CMS authority to collect data from drug manufacturers  on coupon discounts for Part B drugs based on ASP and require the  agency to periodically collect these data and report on the implications of  coupon programs for Part B drug payment rate methodology.", "Low-volume payment adjustments. Medicare\u2019s payment adjustment for  low-volume dialysis facilities is one of several modifications in Medicare\u2019s  payment systems designed to help maintain beneficiaries\u2019 access to care.  Low-volume providers in areas where other care options are limited may  warrant higher payments, and CMS intended this low-volume payment  adjustment (LVPA) to encourage small dialysis facilities to continue  operating in areas where beneficiary access might be jeopardized if such  facilities closed. However, in 2013 we found that, as designed, the LVPA  did not effectively achieve this goal because it did not target all relatively  low-volume, high-cost facilities that were in areas where beneficiaries  may have lacked other dialysis care options, and it targeted some  facilities that appeared unnecessary for ensuring access to dialysis, such  as dialysis facilities located in close proximity to other facilities. In  response to our report, CMS revised the LVPA, beginning in 2016, to  more effectively target low-volume facilities necessary for ensuring  access to care; and in 2015, CMS issued clarifying guidance on the LVPA  in a final rule and held outreach calls to dialysis facilities and Medicare  contractors to ensure their understanding of the guidance. The agency  has not acted, however, to implement an improvement we recommended  to change the design of LVPA to reduce the incentive for facilities to  restrict the services they provide in order to avoid reaching treatment  thresholds that determine eligibility for the program.", "Physician payment rates. The accuracy of Medicare\u2019s payment rate for  physician services has major implications for the health care system  given spending on these services\u2014$70 billion in fiscal year 2015\u2014and  the fact that other payers, such as private insurers, base their payment  rates at least in part on Medicare rates. Inaccurate payment rates can  create distorted incentives for physicians to either over- or underprovide  services or to pursue certain specialties. We and others have identified  several weaknesses in CMS\u2019s processes for setting physician payment  rates. This process involves CMS assigning relative values to each  service by taking into account recommendations made by the American  Medical Association\u2019s Specialty Society Relative Value Scale Update  Committee (RUC).", "Some of our concerns with this process include issues with the survey  data the RUC uses in part to develop relative value recommendations,  including low survey response rates. In 2015, the median survey  response rate for over 200 physician services was about 2 percent.  Additionally, although CMS officials state that all Medicare services are  reviewed every 5 years as required by statute, the agency does not  maintain a database to track when services were last valued. CMS  officials acknowledge that the agency relies heavily on RUC  recommendations. Given the process and data-related weaknesses  associated with the RUC\u2019s recommendations, this process could  potentially result in inaccurate payment rates. To address these concerns,  we recommended that CMS incorporate data and expertise from  physicians and other relevant stakeholders into the process for  establishing relative values. CMS concurred with this recommendation  and has begun to research ways to develop an approach for validating  relative values, but until it develops a timeline and a plan for determining  its approach, CMS risks continuing to use payment rates that may be  inaccurate."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Medicare Advantage and Other Medicare Health Plans", "paragraphs": ["The MA program, an alternative to the traditional Medicare FFS program,  provides health care coverage to Medicare beneficiaries through private  health plans. The number and percentage of Medicare beneficiaries  enrolled in MA has grown steadily over the past several years, increasing  from 8.1 million (20 percent of all Medicare beneficiaries) in 2007 to 15.8  million (30 percent of all Medicare beneficiaries) in 2014. Congress has  taken a number of steps to introduce financial incentives to explicitly  reward quality and efficiency in the MA program. For example, PPACA  provided that MA plans with a quality rating of four or more stars\u2014with  five stars indicating the highest quality\u2014receive bonus payments, and  required MA maximum payment amounts to be adjusted to near or below  FFS spending. Moreover, in January 2013, Congress enacted the  American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (ATRA), which increased the  statutory minimum for the annual MA coding intensity adjustment in order  to account for differences in the comprehensiveness with which MA plans  and FFS providers code medical diagnoses. CBO estimated that this  change alone would save Medicare about $1.4 billion over 5 years. The  recently enacted 21st Century Cures Act also includes several changes to  the MA risk adjustment model that must be implemented beginning in  2019. For example, the MA risk adjustment model will be required to take  into account the number of diseases or conditions of enrollees and allows  CMS to use 2 years of diagnosis data when determining the health  condition of beneficiaries.", "CMS has yet to take action to improve the accuracy of its payments to  MA programs or to ensure that MA beneficiaries have sufficient access to  providers. We have identified additional opportunities for CMS to improve  the accuracy of MA payments, such as adjusting its methodology to  account for diagnostic coding differences between MA and FFS, and  improve CMS\u2019s oversight of MA network adequacy.", "MA plan payment adjustments. Concerns remain about the discrepancy  between FFS and MA payments because CMS has yet to improve the  accuracy of the adjustment to account for excess payments due to  differences in how MA plans and FFS providers code medical diagnoses.  We have found that CMS\u2019s risk adjustment model\u2014which uses one  year\u2019s diagnoses to predict the following year\u2019s health care costs for each  MA enrollee\u2014has led it to overpay MA organizations because of different  diagnostic coding patterns between the FFS and MA programs. In 2013,  we estimated that these overpayments ranged from at least $3.2 billion to  $5.1 billion from 2010 through 2012. We have recommended that CMS  take steps to improve the accuracy of its risk score adjustments by, for  example, accounting for additional beneficiary characteristics such as  sex, health status, and Medicaid enrollment status, as well as including  the most recent data available. In April 2016, CMS indicated that after  analyzing MA data, the agency planned to implement the statutory  minimum for the annual MA coding adjustment mandated in ATRA.  However, as of October 2016, CMS had not provided documentation of  its analysis to determine, for example, the extent to which the agency\u2019s  methodology accounted for additional beneficiary statistics, as we  recommended.", "In addition, CMS has taken steps to collect encounter data\u2014information  on the services and items furnished to enrollees\u2014which are more  comprehensive than the beneficiary diagnosis data the agency currently  uses to risk adjust payments to MA organizations, and has reported that it  will use these data in calculating risk adjustments. However, CMS has not  fully developed plans for validating and using MA encounter data, missing  an opportunity to detect potentially inaccurate or unreliable data that is  being used to direct billions of federal dollars. We recommended that  CMS fully validate the MA encounter data it is collecting before using  these data for payment purposes. In 2015, CMS began using encounter  data as an additional source of diagnostic data in calculating beneficiary  risk scores but acknowledged that the agency had yet to complete all  steps to validate the data before using them for payment purposes, as we  had recommended. Without fully validating the completeness and  accuracy of MA encounter data, CMS and MA organizations would be  unable to confidently use the data for risk adjustment or any other  program management purpose.", "Provider network adequacy. CMS is responsible for ensuring adequate  access to care for MA enrollees, but reports that some MA organizations  have been narrowing their provider networks raise questions about CMS  oversight of MA plans\u2019 network adequacy. In 2015, we reported on  shortcomings in CMS\u2019s criteria for determining network adequacy, how  the agency oversees MA organizations\u2019 adherence to its requirements,  and how it ensures enrollees are properly notified about provider network  changes. For example, unlike other managed care programs, CMS\u2019s  network adequacy criteria do not consider measures of provider  availability, such as appointment wait times and whether providers are  accepting new patients. CMS also assesses very few networks (less than  one percent) each year against its network adequacy criteria and does  little to evaluate the accuracy of the network data MA organizations  submit. We made several recommendations, including that CMS augment  MA network adequacy criteria to address provider availability. HHS  concurred with this recommendation, and in early 2016, officials stated  that they will review how to augment the MA network adequacy criteria to  address provider availability in future years.

Because most Medicare beneficiaries pay their Part  B premium by having it withheld from their monthly Social Security  benefits, and because growth in Medicare premiums and cost sharing has  outpaced growth in Social Security benefits, beneficiaries and their  families may increasingly need to draw on other income or resources to  help pay for necessary medical care. Moving forward, it will be important  to find approaches that help avert or mitigate this growing financial  burden, particularly for those beneficiaries with high health care needs  and few economic resources. For example, understanding how  beneficiaries make medical decisions and what information would help  them identify and use providers that efficiently deliver appropriate, high- quality care could lead to savings for both beneficiaries and taxpayers.", "Our work has identified additional opportunities to improve how the  Medicare program ensures that beneficiaries, including those who are  also eligible for Medicaid, receive the appropriate services they need.", "Care for dual-eligible beneficiaries. The federal government, states,  and others have been focusing on care coordination as a key strategy for  improving the quality of care for dual-eligible beneficiaries\u2014individuals  who qualify for both Medicare and Medicaid\u2014while also reducing costs.  Dual-eligible beneficiaries, who are often in poorer health compared with  other Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries, typically receive benefits  through each program separately, which can lead to fragmented care due  to different program rules for receiving benefits and reimbursing  providers. In 2013, CMS began implementing the Financial Alignment  Demonstration to integrate Medicare and Medicaid services and  financing, and to improve coordination for dual-eligible beneficiaries.  While CMS established a framework of monitoring activities to oversee  the demonstration, the extent of care coordination is not entirely clear  from the information being collected. For example, CMS monitors two  core measures related to care coordination, but because these are being  used in only one of two models being tested in the demonstration, CMS  cannot compare the two demonstration models using these measures.  Similarly, demonstration states had state-specific measures that explored  aspects of care coordination, but they were not comparable across states.  We recommended, among other things, that CMS align existing state- specific measures of the extent to which individualized care plans are  being developed to make them comparable. The agency agreed with  this recommendation, and CMS officials said they plan to develop a care plan measure that more closely aligns specifications across  demonstrations, but data collection is not expected to begin until January  2018.", "Dual-eligible special needs plans. Special needs plans are MA private  plans designed to address the unique needs of certain Medicare  populations, and among these plans are those targeted specifically to  dual-eligible beneficiaries. CMS and Congress have taken steps to  coordinate care for those enrolled in dual-eligible special needs plans to  increase benefit integration and care coordination. For example, PPACA  established a type of plan referred to as a fully integrated dual-eligible  special needs plan, which is designed to integrate program benefits for  dual-eligible beneficiaries through a single managed care organization. In  addition, dual-eligible special needs plans that meet certain performance  and quality-based standards may seek CMS approval to offer benefits  beyond what other MA plans offer if such benefits would help bridge the  gap between Medicare- and Medicaid-covered services. Although a large  percentage of dual-eligible beneficiaries (43 percent in 2012) were under  age 65 and qualified for Medicare because they were disabled, we found  that few fully integrated dual-eligible special needs plans serve disabled  dual-eligible beneficiaries or report lower costs for Medicare services. In  addition, moderately better health outcomes for disabled dual-eligible  beneficiaries in dual-eligible special needs plans do not necessarily  translate into lower levels of costly Medicare services\u2014that is, inpatient  stays, readmissions, and emergency room visits.", "Access to preventive services. Over the past several years,  researchers have found that certain preventive services are effective in  early diagnosis or reduced prevalence of diseases that contribute to the  growth in Medicare spending. To encourage beneficiary use, PPACA  removed beneficiary cost-sharing requirements for many Medicare- covered preventive services, such as mammograms and colorectal  cancer screening. However, in our work we found that while Medicare  beneficiaries\u2019 use of some preventive services\u2014cardiovascular disease  screening and cervical cancer screening\u2014generally aligned with clinical  recommendations, the use of other preventive services, such as  osteoporosis screening and immunizations, did not. Medicare  beneficiaries who did not receive certain preventive services commonly  reported that they had limited information on prevention; had concerns  about discomfort, side effects, or efficacy; or their doctor did not  recommend the services. Furthermore, we found better use of preventive  services by beneficiaries is unlikely without appropriate Medicare  coverage. For instance, low use of some recommended services\u2014such  as osteoporosis screenings\u2014may result, in part, from limiting which  beneficiaries are covered or how frequently the service is covered.  Conversely, the absence of required cost sharing for certain services that  are not recommended, such as prostate-specific antigen testing for  prostate cancer for men aged 75 or older, may contribute to the  inappropriate use of those services. In 2012, we suggested Congress  require beneficiaries to share the cost when they receive services that the  U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends against."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Program Management", "paragraphs": ["CMS has overcome some challenges in managing the Medicare program  as it implemented some program improvements in recent years, including  a competitive bidding program for durable medical equipment (DME).

We had previously reported that  Medicare sometimes overpaid for DME items relative to other payers.  Congress required that CMS implement a competitive bidding program for  DME suppliers, which the agency began in 2009. In early assessments,  we found that beneficiary access and satisfaction appeared stable and  the competitive bidding program has led to savings. More recently in  2016, we found that the number of beneficiaries receiving DME items  covered under the competitive bidding program generally decreased after  implementation of phases of the program that began in July 1, 2013.  Available evidence from CMS\u2019s monitoring efforts indicates no  widespread effects on beneficiary access, but some beneficiary advocacy  groups have reported specific access issues, such as difficulty locating  contract suppliers and delays in delivery of DME items. Changes such as  expanding the program into additional competitive bidding areas; using  pricing from competitive bidding areas to set prices in non-competitive  bidding areas (which was fully phased in as of July 2016); and selecting  new contract suppliers for contracts for new rounds of bidding will provide  significant new data to further assess the effect of the program.  Continued monitoring of the competitive bidding program experience is  important to determine the full effects it may have on Medicare  beneficiaries and DME suppliers.", "Appeals process. Medicare has seen significant growth in the number of  appeals submitted by providers, beneficiaries, and others dissatisfied with  the program\u2019s decisions to deny or reduce payment for claims. The  Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) attributes the increase  in appeals to several factors, including for example, CMS\u2019s recent  increased focus on program integrity activities, which has resulted in  more denied claims and more appeals. In fiscal year 2014, Medicare  denied 128 million FFS claims, or 10.5 percent of claims submitted.  Medicare\u2019s administrative appeals process for FFS claims consists of 4  levels of review (Levels 1 through 4) and allows appellants who are  dissatisfied with decisions at one level to appeal to the next level, with  separate appeals bodies making decisions at each level. From fiscal year  2010 to 2014, the number of appeals at all levels of Medicare\u2019s  administrative appeals process increased significantly but varied by level.  The largest rate of increase (over 900 percent) was experienced at Level  3, in which cases are reviewed by administrative law judges. The large  volume of appeals has resulted in backlogs in decisions; in fiscal year  2014, more than 90 percent of Level 3 decisions were issued after the 90- day statutory time frame.", "We recommended that HHS take additional steps to improve its oversight  of the appeals process, including collecting more complete and consistent  data that would assist in monitoring efforts and addressing inefficiencies  in the way certain repetitious claims\u2014such as those for monthly oxygen equipment rentals\u2014are adjudicated. HHS has taken some actions to  reduce the backlog of appeals. For instance, CMS has offered  administrative agreements to eligible hospitals that are willing to withdraw  their pending appeals in exchange for timely partial payments, in order to  more quickly reduce the volume of claims pending in the appeals  process. As of August 2016, CMS has executed settlements amounting to  nearly $1.5 billion with 2,022 hospitals, representing approximately  346,000 claims that were in the appeals system. In September 2016,  CMS announced it would execute another round of settlements for  hospitals with inpatient claims in appeals.

CDRs are entities  that collect detailed information on the therapies that patients receive and  changes in their clinical condition over time in order to evaluate and  improve care practices and outcomes. In 2013, we recommended that  HHS adopt several key requirements to ensure qualified CDRs actually  improve the quality and efficiency of care that beneficiaries receive. For  example, CMS should require qualified CDRs to demonstrate  improvements on key measures of quality and efficiency for their target  population and establish a process for monitoring qualified CDRs\u2019  compliance with requirements. HHS should also enhance the effect of  qualified CDRs on quality and efficiency by making it easier to develop  them by promoting the use of health information technology. HHS  concurred with each of our recommendations, but also noted some  challenges it expects, for example in establishing a set of core measures  for qualified CDRs, as we recommended, given the number of clinical  specialties on which qualified CDRs may focus.

Medicare\u2019s monthly payments to physicians for  managing the care of home patients are often lower than those for  managing in-center patients, which may also discourage physicians from  prescribing home dialysis. Further, just a small fraction of Medicare  patients have used the Kidney Disease Education benefit\u2014which  provides pre-dialysis education and is designed to help patients make  informed decisions related to their treatment. Limited use of this benefit  may be due to statutory limitations on the types of providers who are  permitted to furnish the benefit and on the patients eligible to receive it.  We recommended that CMS examine and, if necessary, revise policies  for paying physicians to manage the care of dialysis patients, and  examine the Kidney Disease Education benefit, and if appropriate, seek  legislation to revise the categories of providers and patients eligible for  the benefit.

Although CMS and RA officials told  us that a demonstration of RA prepayment reviews was considered  successful, the agency disagreed with our recommendation to seek  authority to extend this ability and told us that other claim review  contractors conduct prepayment reviews and that CMS has implemented  other programs as part of its strategy to move away from the \u201cpay and  chase\u201d process of recovering overpayments. We continue to believe that  prepayment reviews better protect agency funds compared to  postpayment reviews, and that seeking the authority to allow RAs to  conduct prepayment reviews is consistent with CMS\u2019s strategy to pay  claims properly the first time. In not seeking the authority, CMS may be  missing an opportunity to reduce the amount of uncollectable  overpayments from RA reviews and save administrative resources  associated with recovering overpayments.

This federal-state program covered an estimated 72.2 million people in  fiscal year 2016 and is the largest health program as measured by  enrollment and the second largest as measured by expenditures, second  only to Medicare. A source of significant pressure on federal and state  budgets, estimated Medicaid outlays for fiscal year 2016 were $575.9  billion, of which $363.4 billion was financed by the federal government  and $212.5 billion by the states.", "Medicaid allows states significant flexibility to design and implement their  programs, resulting in more than 50 distinct programs; this variability  complicates program oversight and has contributed to challenges in  overseeing program payments and beneficiaries\u2019 access to services.  Each state Medicaid program, by law, must cover certain categories of  individuals and provide a broad array of benefits. Populations covered  include children in low-income families and low-income individuals who  are elderly, disabled, or are experiencing high medical needs. Medicaid\u2019s  extensive benefit package includes coverage for acute care services,  primary care services, long-term care services, and comprehensive  screening and treatment services for children.", "Within these broad parameters, however, states administer their own  programs, deciding whether to cover any health services or populations  beyond what are mandated by law, setting provider reimbursement rates,  and operating state-specific data systems to enroll eligible beneficiaries  and providers and to process and pay claims. For example, states may  pay health care providers for each service they provide on a fee-for-service (FFS) basis; contract with managed care organizations (MCO) to  provide a specific set of Medicaid-covered services to beneficiaries, and  pay them a set amount per beneficiary per month; or rely on a  combination of both delivery systems.", "Variability among state Medicaid programs also results from key Medicaid  reform efforts that states may initiate. For example, under Section 1115 of  the Social Security Act, the Secretary of Health and Human Services can  waive traditional Medicaid requirements and authorize states to expend  funds on Medicaid demonstrations to test new ways to deliver services.  State Medicaid programs also differ in whether and how they have  elected to expand Medicaid as allowed under the Patient Protection and  Affordable Care Act (PPACA), which gave states the option to expand  Medicaid eligibility to nearly all adults under age 65 with incomes up to  133 percent of the federal poverty level (hereafter referred to as newly  eligible adults). States that elected to expand Medicaid received 100  percent federal funding for this newly eligible population through 2016,  with the federal share declining to 90 percent for 2020 and subsequent  years. As of October 2016, 31 states and the District of Columbia had  opted to expand Medicaid eligibility under PPACA. In 2015, the Centers  for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) projected that total spending for  Medicaid will rise an average of 6.4 percent per year from 2015 to 2024  (see figure 19).", "States also vary in the extent to which they are affected by economic  downturns, which in turn can affect their Medicaid programs. The federal  government matches most state expenditures using a statutory formula  based in part on each state\u2019s per capita income. We and others have  noted that states\u2019 efforts to fund Medicaid can be challenged during  economic downturns, when Medicaid enrollment can rise and state  revenues can decline. To ensure that federal funding efficiently and  effectively responds to the program\u2019s countercyclical nature, we have  emphasized the need for timely and targeted federal assistance to  stabilize states\u2019 funding of Medicaid during such periods. Such  assistance would support states with declining revenues or increased  enrollment during a national economic downturn, further stabilizing the  financing of this important program.", "An overarching challenge for the Medicaid program is the lack of  accurate, complete, and timely data CMS needs to oversee the diverse  and complex state Medicaid programs.

In recent years, states have  increasingly relied on funds from providers and local governments to  finance the nonfederal share of Medicaid, with implications for federal  costs. While states finance the nonfederal share in large part through  state general funds, they also depend on other sources of funds, such as  taxes on health care providers and transfers of funds from local  governments. Our 2013 survey of states found that, in 2012, states  financed over one-quarter\u2014over $46 billion\u2014of the nonfederal share of  Medicaid with funds from health care providers and local governments, an  increase of over 21 percent since 2008 from these sources. Our work has  illustrated that by requiring providers to supply all or more of the  nonfederal share of Medicaid payments, states can claim an increase in  federal matching funds without a commensurate increase in state  expenditures. This shifts costs from the state to the federal government.", "Identifying the sources of nonfederal funds is essential to assessing their  effect; however, CMS does not collect complete or accurate information  on these sources of nonfederal funds. Apart from data on provider taxes  and donations, CMS does not require states to provide information on the  funds they use to finance Medicaid nor ensure that the data they do  collect are accurate and complete. This lack of transparency in states\u2019  sources of funding hinders CMS\u2019s ability to determine whether increasing  payments to providers provides fiscal relief to the state or whether  increasing payments to providers improves beneficiary access. Without  accurate information on how states finance their Medicaid programs,  CMS is also unable to ensure that states comply with federal  requirements. For instance, under federal law, at least 40 percent of the  state share must be from state funds, which includes state general funds,  provider taxes and donations, and transfers from other state agencies.  CMS disagreed with our recommendation to take action to improve the  information available on states\u2019 sources of the nonfederal share of  Medicaid payments. In 2015, legislation was introduced that would  require CMS to take such action.", "Oversight of payments to institutional providers. Over the years, we  and others have reported on CMS\u2019s oversight of payments that states  often make to institutional providers, such as hospitals and nursing  facilities, which have raised questions. In particular, concerns have been  raised about states making large Medicaid supplemental payments\u2014 payments in addition to the regular, claims-based payments made to  providers for services they provided\u2014often to government providers,  such as local government and state-operated hospitals and other health  care facilities. In fiscal year 2015, the latest date for which data are  available, these payments totaled about $55 billion. Supplemental  payments that result in total Medicaid payments well in excess of a  provider\u2019s costs raise questions about whether payments are consistent  with the statutory requirement that payments be economical and efficient  and are actually for covered Medicaid services.", "Among other concerns related to CMS oversight of supplemental  payments, we have found the agency lacks a policy and process for  determining whether payments made to individual providers are  economical and efficient, as required by law, and lacks clear guidance on  appropriate methods for states to distribute payments. For example, in  2015, we reported that three hospitals in New York received  supplemental payments that resulted in overall Medicaid payments to the  hospitals that greatly exceeded their cost of providing Medicaid services.", "CMS, in response, required New York to retroactively reduce  supplemental payments to the hospitals by more than $1.5 billion\u2014 including $771 million in federal funds\u2014over 4 years.", "Further, in a 2016 report, we found that selected states distributed  supplemental payments to hospitals largely based on the availability of  local government funds to finance the nonfederal share, rather than on  the volume of services each hospital provided. In addition, officials from  hospitals that received payments above costs reported using the excess  revenues from these supplemental payments broadly, from covering the  costs of uninsured patients to funding general hospital operations,  maintenance, and capital purchases, such as for a helicopter.", "Based on the findings from these reports, we have recommended that  CMS (1) clarify criteria for determining the economy and efficiency of  payments to individual providers, (2) issue guidance clarifying its policies  that supplemental payments should be linked to the provision of Medicaid  services and not be contingent on the availability of local financing, and  (3) require provider-specific reporting of certain types of supplemental  payments. In 2015, legislation was proposed that would require CMS to  collect provider-specific data on states\u2019 supplemental payments.

Federal spending for managed care in fiscal year 2014 was $107  billion, which accounted for over one-third of federal Medicaid spending  that year and represented a significant increase from 2013. Increased  enrollment and spending for Medicaid managed care makes effective  federal and state oversight of this large and complex component of the  Medicaid program critical, and underscores the need for reliable data to  assess the appropriateness of states\u2019 payments to MCOs and  beneficiaries\u2019 access to MCO services. In our work examining federal  expenditures for MCOs, we determined that state payments to MCOs in  2014 varied widely across and within 8 states as did the average annual  MCO payments per beneficiary, which ranged from $2,784 in California to  $5,180 in Pennsylvania. While this variation could be due, in part, to  differences in the enrolled population and geographic costs and utilization  patterns, it suggests the need to further examine the relationship between  higher MCO spending and beneficiaries\u2019 experiences.", "Further, federal law requires states to collect encounter data\u2014records of  health care services for which MCOs pay\u2014and submit these data to CMS  using MSIS. Having reliable encounter data that provides information on  service utilization is important as MCOs receive a fixed amount per  beneficiary regardless of the number of services used and therefore may  have financial incentives to limit beneficiaries\u2019 access to services.  However, in our work examining beneficiary utilization of services, we  could not fully assess utilization patterns for Medicaid managed care  beneficiaries in 19 states because MSIS data were either not available  (11 states) or were unreliable (8 states). In May 2016, CMS issued a  final rule for Medicaid managed care that includes provisions aimed at  improving Medicaid managed care encounter data submissions. For  example, for contracts with MCOs and limited benefit health plans  beginning on or after July 1, 2017, states are required to include  provisions regarding the maintenance of encounter data, and, by July 1,  2018, to have procedures in place to validate that the enrollee encounter  data these entities submit are complete and accurate."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Growing Expenditures for and Oversight of Large Medicaid Demonstrations", "paragraphs": ["Medicaid demonstrations have become a significant proportion of  Medicaid expenditures, growing steadily from about $50 billion, or about  14 percent of total Medicaid expenditures in fiscal year 2005, to $165  billion, or close to one-third of total Medicaid expenditures in fiscal year  2015. Section 1115 of the Social Security Act authorizes the Secretary  of HHS to waive certain federal Medicaid requirements and allow costs  that would not otherwise be eligible for federal matching funds for  experimental, pilot, or demonstration projects that are likely to assist in  promoting Medicaid objectives. The demonstrations can provide a way for  states to test and evaluate new approaches for delivering Medicaid  services. By policy, demonstrations should be budget neutral to the  federal government; that is, they must not increase federal costs. In July  2015, CMS changed its organizational structure and increased its staffing  to oversee section 1115 demonstrations and their growing role in the  Medicaid program, and we continue to assess CMS\u2019s approval and  oversight of spending for these demonstrations.", "Expenditure authorities in Medicaid demonstrations. Using its  authority under Section 1115 of the Social Security Act to approve costs  that would not otherwise be matchable under Medicaid, HHS has  approved Medicaid spending for a wide range of purposes beyond  extending coverage to new populations or for new benefits. For example,  HHS approved demonstrations that allowed 5 states to spend up to $9.5  billion to fund state health programs that were previously financed at least  in part by the state or potentially other federal programs. HHS also  approved 8 states to make more than $26 billion in supplemental  payments to hospitals and other providers. We found that HHS\u2019s criteria  and approval documents were not always clear as to how approved  spending would further Medicaid objectives. For example, some of these state programs appeared to be only tangentially related to  improving health outcomes for low-income individuals and lacked  documentation explaining how approving them would promote Medicaid  objectives. We also found that demonstration approvals sometimes  lacked assurances that demonstration spending would not duplicate other  federal funds received by states.", "In response to our work, HHS issued general criteria for determining  whether demonstrations met Medicaid objectives, which it had not  delineated before. HHS also committed to identifying in approval  documents how each expenditure authority promoted Medicaid objectives  and providing assurances that demonstration funds would not duplicate  other federal funds. While issuing the general criteria is a useful first step,  we maintain that given the breadth of the Secretary\u2019s authority under  section 1115\u2014the exercise of which can result in billions of dollars of  federal expenditures for costs that would not otherwise by allowed under  Medicaid\u2014more explicit criteria are needed.", "Budget neutrality of Medicaid demonstrations. We remain concerned  about the Secretary of HHS\u2019s lack of an adequate budget neutrality policy  including the criteria and process for reviewing and approving  demonstration spending limits and the lack of a written, up-to-date policy  that is readily available to state Medicaid directors and others. In multiple  reports, we have found that federal spending on Medicaid demonstrations  could be reduced by billions of dollars if HHS were required to improve  the process for reviewing, approving, and making transparent the basis  for spending limits approved for Medicaid demonstrations. For example,  in 2014, we reported that HHS had approved a spending limit for  Arkansas\u2019s demonstration\u2014to test whether providing premium assistance  to purchase private coverage through the health insurance exchange  would improve access for newly eligible Medicaid beneficiaries\u2014that was  based, in part, on hypothetical, not actual, costs. We estimated that by  allowing the state to use hypothetical costs, HHS approved a  demonstration spending limit that was over $775 million more than what it  would have been if it was based on the state\u2019s actual payment rates for  services under the traditional Medicaid program.", "Another troubling precedent is that HHS granted Arkansas and 11 other  states additional flexibility in their demonstrations to increase the  spending limit if costs proved higher than expected. Our report on  Arkansas was the latest in a series of reports showing significant  concerns with HHS\u2019s process for reviewing and approving spending  under demonstrations. For example, in 2013 we reported that, for 4 of 10  demonstrations we reviewed, HHS approved spending limits that  exceeded those that were supported in documentation and by HHS\u2019s own  policy by an estimated $32 billion. We have recommended that HHS (1)  better ensure that valid methods are used to demonstrate budget  neutrality, (2) clarify criteria for reviewing and approving demonstration  spending limits, (3) document and make public the basis for approved  spending limits, and (4) update its written budget neutrality policy to  reflect the actual criteria and processes used to develop and approve  demonstration spending limits.", "HHS has generally disagreed that changes to its policy and process are  needed. Congress has held hearings, sent letters to CMS, and proposed  legislation regarding how CMS reviews and approves demonstration  spending limits. Although HHS has not issued a written budget neutrality  policy as of October 2016, HHS has taken some steps to improve its  oversight, including issuing a report in October 2015 to Congress on  actions taken with respect to Medicaid demonstrations. The report  discussed some steps HHS has taken and planned to take to improve  access to program information and the transparency of its criteria for  approving expenditures. Further, in 2016 HHS took steps to change its  budget neutrality methodology that are intended to result in more  appropriate demonstration spending limits.

To help assess Medicaid enrollees\u2019 access to care, CMS  needs better data.", "Access to preventive, oral, and mental health services. The higher  prevalence of some health conditions among Medicaid beneficiaries  nationally that can be identified and managed by preventive services  suggests that more can and should be done to ensure Medicaid  beneficiaries receive these services. For example, states are required to  provide preventive services for children through the Early and Periodic  Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment (EPSDT) benefit. However,  national data collected by HHS suggest that Medicaid beneficiaries  receive these services at rates below established goals. In addition, our  2016 work showed that, due to variation across states in the scope,  functionality, and availability of resources on provider information,  Medicaid beneficiaries in FFS arrangements may face challenges in  identifying available providers in their respective states. State Medicaid  programs have also struggled to ensure that beneficiaries, particularly  children, receive appropriate oral health and mental health services when  needed. High rates of dental diseases remain prevalent across the nation,  especially in vulnerable and underserved populations. Medicaid  beneficiaries, children in particular, have increased their use of dental  services but still visited the dentist less often than privately insured  children. These visits are essential to preventing future high cost dental  services. Medicaid children may also have problems accessing mental  health providers and may not be receiving appropriate mental health  treatment and services.

SSA officials reported in October 2016 that the agency was developing an  initial product to deliver to three test sites focused on processing certain  fast-track claims. To address its priority goal of reducing the time for  hearing decisions, officials reported that SSA increased the number of  administrative law judges (ALJ) who decide appeals cases by 349 in  fiscal years 2015 and 2016\u2014about a 24 percent increase. In its plan to  address its appeals backlog, SSA noted that it is exploring ways to  improve ALJ hiring in difficult-to-staff locales, leverage SSA\u2019s Office of  Quality Review to obtain assistance with critical case processing  activities, and use judges from the Appeals Council to hold hearings on  some cases.

PBGC\u2019s financial future  remains uncertain, due in part to a long-term decline in the number of  traditional defined benefit plans and the collective financial risk of the  many underfunded pension plans that PBGC insures. We designated the  single-employer program as high risk in July 2003 and added the  multiemployer program in January 2009.", "Since fiscal year 2013, PGBC\u2019s financial deficits have more than doubled.  At the end of fiscal year 2016, PBGC\u2019s net accumulated financial deficit  was over $79 billion\u2014an increase of about $44 billion since 2013. At the  same time, PBGC estimated that its exposure to future losses for  underfunded plans was nearly $243 billion. The single-employer  program, composed of about 22,200 plans, accounted for $20.6 billion of  PBGC\u2019s overall deficit (see figure 21). The multiemployer program,  composed of only about 1,400 plans, accounted for about $59 billion.  According to PBGC, these dramatic increases were attributable to broad  economic factors and financial conditions of the plans PBGC insures.", "Various laws have been enacted to strengthen PBGC\u2019s financial position.

However, some of this legislation also included provisions that would allow single employer plan sponsors to defer mandatory  contributions to their defined benefit pension plans. To the extent that  sponsors reduce contributions in the short term, they may increase plan  underfunding and expose PBGC to greater risk. Recognizing the dramatic  increase in PBGC\u2019s deficit because of particular financial and  demographic challenges facing many multiemployer plans, the  Multiemployer Pension Reform Act of 2014 (MPRA) was enacted in  December 2014 with a number of provisions to promote the long-term  viability of the multiemployer program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["As with our last report in 2015, there is no rating for this high-risk area  because addressing the issues in this area primarily involves  congressional action, while the high-risk criteria and subsequent ratings  were developed to reflect the status of agencies\u2019 actions and the  additional steps they need to take.", "While PBGC faces a significant long-term challenge with its single- employer program, it faces an immediate and critical challenge with its  multiemployer program. In a 2013 report, we recommended that  Congress consider comprehensive and balanced structural reforms to   reinforce and stabilize the multiemployer system. In December 2014,  Congress took action to address the growing crisis in the multiemployer  pension system by passing MPRA, which enacted several reforms  responsive to our 2013 report on PBGC\u2019s multiemployer program.  Specifically, MPRA provided severely underfunded plans, under certain  conditions and only with the approval of federal regulators, the option to  reduce the retirement benefits of current retirees to avoid plan insolvency  and expanded PBGC\u2019s ability to intervene when plans are in financial  distress. In addition, MPRA doubled the premiums paid by  multiemployer plans (from $13 to $26 per participant). While these  reforms are intended to improve the program\u2019s financial condition,  projections suggest that the future insolvency of the multiemployer  program remains likely. Prior to passage of MPRA, PBGC estimated that  the multiemployer insurance fund would likely be exhausted by 2022 as a  result of current and projected plan insolvencies. PBGC officials noted  that the act did not fully address the crisis in the multiemployer program  and they predict that the changes will only forestall insolvency of the  program probably by about an additional 3 years. Current estimates  indicate that these changes will allow some plans to stay solvent and will  reduce the cumulative unmet need for financial assistance to  multiemployer plans by about half. As of January 2017, 10 pension plans  had submitted 11 applications to suspend benefits under MPRA. (4  applications have been denied, 2 were withdrawn, 4 are under review,  and 1 has been approved.) In addition, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013  and the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 increased premium rates for the  single-employer program.", "PBGC continues to face long-standing funding challenges for its single- employer insurance program as well, due to an overall decline in the  defined benefit pension system. While tens of thousands of companies  continue to offer traditional defined benefit plans, the total number of  plans has declined significantly, as has participation in those plans. Since  1985, there has been a 79 percent decline in the number of plans insured  by PBGC to 23,769 plans in 2014 and more than 11 million fewer workers  are actively participating in these plans. As a result, PBGC\u2019s premium  base has been eroding over time as fewer sponsors are paying premiums  for fewer participants.", "Additionally, the structure of PBGC\u2019s premium rates\u2014a key component of  PBGC\u2019s funding\u2014has long been another area of concern. Despite  periodic increases in premium rates, which are set according to statute,  the level of premiums has not kept pace with the magnitude and  multiplicity of risks that PBGC insures against. Moreover, plan  underfunding is the only risk factor currently considered in determining a  sponsor\u2019s premium rate. Since 2011, the administration has proposed  legislative reforms that would authorize the PBGC board to adjust  premiums and to explore designing a more risk-based premium structure.  Under the current premium structure for its single-employer program,  PBGC collects from sponsors a per-participant flat-rate premium and a  variable-rate premium that is based on a plan\u2019s level of underfunding. In  2012, we recommended that Congress consider authorizing a redesign of  PBGC\u2019s premium structure for single-employer plans to allow  incorporation of additional risk factors, such as consideration of a  sponsor\u2019s financial health. PBGC officials stated that they have continued  efforts to enhance understanding of alternative premium structures by  analyzing the limitations of the current system and by modeling various  alternative risk-based options. However, to date no legislation  incorporating additional risk factors into PBGC\u2019s premium structure has  been enacted.", "PBGC\u2019s governance structure is another area of weakness noted in  several of our past reports. In particular, we have long recommended that  PBGC\u2019s board\u2014currently composed of the Secretaries of the Treasury,  Commerce, and Labor\u2014be expanded to include additional members with  diverse backgrounds who possess knowledge and expertise useful to  PBGC\u2019s mission. This recommendation has not yet been enacted into  law, but MAP-21 included provisions to improve PBGC\u2019s governance by  prescribing in greater detail the working relationships between its Board  of Directors and its Inspector General, General Counsel, Advisory  Committee, and Director. It also called for the National Academy of  Public Administration (NAPA) to review PBGC\u2019s governance structure  and to report on the ideal size and composition of its board. In its  September 2013 report, NAPA recommended to Congress that if the  agency is provided greater responsibility over its policies, PBGC\u2019s board  should be expanded. Furthermore, we have long emphasized that  PBGC requires strong and stable leadership to ensure that it can meet its  future financial challenges.", "In August 2016, the Secretary of Labor provided updated information  related to several of these areas of concern. Regarding the long-term  financial stability of both insurance programs, the Secretary noted that the  President\u2019s 2017 budget again proposed that the PBGC Board be granted  the authority to adjust premiums, and with that authority directed the  Board to raise $15 billion in additional premium revenue from the  multiemployer program. With regard to the recommendation to improve  PBGC\u2019s governance structure, the PBGC Board has declined to pursue  the matter further absent authorizing legislation. PBGC has recently  established an Enterprise Risk Management function and plans to hire a  Risk Management Officer to identify and determine appropriate actions to  mitigate the risks identified.

VA\u2019s Veterans Health Administration (VHA)  operates one of the largest health care delivery systems in the nation,  with 168 medical centers and more than 1,000 outpatient facilities  organized into regional networks. VA has faced a growing demand by  veterans for its health care services\u2014due, in part, to servicemembers  returning from the United States\u2019 military operations in Afghanistan and  Iraq and the needs of an aging veteran population\u2014and that trend is  expected to continue. For example, the total number of veteran enrollees  in VA\u2019s health care system rose from 7.9 million to almost 9 million from  fiscal year 2006 through fiscal year 2016. Over that same period, VHA\u2019s  total budgetary resources have increased substantially, from $37.8 billion  in fiscal year 2006 to $91.2 billion in fiscal year 2016.", "Although VA\u2019s budget and the total number of medical appointments  provided have substantially increased for at least a decade, there have  been numerous reports in this same period of time\u2014by us, VA\u2019s Office of  the Inspector General, and others\u2014of VA facilities failing to provide timely  health care. In some cases, the delays in care or VA\u2019s failure to provide  care at all reportedly have resulted in harm to veterans. In response to  these serious and longstanding problems with VA health care, the  Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014 (Pub. L. No.  113-146, 128 Stat. 1754) was enacted, which provided temporary  authority and $10 billion in funding through August 7, 2017 (or sooner, if  those funds are exhausted) for veterans to obtain health care services  from community (non-VA) providers to address long wait times, lengthy  travel distances, or other challenges accessing VA health care. Under this  authority, VA introduced the Veterans Choice Program in November  2014. The $10 billion is meant to supplement VA\u2019s medical services  budget and is funded through a separate appropriations account, the  Veterans Choice Fund. The 2014 law also appropriated $5 billion to  expand VA\u2019s capacity to deliver care to veterans by hiring additional  clinicians and improving the physical infrastructure of VA\u2019s medical  facilities. agency officials projected a fiscal year 2015 funding gap of about $3  billion in its medical services appropriation account. The projected  funding gap was largely due to administrative weaknesses that slowed  the utilization of the Veterans Choice Program in fiscal year 2015 and  resulted in higher-than-expected demand for VA\u2019s previously established  VA community care programs. In particular, VA officials expected that the  Veterans Choice Program would absorb much of the increased demand  from veterans for health care services delivered by non-VA providers, but  instead the slow utilization resulted in veterans continuing to receive care  through previously established VA community care programs that drew  funds from VA\u2019s medical services appropriation account. To avoid a  projected funding gap in VA\u2019s medical services appropriation account, the  VA Budget and Choice Improvement Act provided VA temporary authority  to use up to $3.3 billion from the Veterans Choice Program appropriation  for obligations incurred for other specified medical services, starting May  1, 2015, until October 1, 2015.", "While timely and cost-effective access to needed health care services is  essential, care coordination between VA and community providers, and  between VA and the Department of Defense (DOD) (for transitioning  servicemembers), is also critical to preventing unfavorable health  outcomes for veterans. With the increased utilization of community  providers that has occurred as a result of the Veterans Access, Choice,  and Accountability Act, veterans are required to navigate multiple  complex health care systems\u2014the VA health care system and those of  community providers\u2014to obtain needed health care services. The quality  of veterans\u2019 care may be adversely affected if VA and community  providers do not promptly communicate important clinical information. In  addition, servicemembers transitioning from DOD to VA health care may  experience problems if, for example, VA inappropriately discontinues  medications, such as those for mental health conditions, because of a  lack of clarity in VA\u2019s medication continuation policy, potentially increasing  the risk for adverse health effects."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Overall, VA has partially met the criteria for leadership commitment and  an action plan to address the five areas of concern we identified when we  placed VA health care on our High-Risk List in 2015.

In this  manner, over time, the Program Manager and key departments track  milestones and adjust project baselines as needed. The status of  modifying milestones was documented in regular priority objective and  milestone updates. For instance, in cases where milestones were added,  such as under the Data Tagging and FICAM priority objectives, the  Program Manger noted that the new milestones were not creating  additional tasks. Rather, the new milestones were written at a finer level  of detail, which allowed departments and agencies to demonstrate  incremental progress that was not visible under the original milestones.  Milestones were deleted if stewards and stakeholders agreed that the  milestones were no longer relevant to accomplishing priority objectives.  The Program Manager and officials from key departments and agencies  generally agreed that the Implementation Plan and process used to track  and adjust priority objectives and milestones were effective, and we  reviewed documentation that justified the status determinations for  several milestones.", "Overall, the Program Manager and key departments have demonstrated  progress in advancing the ISE by using processes to track and assess  the status of priority objectives and milestones, and to make adjustments  if needed.
