The New Starts program serves as an important source of federal funding for the design and construction of transit projects throughout the country. SAFETEA-LU requires GAO to report each year on FTA's New Starts process. As such, GAO examined (1) the number of projects that were evaluated, rated, and proposed for FFGAs for the fiscal year 2007 evaluation cycle and the proposed funding commitments for the fiscal year 2007 budget; (2) procedural changes that FTA proposed for the New Starts program beginning with the fiscal year 2008 evaluation cycle; and (3) changes SAFETEA-LU made to the New Starts program and FTA's implementation of these changes. GAO reviewed New Starts documents and interviewed FTA officials and project sponsors, among other things, as part of its review. GAO is not making recommendations in this report. In commenting on a draft of this report, FTA provided technical clarifications, which we incorporated as appropriate."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["For the fiscal year 2007 evaluation cycle, FTA evaluated and rated 20 projects, recommended 5 projects for new FFGAs and 2 projects with pending FFGAs. FTA also identified 5 other projects that may be eligible for funding outside of FFGAs. The administration's fiscal year 2007 budget proposal requests $1.47 billion for the New Starts program, which is about $200 million more than the amount received last year. FTA proposed nine procedural, or nonregulatory, changes for the New Starts program beginning with the fiscal year 2008 evaluation cycle that were generally intended to improve the management of the New Starts process. These changes include linking the New Starts and National Environmental Policy Act planning requirements and processes and capping New Starts funding when projects enter the final design phase. As required by SAFETEA-LU, FTA published these proposals in policy guidance and sought public input. Members of the transit community supported changes that they thought would make the New Starts process more efficient, but many commenters expressed strong opposition to other changes, citing, for example, the time and resources required to analyze ridership and cost uncertainties. Consequently, FTA implemented only 4 of the proposed procedural changes, but indicated that a final decision on the other 5 proposed changes would be made through the rulemaking process. SAFETEA-LU introduced eight statutory changes to the New Starts program that include establishing the Small Starts program and identifying new evaluation criteria. FTA has taken some initial steps to implement these changes, including issuing an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) for the Small Starts program and proposed policy guidance for the New Starts program, both in January 2006. The Small Starts program is a new component of the New Starts program and is intended to offer an expedited and streamlined application and review process for small projects. The transit community, however, questioned whether the Small Starts program, as outlined in the ANPRM, would provide such a process. In July 2006, FTA introduced a new eligibility category called Very Small Starts, which is for the simplest and least costly projects. Very Small Starts projects will qualify for an even simpler and more expedited evaluation process. FTA also identified and sought public input on possible changes to the New Starts program that would have an impact on traditional New Starts projects, such as revising the evaluation process to incorporate the new evaluation criteria identified by SAFETEA-LU. According to FTA, a potential challenge in moving forward is incorporating both land use and economic development as separate criteria in the evaluation process, including developing appropriate measures for the criteria and avoiding duplication in counting benefits."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Fixed guideway systems use and occupy a separate right-of-way for the exclusive use of  public transportation services.

For that reason, SAFETEA-LU, like TEA-21, directs FTA  to continue to prioritize projects for funding by evaluating, rating, and  recommending potential projects on the basis of specific financial and  project justification criteria including mobility improvements, cost- effectiveness, environmental benefits, and operating efficiencies.  However, SAFETEA-LU made several changes to the New Starts  evaluation and rating process, including identifying a new eligibility  category for smaller fixed guideway projects and establishing new  evaluation criteria. FTA is currently implementing these changes.", "SAFETEA-LU also requires us to report each year on FTA\u2019s processes and  procedures for evaluating, rating, and recommending New Starts projects  for funding and on FTA\u2019s implementation of these processes and  procedures.

To address these objectives, we  reviewed SAFETEA-LU; FTA guidance and regulations governing the New  Starts program; and other relevant FTA documents, including the annual  New Starts report. We also interviewed FTA officials, project sponsors  from five projects in preliminary engineering and final design that were  rated in the fiscal year 2007 evaluation cycle, and representatives from the  American Public Transportation Association and the New Starts Working  Group.

The New Starts program serves as an important source of federal funding  for the design and construction of transit projects throughout the country.  FTA generally funds New Starts projects through FFGAs, which establish  the terms and conditions for federal participation in a New Starts project  and also define a project\u2019s scope, including the length of the system and  the number of stations; its schedule, including the date when the system is  expected to open for service; and its cost.", "For a project to obtain an FFGA, it must progress through a local or  regional review of alternatives and meet a number of federal requirements,  including requirements for information used in the New Starts evaluation  and rating process (see fig. 1). As required by SAFETEA-LU, New Starts  projects must emerge from a regional, multimodal transportation planning  process. The first two phases of the New Starts process\u2014systems  planning and alternatives analysis\u2014address this requirement. The systems  planning phase identifies the transportation needs of a region, while the  alternatives analysis phase provides information on the benefits, costs,  and impacts of different corridor-level options, such as rail lines or bus  routes. The alternatives analysis phase results in the selection of a locally  preferred alternative\u2014which is intended to be the New Starts project that  FTA evaluates for funding, as required by statute. After a locally preferred  alternative is selected, project sponsors submit a request to FTA for entry  into the preliminary engineering phase. Following completion of  preliminary engineering and federal environmental requirements, the  project may be approved by FTA to advance into final design, after which  the project may be approved by FTA for an FFGA and proceed to  construction, as provided for in statute. FTA oversees grantee  management of projects from the preliminary engineering phase through  construction and evaluates the projects for advancement into each phase  of the process, as well as annually for the New Starts report to Congress.", "To help inform administration and congressional decisions about which  projects should receive federal funds, FTA assigns ratings on the basis of  various financial and project justification criteria, and then assigns an  overall rating. For the fiscal year 2007 evaluation cycle, FTA primarily  used the financial and project justification criteria identified in TEA-21.  These criteria reflect a broad range of benefits and effects of the proposed  project, such as cost-effectiveness, as well as the ability of the project  sponsor to fund the project and finance the continued operation of its  transit system (see fig. 2).

FTA evaluated and rated fewer projects during the fiscal year  2007 cycle than in fiscal year 2006. According to FTA, this decrease  occurred because 12 proposed projects are no longer in preliminary  engineering or final design. FTA stated in its annual report that the  sponsors of these projects have either (1) fully implemented the project;  (2) received the total New Starts funding requested to implement the  project; (3) terminated or suspended project development activities; (4)  withdrawn from the New Starts process while they address outstanding  issues; or (5) decided not to pursue New Starts funding.", "Of the 20 projects that were rated in the fiscal year 2007 evaluation cycle, 1  was rated as \u201chigh,\u201d 17 were rated as \u201cmedium,\u201d and 2 were rated as \u201clow.\u201d  Under TEA-21, during fiscal years 2000 through 2006, FTA designated  projects as highly recommended, recommended, or not recommended,  based on the results of FTA\u2019s evaluation of each of the criteria for project  justification and local financial commitment. SAFETEA-LU replaced this  rating scale with a 5-point scale of high, medium-high, medium, medium- low, and low. To help transition to the new rating scale, FTA used a   3-point scale of high, medium, and low for the fiscal year 2007 evaluation  cycle, but used the same decision rules to determine overall project ratings  as it did in previous years (see table 1). According to FTA officials, FTA  intends to work closely with the industry to implement the SAFETEA-LU  provisions so that they can be applied in subsequent annual project  evaluation cycles. In addition, FTA\u2019s current schedule anticipates that the  final rule will be completed in time to use the 5-point scale for the fiscal  year 2010 evaluation cycle.", "FTA\u2019s evaluation process informed the administration\u2019s recommendation  to fund 12 projects. FTA recommended five projects for new FFGAs. The  total capital cost of these five projects is estimated to be $3.3 billion, of  which the total federal New Starts share is expected to be $1.9 billion. In  addition, FTA recommended funding for two projects with pending  FFGAs. The total capital cost of these two projects is estimated to be $8.2  billion, of which the total federal New Starts share is expected to be $2.8  billion. FTA also recommended reserving $101.9 million in New Starts  funding for five \u201cother projects.\u201d In its annual report, FTA stated that four  of the five other projects (1) were in or nearing final design, (2) received  overall medium or higher ratings, and (3) had medium or better cost- effectiveness ratings, or (4) were exempt from the requirement to achieve  a medium cost-effectiveness rating. According to FTA, no other project in  preliminary engineering or final design met these criteria. The fifth  project\u2014Washington, D.C., Largo Metrorail Extension\u2014did not meet  these criteria but was congressionally designated for funding in SAFETEA- LU. Similar to last year, FTA did not specify funding levels for the five  other projects because it wanted to ensure that the projects were moving  forward as anticipated before making specific funding recommendations  to Congress. FTA also notes in its annual report that some projects may  encounter unexpected obstacles that slow their progress. For example,  FTA stated that some of the projects must still complete the  environmental planning process and address FTA-identified concerns  related to capital costs or project scope. Reserving funds for these projects  without specifying a particular amount for any given project will allow the  administration to make \u201creal time\u201d funding recommendations when  Congress is making appropriations decisions.

For example, the  commenters were generally supportive of FTA\u2019s proposal to require  sponsors to keep and update the information produced during alternatives  analysis prior to each phase of project development until the FFGA is  awarded, since this information is necessary for the before-and-after  study. In contrast, most project sponsors and transit industry groups  opposed FTA\u2019s proposed certification of technical methods, planning  assumptions, and project development procedures, citing concerns that  such a certification would raise questions about professional liability and  lead to potential federal prosecution, and noting that a single individual is  typically not responsible for producing all the underlying assumptions  used to develop cost estimates and ridership forecasts. On the basis of the  comments received, FTA adopted four proposals, including the mandatory  completion of NEPA scoping before entry into preliminary engineering  (PE), the presentation of the New Starts information in the NEPA  documents, the preservation of information for the before and after study,  and the capping of New Starts funds upon approval into final design. For  two of the four adopted proposals, FTA slightly revised its original  proposals on the basis of the comments received. FTA did not adopt five  proposals; however, FTA noted that it may revisit these proposed changes  in the future.", "More recently, FTA hired a consulting firm to conduct an assessment of  the New Starts project development process. According to FTA\u2019s Deputy  Administrator, the impetus for the review is to streamline the project  development process while still ensuring that projects recommended for  funding are delivered in a timely manner and stay within budget. We have  previously reported that project sponsors have raised concerns about the  number of changes FTA has made to the New Starts process, such as  requiring project sponsors to prepare risk assessments, and the time and  cost associated with implementing these changes.

Specifically, SAFETEA-LU continues to require that the federal share for a  New Starts project may be up to 80 percent of the project\u2019s net capital  project cost, unless the project sponsor requests a lower amount, and  prohibits the Secretary of Transportation from requiring a nonfederal  share of more than 20 percent of the project\u2019s total net capital cost. This  language changes FTA\u2019s policy of rating a project as low if it seeks a  federal New Starts share of more than 60 percent of the total cost.

FTA will continue to implement the changes outlined in  SAFETEA-LU through the rule-making process over the next 1\u00bd years.

In its ANPRM, FTA suggested that the planning and  project development process for proposed Small Starts projects could be  simplified by allowing analyses of fewer alternatives for small projects,  allowing the development of evaluation measures for mobility and cost- effectiveness without the use of complicated travel demand modeling  procedures in some cases, and possibly defining some classes of  preapproved low-cost improvements as effective and cost-effective in  certain contexts. FTA also sought the transit community\u2019s input on three  key issues in its ANPRM, including eligibility, the rating and evaluation  process, and the project development process. For each of these issues,  FTA outlined different options for how to proceed and then posed  questions for public comment.", "FTA\u2019s ANPRM for Small Starts generated a significant volume of public  comment. Members of the transit community were supportive of some  proposals for the Small Starts program, but also had a number of  concerns. In particular, the transit community questioned whether FTA\u2019s  proposals would, as intended, provide smaller projects with a more  streamlined evaluation and rating process. As a result, some commenters  recommended that FTA simplify some of its original proposals in the  NPRM to reflect the smaller scope of these projects. For example, several  project sponsors and industry representatives thought that FTA should  redefine the baseline alternative as the \u201cno-build\u201d option and make the  before-and-after study optional for Small Starts projects to limit the time  and cost of their development. In addition, others were concerned that  FTA\u2019s proposals minimized the importance of the new land use and  economic development evaluation criteria introduced by SAFETEA-LU,  and they recommended that the measures for land use and economic  development be revised.", "Since FTA does not plan to issue its final rule for the New Starts and Small  Starts programs until early 2008, FTA issued final interim guidance for the  Small Starts program in July 2006 to ensure that project sponsors would  have an opportunity to apply for Small Starts funding and proposed  projects could be evaluated in the upcoming cycle (i.e., the fiscal year 2008  evaluation cycle). The final interim guidance describes the process that  FTA plans to evaluate proposed Small Starts projects to support (1) the  decision to approve or disapprove their advancement to project  development and (2) decisions on project construction grant agreements,  including whether proposed projects are part of a broader strategy to  reduce congestion. In addition, FTA introduced a separate eligibility  category within the Small Starts program for \u201cVery Small Starts\u201d projects  in the final interim guidance. Small Starts projects that qualify as Very  Small Starts are projects that have all of the following elements:    have substantial transit stations;  include traffic signal priority and preemption, where appropriate;   provide low-floor vehicles or level boarding;  include branding of the proposed service;   offer 10 minute peak and 15 minute off-peak headways or better while  operating at least 14 hours per weekday;   are in corridors with existing riders who will benefit from the proposed  project and number more than 3,000 on an average weekday; and   have a total capital cost of less than $50 million (including all project  elements) and less than $3 million per mile (excluding rolling stock).", "According to the final interim guidance, FTA intends to scale the planning  and project development process to the size and complexity of the  proposed projects. Therefore, Very Small Starts projects will undergo a  very simple and streamlined evaluation and rating process. For instance,  according to the guidance, Very Small Starts projects are cost-effective  and produce land use and economic development benefits commensurate  with their costs; thus, if a project meets the Very Small Starts eligibility  criteria, it will automatically receive \u201cmedium\u201d ratings for land use and  cost-effectiveness. Small Starts projects that do not meet all of the criteria  for Very Small Starts projects will be evaluated and rated using a  framework similar to that used for traditional New Starts projects, with  the exception that fewer measures are required and their development is  simplified. In particular, FTA\u2019s evaluation and rating process for Small  Starts will diverge from the traditional New Starts process in several ways.  For example,  the project\u2019s cost-effectiveness will be rated based on a shorter time frame  (i.e., opening year);   other technically acceptable ridership forecasting procedures, besides  traditional \u201cfour-step\u201d travel demand models can be used; the opening year\u2019s estimate of user benefits will be adjusted upward when  determining a project\u2019s cost-effectiveness; the financial and land use reporting requirements have been simplified;  and the project\u2019s economic development benefits and inclusion in a congestion  reduction strategy will be considered an \u201cother factor\u201d in the evaluation  process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FTA Also Identified Possible Changes to the New Starts Program in Response to SAFETEA-LU as Well as Implementation Challenges", "paragraphs": ["In response to SAFETEA-LU, FTA identified possible changes to the New  Starts program that would affect traditional New Starts projects in its  January 2006 guidance. According to FTA, some SAFETEA-LU provisions  could lead to changes in the definition of eligibility, the evaluation and  rating process, and the project development process. (See app. II for a  description of the different changes FTA is considering.) In the guidance,  FTA outlined changes it is considering and solicited public input, through  a series of questions, on the potential changes. For example, FTA  identified two options for revising the evaluation and rating process to  reflect SAFETEA-LU\u2019s changes to the evaluation criteria. The first option  would extend the current process to include economic development  impacts and the reliability of cost and ridership forecasts. (See fig. 6.)", "Specifically, FTA suggested that economic development impacts and the  reliability of forecasts simply be added to the list of criteria considered in  developing the project justification rating. The second option would be to  develop a broader process to include the evaluation criteria identified by  SAFETEA-LU and to organize the measures to support a more analytical  discussion of the project and its merits. (See fig. 7.) According to FTA, the  second option would broaden the evaluation process beyond a  computation of overall ratings based on individual evaluation measures  and develop better insights into the merit of a project than are possible  from using the quantified evaluation measures alone. In addition, the  second option would also consider the major uncertainties associated with  any of the information used to evaluate the project, such as ridership  forecasts, cost estimates, projected land use, and other assumptions.  According to FTA, understanding a project\u2019s uncertainties is needed for  informed decision making.", "In its guidance, FTA also identified potential challenges in implementing  some SAFETEA-LU changes. In particular, FTA described the challenges  of incorporating and distinguishing between two measures of indirect  benefits in the New Starts evaluation process\u2014land use and economic  development impacts. For example, FTA noted that its current land-use  measures (e.g., land-use plans and policies) indicate the transit- friendliness of a project corridor both now and in the future, but do not  measure the benefits generated by the proposed project. Rather, the  measures describe the degree to which the project corridor provides an  environment in which the proposed project can succeed. According to  FTA\u2019s guidance, FTA\u2019s evaluation of land use does not include economic  development benefits because FTA has not been able to find reliable  methods of predicting these benefits. FTA further stated that because  SAFETEA-LU introduces a separate economic development criterion, the  potential role for land use as a measure of development benefits becomes  even less clear, given its potential overlap with the economic development  criterion. In addition, FTA noted that many economic development  benefits result from direct benefits (e.g., travel time savings), and  therefore including them in the evaluation could lead to double counting  the benefits FTA already measures and uses to evaluate projects.  Furthermore, FTA noted that some economic development impacts may  represent transfers between regions rather than a net benefit for the  nation, raising questions of whether these impacts are useful for a  national comparison of projects. To address some of the challenges, FTA  suggested that an appropriate strategy might be combining land use and  economic development into a single measure.", "In our January 2005 report on the costs and benefits of highway and transit  investments, we identified many of the same challenges of measuring and  forecasting indirect benefits, such as economic development and land-use  impacts. For example, we noted that it is challenging to predict changes  in land use because current transportation demand models are unable to  predict the effect of a transportation investment on land-use patterns and  development, since these models use land-use forecasts as inputs into the  model. In addition, we noted that certain benefits are often double  counted when evaluating transportation projects. In particular, indirect  benefits, such as economic development, may be more correctly  considered transfers of direct user benefits or economic activity from one  area to another. Therefore, estimating and adding such benefits to direct  benefits could constitute double counting and lead to overestimating a  project\u2019s benefits. Despite these challenges, experts told us that evaluating  land use and economic development impacts is important since they often  drive local transportation investment choices. To help overcome some of  the challenges, experts suggested several potential solutions, including  using qualitative information about the benefits rather than relying strictly  on quantitative information and expanding the use of risk assessment or  probability analysis in conjunction with economic analysis. For example,  weather forecasters talk about the probability of rain rather than  suggesting that they can accurately predict what will happen. This  approach could illustrate that projects with similar rates of return have  very different risk profiles and different probabilities of success. FTA\u2019s  second option for revising the New Starts evaluation process, which would  consider qualitative information about the project and the project\u2019s  uncertainties, appear to be in line with these suggestions.", "FTA received a large number of written comments on its online docket in  response to its proposed changes. (See app. II for common comments  submitted for each proposed change.) While members of the transit  community were supportive of some proposals, they expressed concerns  about a number of FTA\u2019s proposed changes. For example, a number of  commenters expressed concerns about FTA\u2019s options for revising the  evaluation process, noting that both proposals deemphasized the  importance of economic development and land use. For example, as  described in FTA\u2019s January 2006 guidance, land use would receive less  weight in calculating the overall project rating in both proposals than it  receives in the current process. Some commenters also noted that land use  and economic development should not be combined into a single measure  and that they should receive the same weight as cost-effectiveness in the  evaluation and rating process. These commenters argued that combining  land use and economic development into a single measure or assigning  them less weight than cost-effectiveness serves to deemphasize these  benefits."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["FTA\u2019s New Starts program is in a period of transition. SAFETEA-LU made  a number of significant changes to the program, and FTA is off to a good  start in implementing these changes. Tough decisions and implementation  challenges remain, however. For example, FTA must determine how to  incorporate economic development into the evaluation process and  implement the Small Starts program in the upcoming evaluation cycle.  Through the issuance of the final interim guidance on the Small Starts  program, FTA has acted to provide a streamlined evaluation process for  small projects by simplifying the evaluation measures and introducing the  Very Small Starts eligibility category. As the Small Starts program is  implemented in the upcoming cycle, FTA officials will have the  opportunity to determine whether the Small Starts program is sufficiently  streamlined and whether the streamlined evaluation process provides  adequate information to differentiate among projects for funding  purposes. FTA will also have the opportunity to make necessary  modifications to the Small Starts program as it learns through its  experience in implementing the program and working to develop the final  rule. Thus, the coming months will be a critical period for the New Starts  program, as FTA works through these remaining decisions and  implementation challenges to fully incorporate SAFETEA-LU changes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Department of Transportation,  including FTA, for review and comment.

We selected these projects  because they represent different phases of project development  (preliminary engineering and final design), received different overall  project justification and finance ratings, varied in size based on the  project\u2019s total capital cost, received different levels of New Starts funding,  and are geographically diverse. We obtained this information from FTA\u2019s  annual New Starts report for fiscal year 2007. Our interviews were  designed to gain project sponsors\u2019 perspectives on three main topics,  including the impact of FTA\u2019s proposed changes to the New Starts  application and project development process during the fiscal year 2008  evaluation cycle, FTA\u2019s implementation of the newly established Small  Starts program, and FTA\u2019s plans to align and revise its evaluation and  ratings process with the changes required by the Safe, Accountable,  Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users  (SAFETEA-LU). Specifically, we asked for their opinions on how FTA  plans to measure and weight new criteria in its evaluation framework. We  provided all project sponsors with a list of topics and questions prior to  our interviews, and we reviewed the comments they submitted to FTA\u2019s  docket.
