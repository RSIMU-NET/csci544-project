The federal government plays a more limited, indirect role by targeting federal funding to poor students and by encouraging states through the use of incentives in the Improving America\u2019s Schools Act of 1994 to equalize funding among their school districts."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The federal government\u2019s main role in elementary and secondary education since the 1960s has been to target federal funding toward services for educationally disadvantaged children through categorical, program-specific grants. The largest single federal elementary and secondary education grant program, which began in 1965, is title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. This program continues to serve educationally disadvantaged children through program-specific grants. The fiscal year 1997 appropriation for the disadvantaged was $7.3 billion.", "The federal role in funding elementary and secondary education has traditionally been limited, however, with state and local governments providing most funding. The federal government funds only about 7 percent of total national education funding, with states and local governments funding nearly an equal share of the remaining funding. Individual states\u2019 share of funding, however, varies considerably. State contributions in the 1991-92 school year ranged from 8 percent of total (state and local) funding in New Hampshire to 85 percent of total funding in New Mexico.", "The federal government does target funds to disadvantaged and poor students. As we reported in our study of targeting to poor students,although federal dollars make up only a small part of total national funding of elementary and secondary education, the effect of adding federal funds to state funds increased the targeting of funds to poor students by 77 percent in school year 1991-92. Moreover, 64 percent of poor children attended public schools in 21 states that had significant funding gaps between poor and wealthy districts, according to our study. To the extent that poor students live in poor districts, federal funds help to reduce the effect of tax base disparities among districts. Although the number of poor students in a district tends to increase as district wealth declines, the increase is not great.", "States\u2019 ability to fund education can vary considerably, depending on states\u2019 income levels, the number of children enrolled in public school, and the number of children requiring additional services, such as special programs for disabled or poor children. States with higher income levels can afford to finance higher levels of education funding per pupil. In the 1991-92 school year, states\u2019 average income per weighted pupil ranged from $41,385 in Utah to $160,761 in New Jersey. States\u2019 numbers of poor students or those with disabilities that require additional educational needs vary widely. For example, the rate of student poverty ranged from about 33 percent in Mississippi to about 6 percent in New Hampshire in 1990.", "In addition, localities\u2019 ability to raise funding for education varies widely. Among the nation\u2019s almost 16,000 school districts, most receive local funds for education mainly through property taxes and, to a lesser extent, through local sales and income taxes. This reliance on the local property tax to raise revenue, coupled with large differences in local tax base wealth, accounts for relatively large funding gaps between wealthy and poor districts. Localities with low tax base wealth usually have low funding per pupil even with high tax rates; localities with high property values have high funding per pupil even with low tax rates.", "Since the 1970s, these funding disparities have resulted in lawsuits in more than 40 states challenging the constitutionality of the state school finance system. More than half of the state systems have been challenged in court since 1990; in almost half of these cases, states have subsequently implemented changes designed to make the finance system more equitable.", "In contrast to the federal commitment to funding services for educationally disadvantaged children, the federal government has played only a small part in encouraging states to develop equitable finance systems. Federal policy encouraging states to equalize their finance systems appears in two programs of the Improving America\u2019s Schools Act of 1994, which reauthorized the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA). Both programs use performance indicators focusing only on the size of funding gaps and not on a state\u2019s effort to equalize funding among districts.", "The first program, title VIII Impact Aid, allows states that the Secretary of Education certifies as meeting an equity in education funding standard to take steps to prevent impact aid payments to local school districts from undermining state equalization efforts. This provision is intended to prevent impact aid from hindering states\u2019 equalization efforts and duplicative compensation of school districts affected by federal activity (once by the federal government through impact aid and a second time by the state\u2019s equalization program). The effect of the provision is to encourage states to equalize education funding. States that do not pass the equalization test may not consider impact aid payments as local revenue in determining state funding.", "The second program, the title I Education Finance Incentive program, has not yet been funded but would award additional federal money to states depending on the degree of fiscal effort and funding equity achieved. Supporters of this program suggest that if a state\u2019s spending for education increases and spending disparities among a state\u2019s districts decrease, title I funds can be more effectively allocated to provide disadvantaged children the additional resources they need.

When these authorities seek voter approval, district residents may choose taxes for education by voting for or against property tax rate increases tied to general levies or specific levies such as initiatives to improve school technology.", "States also make policies affecting local taxes. Since the 1970s, states have increased their direct control of districts\u2019 tax efforts. For example, some states mandate a certain tax rate or impose a minimum or maximum tax rate on districts to ensure that districts contribute a certain share toward their students\u2019 education.

Specifically, a state\u2019s equalization effort measures the portion of the state\u2019s average funding per pupil that state aid would enable all districts to finance with an equal tax effort.

To make up for the loss of local revenue, the state sharply increased its share of funding from 33 to 59 percent between school years 1991-92 and 1995-96. The new state funding formula included a new base funding level per student and allowed for adjustments to the base to account for (1) student needs, such as those for special education, poverty, and English as a second language, and (2) district needs, such as transportation costs and teacher costs based on teacher experience. The state share of funding for an individual district equaled the base funding level adjusted for student and district needs less the revenue the district could raise locally at the mandatory tax rate.", "Initially, under the new state finance system, total revenue in the wealthiest districts would have decreased significantly; revenue in the poorest districts would have greatly increased.

Thus, almost no change occurred in the relative tax effort of both poor and wealthy districts, ensuring that the state\u2019s increased equalization effort would reduce the funding gap.", "Under the new finance system, although all Oregon districts received more state aid, a smaller share of the increased state aid was targeted to poor districts.

Between school years 1991-92 and 1995-96, about 66 percent of the $1,717 increase in state funding per weighted pupil was needed to replace the wealthiest districts\u2019 loss of $1,132 per weighted pupil in local funding.

Although this change in tax effort would normally widen the funding gap between poor and wealthy districts, this was prevented in part because the wealthy districts were required to remit their excess local revenue for distribution as state aid to less wealthy districts. In addition, even though the state gave districts the choice of raising their property tax rates enough to increase their spending levels up to 25 percent above the base budget, limiting this additional spending allowed the state to maintain control over district spending levels.

In contrast, the wealthiest districts received an additional $597 per weighted pupil in state aid, an increase of only about 32 percent. The wealthiest group included 10 districts that received no state aid in school year 1995-96 and instead had to remit about $34 million in excess local revenue to the state.

This option would be difficult to implement, however, because the statewide minimum effort must be at least equal to the tax effort of the state\u2019s wealthiest districts; a lower tax effort by poor compared with wealthy districts would exacerbate funding gaps. The state would have to regularly monitor district tax efforts statewide and, if necessary, raise the minimum effort to lessen the funding gaps.", "For the federal government, the difficulty is determining whether federal programs encouraging equalization should continue to focus only on reduced funding gaps between poor and wealthy districts or whether these programs should also consider the extent to which state policies are responsible for reducing those gaps. Two federal programs with equalization components operate to effectively reward a state for reducing funding gaps even if the state has not made much effort to equalize funding. Some states with low funding gaps have accomplished this outcome in part through extraordinary taxpayer effort in the poorest school districts.", "To encourage states to increase their equalization effort and reduce funding gaps among districts, federal policymakers could use both a performance indicator of state equalization effort and an indicator of funding gaps to reward states for their performance. To encourage states to increase their equalization effort, regardless of its impact on funding gaps, federal policymakers could replace the performance indicator of a state\u2019s funding gap with one that measures only state efforts to equalize funding. In either case, a performance indicator of state equalization efforts used in combination with or instead of an indicator of funding gaps would better ensure that federal policy rewards those states whose funding policies lead to greater funding equity."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Matter for Congressional Consideration", "paragraphs": ["If federal policymakers want to encourage greater state efforts to reduce funding gaps between poor and wealthy districts, then the Congress may wish to consider establishing additional incentives or incentives different from those that federal programs now have."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Education provided written comments and suggested changes on a draft of this report (see app. VI). We revised our report on the basis of these comments and suggestions as they related to federal education programs when applicable.", "The Department said that this report provides important information on how well state funding is targeted to poor school districts. In addition, the Department noted, as we have shown in an earlier report, School Finance: State and Federal Efforts to Target Poor Students (GAO/HEHS-98-36, Jan. 28, 1998), that federal funds are more targeted to poor students than state funds and that federal education funding plays an important role in improving equity. Department officials said, however, that a federal policy with financial incentives for encouraging states to equalize funds would probably be insufficient without a substantial increase in funding for the title I and Impact Aid programs. In addition, they said that such a policy pursued under title I Education Finance Incentive Grants would shift funds from high-poverty states to low-poverty states under the current formula.", "We acknowledge that this redistribution of funds between states could occur under the current title I Education Finance Incentive Grant formula. In two previous reports, Remedial Education: Modifying Chapter 1 Formula Would Target More Funds to Those Most in Need (GAO/HRD-92-16, July 28, 1992) and School Finance: Options for Improving Measures of Effort and Equity in Title I (GAO/HEHS-96-142, Aug. 30, 1996), we provided suggestions to the Congress on how to improve targeting to states with high numbers of poor students. If those suggestions were adopted along with a performance measure encouraging states to increase equalization effort as suggested in this report, better equalization could be encouraged with the result of more funding to high-poverty states."], "subsections": []}]}]}], "fastfact": []}
