FMD is the most highly infectious animal disease that is known. Nearly 100 percent of exposed animals become infected. A single outbreak of FMD on the U.S. mainland could have significant economic consequences. Concerns have been raised about moving FMD research off its island location and onto the U.S. mainland--where it would be in closer proximity to susceptible animal populations--as opposed to building a new facility on the island. GAO was asked to evaluate the evidence DHS used to support its decision that FMD work can be done safely on the U.S. mainland, whether an island location provides any additional protection over and above that provided by modern high containment laboratories on the mainland, and the economic consequences of an FMD outbreak on the U.S. mainland. In preparing this testimony, GAO interviewed officials from DHS and USDA, talked with experts in FMD and high-containment laboratories worldwide, and reviewed studies on FMD, high-containment laboratories, and the economic consequences of FMD outbreaks. GAO also visited the Plum Island Animal Disease Center and other animal biocontainment laboratories in other countries."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO found that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)has neither conducted nor commissioned any study to determine whether work on foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) can be done safely on the U.S. mainland. Instead, in deciding that work with FMD can be done safely on the mainland, DHS relied on a 2002 U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) study that addressed a different question. The study did not assess the past history of releases of FMD virus or other dangerous pathogens in the United States or elsewhere. It did not address in detail the issues of containment related to large animal work in BSL-3 Ag facilities. It was inaccurate in comparing other countries' FMD work experience with that of the United States. Therefore, GAO believes DHS does not have evidence to conclude that FMD work can be done safely on the U.S. mainland. While location, in general, confers no advantage in preventing a release, location can help prevent the spread of pathogens and, thus, a resulting disease outbreak if there is a release. Given that there is always some risk of a release from any biocontainment facility, most experts GAO spoke with said that an island location can provide additional protection. An island location can help prevent the spread of FMD virus along terrestrial routes, such as from vehicles splashed with contaminated mud, and may also reduce airborne transmission. Some other countries besides the United States have historically seen the benefit of an island location, with its remoteness from susceptible species and permanent water barriers. A recent release from the Pirbright facility--located in a farming community on the mainland of the United Kingdom--highlights the risks of a release from a laboratory that is in close proximity to the susceptible animals and provides the best evidence in favor of an island location. FMD has no health implications for humans, but it can have significant economic consequences, as recent outbreaks in the United Kingdom have demonstrated. The economic effects of an FMD outbreak in the United States, however, would depend on the characteristics of the outbreak and how producers, consumers, and the government responded to it. Although estimates vary, experts agree that the economic consequences of an FMD outbreak on the U.S. mainland could be significant, especially for red meat producers whose animals would be at risk for diseases, depending on how and where such an outbreak occurred."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["We are pleased to be here to discuss our findings on the evidence the  Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has used to support its decision  that foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) work can be conducted as safely on  the U.S. mainland as on Plum Island.", "By law, live FMD virus may be used only at a coastal island, such as Plum  Island, unless the Secretary of Agriculture specifically determines that it is  necessary and in the public interest to conduct such research and study on  the U.S. mainland.

It affects cloven-hoofed  animals such as cattle, sheep, goats, and pigs, and has occurred in most  countries of the world at some point during the past century.  It has 7  types and over 80 subtypes. Immunity to, or vaccination for, one type of  the virus does not protect animals against infection from the other types.  FMD-infected animals usually develop blister-like lesions in the mouth, on  the tongue and lips, on the teats, or between the hooves. They salivate  excessively or become lame. Other symptoms include fever, reduced feed  consumption, and miscarriages. Cattle and pigs, which are very sensitive  to the virus, show disease symptoms after a short incubation period of 3 to  5 days. The incubation period in sheep is considerably longer, about 10 to  14 days, and the clinical signs of the disease are usually mild and may be  masked by other diseases, thereby allowing FMD to go unnoticed.", "The mortality rate for young animals infected with FMD varies and  depends on the species and strain of the virus; in contrast, adult animals  usually recover once the disease has run its course. However, because the  disease leaves them severely debilitated, meat-producing animals do not  normally regain their lost weight for many months, and dairy cows seldom  produce milk at their former rate. Therefore, the disease can cause severe  losses in the production of meat and milk.", "The FMD virus is easily transmitted and spreads rapidly. Before and during  the appearance of clinical signs, infected animals release the virus into the  environment through respiration, milk, semen, blood, saliva, and feces.  The virus may become airborne and spread quickly if pigs become infected  because pigs prolifically produce and excrete large amounts of the virus  into the air. Animals, people, or materials that are exposed to the virus can  also spread FMD by bringing it into contact with susceptible animals. For  example, the virus can spread when susceptible animals come in contact  with contaminated    animals;    animal products, such as meat, milk, hides, skins, and manure;   transport vehicles and equipment;    clothes or shoes worn by people; and    hay, feedstuffs, or veterinary biologics.", "FMD virus is the most infectious animal disease-causing virus. It has been  determined that for certain strains, the dose required to infect cattle or  sheep through inhalation is about 10 organisms (10 1 TCID50). Infected  pigs produce immense amounts of airborne virus. An infected pig exhales  400 million organisms per day (10 8.6 TCID50). The sensitivity of cattle to  infection and the high levels of airborne virus produced by infected pigs  illustrate that the airborne spread of infection is another important factor  in FMD outbreaks.", "FMD occurs throughout much of the world, and although some countries  have been free of FMD for some time, its wide host range and rapid spread  represent cause for international concern. After World War II, the disease  was widely distributed across the globe. In 1996, endemic areas included  Asia, Africa, and parts of South America. In North America, the last  outbreaks of FMD for the United States, Canada, and Mexico occurred in  1929, 1952, and 1953, respectively.", "North America, Australia, and Japan have been free of FMD for many  years.

In fact, the incidence  of the release of any dangerous pathogen from modern containment  facilities is quite low. During the vast majority of the time, such facilities  have been operating safely. Some releases have occurred, however. Table  2 lists known and attributed releases of FMD virus from laboratories  worldwide, including those that produce vaccines.", "A particular deficiency in the 2002 USDA study was the omission of any  explicit analysis of the release of FMD virus from Plum Island itself in  1978. In September of that year, FMD virus was found to have infected  clean animals being held outside the laboratory compound in the  quarantined animal supply area of PIADC. The exact route by which the  virus escaped from containment and subsequently infected the animal  supply was never definitely ascertained. An internal investigation  concluded that the most probable routes of escape of the virus from  containment were (1) faulty air balance of the incinerator area, (2) leakage  through inadequately maintained air filter and vent systems, and (3)  seepage of water under or through a construction barrier near the  incinerator area. Animal care workers then most likely carried the disease  back to the animal supply area on the island, where it infected clean  animals being held for future work. (See table 3.)", "An analysis of the deficiencies underlying these probable routes of escape  noted during the investigation show that all were related to human error  and that none were related to insufficient containment technology. Any  one of these deficiencies could happen in a modern facility, since they  were not a function of the technology or its sophistication, procedures or  their completeness, or even, primarily, the age of the facility. The  deficiencies were errors in human judgment or execution and, as such,  could occur today as easily as they did in 1978.", "In addition, a number of incidents at PIADC have resulted in internal  releases such that animals within the laboratory compound inadvertently  became infected, although no FMD virus was released outside the facility.  These incidents show that technology sometimes fails, facilities age, and  humans make mistakes. Table 4 lists known internal releases of FMD virus  at PIADC since 1971.", "These incidents involved human error, lack of proper maintenance,  equipment failure, and deviation from standard operating procedures.  Many were not a function of the age of the facility or the lack of  technology and could happen in any facility today. While these incidents  did not directly result in any external release, they could have been useful  in the 2002 study in illustrating the variety of ways in which internal  controls\u2014especially in large animal biocontainment facilities\u2014can be  compromised.", "Given the rarity of the release of FMD virus from laboratories, and how  relevant its release is to the question of moving FMD work off its present  island location, we believe that the 2002 study was remiss in not more  explicitly considering this matter. In fact, members of the panel we spoke  with could recall little, if any, discussion of incidents of release at Plum  Island.", "Beyond the history of incidents at Plum Island, we found no evidence that  the study considered the history of accidents in or releases from  biocontainment facilities generally. Had the study considered this history,  it would have shown that no facility for handling dangerous pathogens can  ever be completely safe and that no technology can be totally relied on to  ensure safety.", "The study found that \u201ctoday\u2019s technology is adequate to contain any  biosafety risks at any site.\u201d While we agree that technology\u2014 biocontainment facilities, filtration technologies, and the like\u2014has come a  long way and is a critical component of biosafety, we believe that it is  inadequate by itself in containing biosafety risks. A comprehensive  biosafety program involves a combination of biocontainment technology,  proper procedures, and properly trained people. The study also concurred  that \u201cbiosafety is only as effective as the individual who practices it.\u201d", "Even with a proper biosafety program, human error can never be  completely eliminated. Many experts told us that the human component  accounts for the majority of accidents in high-containment laboratories.  This risk persists, even in the most modern facilities and with the latest  technology. The 2002 study, in fact, acknowledged this, although it did not  elaborate on the critical role that people play in keeping biocontainment  laboratories safe when it stated that \u201cbiosafety is only as effective as the  individual who practices it.\u201d The study\u2019s summary conclusion that  \u201cbiocontainment technology allows safe research\u201d is, therefore,  disingenuous.", "Finally, as we have reported previously, the maintenance of any  biocontainment facility or technology plays a critical role in biosafety.   For example, the lack of proper maintenance was one of the probable  routes of escape in the 1978 release at Plum Island. High-containment  laboratories are highly sophisticated facilities that require specialized  expertise to design, construct, operate, and maintain. Because they are  intended to contain dangerous microorganisms, usually in liquid or aerosol  form, even minor structural defects\u2014such as cracks in the wall, leaky  pipes, or improper sealing around doors\u2014can often have severe  consequences. For example, leaking drainage pipes was determined to be  the likely cause of the FMD outbreak at Pirbright in 2007.", "According to the experts we talked with, failure to budget for and conduct  regular inspections and maintenance of biocontainment facilities is a risk  to which even the most modern facilities are susceptible. All the experts  we talked with, including the panel members who contributed to the 2002  study, emphasized the importance of effective maintenance and the need  to protect maintenance budgets from being used for other purposes. One  official told us, for example, that as his containment facility ages, he is  spending more and more of his operating budget on maintenance and that,  in fact, he is having to offset the rise in maintenance costs from other  categories of funding within his overall budget."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Study Did Not Address in Detail the Issues of Containment Related to Large Animals Infected with FMD", "paragraphs": ["The 2002 study did not address in detail the issues of containment related  to large animals like cattle and pigs, which present problems very different  from those of laboratory animals like rats, mice, and guinea pigs. It did not  address the unique risks associated with the special containment spaces  required for large animals or the impact of highly concentrated virus loads  on such things as the air filtration systems.", "Large animals cannot be kept in containers. They must be allowed  sufficient space to move around in. Handling large animals within confined  spaces\u2014a full size cow can weigh up to 1,430 pounds\u2014can present special  dangers for the scientists as well as the animal handlers. Moving carcasses  from contained areas to necropsy or incineration poses additional risks.  For example, one of the internal releases of FMD virus at PIADC happened  in transporting large animal carcasses from contained rooms through to  incineration.", "Although it could not have been known to the study group in 2002,  transferring FMD work to NBAF is to be accompanied by an increase in  both scope and complexity over the current activities at PIADC. These  increases in scope and complexity would mean an increase in the risk  associated with work at the new facility. For example, the proposed BSL-3  Ag space at the new NBAF is projected to be almost twice the size of the  space currently at PIADC and is to accommodate many more large  animals. USDA\u2019s Agricultural Research Service animal holding area  requirements at PIADC specify space for 90 cattle, 154 swine, or 176 sheep  (or combinations thereof). Translational studies will involve clinical trials  with aerosolized FMD virus challenging groups of 30 to 45 animals and  lasting 3 to 6 months. This is contrasted with about 16 large animals that  PIADC can process today.", "Moreover, unique risks are associated with BSL-3 Ag facilities, where the  facility itself is considered the primary containment area. In a standard  BSL-3 laboratory, in contrast, work is done within a biological safety  cabinet, which provides the primary level of containment, eliminating  direct contact between the human operator and infected material. The  outer parts of the facility walls thus provide a secondary barrier. Because  large animals cannot be handled within a biological safety cabinet, they  are free to move around in a BSL-3 Ag laboratory, where the laboratory  walls provide the primary containment.", "An important difference between a standard BSL-3 laboratory, such as  those used with human pathogens, and a BSL-3 Ag laboratory therefore is  that in the latter there is extensive direct contact between the human  operator and the infected animal and, consequently, the virus. Because the  virus can be carried in a person\u2019s lungs, nostrils, or other body parts, the  human becomes a potential avenue by which the virus can escape the  facility. Special biosafety procedures are needed\u2014for example, a full  shower upon exiting containment, accompanied by expectorating to clear  the throat and blowing through the nose to clear the nasal passages.  Additionally, a 5-to-7-day quarantine period is usually imposed on any  person who has been within containment where FMD virus is present, a  tacit acknowledgment that humans can carry the disease out with them  even after these additional procedures. Although the study mentioned  these matters, it gave no indication that these unique risks associated with  working in large animal biocontainment facilities informed the study\u2019s  eventual findings.", "We also found that the study did not consider other safety issues specific  to FMD. For example, the study did not look at the likely loads that air  filtration systems have to deal with, especially in the case of pigs infected  with FMD virus\u2014which, through normal expiration, excrete very large  amounts of virus-laden aerosols. Properly fitted and maintained high- efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters are a key factor in all modern  biocontainment facilities and have a record of being highly effective in  keeping aerosolized pathogens, including viruses, contained. Nevertheless,  they do not represent an absolute barrier. The typical standard for such  filters is that they must operate with an efficiency of at least 99.97  percent. Often the highest level-containment laboratories use two HEPA  filters in series, in addition to prefiltration systems, to gain increased  efficiency. However, we found no indication that the study examined  specific filtration issues with the FMD virus or that it questioned the  efficiency of such systems specifically in relation to a high-volume  challenge of virus, a concern that, while remote, should not have been  dismissed, given the very low dose of FMD virus required for animals to  become infected."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Study Was Inaccurate in Comparing Other Countries\u2019 FMD Work Experience with the Situation in the United States", "paragraphs": ["The study cited the experience of three countries around the world in  working with FMD\u2014Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom.

Australia maintains a ban on  live virus FMD work at all its laboratories, whether on mainland, island, or  peninsula, including the laboratory at Geelong\u2014considered by many to be  the premier laboratory in the world in terms of state-of-the-art animal  containment technology. Australia mitigates the risk FMD poses to its  livestock by outsourcing its FMD work to other countries.", "The Canadian laboratory at Winnipeg was not in operation at the time of  the 2002 study and is not appropriately compared to the U.S. situation.  Canada has decided to conduct FMD work on the mainland. However, it is  in a downtown location where there is little likelihood that susceptible  animals will be in the immediate neighborhood. In addition, its scope of  work for FMD is smaller than the present FMD work at the PIADC facility  or the proposed facility. The proposed U.S. sites are potentially more  likely to pose a risk, given their closer proximity to susceptible animal  populations.", "The 2002 study used the U.K. Pirbright facility as an example of a  precedent for allowing FMD work on the mainland. The study participants  could not have known in 2002, however, that an accidental release of FMD  virus at the Pirbright facility in 2007 led directly to eight separate  outbreaks of FMD on farms surrounding the Pirbright laboratory. This fact  highlights the risks of release from a laboratory that is in close proximity  to susceptible animals and provides the best evidence in favor of an island  location.", "Finally, the study did not consider the German and Danish situations. For  example, all FMD work with large animals in Germany is restricted to  Riems, an island just off the northeastern coast of Germany in the Baltic  Sea. FMD work in Germany was originally restricted to the island in  the1910s. During the post-World War II period, when Riems was controlled  by East Germany, West Germany maintained a separate mainland facility  for its FMD research, but after re-unification, Germany again decided to  restrict all FMD research to Riems and disestablished the mainland  facility. Construction is currently under way to expand the facility on the  island at Riems.", "Similarly, Denmark restricts all FMD work to the National Veterinary  Institute Department of Virology, on the island of Lindholm.

An examination of the empirical  evidence of past FMD releases from research facilities shows that an  island location can help keep a release from becoming a more general  outbreak. Another benefit of an island location is that it provides a  permanent geographical barrier that may not be impregnable but that can  more easily allow the Office International des Epizooties (OIE) to declare  the rest of the U.S. mainland disease-free from FMD if there happened to  be a release on the island.", "Experts we spoke with\u2014including a number of the expert panel members  from the 2002 study\u2014agreed that an island location provides additional  protection. They agreed that all other factors being equal, FMD research  can be conducted more safely on an island than in a mainland location.", "A comparison of the releases at Plum Island in 1978 and Pirbright in 2007  provides evidence that an island location can help keep a release from  becoming a more general outbreak. In September 1978, FMD virus was  found to have been released from containment at PIADC. The exact route  of escape was never definitely ascertained, but clean animals held on the  island in the animal supply area outside the laboratory compound became  infected with FMD.", "However, no virus was ever found off the island. In fact, when the  subsequent investigation by USDA\u2019s Animal and Plant Health Inspection  Service on the mainland of Long Island found that no spread of FMD,  OIE\u2014in consideration of PIADC\u2019s island location\u2014continued to officially  consider the United States as a whole free from FMD. This was a  significant declaration that allowed the continued unrestricted export of  U.S. animal products from the mainland.", "In summarizing the 1978 FMD virus release, the PIADC Safety  Investigation Committee identified three main PIADC lines of defense that  stood as barriers against the escape of disease agents: (1) the design,  construction, and operation of its laboratory buildings; (2) its restrictions  on the movement of personnel, materials, supplies, and equipment; and (3)  the island location. This internal investigation concluded that although  the first two barriers had been breached, probably by human error, the  final line of defense\u2014the island location\u2014succeeded in containing the  release from becoming a wider outbreak beyond PIADC itself.", "The 1978 release at Plum Island can be compared to the release at  Pirbright in the summer of 2007. Pirbright is located on the mainland of  Great Britain in Surrey, a semi-agricultural area just southwest of London.  The U.K. Institute for Animal Health and Merial, a commercial vaccine  production plant, are collocated there, and both work with FMD virus. The  site is surrounded by a number of \u201chobby farms,\u201d on some of which 40 to  50 cattle are bred and raised. In summer 2007, cattle on farms near the  Pirbright facility became infected with FMD. Subsequent investigations  concluded that the likely source of the release was a leaking drainage pipe  at the facility that carried waste from the contained areas to an effluent  treatment plant. The virus was then spread onto local farms by the  splashing of contaminated mud onto vehicles that had unrestricted access  to the contaminated area and could easily drive onto and off the site. The  investigations determined that there had been a failure to properly  maintain the site\u2019s infrastructure. In all, eight separate outbreaks occurred  over a 2-month period.", "A key difference, of course, between the Pirbright incident in 2007 and the  incident at Plum Island in 1978 is that virus did not spread off the Plum  Island.", "Similarly, escapes in 1968 in Denmark from the Lindholm facility and in  the 1970s in Germany from the Riems facility, when compared to Pirbright  in 2007, also demonstrate the benefit of an island location in containing a  release."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "An Island Facility Could More Easily Allow the United States to Maintain Disease-Free Status If a Release Were to Occur", "paragraphs": ["Since 1996, OIE has provided a procedure for officially recognizing the  sanitary status of countries with regard to particular animal diseases,  including FMD. A country can apply for and be granted disease-free status  if it can prove that a disease is not present in the country. Ad hoc groups  of international experts examine countries\u2019 applications for official  recognition of sanitary status. An elected Specialist Commission reviews  the recommendations of these groups and either accepts or rejects them.", "If an outbreak does occur, procedures exist for countries to regain their  disease-free status. This offers significant economic benefit, because  export bans can exist for countries not considered disease-free. In 2002,  GAO reported that an export ban on U.S. livestock products because of an  FMD outbreak in the United States, similar to the 2001 outbreak in the  United Kingdom, could result in losses of $6 billion to $10 billion a year  while the nation eradicated the disease and regained disease-free status.", "Instead of revoking the U.S. disease-free status in response to the 1978  release at Plum Island, OIE continued to consider the United States as a  whole free from FMD. This was because of the facility\u2019s island location.  This status from OIE allowed the United States to continue exporting  animal products from the mainland after the release was identified.  However, these OIE officials said that if a similar release were to occur  from a facility on the U.S. mainland, OIE would most likely not be able to  declare the United States disease-free. In their view, the island location  provides a natural \u201czoning\u201d ability that, under OIE\u2019s rules, more easily  allows the country to prove the compartmentalization that is necessary for  retaining \u201cdisease-free\u201d status."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The Economic Consequences of an FMD Outbreak in the United States Could Be Significant", "paragraphs": ["While humans cannot become infected with FMD through contact with  infected animals or through eating products of diseased animals, still, FMD  can have economic consequences, as recent outbreaks in the United  Kingdom have demonstrated.

Current estimates of U.S. livestock inventories are 97 million cattle and  calves, 7 million sheep, and 59 million hogs and pigs, all susceptible to an  FMD outbreak.

However, government compensation  programs might not cover 100 percent of producers\u2019 costs. As a result,  direct costs would also occur for disinfection and for the value of any  slaughtered animals not subject to government compensation.", "According to the available studies, the direct costs of controlling and  eradicating a U.S. outbreak of FMD could vary significantly, depending on  many factors including the extent of the outbreak and the control strategy  employed.", "Indirect costs of an FMD outbreak would include costs affecting  consumers, ancillary agricultural industries, and other sectors of the  economy. For example, if large numbers of animals were destroyed as part  of a control and eradication effort, then ancillary industries such as meat  processing facilities and feed suppliers would be likely to lose revenue.", "Furthermore, an FMD outbreak could have adverse effects such as  unemployment, loss of income (to the extent that government  compensation would not fully reimburse producers), and decreased  economic activity, which could ripple through other sectors of the  economy as well. However, our analyses show that these effects would  likely be local or regional and limited in scope.", "The economic effects of an FMD outbreak would depend on the  characteristics of the outbreak and how producers, consumers, and the  government responded to it. The scale of the outbreak would depend on  the time elapsed before detection and the number of animals exposed,  among other factors. Costs to producers of addressing the disease  outbreak and taking steps to recover would similarly vary. The responses  of consumers in the domestic market would depend on their perceptions  of safety, as well as changes in the relative prices of substitutes for the  affected meat products, as supply adjusted to the FMD disruption. In  overseas markets, consumers, responses would be mediated by the  actions their governments would take or not take to restrict imports from  the United States. Because an overall estimate of effects depends heavily  on the assumptions made about these variables, it is not possible to settle  on a single economic assessment of the cost to the United States of an  FMD outbreak.
