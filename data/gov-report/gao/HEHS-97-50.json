This flexibility can cause problems for the Medicare program. For example, under this policy beneficiaries may decide to use managed care or other private plans while in relatively good health but may disenroll to fee for service when their health care needs increase. The result can be a disproportionate number of less healthy beneficiaries in fee for service, excess payments to health maintenance organizations (HMO), and unnecessary Medicare spending.", "Recently, the Congress has considered making Medicare\u2019s policies more consistent with those of other large health care purchasing organizations by establishing a limited time each year during which Medicare beneficiaries could enroll in a particular plan and by restricting disenrollment outside that period. To help the Congress in its consideration of the effects of such a policy change, you asked us to assess how a limited enrollment period would affect the Medicare program, private health plans, beneficiaries, and employers who provide Medicare supplemental benefits to retirees. To do this, we examined the potential effects of policy changes on (1) the growth of Medicare\u2019s managed care program, (2) employers\u2019 attempts to administer their respective benefits seasons, (3) taxpayer savings measured against beneficiary protections, and (4) the resources needed by the federal agency that runs Medicare\u2019s day-to-day operations. Because a specific annual enrollment period could be established without also limiting beneficiaries\u2019 opportunities to change to fee for service, we have discussed the effects of the two policy changes (limiting the enrollment period and limiting disenrollment opportunities) separately.", "We assumed that a new Medicare enrollment policy might be similar, but not necessarily identical, to the provisions contained in the proposed Balanced Budget Act of 1995 (BBA), H.R. 2491, as discussed in the act\u2019s accompanying conference report. Therefore, we developed and analyzed a limited enrollment period policy modeled on the BBA. Although the BBA would have provided for an expanded range of health care delivery and insurance options, we focused our attention on risk HMOs because they currently serve most beneficiaries not in Medicare fee for service. To assess the likely effects of such a policy, we interviewed representatives of 10 Medicare risk HMOs, the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), employers who offer managed care options to retirees, and Medicare beneficiary advocacy organizations. We surveyed HMOs with Medicare risk contracts regarding their employer group business. To develop information on the potential financial effect on Medicare of limiting disenrollment, we analyzed HMO disenrollment data and fee-for-service claims in California. For more detailed information on our methodology, see appendix III. We did our work from March through November 1996 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Consistent with the national trend toward managed care, the number of Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in HMOs has grown significantly\u2014from about 1 million in 1987 to about 4 million in 1996. This growth represents an increase from about 3 percent of all Medicare beneficiaries to about 10 percent. About 90 percent of Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in managed care are in risk-contract HMOs. The largest growth in Medicare managed care enrollment has occurred in the risk program. (See fig. 1.)", "The number of HMOs in the risk program fluctuated somewhat in the program\u2019s first 5 years, but since 1992 the number of risk HMOs has grown steadily. (See fig. 2.) As of November 1996, HCFA had entered into 238 risk contracts. Most beneficiaries have at least one risk HMO available in their area, and, in some markets, beneficiaries can choose from as many as 14 different HMOs.", "Risk HMOs are required to offer at least one 30-day enrollment period each year, but, in practice, most accept enrollment continuously. Although HCFA provides beneficiaries some general information about HMOs when beneficiaries first become eligible for Medicare, they typically learn about their options from the HMOs. Unlike leading private and public health care purchasing organizations, Medicare does not provide its beneficiaries with comparative information about available HMOs. HMOs provide beneficiaries with enrollment forms, collect the forms, and notify HCFA of enrollments. Beneficiaries may disenroll from a plan as often as once each month.", "As discussed in the BBA conference report, the BBA included provisions that would have amended Medicare\u2019s enrollment policy in the following ways:", "Each October, Medicare would have an annual, coordinated election period, or \u201copen season,\u201d during which beneficiaries could change their Medicare election. Elections of coverage would become effective the following January 1. However, newly eligible Medicare beneficiaries could elect coverage and have their choice become effective when they first became eligible for benefits.", "The Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) would conduct a nationally coordinated educational and publicity campaign during October. At least 15 days before the election period, the Secretary would mail all Medicare beneficiaries and prospective beneficiaries general election information and information comparing benefits, premiums, and measures of quality at available health plans.", "Disenrollment could occur only within 90 days of the time elected coverage began. Beneficiaries who disenrolled could elect a different HMO for the remainder of the year. This disenrollment option would only apply the first time a beneficiary enrolled in a particular managed care plan and would not apply more than twice for any beneficiary in a calendar year. Exceptions would include disenrollment for beneficiaries who moved out of a service area."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "A Limited Enrollment Period Policy Could Slow Managed Care Growth Despite Better Consumer Information", "paragraphs": ["Establishing a limited enrollment period could slow managed care growth for two reasons. First, marketing practices possible under a limited enrollment policy might be less effective in attracting beneficiaries to managed care.

Second, restrictions on health plan switches outside the established enrollment period\u2014even if no restrictions existed on changing to traditional fee-for-service Medicare\u2014could deter some beneficiaries from enrolling in HMOs. In particular, a limited enrollment period policy would have three main disadvantages for beneficiaries: (1) dissatisfied beneficiaries and those encountering problems gaining access to desired treatments could be exposed to higher health care expenses, (2) beneficiaries who spend part of each year in a different location (\u201csnowbirds\u201d) could find they had no choice other than fee for service, and (3) all beneficiaries enrolled in HMOs could face delays in obtaining physician appointments at the start of each benefit year because of a large volume of new beneficiaries seeking services."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "HMO Marketing Abuses Associated With In-Home Sales Would Probably Be Reduced", "paragraphs": ["One-on-one sales presentations, often conducted in the privacy of beneficiaries\u2019 homes, leave beneficiaries vulnerable to abusive sales tactics and serious marketing problems. Reported abuses include HMO representatives\u2019 lying to prospective enrollees about the benefits of HMO enrollment, pressuring beneficiaries to join HMOs, enrolling beneficiaries who could not make informed enrollment decisions, and obtaining enrollment signatures under false pretenses. Although HCFA cannot determine the frequency of these problems, agency officials are concerned about the potential for in-home sales marketing abuses.", "According to our HMO survey results, about half of the beneficiaries who enrolled in a Medicare HMO as individuals (not as members of an employer group) in 1995 participated in a one-on-one sales presentation. However, the likelihood of a beneficiary\u2019s participating in a one-on-one sales presentation varied greatly by HMO.", "A limited enrollment period lasting just 1 or 2 months each year could make it impractical for HMOs to conduct as many in-home sales presentations. Each one-on-one meeting can last from 1/2 hour to 2 hours and is conducted by an HMO sales agent who sells only to Medicare beneficiaries. HMO representatives told us that sales agents who sell Medicare plans sell them exclusively. Agents are trained not only in the details of their HMO\u2019s offering, but also in traditional Medicare and the rules governing Medicare managed care. Some HMO representatives implied that maintaining a large, dedicated Medicare sales force year-round would be impractical if most sales would take place during a 1- or 2-month limited enrollment period. Furthermore, HMO representatives said it would be unrealistic to expect non-Medicare agents to be able to sell Medicare products. Because beneficiaries are particularly susceptible to abusive sales practices in their homes, reducing or eliminating in-home sales presentations would better protect beneficiaries from the possibility of sales abuses. This protection, however, would be a by-product of the enrollment policy change and could be achieved by more direct methods."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comparative Information Distributed During a Limited Enrollment Period Would Aid Beneficiary Decision-Making", "paragraphs": ["Under the BBA, before the start of a limited enrollment period, the Secretary of HHS would have been responsible for producing and distributing (1) a list of plans available in a given area and (2) comparative information about those plans, including benefits, premiums, and measures of quality. The Secretary would also have been responsible for maintaining a toll-free number that beneficiaries could call to receive specific information.", "Beneficiaries\u2019 ability to make informed health care choices would be enhanced by the availability of objective, comparative information and access to a hot line. We recently reported that beneficiaries who wish to compare plans face difficult, if not daunting, steps. First, they must call a toll-free telephone number to obtain a list of HMOs available in their area. Next, they must contact those HMOs and request marketing brochures. Finally, they must compare plans\u2019 benefit packages and cost information described in the brochures. The last step can be difficult because HMOs are not required to use standard formats or terminology in describing their products.", "A limited enrollment period would facilitate an annual HMO marketing campaign and create a natural opportunity for HCFA to distribute comparative plan information to beneficiaries. Some experts believe that HMOs\u2019 concentrated advertising during the open season would help inform beneficiaries of alternative Medicare options. Another potential advantage is that any comparative information produced by HCFA would be up to date at the time most beneficiaries were making health care choices."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Mass Marketing Campaign Might Not Adequately Inform Beneficiaries Unfamiliar With Managed Care", "paragraphs": ["HMO representatives told us that if Medicare established a limited enrollment period, plans would turn to a marketing approach more conducive to a limited enrollment time frame.

These experts suggest that the Medicare advertising blitz could be similar to the advertising campaigns that occur in the Washington, D.C., area during the Federal Employees\u2019 Health Benefits Program (FEHBP) open season each fall. Whether Medicare HMOs\u2019 advertising campaigns would be as intense as FEHBP plans\u2019 is uncertain. FEHBP subscribers represent about 9 percent of the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area\u2019s total population.", "Nationwide, Medicare beneficiaries represent about 14 percent of the total population. However, only about 1 in 10 Medicare beneficiaries currently enrolls in managed care. If advertising intensity is driven by the proportion of potential customers, the intensity of a campaign for Medicare beneficiaries would depend upon whether HMOs believe the potential market is all Medicare beneficiaries or only 1 in 10.", "Representatives of HMOs, however, believe that an advertising campaign without the benefit of one-on-one sales would be less effective at convincing Medicare beneficiaries to try managed care. Representatives of most HMOs we contacted stated that limiting Medicare\u2019s enrollment period would slow the growth of managed care because plans would not (1) have time to educate beneficiaries about Medicare\u2019s managed care option and (2) be able to hire enough trained sales staff on a seasonal basis to answer beneficiary questions during the limited enrollment period. Although abuses have been reported in conjunction with one-on-one sales, HMOs believe this sales approach is both necessary and effective, in part because many beneficiaries have had no experience with managed care.", "The effectiveness of an FEHBP-like mass marketing campaign for Medicare may depend on whether HCFA develops ancillary mechanisms to inform beneficiaries. Participants in FEHBP do not rely exclusively on mass marketing to obtain information. All active and retired FEHBP enrollees are given comparative information on available plans and can obtain detailed, plan-specific information brochures that follow a standard format. Active federal workers can also discuss their health care options with colleagues or their agency\u2019s benefits administrator. Furthermore, most workers can easily attend health fairs sponsored by their agency, where health plan representatives distribute literature and answer questions. The 20 percent of FEHBP members who are retired also have some advantages over individuals in Medicare. As former federal workers, FEHBP participants are familiar with the program\u2019s enrollment and disenrollment rules. In addition, federal retirees receive guidance from the National Association of Retired Federal Employees. This organization, with over 1,700 chapters nationwide, works closely with FEHBP in answering questions and resolving problems.

Beneficiaries might welcome such a change in enrollment practices partly because they would have the convenience of \u201cone-stop shopping\u201d and also appreciate a source of objective, comparative information. A recent focus group conducted for HCFA found that most beneficiaries did not view insurance plan representatives as trustworthy sources of impartial information. Nonetheless, HMO representatives maintain that personal contact with an HMO sales agent can be reassuring to beneficiaries and that industry sales abuses are few.", "HCFA plans to test the effect of third-party enrollment contractors in a future Medicare demonstration project. Scheduled to begin sometime in 1997, this project will use a third-party contractor to conduct marketing, education, counseling, and enrollment activities. HCFA\u2019s design\u2014as of August 1996\u2014will permit HMOs to provide information to beneficiaries directly and even help beneficiaries fill out enrollment forms. The third-party contractor will provide comparative information about the plans, counsel beneficiaries who want to consult with a neutral party, and perform all enrollment transactions. The potential effect of this approach on enrollment is not clear, and the demonstration\u2019s effects may not be fully evaluated for years.", "If the Medicare program relies solely on enrollment brokers and prohibits HMOs from marketing to individual beneficiaries, however, growth of Medicare managed care might slow. HMO representatives with whom we discussed this issue were concerned that brokers would be less knowledgeable about the advantages of specific plans and thus not as effective as sales agents in selling managed care to Medicare beneficiaries. Recent experience in the Medicaid program suggests that prohibiting direct marketing by HMOs could slow enrollment growth. Because of abuses, Florida and New York prohibited HMOs from marketing to beneficiaries directly. Both states experienced significant declines in Medicaid HMO enrollment. Florida reported that, in a recent 3-month period since banning direct marketing, enrollment levels fell by an average of 10,000 enrollees per month. New York temporarily suspended its ban on direct marketing to help increase HMO enrollment but implemented other steps to prevent HMO marketing abuses. In fact, in many Medicaid programs in which beneficiary participation in managed care is voluntary, states rely on HMOs to inform beneficiaries about managed care and encourage them to enroll."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Potential Costs If Dissatisfied Could Dissuade Some Beneficiaries From Enrolling in Medicare HMOs", "paragraphs": ["Although a limited enrollment period could add some consumer protections for beneficiaries, it could expose dissatisfied beneficiaries to additional out-of-pocket costs. Under the limited enrollment period policy discussed here, beneficiaries dissatisfied with their HMOs would have three choices: (1) remain in the HMO, (2) switch to traditional Medicare fee for service and pay the deductible and coinsurance for submitted claims, or (3) switch to traditional Medicare fee for service and purchase a Medigap policy if one was available to them. Beneficiaries dissatisfied with access to desired treatments could remain in their HMO and purchase those services privately. However, going outside the HMO for treatment or changing to fee for service would cost most beneficiaries more money than they would have spent had they been able to enroll in another HMO.", "Changing to traditional fee for service could be an expensive option for many dissatisfied Medicare HMO members. HMOs are cheaper than fee for service for many Medicare beneficiaries because 65 percent of HMOs do not charge a monthly premium (so-called \u201czero premium HMOs\u201d). In addition, HMOs frequently offer benefits, such as outpatient prescription drugs, that are not provided by traditional Medicare. Beneficiaries in HMOs are responsible for copayments for certain services but often fewer services than in a fee-for-service arrangement. Beneficiaries in fee for service who need services covered under Medicare part B must fulfill a deductible and pay a portion of additional expenses.", "Dissatisfied HMO members who change to fee for service may want to purchase supplemental health insurance, known as Medigap, to help cover out-of-pocket costs. However, Medigap policies can cost over $1,000 per year\u2014more than most beneficiaries would pay to an HMO. Furthermore, beneficiaries have no guarantee that a Medigap policy will be available upon disenrolling from an HMO. During the 6 months after a person turns age 65 and enrolls in Medicare part B, federal law guarantees beneficiaries the opportunity to purchase a Medigap policy. After that, Medigap insurers are permitted to refuse to sell policies because of an applicant\u2019s health history or status. We recently reported that, although some insurers do exercise their option to refuse coverage, all beneficiaries currently have at least one Medigap policy available to them after the 6-month guarantee period, regardless of their health history or status. Nevertheless, no federal requirement exists to ensure that beneficiaries will always have such alternatives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Fee for Service Could Be Only Option for Medicare \u201cSnowbirds\u201d", "paragraphs": ["Beneficiaries who temporarily relocate for the winter, commonly known as \u201csnowbirds,\u201d might find joining a Medicare HMO impractical and would probably choose the fee-for-service option instead.

Furthermore, HMOs are required to disenroll any member who leaves his or her HMO\u2019s service area for more than 90 days. Currently, snowbirds can disenroll from an HMO and switch to fee for service or another HMO each time they relocate. If a limited enrollment period policy prohibited such plan switching, snowbirds would be left with only one realistic option\u2014enrolling in Medicare\u2019s fee-for-service program. Although data are not available on the number of Medicare snowbirds, their existence is widely recognized.", "HMOs might respond to a limited enrollment period policy by offering flexible service arrangements not commonly available today, such as reciprocal agreements and point-of-service options, partly to attract snowbirds. Reciprocal agreements among health plans\u2014which permit HMO members traveling outside their plan service area to receive routine care and nonemergency services from another HMO\u2014would make temporary relocations less problematic for beneficiaries who wished to enroll in managed care. Several HMOs now offer reciprocity but only within their own companies or affiliates. For example, a member of the Kaiser Foundation Health Plan in Los Angeles may receive services from Kaiser HMOs in other parts of the country. A representative of the American Association of Retired Persons said her organization is interested in encouraging the development of reciprocal agreements among plans, although no such agreements currently exist. Similarly, if many HMOs offer the point-of-service option\u2014a hybrid of HMOs and fee-for-service plans\u2014a Medicare policy limiting plan switching would be less of a deterrent to snowbirds who wished to enroll in HMOs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HMO Enrollees Could Face Delays Obtaining Physician Appointments at Start of Health Benefits Year", "paragraphs": ["Most of the HMOs we contacted believe that a limited enrollment period would cause beneficiaries to face delays in receiving health care services at the beginning of each health benefit year.

One HMO told us that a large percentage of that HMO\u2019s new members see their primary care physician within 60 days of enrolling to receive health care or renew a prescription. In fact, some plans strongly suggest that new members undergo initial health assessments within 30 days of joining. Although demand for provider services also increases after the start of a commercial contract, the effect of an influx of new Medicare members is greater because Medicare beneficiaries tend to use physician services more frequently than younger HMO members.", "Beneficiaries who would likely face delays in scheduling physician office visits might be those who join HMOs that employ providers directly (\u201cstaff model\u201d HMOs) or have exclusive contracts with providers (\u201ccaptive group model\u201d HMOs) or those who join HMOs with relatively small provider networks. Beneficiaries who join HMOs with exclusive provider arrangements will, by definition, change providers when changing plans. New members in HMOs with small provider networks are more likely to need to select a new provider than beneficiaries joining plans with large networks. However, for some beneficiaries, joining an HMO or switching among plans will not require switching physicians and an introductory visit because physicians often contract with multiple HMOs.", "Obtaining appointments at the start of each health benefit year might be difficult for beneficiaries in some HMOs because a limited enrollment period policy would probably result in dramatic, once-a-year membership spikes. From December 1994 to December 1995, 24 plans enrolled more than 10,000 new members, including 1 that enrolled close to 55,000 members. (Table 1 shows the distribution of new members among plans.) These membership increases, however, were absorbed by the plans over 12 months, not during a single month, as might occur under a limited enrollment period policy.", "The annual enrollment change resulting from a limited enrollment period could be difficult for HMOs to predict accurately; any unanticipated HMO enrollment growth could contribute to provider access problems. Representatives of one large HMO described what happened when they grossly underestimated the response to their Medicare product in a new market area. Although the plan had contracted with a large number of physicians, it underestimated the need for primary care physicians and certain specialists. Demands on plan physicians\u2019 time and the level of beneficiary complaints were so high that some physicians quit. The plan contracted with new physicians (a process that took about 6 months) and cut back its marketing efforts to hold down additional enrollment, but 1-1/2 years passed before the plan\u2019s provider network could comfortably meet members\u2019 demand for services.", "A January start date for the Medicare benefits year, as specified in the BBA, could cause longer delays in receiving health services than if another time of year was selected. January is already a particularly busy month for providers because so many members of employer-based health plans begin their benefits years on January 1.

To quantify potential savings, we studied the behavior of all 738,000 California Medicare beneficiaries who were enrolled in a risk HMO at the start of 1994. Of the beneficiaries who did not change residences, only 15,772 switched from managed care to fee for service during 1994.Medicare paid fee-for-service claims for 11,382 of these beneficiaries, amounting to almost $73 million. If these beneficiaries had not been allowed to disenroll from their plans, the Medicare program would have paid $42 million in capitated payments to HMOs to cover these same beneficiaries.

Beneficiaries in California have many HMOs from which to choose and can readily join a competing HMO if dissatisfied with their own. In other states, however, beneficiaries have fewer choices, and the rate of changing to fee for service among dissatisfied beneficiaries may be higher than in California. Since limiting the opportunity to change to fee for service during the year produces cost savings, the potential savings, as a percentage of payments to HMOs, may be higher in states with few HMOs. However, national Medicare savings would still likely be small because California represents about 44 percent of all Medicare risk-contract HMO expenditures.", "The less restrictive the disenrollment policy is\u2014in other words, the more opportunities beneficiaries have to change to fee for service\u2014the smaller the potential savings. For example, if beneficiaries were permitted to disenroll and switch to fee for service during the first 90 days of membership, Medicare would realize some savings but fewer than under a more restrictive disenrollment policy. Our analysis of 1994 California data indicates that Medicare would have saved, at most, $22 million if beneficiaries had been permitted to disenroll to fee for service only within the first 90 days.", "These estimated savings probably represent the upper limit of what Medicare could have saved in California in 1994. Our estimates assume that beneficiary behavior and enrollment patterns would not change as the result of a limited disenrollment policy. However, as the following section discusses, beneficiary behavior will likely be affected by such a policy.

Changing the disenrollment policy could also weaken plans\u2019 incentive to maintain the quality of the services and care they provide. Finally, without the ability to disenroll, HCFA and HMOs believe that beneficiaries are likely to file more grievances and appeals.", "Although most beneficiaries do not change plans frequently, some HMOs have high member disenrollment rates, which can signal member dissatisfaction. We recently reported that one HMO in Miami and one in Los Angeles had 1995 disenrollment rates of 37 percent and 42 percent, respectively. One Miami HMO with high disenrollment rates had a 7-year history of Medicare deficiencies, including those involving beneficiary appeal rights and quality assurance. Thus, although most members appear to be satisfied with their HMO, problems do exist, and the freedom to disenroll provides a course of action for dissatisfied plan members.", "Some beneficiary advocates believe that to ensure continuity of care, beneficiaries should be able to disenroll from an HMO if their physician leaves the plan. In fact, this may be a common reason for switching HMOs or changing to fee for service. A 1992 study reported that 26 percent of beneficiaries who disenrolled from an HMO cited their doctor\u2019s leaving the HMO as a reason for disenrolling. One large HMO told us that after terminating a contract with one of its physician groups, nearly all 1,668 members assigned to those physicians disenrolled from the HMO. Representatives of the plan believe that these members followed their physicians to a competing HMO that also contracted with the physician group. The Physician Payment Review Commission recently recommended that if a limited disenrollment policy is established, beneficiaries have the right to disenroll before year-end or to purchase services on a special point-of-service basis for the rest of the year if a plan makes a major change in its network of providers during the year.However, the Commission acknowledged that defining the precise circumstances for permitting disenrollment could be difficult.", "HMO representatives believe that beneficiaries\u2019 current ability to disenroll at the end of any month is good for competition and, thus, good for consumers. The need to retain members who can disenroll motivates plans to maintain quality, work for member satisfaction, and improve benefits continuously throughout the year. For example, officials at one large HMO told us that it increased benefits three times in 1995 to remain competitive. The HMO increased its pharmaceutical benefit, reduced beneficiary copayments for office visits, and improved its dental coverage.", "Representatives of several HMOs told us that an enrollment policy that includes a 90-day disenrollment option would be better for beneficiaries than no disenrollment option at all but that the current practice of permitting monthly disenrollment is far better for industry competition and for beneficiaries. Many beneficiaries who disenroll from their risk HMO do so within the first 90 days. For example, of about 326,000 beneficiaries who joined a risk HMO during the first 3 months of 1995, 14.4 percent disenrolled within 1 year or less, but a disproportionate amount\u2014 5.6 percent\u2014disenrolled in less than 90 days.", "On the other hand, representatives of one HMO speculated that if beneficiaries were permitted just 90 days to disenroll, short-term disenrollment rates would soar. Beneficiaries who are less than completely satisfied with their HMO might quickly disenroll, rather than give their plan a chance to address their complaints.", "HCFA officials predict that without the option of disenrolling, dissatisfaction among HMO members would manifest itself in other ways, such as an increase in grievances to HMOs and appeals to HCFA\u2014a prediction that was echoed throughout our visits to HMOs. This prediction is supported by data we obtained from one HMO. In 1995, over 90 percent of this plan\u2019s Medicare group membership was \u201clocked into\u201d the HMO for the year. Because of conditions set by the beneficiaries\u2019 former employers, these members could change plans only during annual enrollment periods. Group members filed grievances at a rate 100 times greater than that of individual members who could disenroll monthly. Group members filed 60 times more appeals than individual members.

Some beneficiaries might not join HMOs because, even if dissatisfied with the care they received or denied a procedure they believed was critical, they would have little recourse available.

This allows HMOs time to decide whether they will renew their contract and to adjust premiums and benefits before the new contract cycle begins in January. Depending on the timing of the enrollment period, the announcement of the payment rates might need to occur earlier in the year so that HMOs could set premiums and benefits before Medicare\u2019s open season.

Although such a policy would reinforce the concept of managed care and reduce the opportunities for less healthy HMO enrollees to change to Medicare fee for service, our analysis suggests that the savings might be relatively small. For example, if enrollment and disenrollment had been limited for California beneficiaries in 1994, Medicare savings would have been\u2014at most\u2014$20 million to $30 million.
