This report examines states' use of SSA's verification service, factors that may affect the usefulness of the service, and other tools states use or need to verify identity."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO found that 25 states have used either one or both of the methods SSA offers for requesting SSN verification. Over the last several years, states used the batch and on-line method to submit over 84 million and 13 million requests, respectively. Although on-line use has been increasing, usage varied significantly among states, with 5 out of 18 states submitting over 70 percent of all requests. States decide to use SSA's service based on various factors, such as costs and state priorities. Weaknesses in SSA's design and management of its SSN verification service have contributed to capacity and performance problems and limited its usefulness. While SSA recently increased systems capacity and reduced outages, problems remain. For example, the level of service cannot be assessed because SSA has not established key performance measures. States are concerned that the high verification failure rate adds to their workloads. Several states noted that some of the failures could be prevented if SSA disclosed more information to states. States using the batch method are vulnerable to licensing individuals using SSNs of deceased persons because SSA does not match requests against its death files. In fact, GAO obtained licenses using fraudulent documents and deceased persons' SSNs in 2 states. Driver licensing agencies rely primarily on visual inspection of documents such as birth certificates, driver licenses, and U.S. immigration documents to verify applicants' identity. While states may use safeguards beyond visual inspection to verify documents, they lack the ability to systematically exchange identity information on all drivers with other states. Without a means to readily share all driver records, states face a greater risk for identity theft and fraud in the driver licensing process. A recent Department of Transportation report to Congress identified options that would provide states a system for exchanging records on all drivers and could help mitigate identity fraud."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The events of September 11, 2001, focused attention on the importance of  identifying people who use false identity information or documents,  particularly in the driver licensing process. Driver licenses are a widely  accepted form of identification that individuals frequently use to obtain  services or benefits from federal and state agencies, open a bank account,  request credit, board an airplane, and carry on other important activities of  daily living. For this reason, driver licensing agencies are points at which  individuals may attempt to fraudulently obtain a license using a false  name, social security number (SSN), or other documents such as birth  certificates to secure this key credential. Accordingly, states face  increasing pressure to verify the identity information of individuals to  whom they issue licenses.", "As the agency responsible for issuing SSNs, the Social Security  Administration (SSA) is uniquely positioned to help states verify the  identity information provided by applicants. To this end, SSA has a  verification service in place that allows state driver licensing agencies to  verify the SSN, name, and date of birth of customers with SSA\u2019s master file  of SSN owners. States can transmit requests for SSN verification in two  ways. One is by sending multiple requests together, called the \u201cbatch\u201d  method, to which SSA generally responds within 24 to 48 hours. The other  way is to send an individual request on-line, to which SSA responds  immediately.", "To shed light on states\u2019 practices for verifying the identity information of  driver license applicants, you asked us to examine: (1) the extent to which  states use SSA\u2019s services to verify the SSNs of driver license applicants,   (2) factors that may affect the usefulness of SSA\u2019s verification service, and  (3) other tools states use or need to verify the identity of driver license  applicants. To conduct our work, we reviewed federal requirements  governing SSN use in the driver licensing process, SSA\u2019s policies for  disclosing information to licensing agencies, information on the operation  of SSA\u2019s verification service, and national data on states\u2019 use of the  service. We interviewed key SSA headquarters managers and staff  responsible for the design and oversight of the verification service, as well  as American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators (AAMVA)  officials responsible for co-managing the on-line verification method with  SSA. To develop in-depth information on specific states\u2019 identity  verification practices, we obtained data and interviewed officials from  California, Florida, Georgia, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Ohio,  Pennsylvania, and Tennessee. These states represent a range of identity  verification policies and practices. We also telephoned or visited the states  that did not use SSA\u2019s service to obtain general information about their  identity verification policies and practices. Finally, we analyzed SSA and  state driver licensing agency data to identify instances of potential identity  fraud involving (1) individuals who used the name and SSN of deceased  persons and (2) individuals who used fraudulent out-of-state licenses. We  conducted our work from July 2002 through May 2003 in accordance with  generally accepted government auditing standards. For additional details  on our audit approach, see appendix I."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Driver licenses have become widely accepted identity documents because  they generally include features that make them difficult to counterfeit or  alter and may contain identifying information such as the licensees\u2019 legal  name, photograph, physical description, and signature. Currently, about  188 million drivers are licensed in the United States, and states issue an  additional 73 million licenses and identification cards each year.  Individuals can apply to obtain licenses at about 3,800 locations across the  United States.", "Authority for designing and administering driver licensing programs, as  well as for verifying the identity information of licensees, lies with  individual states. Accordingly, driver licensing agencies face the challenge  of determining whether the identity documents individuals provide (1) are  authentic and contain information that agrees with the issuing agency\u2019s  records and (2) actually belong to the person presenting them. To promote  uniformity among driver licensing programs, AAMVA provides states with  guidance on documents it recommends as acceptable proof of identity, as  well as best practices for verifying the documents. Not surprisingly, the  SSN is key to any verification process because each SSN is unique to its  owner. In February 2002, we reported that 45 states collect SSN  information from driver license applicants.  Individuals obtain SSNs by  applying to SSA and providing evidence of their age, identity, and U.S.  citizenship or lawful alien status.", "As the agency responsible for assigning SSNs and issuing social security  cards, SSA provides a service to the states to verify those numbers. SSA  provides two methods for driver licensing agencies to verify SSNs: batch  and on-line. States use the batch method to submit an aggregate group of  SSN requests directly to SSA, and SSA generally responds within 24 to  48 hours. Those states using the on-line method submit individual SSN  requests and receive immediate \u201creal time\u201d responses from SSA. On-line  users transmit and receive information to and from SSA through a network  maintained by AAMVA. SSA charges states a fee to cover its costs  (basically system processing and personnel) for providing this service.  Batch users pay $0.0015 per transaction while on-line users are charged  $0.03 per transaction. For fiscal year 2002, the total billings for batch and  on-line users were about $39,000 and $193,000, respectively. SSA collects  payments directly from the batch users, while it bills and collects  payments from the on-line users through AAMVA.", "SSA followed Privacy Act requirements in deciding what information it  would disclose to driver licensing agencies. Under its current disclosure  policy, if the SSN, name, and date of birth submitted to SSA by a driver  licensing agency match SSA\u2019s records, SSA will verify the match to the  state driver licensing agency. If one or more elements do not match, SSA  will inform the agency of the nonmatch but will not disclose further  information. match only establishes that the information agrees with SSA\u2019s  records and is not proof that the individual using the SSN is the person to  whom SSA assigned the number.", "Beyond SSA\u2019s verification service, the federal government plays a role in  several other key areas of states\u2019 driver licensing programs. For example,  within the Department of Transportation (DOT), the National Highway  Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) operates the National Driver  Register (NDR), a national database containing identity information on   39 million problem drivers that states are required to use when making  licensing decisions. Also, to remove unsafe commercial drivers from the  highways, the federal government established the Commercial Drivers  License Information System (CDLIS), a nationwide database of 11 million  records that states must use to exchange information on applicants who  may hold commercial licenses in other states or have driving infractions  that make them ineligible for licensing. DOT, the federal agency charged  with establishing the CDLIS database, contracts with AAMVA to operate it.  The federal government also provides grants to help states improve their  highway safety programs. Furthermore, states\u2019 receipt of federal funds for  their state child support enforcement programs are contingent on the  collection of individuals\u2019 SSNs during the driver licensing process. This  provision enables licensing agencies to assist states in locating and  obtaining child support payments from noncustodial parents."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Twenty-five States Have Used SSA\u2019s Verification Service", "paragraphs": ["Twenty-five states have used either the batch or on-line verification  method and the extent to which they regularly use the on-line service  varies.

States generally use the  batch method for a short-term period, but states are more likely to use the  on-line service on a continuous basis. About three-fourths of the states  that rely on SSA\u2019s verification service used the on-line method or a  combination of the on-line and batch method, while the remaining states  used the batch method exclusively. (See fig. 1.) Over the last several years,  states estimated submitting over 84 million requests to SSA using the  batch method. Similarly, states submitted a total of 13 million requests  using the on-line method. Two-thirds of these on-line requests were  submitted in the last 2 fiscal years.", "SSA officials told us that the batch method offers advantages in  circumstances where a real-time verification response is unnecessary. For  example, some states have used the batch method to \u201cclean-up\u201d SSNs in  their existing records and address any discrepancies prior to the license  coming due for renewal at a later date. A number of states that have used  the batch method in this manner subsequently used the on-line method  exclusively. For example, one state that used the batch method in 2001 to  verify over 8.3 million existing records has since used the on-line method  exclusively. SSA officials noted that only one state currently uses the  batch method on a continuous basis to verify SSNs for all of its customers.", "For states that issue permanent licenses on the spot, the on-line service  also offers an advantage, namely, the ability to instantly verify the SSN and  other key information submitted by individuals seeking initial licenses, as  well as those converting out-of-state licenses. Between fiscal years   1998 and 2002, the number of states participating in SSA\u2019s on-line service  grew by about 3 states each year.

The nonverifying states we contacted frequently cited  cost as a reason why they did not use SSA\u2019s verification service. In  addition to the per-transaction fees that SSA charges, states may incur  additional costs to set up and use SSA\u2019s service, including the cost for  computer programming, equipment, staffing, training, and so forth. State  estimates associated with establishing an on-line SSN verification process  with SSA varied considerably based on factors such as the system  modifications they planned to make. For example, one state we contacted  estimated that it would cost approximately $770,000 to implement the on- line service. Another state estimated that using the on-line service would  have a start-up cost of about $230,000.", "Many nonverifying states we contacted expressed a reluctance to use  SSA\u2019s verification service based on performance problems they had heard  were encountered by other states. Some states cited concerns about  frequent outages and slowness of the on-line system. Other states  mentioned that the extra time to verify and resolve SSN problems could  increase customer waiting times because a driver license would not be  issued until verification was complete.", "States\u2019 decisions about whether to use SSA\u2019s service, or the extent to  which to use it, are also driven by internal policies, priorities, and other  concerns. For example, some of the states we visited have policies  requiring their driving licensing agencies to verify all customers\u2019 SSNs.  Officials in one of these states acknowledged that the growing prevalence  of identity theft and the events of September 11, 2001, directly affected  their decision to begin using SSA\u2019s service. Conversely, another state we  visited that had submitted only 51 transactions over a 3-year period told us  that it was delaying full use of SSA\u2019s service until spring 2003 to coincide  with the roll-out of its new driver-license issuance system. Finally, we  found that states may limit their use of the on-line method to certain  targeted populations. For example, one state reported that its policy was  to use the on-line method only if fraud was suspected, while another used  the service only for initial licenses and out-of-state conversions, but not  for renewals of in-state licenses."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Weaknesses in SSA\u2019s Design and Management of the SSN Verification Service Has Limited Its Usefulness", "paragraphs": ["Weaknesses in the design and management of SSA\u2019s on-line verification  service have contributed to capacity and performance problems and  ultimately limited its usefulness.

Beyond system design problems,  SSA\u2019s day-to-day management of the service has also been problematic.  This lack of management attention to the service is evidenced by the fact  that SSA has failed to bill and collect in a timely fashion more than  $370,000 from AAMVA over the last several years. SSA officials have taken  some steps to address system capacity problems, but the agency still lacks  key performance goals for the on-line service.

In designing the  system, SSA connected its server to AAMVA\u2019s network, to which driver  licensing agencies across the country were linked. SSA connected the  two systems using a low-speed data communication line. In 1997, SSA  piloted the on-line service with three states participating. A joint SSA and  AAMVA evaluation of the pilot estimated that the on-line service could  verify 43,200 requests in a 12-hour period or 12.5 million per year. It was  also estimated that states would submit 7.7 million requests in 1998. While  the system experienced some problems during the pilot\u2014such as slow  response times and outages\u2014SSA expressed confidence that its system  would be sufficient to handle all requests. SSA acknowledged that only  limited capacity testing was done. However, SSA planned to monitor the  system\u2019s performance as needed to ensure it could meet states\u2019 needs.", "Following the pilot phase, problems worsened as more states began using  SSA\u2019s service. AAMVA\u2019s data show that in 1999 the system experienced an  average of three major outages per month, increasing to an average of five  per month in 2000. More recent AAMVA data showed that from August  2002 through March 2003, outages continued to occur frequently and  lasted from about 30 minutes to as long as 1 day. Such outages can affect  customer service because employees in one state told us that when the  service is down, they cannot process customers\u2019 transactions. However,  because SSA did not collect or monitor performance data on response  times and outages, SSA did not know the magnitude or specifics of the  problem.", "The capacity problems inherent in the design of the on-line system have  affected states\u2019 use of SSA\u2019s verification service. Officials in one state told  us that they have been forced to scale back their use of the system  because they were told by SSA that the volume of transactions was  overloading the system. In addition, AAMVA representatives told us that  because of concerns about performance and reliability, they have not  allowed new states to use the service since the summer of 2002. At the  time of our review, 10 states had signed agreements with SSA and were  waiting to use the on-line system, and 17 states had received funds from  DOT for the purpose of verifying SSNs with SSA. It is uncertain how  many of the 17 states will ultimately opt to use SSA\u2019s on-line service.  However, even if they signed agreements with SSA today, they may not be  able to use the service until the backlog of waiting states is addressed.", "In addition to design weaknesses, SSA did not sufficiently focus on the  management of its service. In particular, SSA previously lacked a  designated person to oversee the day-to-day operations of the service and  to coordinate with AAMVA on various management issues. As a result,  AAMVA lacked a focal point within SSA to resolve persistent performance  problems that arose with the system. AAMVA officials told us they would  start by calling SSA\u2019s general help desk, as directed by SSA, but would end  up calling several different components within the agency. This situation  impeded the timely and effective resolution of problems necessary to meet  states\u2019 verification needs. SSA\u2019s lack of management attention to the  service is also evidenced by the fact that the agency failed to timely bill  and collect fees from AAMVA over the last several years. Each year SSA is  required to reach agreement with AAMVA on the per transaction cost of its  service. However, for several years SSA and AAMVA have not done this.  Under the agreement, SSA is also required to send AAMVA a final billing  each year based on the number of transactions processed. SSA billed and  collected payments from AAMVA for the first 2 fiscal years\u20141997 and  1998. However, between fiscal years 1999 and 2002, SSA failed to bill and  collect more than $370,000 it calculated as being due from AAMVA.", "SSA and AAMVA officials have acknowledged problems stemming from  the design and management of the on-line service and have made some  necessary improvements. For example, according to SSA, in April 2003 the  service began using software that AAMVA recently revised to increase the  volume of transactions states could submit and receive through AAMVA\u2019s  network. About the same time, SSA completed an upgrade of its data  communication line and server to enhance its system capacity and  response time. SSA officials told us these upgrades should reduce outages  and enhance performance. SSA provided us with information showing that  in May 2003, 2 states had increased their volume of transmissions and an  additional 3 states had begun using the service. SSA plans to add 4 new  states that are currently testing the on-line system. AAMVA estimates that  2003 verification requests may increase to 28 million, more than five times  the number received in 2002. Despite this projection, however, at the time  of our review, SSA still had not established key goals for the level of  service it will provide driver licensing agencies. SSA officials told us they  are currently monitoring the volume of transactions and response times as  new states are added. However, until SSA establishes key goals, the quality  and effectiveness of SSA\u2019s on-line service cannot be fully assessed. More  recently, SSA also designated a project manager responsible for  overseeing the day-to-day operation of its service, as well as an individual  responsible for the billing and collection of AAMVA payments. At the time  of our review, SSA had collected $330,000 from AAMVA for fiscal years  1999-2002.

These problems  pose a concern for states because of the additional workloads associated  with resolving discrepancies between SSA and states\u2019 driver records as  well as the potential for identity theft. SSA\u2019s data over the last 5 years  show that an average of 11 percent of all transactions submitted by states  failed to verify with SSA\u2019s records. Some states have experienced  nonmatch rates as high as 30 percent. In fiscal year 2002, about   800,000 records failed verification. Generally, about one-half of these  failed because the name submitted with the SSN did not match the name  in SSA\u2019s records. Such mismatches may occur, for example, if a person\u2019s  SSN record lists a maiden name, but the person is applying for a license  under a married name. The states and AAMVA have voiced their concerns  to SSA about the need for additional disclosure of information. In a May  2001 letter to one state, SSA\u2019s Acting Deputy Commissioner specified the  agency\u2019s disclosure policy for driver licensing agencies and stated that  SSA closely scrutinizes requests involving SSN use for purposes not  related to the Social Security program. In doing so, SSA has decided to  provide its verification service in a limited manner by informing driver  licensing agencies which data elements match or do not match.", "State concerns about the potential workloads associated with resolving  nonmatch issues may affect their willingness to fully use SSA\u2019s service.  Officials in one state told us that a planned start up of the on-line service  may be delayed due to concerns about the high nonmatch rate they have  experienced using SSA\u2019s batch service. Officials in another state indicated  that they have not done a batch clean up of their existing databases  because they are unable to devote the additional funding and staff  resources to address nonverification issues. SSA officials told us that they  are aware of states\u2019 concerns and have recently begun discussions to  address disclosure issues with the states.", "In reviewing SSA\u2019s verification service, we also identified a key weakness  in the batch method that exposes states to a higher risk of fraud by  allowing them to inadvertently issue licenses to individuals using the SSNs  of deceased individuals. Unlike the on-line service, SSA does not match  batch requests against its death records. As a result, the batch method will  not identify and prevent the issuance of a license in cases where an SSN of  a deceased individual is being used. SSA officials told us that they initially  developed the batch method several years ago, and they did not design the  system to match SSNs against its death files. However, a death match was  built into the on-line system. At the time of our review, SSA acknowledged  that it had not explicitly informed states about the limitation of the batch  service.", "Our own analysis of 1 month of SSN transactions submitted to SSA by one  state using the batch method identified at least 44 cases in which  individuals used the SSN, name, and date of birth of persons listed as  deceased in SSA\u2019s records to obtain a license or an identification card.  We forwarded this information to state investigators who quickly  confirmed that licenses or identification cards had been issued in 41 cases  and were continuing to investigate the others. To further assess states\u2019  vulnerability in this area, our own investigators, working in an undercover  capacity, were able to obtain licenses in two batch states using a  counterfeit out-of-state license and other fraudulent documents and the  SSNs of deceased persons. In both states, driver licensing employees  accepted the documents we submitted as valid. Our investigators  completed the transactions in one state and left with the new valid  license. In the second state, the new permanent license arrived by mail  within weeks. The ease in which they were able to obtain these licenses  confirmed states\u2019 vulnerability to accepting fraudulent documents, and for  those states that use SSA\u2019s batch process, to issuing licenses to individuals  using SSNs of deceased individuals. SSA officials have told us that the  agency has not made a decision about whether the current batch system  will be modified to include a death match.", "Our field work shows that licensing officials in states that use or have used  the batch process were often unaware that SSA did not match SSNs  against its death records.

Accordingly,  several of the states we visited have periodically used electronic queries or  data matches to access birth or death records.", "Three of the nine states we visited were pilot-testing or considering the  use of private vendors to strengthen their identity verification and fraud  detection procedures. These private vendors typically access various  information sources, including civil and criminal records, credit  information, address information, state driver records, and state birth and  death data to help driver licensing agencies corroborate information  provided by applicants and correctly issue licenses. At the time of our  review, one state was pilot-testing on-line access to a private vendor in a  limited number of sites. AAMVA officials did not have national data on the  extent to which other states are using innovative third-party verification  tools to strengthen the integrity of their licensing procedures. However,  they generally noted that such practices are not routinely used to  supplement states\u2019 primary practice of visually inspecting documents.", "Several states we visited made extensive use of computer systems to  prevent identity theft and fraud. Several states have computer systems  capable of screening for multiple individuals in their state with the same  or similar identity information. For example, one state\u2019s computer system  automatically cross-matches first-time applicants\u2019 personal information  against existing driver records in the database to search for such  situations. When states do not have the capability to routinely perform  such cross-matches, employees may inadvertently issue licenses to  individuals who may be using the identity information of someone the  state has previously licensed.", "Some states\u2019 computer systems are designed to prevent the issuance of a  license in certain high-risk situations. For example, one state\u2019s system  terminates the processing of a transaction if identity information does not  verify with SSA, or if staff attempt to by-pass this verification step. Staff  are also prevented from overriding the system and issuing the license  unless an authorized person\u2014generally a higher-level official\u2014intervenes.  Similarly, some states had systems that could prevent issuance of a license  if an individual\u2019s personal information already existed in the states\u2019 driver  records, or DHS information failed to verify. Further, in cases where fraud  is suspected, most states\u2019 systems\u2014although not all\u2014are capable of  flagging the transaction and automatically transmitting this information to  other offices within the state to prevent persons from \u201cshopping\u201d sites  once they were denied at the first location. Officials in one state that  lacked this protection told us that in cases of suspected fraud, staff relied  on manual processes such as telephone calls and e-mails to alert other  offices about suspicious individuals and false documents.", "Finally, to varying degrees, the states we visited have instituted additional  controls to better address identity theft and fraud issues. Due to concerns  about the quality and integrity of other state licensing systems, three states  prohibit or limit the acceptance of out-of-state licenses as a sole or  primary identity document. Officials from another state told us that they  would not accept such documents from 20 states that they have  determined to have less stringent verification processes. A few other  states have also instituted policies requiring that two employees review or  sign-off on the authenticity of documents provided by applicants before a  license can be issued. This separation of responsibilities provides for  additional scrutiny of documents and may act as a further check against  employee fraud. Another common practice among several states was to  copy all identity documents if during the application process, fraud was  suspected. This provides the licensing agency with key information for  investigating the individual\u2019s alleged identity. An official in one state told  us that staff are trained to collect and copy identity documents upfront  regardless of whether fraud is suspected at the time.", "All nine states we visited also store and transmit information such as  digital photographs and signatures for verification purposes. Two states  also captured fingerprints at the time of application, but only one of them  used biometric technology to electronically verify this identity information  for individuals renewing licenses. Another safeguard used by two states is  the issuance of temporary licenses when identity information has not been  corroborated at the time of application. Such licenses lack photographs  and security features common to permanent licenses or clearly state that  they are not valid for identity verification purposes. However, a third  state\u2019s temporary license looks the same and includes identical  information as its permanent license. As a result, this license could  continue to be presented as an identity document by individuals even if  the circumstances under which it was issued are ultimately determined to  be fraudulent."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "States Lack a Systematic Means to Exchange Records on All Drivers", "paragraphs": ["Despite the additional safeguards taken by some states, licensing agencies  lack a systematic means to exchange information on all drivers  nationwide, limiting their ability to deter identity theft and fraud.  Currently, states have automated access and are required to use the NDR,  which is a DOT database of 39 million problem drivers. With this system,  licensing agencies have the ability to simultaneously query all 50 states to  determine whether an applicant\u2019s name appears in the database. For  commercial drivers, states obtain information on their licensing,  identification, and disqualification from the CDLIS database of 11 million  records. States are required to input driver information into CDLIS and to  use the system to verify commercial driver record information during the  licensing process.", "Because the NDR and CDLIS target specific driver populations and do not  include the records and identity information of the approximately   188 million drivers operating in the United States, state driver licensing  agencies lack a single inquiry process to determine whether or not a  person has ever been issued a license. Numerous officials in the states we  visited told us that having a more efficient means of electronic interstate  communications, that included the electronic transfer of identity  information such as digital photographs and signatures, would improve  the integrity of their licensing process. Officials in the states we visited  were particularly concerned about individuals using licenses issued by  other states as identity documents and their inability to quickly query all  states\u2019 databases to corroborate key information. As a result, states are  limited in their ability to determine whether other states\u2019 identity  documents are authentic or to identify multiple individuals using the same  personal identifying information in other states.", "Our analysis of one state\u2019s data demonstrates the potential vulnerabilities  driver licensing agencies currently face when accepting out-of-state  licenses as proof of identity. We examined data from one state\u2019s internal  state cross-match of its existing driving records and identified numerous  instances where the same out-of-state license number had been used by  multiple individuals with different names and dates of birth to apply for  and obtain a new license. We forwarded about 100 of these license  numbers to the alleged issuing state and asked them to provide us with  key information on the owner of record. We found 96 cases of potential  identity fraud involving 52 of the driver licenses numbers. For example,  states reported some license numbers as invalid or as being issued to  someone other than the persons that had used them. One state reported  back that the license number we submitted to them was actually a zip  code, rather than a genuine state-issued license number. Another license  was reported by the issuing state to be a valid number that had been  counterfeited and used in several states.", "A July 2001 report to the Congress prepared by DOT in cooperation with  AAMVA, identified alternatives to improving state data exchanges and  discussed various options for change. The specialized nature of NDR and  CDLIS does not allow states to verify licenses for all drivers\u2014a means to  identify potential identity fraud. However, the report concluded that an  alternative system encompassing all driver records could operate  efficiently using existing programs developed for CDLIS and on hardware  that is currently in use. However, the report also concluded that before  such a system could be developed, several potential obstacles should be  addressed. These include agreeing on the use of a unique identifier by  which to query all state driving records, ensuring that all states participate,  defining the role of the federal government, and funding the costs of  developing and converting to an all-driver system. The report also  acknowledged that state resources for development and implementation  would be necessary to cover projected costs, which AAMVA has estimated  to be about $78 million over 3 years. However, the report concluded that,  once operational, user fees similar to those imposed for CDLIS could be  levied by states to cover operational expenses."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["The driver license is a key identity document that can be used by  individuals to obtain a range of public and private services nationwide.  Accordingly, state driver license agencies face a daunting task in ensuring  that the identity information of those to whom they issue licenses is  verified. However, states\u2019 effectiveness in this area is often dependent on  several factors, including the receipt of timely and accurate identity  information from SSA, the extent to which they implement additional  identity verification and fraud detection tools, and their ability to quickly  and systematically share key driving record information with other state  licensing systems. Deficiencies in any of these areas may weaken states\u2019  efforts to ensure the integrity of their licensing decisions.", "Unfortunately, design and management weaknesses associated with SSA\u2019s  verification service have limited its effectiveness. States that are unable to  take full advantage of the service and others that are waiting for the  opportunity to use it remain vulnerable to identity theft and fraud. SSA\u2019s  recent efforts to refocus management attention on improving its service  represents a positive step and may be key to moving more state licensing  agencies away from processes that rely heavily on fraud-prone visual  inspections of identity documents, to one in which information such as an  individual\u2019s SSN, name, and date of birth can be quickly and independently  corroborated. However, sustained attention to improving its service is  needed. Furthermore, states that continue to rely primarily or partly on  SSA\u2019s batch verification service still risk issuing licenses to individuals  using the SSNs and other identity information of deceased individuals.  This remains a critical flaw in SSA\u2019s service and states\u2019 efforts to  strengthen the integrity of the driver license.", "Since September 11th, more state driver licensing agencies have begun to  reassess their prior view that driver licenses are simply an authorization to  operate a motor vehicle and have taken aggressive actions to strengthen  the integrity of this important identity document. However, licensing  programs remain state-administered and may vary considerably in the  tools provided to front-line staff to verify identity information, such as  access to automated independent third-party data sources. This has  potentially serious consequences for the numerous public and private  sector service providers who rely on the driver license as an identity  document, but may be unaware that not all states\u2019 licenses are equal in  terms of the integrity of the identifying information included on them.", "Beyond the actions taken by individual states, coordination and data  sharing is key to addressing many of the factors that allow identity theft  and fraud to continue in the driver licensing process. No single state has  overarching authority to require information sharing nationwide, define  minimum standards for proof of identity, or mandate the development of a  systematic means for interstate communication. However, cooperative  efforts between the federal government, the states, and AAMVA have  identified and facilitated technological options for improving the exchange  of driver record data among all states. We recognize that potential barriers  related to system\u2019s design, funding, privacy rights, and states\u2019 willingness  to use such a tool have yet to be fully resolved. However, given the  potential economic and national security implications associated with  identity theft at the point of driver licensing, sustained leadership at the  federal level could be the catalyst for needed change."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Matter for Congressional Consideration", "paragraphs": ["In light of the homeland security implications associated with states\u2019  inability to systematically exchange driver license identity information and  the need for sustained leadership in this area, the Congress, in partnership  with the states, should consider authorizing the development of a national  data sharing system for driver records."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["Considering the significant increase in the number of on-line requests that  SSA anticipates receiving from states, as well as the weaknesses that we  identified in SSA\u2019s service that may increase states\u2019 vulnerability to  identity fraud, we recommend that the Commissioner of Social Security  take the following actions:    Develop performance measures essential to assessing the quality of the  service provided.", "Develop a strategy for improving the nonmatch rate for SSA\u2019s verification  service.

We also requested that AAMVA officials  review the technical accuracy of our discussion of AAMVA\u2019s role in the  SSN verification process, as well as our characterization of states\u2019 identity  verification and fraud prevention activities. We incorporated AAMVA\u2019s  comments in the report as appropriate.", "SSA generally agreed with our findings regarding its SSN verification  service and said that recent improvements have increased states\u2019 use of  the service. The agency noted that it is continuing to investigate the  sequence of events surrounding our ability to obtain driver licenses with  counterfeit documents and the SSNs of deceased individuals. SSA also  said that its service only offers confirmation that SSNs and other identity  information provided by driver license applicants are consistent with its  records and should not be perceived as a means for verifying identity.  Also, SSA said that any attempts to reduce the nonmatch rate for its  service by relaxing the match criteria would be inconsistent with the need  for \u201ctighter match requirements\u201d and increased security in the post   9/11 era. We agree that SSA\u2019s service does not allow states to definitively  determine the identity of driver license applicants and have made small  changes to ensure that our report will not be misinterpreted. However, we  continue to believe that the verification service, in combination with other  verification tools used by the states, is key to corroborating the identity  information presented by driver license applicants. We also are not  suggesting that SSA compromise the integrity of its verification service in  order to reduce the nonmatch rate. However, our report shows that about  half of all verification failures are for name mismatches. Such mismatches  are thought to commonly occur due to changes in marital status. We  continue to believe that opportunities exist for SSA to work with the states  to explore options for addressing this issue and to ultimately improve the  overall quality of its service.", "In response to our specific recommendations, SSA disagreed that it should  develop measures for assessing the quality of its SSN on-line verification  service. Instead, SSA said that it plans to develop a performance baseline  for enumeration accuracy to measure whether applicants were entitled to  receive an SSN based on supporting documentation. SSA did not believe  that developing performance measures specifically for its verification  service would result in improved identity authentication. However, we  continue to believe that the verification service, in combination with other  tools used by the states, is key to corroborating driver license applicants\u2019  identity information. As our report notes, performance concerns and  issues often affected the extent to which states used SSA\u2019s verification  service, or whether they opted to use the service at all. Thus, some states  lacked a key tool for corroborating the identity information of driver  license applicants. We continue to believe that SSA should develop  measures for its service to monitor and assess systems availability,  outages, response times and other key aspects of performance. Without  such measures, SSA lacks a means to identify performance problems and  take corrective actions when needed.", "SSA agreed with our recommendations that it develop a strategy for  improving the nonmatch rate for its service and that it modify the batch  process to include a match against its death records. However, the agency  said that factors such as legal restrictions on the information it may  disclose to states and limited systems resources could restrict the actions  it can take. Indeed, we encourage SSA to work within the existing law to  develop policies to reduce nonmatches and to better assist states when  they occur.  Also, in view of states\u2019 vulnerability to licensing individuals  using deceased persons\u2019 SSN information and the volume of batch  verification requests submitted to SSA by the states, we believe immediate  action is needed.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Commissioner of SSA and other  interested parties.

To attain our  objectives, we obtained and reviewed various reports related to the issue  of identity verification from state auditors, SSA\u2019s Office of Inspector  General, and the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators  (AAMVA). We reviewed federal requirements governing social security  number (SSN) use in the driver licensing process, SSA\u2019s policies for  disclosing identity information to licensing agencies, and numerous  verification agreements between SSA and the states. We analyzed  nationwide data on states\u2019 use of SSA\u2019s verification service, including the  volume of records submitted, trends in usage, and the rate at which SSNs  failed to verify between October 1997 through May 2003. We interviewed  SSA officials responsible for the SSN verification data with regard to the  reliability of the data, and determined the data to be sufficiently reliable  for our reporting purposes. We telephoned or visited states that were not  using SSA\u2019s service to obtain general information about their identity  verification practices, as well as their plans for using SSA\u2019s service in the  future.", "To obtain more specific information on the design and management of  SSA\u2019s batch and on-line verification service, we interviewed key SSA line  and management officials as well as AAMVA officials responsible for co- managing the on-line service.

To determine batch service states\u2019  vulnerability to individuals who may use deceased persons\u2019 SSNs to obtain  a license, we matched approximately 500,000 batch verification requests  submitted by one state for the month of December 2002 against SSA\u2019s  Master Death file. We identified 44 instances in which SSA verified an SSN  submitted by the state that matched an SSN in the death record where the  death occurred before December 2002. In order to determine whether  these individuals actually received a license or identity card, we submitted  the 44 cases to the state licensing agency for its review. The state officials  confirmed that licenses or identification cards had been issued in 41 cases  and are currently reviewing the remaining cases. Because we selected a  judgmental sample of cases to review, our findings are not generalizable to  the entire state over time or to any other state.", "To gain more in-depth information on specific challenges states may  encounter in their efforts to verify applicant identity documents, as well as  their policies and procedures for doing so, we conducted field work in  California, Florida, Georgia, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Ohio,  Pennsylvania, and Tennessee. At these locations we interviewed key  management and line staff and obtained data and documents relative to  their verification processes and tools. We selected states that were  geographically dispersed to obtain a mix that (1) did, and did not, issue  temporary licenses before issuing permanent licenses, and (2) have, and  have not, used one or both of SSA\u2019s verification services.
