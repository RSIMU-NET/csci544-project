Social Security retirement benefits and traditional defined benefit (DB) pension plans, both key sources of retirement income that promise lifetime benefits, are now required to make payments to retirees for an increasing number of years. This development, among others, has prompted a wide range of possible actions to help curb the rising future liabilities for the federal government and DB sponsors. For example, to address financial challenges for the Social Security program, various options have been proposed, such as adjusting tax contributions, retirement age, and benefit amounts. Individuals also face challenges resulting from increases in life expectancy because they must save more to provide for the possibility of a longer retirement.", "Life expectancy varies substantially across different groups with significant effects on retirement resources, especially for those with low incomes. For example, according to studies GAO reviewed, lower-income men approaching retirement live, on average, 3.6 to 12.7 fewer years than higher-income men. GAO developed hypothetical scenarios to calculate the projected amount of lifetime Social Security retirement benefits received, on average, for men with different income levels born in the same year. In these scenarios, GAO compared projected benefits based on each income groups' shorter or longer life expectancy with projected benefits based on average life expectancy, and found that lower-income groups' shorter-than-average life expectancy reduced their projected lifetime benefits by as much as 11 to 14 percent. Effects on Social Security retirement benefits are particularly important to lower-income groups because Social Security is their primary source of retirement income.", "Social Security's formula for calculating monthly benefits is progressive\u2014that is, it provides a proportionally larger monthly earnings replacement for lower-earners than for higher-earners.

As a result, some proposed actions to address  the fiscal effects of longevity on retirement programs and plan sponsors  may impact lower-income and higher-income individuals differently. In  light of this situation, you asked us to examine disparities in life  expectancy and the implications for our nation\u2019s policies with respect to  retirement security. This report provides information on the following:  1.  The implications of increasing life expectancy for retirement planning.  2.  The effect of life expectancy on the retirement resources for different  groups, especially those with low incomes.", "To explore the implications of increasing life expectancy for retirement  planning, we reviewed existing publications, including federal agency  documentation and studies on life expectancy for individuals around  retirement age conducted by various researchers and federal agencies.  We also interviewed agency officials and retirement experts, including  researchers and academics we identified through our review of longevity  studies and through expert referral. In addition, to examine the effect of  life expectancy on the retirement resources for different groups,  especially those with lower incomes, we developed scenarios to illustrate  how disparities in average life expectancy by income group can affect the  average amount of lifetime Social Security retirement benefits received by  different income groups. To determine our scenario assumptions, we  reviewed relevant longevity studies. For our life expectancy estimates,  we relied primarily on a 2007 Social Security Administration (SSA) study  by Hilary Waldron. To inform the income groupings in our scenarios  (based on the 25th and 75th individual income percentiles), we analyzed  2015 data from the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s (Census) Current Population  Survey. We obtained estimated monthly Social Security benefits using  SSA\u2019s quick calculator, and we estimated average lifetime Social  Security benefits by applying life expectancy estimates from SSA and  Waldron. While our report discusses various forms of retirement  resources, for our scenarios we compare only lifetime Social Security  retirement benefits against current income. We do not factor in other  retirement resources, which could include, but are not limited to, future  payments from employer-sponsored defined benefit plans, retirement  savings accounts, or housing equity. (For details on the methodology for  our scenarios, see appendix II.) We assessed the reliability of the data we  used in our scenarios by reviewing relevant documentation and  interviewing knowledgeable agency officials.

Life  expectancy can be expressed in two different ways: (1) as the average  number of years of life remaining for a group, or (2) as the average age at  death for a group. Life span for a particular individual within a group may  fall above or below this average. Researchers use a variety of statistical  methods and assumptions in making their estimates, such as how  longevity trends are expected to change in the future. Researchers also  may use different data sources to develop life expectancy estimates. For  example, some may use death data maintained by SSA, while others may  use Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) mortality data or  Census data.", "As noted, life expectancy can be estimated from different initial ages,  such as from birth or from some older age. For a given population, the  earlier the starting age, the greater the remaining years of life expectancy,  but the lower the average age at death. This is because, when projected  from birth, measures of life expectancy reflect the probability of death  over one\u2019s entire lifetime, including from childhood infectious diseases. In  contrast, life expectancy calculated at older ages, such as age 65,  generally predicts that individuals will live to an older age than when life  expectancy is calculated at birth, since the averages for older persons do  not include those who have died before that age. As a result, the average  age that will be reached from birth will be lower than the average age that  will be reached by those who have already reached age 65.", "Studies have found various factors associated with disparities in life  expectancy. For example, women tend to live longer than men, although  that gap has been getting smaller, according to SSA data. In addition,  65-year-old men could expect to live until age 79.7 in 1915, on average;  in 2015, they could expect to live until age 86.1\u2014an increase of about 6.4  years.

Other factors that have been shown to be  associated with differences in life expectancy include income, race,  education, and geography. A recent study examined trends in life  expectancy at the county level from 1985 to 2010 and found increasing  disparities across counties over the 25-year period, especially in certain  areas of the country. The lowest life expectancy for both men and  women was found in the South, the Mississippi basin, West Virginia,  Kentucky, and selected counties in the West and Midwest. In contrast,  substantial improvements in life expectancy were found in multiple  locations: parts of California, most of Nevada, Colorado, rural Minnesota,  Iowa, parts of the Dakotas, some Northeastern states, and parts of  Florida. The study found that while income, education, and economic  inequality are likely important factors, they are not the only determinants  of the increasing disparity across counties.

This includes jobs covering about 94 percent of  U.S. workers in 2014, according to SSA. Social Security retirement  benefits offer two features that offset some key risks people face in  retirement: (1) they provide a monthly stream of payments that continue  until death, so that there is no risk of outliving a person\u2019s benefits; and (2)  they are generally adjusted annually for cost-of-living increases, so there  is less risk of inflation eroding the value of a person\u2019s benefits.", "Social Security retirement benefits are based on a worker\u2019s earnings  history in covered employment. The formula for calculating monthly  benefits is progressive, which means that Social Security replaces a  higher percentage of monthly earnings for lower-earners than for higher- earners. As we reported in 2015, retired workers with relatively lower  average career earnings receive monthly benefits that, on average, equal  about half of what they made while working, whereas workers with  relatively high career earnings receive benefits that equal about 30  percent of earnings. In 2013, SSA reported that the program provided at  least half of retirement income for 64 percent of beneficiaries age 65 or  older in 2011 and that 35 percent of beneficiaries in this age range  received 90 percent or more of their income from Social Security.", "For retired workers, Social Security pays full (unreduced) benefits at the  full retirement age, which ranges from 65 to 67 depending on an  individual\u2019s birth year. Workers can claim Social Security retirement  benefits as early as age 62, resulting in a reduced monthly benefit, or can  delay claiming after they reach full retirement age, resulting in an  increased monthly benefit until age 70 (i.e., no further increases are  provided for delayed claiming after age 70). According to SSA  documentation, the Social Security benefit formula adjusts the amount of  monthly benefits to reflect the average remaining life expectancy at each  claiming age. More specifically, benefits are adjusted up or down based  on claiming age so that, on average, the actuarial present value of a  beneficiary\u2019s total lifetime benefits is about the same regardless of  claiming age. For example, workers currently age 62 who would reach  full retirement age at 66 would receive a monthly benefit about 25 percent  lower if claiming early, at age 62, compared with the benefit that would be  paid at their full retirement age. Those delaying claiming until age 70  would receive about 32 percent more per month than their full retirement  age benefit, according to SSA.", "Despite higher monthly benefits for those who delay claiming, in 2014,  age 62 was the most prevalent age to claim Social Security retirement  benefits: About 37 percent of total retired worker benefits awarded were  awarded at age 62. When workers die before reaching age 62, they  may not receive any of the Social Security retirement benefits that they  would have been entitled to receive had they lived longer.

The amount of the  annuity provided by a DB plan is determined according to a formula  specified by the plan, and is typically based on factors such as salary,  years of service, and age at retirement.

Also, challenges facing the DI trust fund have affected  OASI.

As of 2012, more than 85 percent of single-employer DB  plans were underfunded by a total of more than $800 billion, according to  the most recent data available from the Pension Benefit Guaranty  Corporation (PBGC).

In 2012, more than 40 percent of single- employer DB plans were frozen in some form, according to the most  recent data available from PBGC, and many frozen plans are ultimately  terminated, which can shift the risk of ensuring an adequate lifetime  retirement income to individuals, as discussed below.", "External de-risking involves closing the plan completely (referred to as  terminating the plan) or reducing the size of the plan by transferring a  portion of plan liabilities, plan assets, and their associated risk to external  parties\u2014typically either to participants or to an insurance company. For  example, an employer may terminate its DB plan, if it can fund all of the  benefits owed through the purchase of a group annuity contract from an  insurance company (sometimes called a \u201cgroup annuity buy-out\u201d). Short  of termination, an employer can also transfer a portion of plan assets and  liabilities to an insurance company for a certain group of plan participants,  such as former employees with vested benefits. Alternatively, an  employer may, under certain circumstances, terminate its DB plan by  paying all the benefits owed in another form, such as by providing a lump  sum to each participant or beneficiary of the plan, if the plan permits. The  employer could also opt to make a lump sum buy-out offer only to certain  plan participants. When such an offer is made, plan participants have a  specified amount of time, known as the lump sum \u201cwindow,\u201d to choose  between keeping their lifetime annuity or taking a lump sum.

For example, a survey conducted by the  Society of Actuaries showed that there is a greater tendency for retired  respondents to underestimate rather than overestimate their life  expectancy. In addition, many individuals will live beyond their life  expectancy in any case, since it is an average. Further, as we reported in  2015, older workers tend to retire sooner than they expected. Coupled  with increasing life expectancy, this means they will likely spend more  years in retirement than anticipated. In 2015, more than a third of  workers surveyed by the Employee Benefit Research Institute reported  that they expected to retire at age 66 or later and an additional 10 percent  expected to never retire; however, only 14 percent of current retirees  reported that they retired after age 65. Similarly, 9 percent of workers said  they expected to retire before age 60, while 36 percent of current retirees  reported they retired earlier. The median age of retirement reported was  age 62. Additionally, only 48 percent of those surveyed had calculated  how much in savings they would need for retirement.", "Beyond underestimating life expectancy, individuals preparing for  retirement face a number of additional challenges in accumulating  retirement savings sufficient to sustain them for their lifetime.

In previous work, we found that among  those not participating, 84 percent reported that their employer did not  offer a plan or they were not eligible for the program their employer  offered. Those that do participate in employer-sponsored retirement  plans are increasingly offered access only to DC plans, which\u2014unlike DB  plans\u2014do not typically provide a guaranteed monthly benefit for life. For  many of these participants, the level of savings accumulated in their DC  retirement accounts at the time they leave the workforce will not be  sufficient to sustain their retirement. Moreover, employer-sponsored DC  plans typically offer only an account balance at retirement, leaving  participants to identify longevity risks and manage how they will draw  down their funds over the course of their retirement.", "To help address individuals\u2019 difficultly in estimating their life expectancy  and the resources needed to avoid outliving their savings, the federal  government, plan sponsors, and others have developed certain tools to  aid with retirement planning. For example, benefits calculators assist  participants in translating their savings into potential annual retirement  income. One such calculator, available on the U.S. Department of Labor\u2019s  website, assumes survival to age 95, which is beyond the average life  expectancy for individuals currently age 65. To encourage saving  among those who lack access to employer-sponsored plans, in  November 2015, myRA, a federal government-managed retirement  savings program, was opened to individuals below a certain income  threshold. Also, as we reported in 2015, a number of states are  exploring strategies to expand private sector coverage for people who  otherwise do not have access to a plan. In addition, for those with  employer-sponsored plans, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 included  provisions that made it easier for certain DC plan sponsors to implement  automatic enrollment and automatic escalation so that workers can be  defaulted into plan participation with rising contributions over time.  Default investment arrangements, including target date funds which  invest according to length of time until retirement, can also help  participants to maintain a balanced investment portfolio with a level of risk  that is appropriate to their retirement dates. Moreover, to provide greater  assurance that individuals with DC plans will not outlive their savings,  some plan sponsors are adding an annuity option at retirement. In  addition, Internal Revenue Service (IRS) regulations that went into effect  in July 2014 allow for a Qualified Longevity Annuity Contract whereby  participants in 401(k) and other qualified DC plans and traditional IRAs  may use a portion of their accounts to purchase annuities that begin  payout no later than age 85.", "In sum, despite the efforts by the federal government, plan sponsors, and  others to encourage greater retirement savings, many individuals may not  be adequately prepared for retirement.

It is not unexpected  for life expectancy estimates to vary as they depend, among other things,  on the particular data sources, populations, and age ranges analyzed.  While the studies we reviewed found a range of life expectancy  differences by income, each of them finds that disparities exist.", "Moreover, disparities in life expectancy by income have grown, according  to the studies that examined trends over time (see table 3).

Similarly, for women, the studies we reviewed found differences in  life expectancy by income were greater in more recent years, and the  range in years was wider than for men. This is perhaps unsurprising, as  some analysts have noted that disparities in household income also  increased over time. According to a 2014 Congressional Budget Office  (CBO) report, between 1979 and 2011, average real after-tax earnings for  the top one percent of households grew about four times as fast as those  in the lowest fifth.", "While higher-income groups have experienced significant growth in their  life expectancy at older ages, lower-income groups have either  experienced less growth or declines in recent decades, according to  studies we reviewed.

Some other studies estimate that life  expectancy declined for those in the bottom of the income distribution.  For instance, a 2015 study by the National Academy of Sciences found  that life expectancy at age 50 has declined for both men and women in  the bottom income quintile. Specifically, men and women in the bottom  income quintile saw life expectancy decreases of 0.5 and 4 years,  respectively, when comparing the 1930 and 1960 cohorts.

Other studies have also examined links with  education and found that individuals with a high school degree or less  tend to have shorter lives than those with a college education.

Specifically, we calculated the  effect of increasing all retirement ages by 2 years and found that the  overall projected lifetime benefit is reduced more for lower-income men  than for higher-income men, given their different life expectancy.

Specifically, the study found that raising the full retirement age to 70  resulted in reducing lifetime benefits for men with income in the bottom  quintile by 25 percent, while reducing lifetime benefits for men with  income in the top quintile by 20 percent.

In a  2014 report, we concluded that people who claim Social Security benefits  early, such as those with physically-demanding blue collar jobs, may have  done so because they faced challenges continuing to work at older  ages. Similarly, in a 2010 report, we noted that many older workers  could face health or physical challenges that would prevent them from  working longer. For example, in that report we found that the workers  who report more difficulty working longer and postponing retirement due  to work-limiting health conditions tend to have less education and lower  household income than those who do not report health limitations. For  these individuals, raising the early or full retirement age could erode an  important safety net.", "Some policies have been proposed to mitigate the potential adverse  effects of raising the early or full retirement age on those with lower  incomes and shorter life expectancies. For example, some researchers  have suggested making early or full retirement ages lower for those with  lower lifetime earnings, though others have suggested that this may be  difficult to implement.

These proposals could have  a negative effect on the projected long-term solvency of Social Security,  although compensating revisions could help moderate costs.", "Therefore, in sum, proposals to address Social Security\u2019s financial  challenges may affect different groups differently.
