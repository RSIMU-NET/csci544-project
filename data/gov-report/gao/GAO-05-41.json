These services included support for government operations, infrastructure improvements, nutrition assistance, the school system, special education, airport and highway infrastructure improvements, Medicaid, and early childhood education. A shortage of adequately trained professionals, such as accountants and teachers, as well as inadequate facilities and limited local funds hampered service delivery or slowed project completion for many of the grants. For example, American Samoa's only hospital lacked an adequate number of U.S.-certified medical staff. Further, the hospital had persistent and serious fire-safety code deficiencies that jeopardized its ability to maintain the certification required for Medicaid funding. American Samoa's failure to complete single audits, federal agencies' slow reactions to this failure, and instances of theft and fraud limited accountability for the 12 grants to American Samoa. The American Samoa government did not comply with the Single Audit Act during fiscal years 1998-2003. The 1998-2000 audit reports, completed in 2003, and the 2001 audit report, completed in 2004, cited pervasive governmentwide and program-specific accountability problems. Despite the audits' delinquency, federal agencies were slow, or failed, to communicate concern to the American Samoa government or to take corrective action. In addition, accountability for all of the grants was potentially undermined by instances of theft and fraud. For example, the American Samoa Chief Procurement Officer, whose office handles procurements for most of the grants GAO reviewed, was convicted of illegal procurement practices."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["American Samoa, a U.S. territory, relies on federal funding to support its  general government operations and deliver critical services; over the last 5  years, federal awards to the territory represented, on average, about 45  percent of the territory\u2019s operating budget.

Although no congressional act formally  establishes a government structure in American Samoa, the territory has its  own local government and constitution. Those born in American Samoa are  U.S. nationals. Since 1977, a popularly elected governor has headed the  American Samoan executive branch for a 4-year term, and the legislature,  or Fono, has comprised 18 elected senators and 20 elected representatives.

The working group made  recommendations to the American Samoa government, which pledged to  implement a financial recovery plan based on these recommendations.  Beginning in fiscal year 1997, the Senate Appropriations Committee  directed DOI to withhold $2 million of capital improvement funding from  the territory until DOI could certify that the American Samoan government  had adequately implemented the recovery plan. However, the territory\u2019s  financial situation subsequently worsened and, in 1999, Congress  authorized a direct federal loan to American Samoa for $18.6 million to  pay debts and implement reforms.

DOI capital improvement  grants, which average about $1.5 million annually for the hospital,  support only one or two new construction projects per year. According  to hospital officials, the hospital depends entirely on federal grant  funds to support its infrastructure upgrades, including those needed to  correct the fire-safety deficiencies cited by HHS hospital certification  surveys.", "Two key sources of revenue for LBJ Hospital, from DOI and the  American Samoa government, did not increase during the period of our  review (see fig. 3). The hospital\u2019s annual subsidy from the government  of American Samoa dropped from about $8.1 million in fiscal year 1998  to about $5.3 million in fiscal year 2003. During the same period, DOI  directly provided LBJ Hospital about $7.8 million of the government  operations grant annually without adjusting this amount for inflation.  Although the Medicaid grant increased over time to cover the cost of  inflation, HHS officials reported that the cap on the Medicaid grant  resulted in a smaller federal contribution than American Samoa would  have received if funded like the 50 states. A hospital official reported  that patient revenues increased during fiscal years 1998-2003 but that  much greater increases would be needed if the hospital could not  identify other sources of revenue. The LBJ Medical Center Authority  has proposed to charge service fees to patients to cover about 20  percent of the cost of their medical care. However, hospital officials  believed that the local legislation needed to change such fees would be  difficult to obtain, because the public views free medical care as an  entitlement. Currently, the hospital charges residents a facility fee of $5  per outpatient visit and $20 per day for inpatient stays. The hospital  charges nonresidents $10 for outpatient visits and $100 per day for  inpatient stays.", "American Samoa airport officials reported that they lacked the local  resources to complement FAA\u2019s Airport Improvement Program funds,  which slowed the pace of critical airport infrastructure projects. For  example, the airports had not acquired all of the rescue vehicles they  needed, and upgrades of the main runway at Pago Pago International  had to be phased in over several years. In August 2003, following  damage to a commercial airplane from loose asphalt on the runway, the  airport\u2019s main runway shut down for 2 weeks. The closure left American  Samoa cut off from commercial flights to Honolulu until the pavement  could be repaired. According to FAA and American Samoa airport  officials, a great deal of progress was made in improving Pago Pago  International Airport\u2019s infrastructure and rescue response capability  during the past several years; however, it will probably not reach an  acceptable standard until 2007.", "For most U.S. airports, including those in American Samoa, a passenger  facility charge of up to $4.50 per passenger provides a key source of  revenue. However, because only eight flights per week depart from Pago  Pago International, the airport generates relatively little revenue and  operates at a loss annually. Congress raised the cap on passenger facility  charges from $3.00 to $4.50 in fiscal year 2000 in FAA\u2019s reauthorization  legislation but elected not to raise it again in legislation reauthorizing FAA  for fiscal years 2004-2007."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Grants Had Limited Accountability, and U.S. Agencies Reacted Slowly", "paragraphs": ["A lack of required single audits, U.S. agencies\u2019 slow reactions to lack of  single audits, and incidents of theft and fraud compromised the  accountability of federal grants to American Samoa.

In particular, LBJ Hospital, which provides medical care for most of  American Samoa\u2019s population, received multiple federal grants but  struggled to overcome challenges posed by an inadequate facility and  limited resources. Specifically, although it receives DOI construction grants  for facility upgrades, the hospital struggled to meet HHS fire-safety  standards for continued Medicare certification required for Medicaid  funding. Nevertheless, in recent years federal departments, principally DOI  and HHS, have not formally collaborated on the use of DOI construction  grants at the hospital. In overseeing the hospital\u2019s use of capital  improvement grants, DOI could benefit from information that HHS could  provide regarding the hospital\u2019s ongoing efforts to maintain Medicare  certification.", "In addition, in fiscal years 1998-2003, the American Samoa government  failed to comply with the Single Audit Act, demonstrating a lack of overall  accountability for federal grants.

DOI\u2019s  concerns about imposing high-risk status for American Samoa included the  possible loss of access to federal programs for American Samoa and the  possible impact of such an action on the American Samoan population and  eventually on other insular areas. Losing access to such programs would  further limit the funds available to American Samoa to address their  staffing and resource problems.

HHS stated that American Samoa should not be  designated a high-risk grantee with respect to the Medicaid Program. In our  view, the findings of the audits of the LBJ Hospital raise concerns about  accountability at the hospital. The American Samoa government strongly  recommended against its being declared a high-risk grantee unless it fails  to meet the terms of its agreement with DOI, because it believed high-risk  status would imperil future funding.

The grantee must respond in writing with a  plan for correcting any findings of noncompliance with federal standards.

Second, the  grantee\u2019s budget figures are included in the annual application, which the  fiscal analyst reviews to make sure that they are allowable. The grantee  must have an approved indirect cost rate and must certify that  administrative costs do not represent more than 15 percent of the total  approved costs of the program. Third, the single audit reports test for  accountability of the program. Fourth, quarterly financial status reports  must be sent by the grantee to the HHS in Region IX.

Additionally, the  review highlighted the literacy program, which utilized locally designed  curriculum and materials that incorporated native culture, community, and  environment as well as family traditions. Part of the success of this literacy  program, according to the review, was attributable to the use of a  community lending library and a partnership with a community-based  organization, called \u201cRead to Me Samoa,\u201d to promote child and family  literacy by emphasizing both English and Samoan languages as well as  cultural traditions.

Seven new facilities providing a total of 38 classrooms devoted  exclusively to Head Start either have been completed or are in the process  of being constructed, according to an American Samoa official. Additional  facilities are planned, depending on the future availability of Head Start  grant funds. During our visit to American Samoa, we toured several Early  Childhood Education classrooms, including those in two of the newer  facilities. The classrooms were spacious, well lit, and well ventilated. The  addition of these facilities will enable several classes previously held in  village homes to move into a modern institutional setting.
