Additionally, McClellan Air Force Base, California, and the Sacramento Air Logistics Center, California, including the Air Force maintenance depot, is to be closed by July 2001. To mitigate the impact of the closing on the local communities and center employees, the administration, in 1995, announced its decision to maintain certain employment levels at these locations. Privatization-in-place was one of the initiatives to be used in achieving these employment goals.", "Since that decision, there has been a continuing debate between Congress and the administration over the process for deciding where, and by whom, the workloads at the closing depots would be performed. Central to this debate are concerns about the excess facility capacity that exists at the Air Force\u2019s three remaining maintenance depots and the legislative requirement, 10 U.S.C. 2469, that workloads exceeding $3 million in value that are being moved from a public depot to private sector performance must be subject to a public-private competition. Based on congressional concerns raised in 1996, the Air Force revised its privatization-in-place plans to provide for competitions between the public and private sectors as a means to decide where the depot maintenance workloads will be performed. The first competition was for the C-5 aircraft depot maintenance workload, which the Air Force awarded to the Warner Robins depot in Georgia on September 4, 1997.", "During 1997, Congress continued to provide oversight of DOD\u2019s strategy for allocating workloads currently performed at the closing depots. The 1998 Defense Authorization Act required that we and DOD analyze various issues related to the competitions at the closing depots and report to Congress concerning several areas. The act provides special procedures for public-private competitions for the San Antonio and Sacramento workloads and requires that we review the solicitations and the competitions to determine if DOD has complied with the act and applicable law.", "Further, Congress was concerned that the workloads be offered to competitors in the most logical and economical manner. Consequently, the act requires that a solicitation may be issued for a single contract for the performance of multiple depot-level maintenance or repair workloads, only if (1) the Secretary of Defense determines in writing that the individual workloads cannot as logically and economically be performed without combination by sources that are potentially qualified to submit an offer and to be awarded a contract to perform those individual workloads, (2) the Secretary submits a report setting forth the determination together with the reasons for the determination, and (3) the solicitation of offers for the contract is issued more than 60 days after the date on which the Secretary submits the report."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD\u2019s Reports Do Not Provide Sufficient Support for the Determination", "paragraphs": ["DOD\u2019s reports and supporting data do not provide adequate support for the determinations that the Sacramento and San Antonio competition workloads cannot as logically and economically be performed without combination by sources that are potentially qualified to submit an offer and to be awarded a contract to perform those workloads.

The official also said that guidance and instructions, regarding how to approach drafting the determination and report, were provided orally to the San Antonio and Sacramento program offices responsible for the competitions. Consequently, there is no written documentation regarding the process used in preparing the reports. Program management officials at Sacramento said that the acquisition strategy the Air Force has adopted was to combine the workloads to be competed into one solicitation and that it was too late to change that approach. Further, they stated they did not know how to go about analyzing the logic and economies of individual workload breakouts. Thus, they relied on the institutional knowledge of center officials and on information developed by offerors who were studying the Sacramento workload to explore business development approaches for reducing costs. Program management officials at San Antonio said that they believe the only way to test whether separate workload packages would be more or less cost-effective would be to hold a competition where the workloads could be done either in combination or separately. They further stated that the strategy of combining the engine workloads has been in place since 1995 and to change strategies now is not practical given the time constraints."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Information Is Available to Evaluate Logic and Economic Analysis of Individual Solicitations", "paragraphs": ["We recognize that the Air Force has considerable latitude to choose the process and format for meeting the legislative reporting requirement. However, we believe that the reports, as presented, do not fully address the requirement as it relates to the logic and economic analysis of individual solicitations.

Further, as discussed in the following paragraphs, we believe that there is sufficient information available to make an analysis of that issue.", "Other Air Force studies show that the Air Force has analyzed information related to the performance of individual workloads by qualified offerors. For example, in late 1996, the Air Force accomplished repair base analyses for six depot-level workloads currently performed by the Sacramento depot. The objective of each analysis was to identify industry capabilities and capacity to repair and overhaul specific workloads. Individual analyses were accomplished for the hydraulics, software, electrical accessories, flight instruments, A-10 aircraft, and KC-135 aircraft depot-level workloads.", "These analyses indicate that there are substantial numbers of private sector companies willing and able to maintain and repair the Sacramento workloads. For each type of workload, the analyses identified a number of companies with the capabilities, capacities, and interest in repairing specific commodities or selected portions of the workload. The analyses show that while some firms were interested in the entire workload associated with a commodity, other firms were primarily interested in repairing only their own proprietary items or selected classes of items. Some firms stated that they could not or did not want to be responsible for an entire commodity or for the packaged workload of all six commodities. Most firms also wanted to perform the work in their own facilities. Some constraints were noted but were expected to be overcome by, among other ways, supplying companies with available government-furnished equipment and test stands.", "To illustrate, 10 private sector companies were surveyed for their capabilities and capacities to perform hydraulics maintenance. Three of the companies were commercial airlines. The analyses concluded that each airline had extensive depot repair and overhaul capabilities, backshop support, well organized and managed repair processes, and well developed supplier networks. All three were judged to have the capacity and interest in performing hydraulics work for the Air Force, but would require military test stands. Five equipment manufacturers were also assessed and all expressed an interest in performing repairs only on their own proprietary items. The remaining two firms (a manufacturer of automated hydraulics test equipment and the company currently managing the recently privatized Air Force Aerospace Guidance and Metrology Center) expressed some interest in assuming the workload under a privatization-in-place arrangement. The analyses found similar results for the other five Sacramento workloads.", "Other Air Force studies also show that analyses can be made evaluating the logic and economies of alternative breakouts and transfers of individual segments of work. In recent years, the Air Force has conducted many analyses of the cost-effectiveness of alternative repair sources. For example, in developing recommendations for the 1995 base closure and realignment process, the Air Force conducted an analysis of alternative movements of workload among the five Air Force depots. The Air Force evaluation, which was considered to be a regular part of the depot workload planning process, was designed to evaluate the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of realigning 35 commodity or process workloads. As a result of this process, the Air Force proposed major workload realignments that were projected to result in net savings of $138.7 million during a 6-year implementation period.", "While we recognize that the studies previously mentioned do not address the specific analysis called for in the 1998 Defense Authorization Act, we do believe they illustrate that information is available or could be developed to specifically address the legislative mandate. Further, we believe various prior Air Force workload planning studies, including the two we previously cited, illustrate that information is available or could be developed to specifically address the legislative mandate."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Concerns About the Adequacy of Support for Some Statements in DOD\u2019s Reports", "paragraphs": ["Our review of DOD\u2019s Report of Determination to Combine Multiple Depot-Level Maintenance and Repair Workloads for Sacramento and San Antonio workloads also identified several questions about the adequacy of support for some specific statements in the reports."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Concerns Related to Sacramento Determination", "paragraphs": ["We question the adequacy of support for the Sacramento Determination Report in the following areas.", "The report states that all competitors indicated throughout their separate workload studies for Sacramento that consolidating workloads offered the most logical and economical performance possibilities. As support for this statement, the report referred to individual studies that had been prepared by the three potential offerors for the Sacramento workloads. However, the objectives of these studies were not the same as those identified by the authorization act. Further, one offeror\u2019s study states that the present competition format is not in the best interest of the government. More specifically, the SM-ALC Depot Workload Competition Study Contract Extension Transition Report, December 15, 1997, stated that the KC-135 workload should either be competed separately if the estimated quantity remains at 35 aircraft, or transferred to an existing public depot if the estimated quantity is reduced to 15\u2014the number of aircraft currently produced at Sacramento. This option also recommended that for various reasons, other segments of the work should also be transferred to other depots. A second option recommended in this study was that the Sacramento workload be separated into two competitive packages\u2014aircraft and commodities\u2014with the A-10 workload being transferred within the Air Force rather than being included in the competition package. These statements are inconsistent with the overall generalization presented in DOD\u2019s report. We were unable to fully evaluate the support for the report because the Air Force did not give us adequate or timely access to the contractor studies.", "The report states that workloads share common facilities and equipment in seven areas such as plating, sheet metal, and machining, which are used across the workloads for a variety of tasks. Further, the report states that the combination of this workload provides the offerors with a greater opportunity to maintain and operate efficient combined facilities and provide an avenue for significant cost savings through process improvements. However, workload data indicates that while common equipment and facilities may be shared, the workload performed in common facilities represents a relatively insignificant amount, thus raising questions about the likelihood of achieving significant savings. For example, of the 1.8 million direct labor hours estimated for the Sacramento competition workload, about 114,000 hours, or 6 percent, of the work is done in common facilities. Thus, while there may be opportunities for cost savings by sharing these facilities; the savings opportunities, contrary to the statement in DOD\u2019s report, are not significant.", "The report states that a single competition for all of the workloads provides for a single coordinated transition of the common areas, which will reduce the risks associated with managing multiple transitions. While we agree that there can be risks associated with the transition of any workload, the report and supporting documentation contained no evidence that this risk is any greater than a single transition of a larger workload.

The Air Force also plans to transition several other San Antonio workloads that the Air Force determined to be non-core, including gas turbine engines, independent of the competition.
