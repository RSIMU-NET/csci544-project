For example, individuals with NVDC may be ineligible for certain professional licenses and federal housing assistance. The NICCC data that GAO reviewed indicate that these 641 collateral consequences can limit many aspects of an individual's life, such as employment, business licenses, education, and government benefits. In addition, GAO also found that the NICCC identified that 497 (78 percent) of the 641 collateral consequences can potentially last a lifetime.", "Of the 641 federal collateral consequences for NVDC, GAO found that the NICCC identified 131 (20 percent) as having a relief mechanism in a related law or regulation that prescribed how an individual could potentially obtain relief from the consequence.

Additional mitigation could, according to some stakeholders, help individuals with NVDC obtain employment, housing, or education; and almost all the stakeholders said mitigation could potentially reduce the likelihood of reoffending. At the same time, federal collateral consequences can serve public safety functions and protect government interests.

In addition to the sentence (i.e., the direct consequences),  individuals may also face collateral consequences. Collateral  consequences are penalties and disadvantages, other than those  associated with a sentence, which can be imposed upon an individual as  a result of a conviction. Collateral consequences can be contained in  federal and state laws and regulations.

Individuals can also  use the NICCC to learn if opportunities exist for them to be relieved of a  collateral consequence. Specifically, the NICCC describes whether relief  mechanisms (e.g., presidential pardon) are available for certain collateral  consequences.", "The Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act of 2016 includes a  provision for GAO to review collateral consequences that can be imposed  on people with federal and state nonviolent drug convictions (NVDC).  Our objectives were to identify (1) collateral consequences contained in  federal laws and regulations (i.e., federal collateral consequences) that  can be imposed upon individuals with NVDC; (2) mechanisms that exist  to relieve individuals from federal collateral consequences for NVDC; and  (3) actions stakeholders identified that the federal government could  consider to mitigate federal collateral consequences for NVDC.", "To address our first objective, we obtained data on federal collateral  consequences from the ABA\u2019s NICCC, as of December 31, 2016. We  used the data from the ABA\u2019s NICCC to determine the number of federal  collateral consequences that can be imposed on individuals with NVDC,  and to identify selected characteristics, such as duration (e.g., permanent  or specific term) of these collateral consequences. According to ABA  officials, the NICCC does not identify whether a federal collateral  consequence is triggered by NVDC; however, an estimate could be  calculated using NICCC data. According to ABA officials, the NICCC was  intended to provide a comprehensive inventory of collateral  consequences contained in all federal and state laws and regulations. For  example, if a collateral consequence was established in a federal law and  also included in a federal regulation, the NICCC would include the  occurrence in federal law and regulation as two separate collateral  consequences. In addition, in instances that federal law requires the  imposition of a collateral consequence by state law or regulation to  receive certain federal funding, the NICCC would include the federal law  and each state law or regulation as a separate collateral consequence.", "To address our second objective, we reviewed relevant laws, regulations,  and federal agency directives and guidance; and interviewed ABA staff  and selected federal officials. Specifically, we interviewed officials from  four federal agencies\u2014the DOJ, Department of Housing and Urban  Development, Department of Health and Human Services, and  Department of Labor. We selected these agencies because they  participated on the Federal Interagency Reentry Council (Reentry  Council) and reviewed at least some regulations or policies in an effort to mitigate federal collateral consequences, among other criteria. In  addition, we analyzed NICCC data on each federal collateral  consequence for NVDC to determine whether relief was available. For our  first and second objectives, we examined the NICCC data and related  controls and interviewed ABA officials, and we concluded that these data  were sufficiently reliable to describe federal collateral consequences for  NVDC and their characteristics.", "To address our third objective, we interviewed selected stakeholders to  gather perspectives on mitigating federal collateral consequences for  NVDC. To identify stakeholders, we conducted a literature search for  studies and other materials related to federal collateral consequences,  identified relevant work groups and conferences, and asked potential  stakeholders to recommend other stakeholders to participate in our study.  From the list of potential stakeholders, we selected individuals with  relevant experience, among other factors. We selected 14 stakeholders  and conducted semi-structured interviews with them to learn what, if any,  actions the federal government could consider taking to mitigate federal  collateral consequences for NVDC. The information obtained from these  stakeholders cannot be generalized across all stakeholders; however,  these stakeholders provided examples of potential actions the federal  government could consider taking to mitigate collateral consequences for  NVDC. To describe the types of actions taken by states to mitigate  federal collateral consequences, we identified and reviewed two studies  that examined actions taken by states to mitigate collateral  consequences, and summarized the types of actions.

For example,  collateral consequences may prohibit people who committed crimes  involving a sex offense or offense involving a child victim from working in  a child care facility. Importantly, federal collateral consequences can be  triggered by federal as well as state convictions. Thus, if an individual is  convicted in state court, then the individual can be subject to federal  collateral consequences.

In 2009, NIJ awarded a grant to the ABA to catalogue and publicize this  information on a publically searchable website, which eventually became  the NICCC. According to NIJ officials, by June 2014, the ABA had  compiled collateral consequence information for the federal and state  governments and publicized the information in the NICCC.

For  example, by law, generally individuals convicted of a state or federal drug  possession offense, while receiving federal education loans, lose  eligibility for federal education loans for a specified period of time.  However, the law also includes a relief mechanism for this collateral  consequence, stating that individuals may resume eligibility for federal  education loans if they successfully complete a drug rehabilitation  program. Examples of other types of relief mechanisms include: presidential or gubernatorial pardon; expungement or sealing of conviction; appeal or review; and  certificate of recovery.", "Although we found that the NICCC identified these 131 collateral  consequences as having a mechanism to obtain relief, individuals  wanting relief may not actually be relieved of the collateral consequences  for a variety of reasons. Below are some of these reasons, based on our  review of the NICCC:  Years since Conviction: Individuals may not be able to obtain relief  until a certain amount of time has passed since their conviction. For  example, a federal collateral consequence may require that  individuals wait 10 years after their conviction to be eligible for relief.  Thus, if it has only been five years since an individual\u2019s conviction,  then the individual would have to wait an additional five years to be  eligible for relief.", "Type of Offense: Individuals may not be eligible for a relief  mechanism due to the type of drug offense for which they were  convicted. For example, a relief mechanism may be available to  individuals convicted of a drug possession offense but not a drug  trafficking offense, or may be available to individuals after their first  offense but not their second offense. Thus, in this example,  individuals with drug trafficking offenses or individuals who received  second convictions would not be eligible for relief.", "Denied Request: Some requests for relief can be denied. For  example, one relief condition is that individuals request an appeal or  review. However, the appeal or review may result in an unfavorable  outcome, and thus, the collateral consequence may continue to be  imposed on individuals seeking relief.", "Of the 641 federal collateral consequences for NVDC, we found that the  NICCC identified 510 (80 percent) that did not have a related law or  regulation that prescribed how a person could potentially obtain relief  from the collateral consequence, as of December 31, 2016. However,  there may be circumstances whereby a person could still obtain relief. For  example, from January 1993 through January 2017, presidents granted,  on average, 33 pardons per year. According to officials from DOJ\u2019s  Office of the Pardon Attorney, a presidential pardon may relieve an  individual of a collateral consequence even if related federal laws or  regulations do not specifically prescribe that the consequence can be  relieved by a pardon. In addition, the officials said that federal collateral  consequences would have to be reviewed on a case-by-case basis to  determine what effect, if any, a presidential pardon may have on the  collateral consequences. Specifically, an individual would have to review  related case law and agency policies to determine the potential effect of a  pardon, according to Office of the Pardon Attorney officials."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Interagency Reentry Council Agencies Have Issued Guidance or Directives Intended to Mitigate Federal Collateral Consequences", "paragraphs": ["In January 2011, the U.S. Attorney General convened the Reentry  Council, a group of about 20 federal entities whose mission is to make  communities safer, assist those who return from prison and jail in  becoming productive citizens, and save taxpayer dollars by lowering the  direct and collateral costs of incarceration. According to a 2016 Reentry  Council report, some Reentry Council agencies have issued guidance or  directives on federal collateral consequences. A primary focus of the  Reentry Council is to reduce \u201cthe policy barriers to successful reentry, so  that motivated individuals\u2014who have served their time and paid their  dues\u2014are able to compete for jobs, attain stable housing, support their  children and their families, and contribute to their communities.\u201d In 2012,  the Attorney General requested that federal agencies participating in the  Reentry Council review their regulations and consider eliminating those  collateral consequences that lessen the likelihood of successful reentry  without improving public safety.

The  review requested by the Attorney General did not target federal collateral  consequences triggered by specific types of convictions, such as NVDC.", "According to Reentry Council leadership, a takeaway from the review was  that many federal collateral consequences are written into law, and thus,  Reentry Council agencies were limited in their ability to modify the related  regulations. Another takeaway was that some federal collateral  consequences included in the review are appropriately tailored and  should not be changed. Further, according to the 2016 Reentry Council  report, some Reentry Council agencies issued guidance or directives  intended to mitigate federal collateral consequences.

The data included variables, such as a description of the  collateral consequence and the duration (e.g., permanent or specific  term). We obtained the data from the NICCC as of December 31, 2016;  however, according to ABA officials, the data may not have been current  as of that date. According to ABA officials, collateral consequences in the  NICCC were not updated on a real-time basis for changes in jurisdictions\u2019  laws and regulations. Collateral consequences for each jurisdiction were  updated periodically based on a schedule developed by NICCC project  management, and based on the schedule, some changes to laws or  regulations may have taken a year or longer to be reflected in the NICCC.  Therefore, even though the NICCC data were obtained as of December  31, 2016, the data may include some laws and regulations that were  removed or modified by a jurisdiction on or before December 31, 2016. In  addition, the NICCC data may not include some laws or regulations that  were added on or before December 31, 2016.", "According to the ABA, the NICCC was developed using the definition of  collateral consequences in the Court Security Improvement Act of 2007.  According to the act: \u201cThe term \u2018collateral consequence\u2019 means a  collateral sanction or a disqualification\u2026.The term \u2018collateral sanction\u2019  means a penalty, disability, or disadvantage, however denominated, that  is imposed by law as a result of an individual\u2019s conviction for a felony,  misdemeanor, or other offense, but not as part of the judgment of the  court; and does not include a term of imprisonment, probation, parole,  supervised release, fine, assessment, forfeiture, restitution, or the costs of  prosecution\u2026.The term \u2018disqualification\u2019 means a penalty, disability, or  disadvantage, however denominated, that an administrative agency,  official, or a court in a civil proceeding is authorized, but not required, to  impose on an individual convicted of a felony, misdemeanor, or other  offense on grounds relating to the conviction.\u201d Although some differences  exist between the definition of collateral consequences in the  Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act of 2016 and the definition  used by the NICCC, we determined that the definition used by the ABA\u2019s  NICCC was appropriate for the purposes of describing federal collateral  consequences for NVDC and their characteristics.", "According to ABA officials, the NICCC was designed to provide a  comprehensive inventory of collateral consequences contained in federal  and state laws or regulations. For example, if a collateral consequence  was established in a federal law and also included in a federal regulation,  the NICCC would count this occurrence as two separate collateral  consequences. In addition, in instances that federal law requires the  imposition of a collateral consequence by state law or regulation to  receive certain federal funding, the NICCC would include the federal law  and each state law or regulation as a separate collateral consequence.", "To determine the number of federal collateral consequences that can be  imposed on individuals with NVDC, we analyzed NICCC data. According  to ABA officials, the NICCC does not identify whether a federal collateral  consequence is triggered by NVDC; however, an estimate could be  calculated using the NICCC\u2019s 16 triggering offense categories, among  other available data. Specifically, we determined that federal collateral  consequences included in the following triggering offense categories may  be imposed for NVDC: (1) Any offense, (2) Any felony, (3) Any  misdemeanor, and (4) Controlled substances. For example, if a federal  collateral consequence was included in the Any offense category, then it  could be triggered by any offense, including nonviolent drug offenses.  Similarly, if a federal collateral consequence was included in the Any  felony category, then it could be triggered by a felony nonviolent drug  offense. According to ABA officials, the following 11 triggering offense  categories generally do not contain drug offenses: Crime of moral  turpitude; Crimes involving fraud, dishonesty, misrepresentation or  money-laundering; Crimes of violence, including \u201cperson offenses\u201d;  Weapons offenses; Sex offenses; Public corruption offenses; Election- related offenses; Recreational license offenses; Motor vehicle offenses;  Child Support offenses; and Other. As such, we excluded these 11  categories from our analysis. In addition, N/A, the final triggering offense  category, includes general background checks that are not triggered by a  specific offense or a type of offense, and may be conducted whether an  applicant or employee does or does not have a conviction. In addition, the  N/A category includes laws and regulations that provide relief from  collateral consequences. As such, we excluded the N/A triggering offense  category from our analysis.", "Based on our analysis, we found that the Controlled substances triggering  offense category included some collateral consequences that did not  relate to drugs. As such, we reviewed each collateral consequence in the  Controlled substances category that included specific words, such as  alcohol and tobacco. If a federal collateral consequence only related to  alcohol or tobacco, we excluded it from our population of federal collateral  consequences for NVDC. Once we identified the population of federal  collateral consequences for NVDC, we analyzed the data by selected  characteristics, such as consequence type (i.e., mandatory, or  discretionary) and duration (i.e., permanent, specific term, or conditional).", "Of the roughly 46,000 federal and state collateral consequences identified  in the NICCC, our review found that some of the consequences (less than  one percent of the total number of collateral consequences) had duplicate  legal citations and collateral consequence titles. We did not further  examine these collateral consequences. In addition, we did not remove  these potential duplicates from the data presented in Appendix II, as there  are reasons why these collateral consequences may be unique and not  duplicative. However, we examined the potentially duplicative federal  collateral consequences that could be triggered by NVDC, and  determined that two were duplicates. We removed these two collateral  consequences from our count of federal collateral consequences for  NVDC. We assessed the reliability of the NICCC data by obtaining  information from ABA officials responsible for managing the database on  how the data are collected and used, and what internal controls the data  are subject to. We examined the data and related controls and  interviewed ABA officials, and we concluded that these data were  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of describing federal collateral  consequences for NVDC and their characteristics.", "To address our second objective, we analyzed NICCC data; reviewed  relevant laws, regulations, and federal agency directives and guidance;  and interviewed selected federal officials and ABA staff. To determine the  number of federal collateral consequences for NVDC that had a related  law or regulation that prescribed how a person could potentially obtain  relief from the collateral consequence, we analyzed NICCC data as of  December 31, 2016. Specifically, we analyzed each federal collateral  consequence for NVDC to determine whether the NICCC identified it as  having relief available. Our analysis was limited to the NICCC\u2019s Relief  variable, which only includes relief mechanisms in laws and regulations  related to a specific collateral consequence. Therefore, our review did not  include federal relief mechanisms that may be available in laws or  regulations that were not specific to a federal collateral consequence for  NVDC, and mechanisms in sources other than laws or regulations, such  as federal agency policies. To identify examples of relief mechanisms, we  analyzed the NICCC description of the relief and the related laws and  regulations. As discussed above, we determined that the NICCC data  were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of describing federal collateral  consequences for NVDC and their characteristics.", "To identify actions the Federal Interagency Reentry Council (Reentry  Council) and its participating federal agencies took to mitigate federal  collateral consequences, we analyzed Reentry Council reports and  interviewed Reentry Council leadership. In addition, we selected four  federal agencies\u2014the Department of Justice, Department of Housing and  Urban Development, Department of Health and Human Services, and  Department of Labor. We selected these agencies because they  participated on the Reentry Council, and reviewed at least some  regulations or policies in an effort to mitigate federal collateral  consequences. We also asked Reentry Council leadership for  recommended agencies to include in our selections. Further, we sought  to select a group of agencies that oversee policy areas that often affect  individuals with NVDC, including employment and government assistance  (e.g., housing and education assistance). For selected agencies, we  reviewed relevant agency directives and guidance and interviewed  agency officials to better understand their actions to mitigate federal  collateral consequences. The information obtained from selected federal  agencies cannot be generalized across all federal agencies; however, the  information provided examples of recent actions the federal government  took to mitigate federal collateral consequences.", "To address our third objective, we interviewed selected stakeholders to  gather perspectives on mitigating federal collateral consequences for  NVDC. We asked these stakeholders to provide their opinions and  perspectives, and not those of the organization to which they were  affiliated. To identify potential stakeholders, we conducted a literature  search for studies, government reports, conference papers, and other  materials, that related to federal collateral consequences. To identify  existing literature, we conducted searches of various databases, such as  ProQuest and Scopus. We performed these searches to identify potential  stakeholders that authored relevant literature, presented at conferences,  or held leadership positions in a workgroup from January 2006 to January  2017. In addition, we asked potential stakeholders to recommend other  stakeholders to participate in our study (i.e., snowball sampling).
