Once awarded, cost-type contracts have additional reporting requirements to help monitoring of cost and schedule performance.", "GAO analyzed program cost and schedule outcomes for 21 major acquisition programs, and did not find a clear relationship between these outcomes and contract types used. However, programs that completed certain knowledge-based acquisition practices generally had better cost and schedule outcomes than programs that did not implement those practices. These practices include completing preliminary design review before the start of system development and releasing at least 90 percent of design drawings by critical design review.", "From fiscal years 2011 through 2019, DOD used cost-type contracts for a small proportion\u2014under one-fifth on average\u2014of obligations for its major acquisition programs. This proportion varied across the military departments (see figure).", "A change to DOD's peer review process for its largest contract awards reduced a means for sharing best practices and lessons learned about contract choice across the military departments. In 2019, the Office of the Secretary of Defense announced the end of its peer reviews for most competitive procurements above $1 billion. While these contracts will instead be reviewed through the military departments' own processes, DOD currently does not require the departments to collect and share their findings.

DOD expects its current portfolio of 85 MDAPs to  cost $1.8 trillion in total. Despite some improvements in recent years,  DOD has historically struggled to meet cost and schedule expectations  for its MDAPs. This has resulted in billions of dollars of cost growth and  delays in providing systems to the warfighter. As a result, weapon  systems acquisition has been on GAO\u2019s High Risk List since 1990. DOD  typically contracts with private-sector companies in order to acquire these  systems, using a variety of contract types.

Specifically, we  selected for each of the three military departments the most recently  awarded cost-type MDAP Research Development, Test, and Evaluation  contract and the most recently awarded cost-type MDAP Procurement  contract as reported in the December 2017 Selected Acquisition Reports.  We also selected the most recently awarded cost-type MDAP contract for  the Marine Corps. We interviewed contracting officials and reviewed key  documentation such as acquisition strategies relating to each one of  these contracts.

Contract types vary according to the degree and  timing of the responsibility assumed by the contractor for the costs of  performance, and the amount and nature of the profit incentive offered to  the contractor for achieving or exceeding specified standards or goals.", "The primary contract types described by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR) fall into two broad categories\u2014cost-type and fixed- price-type\u2014and table 1 summarizes key features of each.", "As illustrated in figure 1, within these categories the specific contract  types range from cost-plus-fixed-fee, in which the contractor has minimal  responsibility for the performance costs and the negotiated fee (profit) is  fixed, to firm-fixed-price, in which the contractor has full responsibility for  the performance costs and resulting profit (or loss). In between are the  various incentive contracts, under which the contractor\u2019s responsibility for  the performance costs and the profit or fee incentives offered are tailored  to the uncertainties involved in contract performance. For contracts with  incentive fees or profits, the amount of fee or profit payable is related to  the contractor\u2019s performance, and generally involves an objective  evaluation by the government of the contractor\u2019s performance toward  cost, schedule, or technical goals. Award fees, on the other hand,  typically emphasize multiple aspects of contractor performance that are  more subjectively assessed, such as the contractor\u2019s responsiveness,  technical ingenuity, or cost management. Furthermore, the basic types of  contracts may be used in combination, with both fixed-price-type and  cost-type contract line item numbers, unless otherwise prohibited. For  example, a firm-fixed-price contract may have a cost-type line item for  travel.", "The FAR states that selecting the contract type is generally a matter for  negotiation and requires the exercise of sound judgment by the  contracting officer. Negotiating the contract type and negotiating prices  are closely related and should be considered together. The objective is  for the government to negotiate a contract type and price (or estimated  cost and fee) that will result in reasonable contractor risk and provide the  contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical  performance. As also noted in the FAR, the government usually  assumes greater risk in its contracts for more complex requirements,  particularly those unique to the government. This is especially true for  complex research and development contracts, where performance  uncertainties or the likelihood of changes make it difficult to estimate  performance costs in advance. Cost-type contracts are suitable for  instances when uncertainties about contract performance do not allow  accurate enough cost estimates to use a fixed-price-type contract\u2014in  other words, when programs choose to accept more risk. The level of risk  drives the contract type chosen, with the contract then reflecting the risk  of the work.", "DOD programs may use different contract types across the life of the  MDAP. For example, DOD guidance notes that the preferred contract  type for development efforts is cost-type, and requires particular  consideration of fixed-price-incentive contracts for acquisitions moving  from development to production. Consistent with the FAR, DOD guidance  also notes that firm-fixed-price production contracts may be in the  government\u2019s best interest once costs have become stable.", "DOD and Congress have encouraged use of fixed-price-type contracts  where appropriate. For example, DOD\u2019s Better Buying Power initiative,  which started in 2010, called for increased use of fixed-price-incentive  contracts for programs transitioning from development to production. In  addition, the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year  2017 required DOD to establish a preference for fixed-price-type  contracts in the determination of contract type and specified approval  requirements for use of cost-type contracts above certain dollar  thresholds. Congress has also limited DOD\u2019s ability to use cost-type  contracts to acquire production units absent congressional notification.  Our prior work contains many recommendations related to incentive-type  contracts. For example, in March 2017 we recommended that the Navy  remind contracting officials to follow guidance on documenting the  rationale for using fixed-price-incentive contracts, and in April 2017, the  Navy issued a memorandum addressing this issue. In July 2017 we  recommended that DOD collect and analyze data to determine the extent  to which incentive contracts achieved desired outcomes. While DOD  agreed with the recommendation and developed a template for the  military departments to use to collect relevant information, it is still  gathering updates from the military departments about the status of this  effort."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Contracting for Major Defense Acquisition Programs", "paragraphs": ["DOD acquires MDAPs through the Defense Acquisition System, which  implements an adaptive acquisition framework that allows DOD officials  to develop acquisition strategies and employ acquisition processes that  match the characteristics of the capability being acquired.

In addition, while two of the three programs that used  only fixed-price-type contracts had unit cost reductions, they also  experienced schedule growth of over 40 percent.

At the heart of a business case is a  knowledge-based approach, in which knowledge supplants risk over time.  Establishing a business case calls for a realistic assessment of risks and  costs; doing otherwise undermines the intent of the business case and  invites failure.

Our analysis of the compendium found that it captures  practices and recommendations related to contract type, as illustrated by  the following examples:", "Use of incentives: Consider development of cost and performance  incentives, rather than use of an award fee.", "Different contract type: Reconsider plan to award a fixed-price- incentive contract, given historical use of a cost-plus-incentive-fee  arrangement under which contractor delivered at or around target  cost.", "Source selection: Throughout solicitation for an award combining  firm-fixed-price and cost-type line items, tell offerors what they are  expected to provide and how they will be evaluated, and document  that evaluation occurred in this exact way.", "Officials from the military departments confirmed that they are aware that  they will now be expected to perform the reviews that DPC previously  conducted. They have taken steps to adjust procedures accordingly,  including updating their acquisition regulations as necessary. However,  DPC does not currently have plans to encourage sharing of findings from  military department-level reviews across the departments. For example,  there are no plans to solicit updates to the online compendium or a similar  centralized resource. USD(A&S) is responsible for improving acquisition  results\u2014including cost, schedule, and performance\u2014by gathering and  distributing data, best practices, and lessons learned across the military  departments. Without a centralized resource for sharing findings, and as  most reviews transition to the military departments, it will become more  difficult for USD(A&S) to identify contracting trends across DOD and  perform this assigned role. An updated compendium or other centralized  resource could help contracting officials continue to learn from the  experiences of peers across DOD\u2014including when acquiring similar  platforms and from similar contractors\u2014by exposing them to good  practices for structuring contracts and prompting consideration of  alternative contract types."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["With DPC conducting fewer peer reviews and no updates to the  compendium since 2013, contracting officials might not have insight into  how other programs across DOD structure contracts. As the reviews will  now primarily occur within the military departments, these officials could  lose exposure to alternative contracting approaches suitable for their  programs. A centralized resource such as the compendium takes on a  new significance as a means for sharing information between the military  departments as they proceed with their own peer reviews. USD(A&S)  remains well-positioned to facilitate information exchange and contribute  to positive program outcomes by requiring the military departments to  share the findings of their peer reviews."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["The Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment should  establish procedures requiring the military departments to collect and  share findings from their peer reviews of MDAP contracting approaches\u2014 including choice of contract type\u2014such as by updating the existing online  compendium of best practices and lessons learned as they complete their  reviews."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to DOD for review and comment.

These  data reflect programs that were part of DOD\u2019s MDAP portfolio and  contracts that were reported in Selected Acquisition Reports at any point  during this period. The basic types of contracts may be used in  combination, with both fixed-price-type and cost-type contract line item  numbers, unless otherwise prohibited. Per the Defense Federal  Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) Procedures, Guidance, and  Information, when entering contract type information info FPDS-NG, the  data entrant is to choose the contract type that is applicable to the  predominant amount of the contract action, based on the value of the line  items; the selected contract type automatically populates any subsequent  contract action reports for modifications. We aggregated obligations on  orders under indefinite-delivery contracts and basic ordering agreements  by contract type for each fiscal year.", "We used the Defense Acquisition Management Information Retrieval  (DAMIR) system to identify those contracts reported in Selected  Acquisition Reports for programs in the MDAP portfolio awarded from  fiscal year 2010 through fiscal year 2018. Our dataset includes only  obligations on MDAP contracts awarded since fiscal year 2010 due to  problems identified in a prior GAO report regarding how data on contract  types were reported in FPDS-NG for contracts awarded prior to that  date. Specifically, prior to fiscal year 2010, data entrants could select the  contract types \u201ccombination\u201d and \u201cother\u201d, or not enter a contract type at all. The Office of Federal Procurement Policy subsequently removed  those contract types as options in FPDS-NG, and made completion of the  field mandatory. Contracts retain their original designation in FPDS-NG  when modifications to those contracts are subsequently made. Therefore,  in order to avoid including contracts coded as \u201ccombination\u201d or \u201cother\u201d, we  limited our analysis to contracts awarded since fiscal year 2010.", "We assessed data reliability by comparing the contract types identified in  FPDS-NG for each contract with information on contract types contained  in DAMIR and in another DOD database\u2014Earned Value Management- Central Repository\u2014and determined the data were sufficiently reliable for  the purposes of analyzing the extent of DOD\u2019s use of cost-type contracts  for MDAPs. Contractors for programs with earned value management  (EVM) reporting requirements submit EVM data to Earned Value  Management-Central Repository. EVM reporting is generally required for  cost-type or incentive contracts valued at $20 million or more. We  included obligations associated with contract types contained in FPDS- NG if they matched contract types contained in either DAMIR or Earned  Value Management-Central Repository. When there was no match with  either source, we reviewed the narrative discussion of contract types  contained in Selected Acquisition Reports in order to determine the most  appropriate contract type with which to label those obligations.", "To assess how DOD chooses among cost-type and other contract types  for MDAPs and monitors their cost and schedule performance, we  reviewed relevant statutes, regulations, and policies.
