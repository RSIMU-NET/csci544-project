GAO was asked to assess the effectiveness of the process for awarding national emergency grants, whether Labor is planning changes that will improve the grant award process, and what is known about how grant funds are used."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Labor does not award most national emergency grants in a timely manner, and as a result, services to workers have been delayed, interrupted, or denied. Labor's goal is to make award decisions within 30 calendar days of receiving a complete application. However, nearly 90 percent of regular grants took longer than 30 days to award. On average, Labor took 92 days to award regular grants. For grants disbursed in more than one payment, Labor took on average 83 days to award the additional increments. Twenty-five of 38 states responding to our survey reported that because of grant award delays, local areas had to delay or deny services to workers. Labor is taking some steps, such as implementing an electronic system to better manage its award process and incorporating its 30-day goal in new guidelines, that may improve the timeliness of grant awards. However, some weaknesses still remain in Labor's planned changes that could prevent Labor from accurately assessing how long it takes to make grant awards and incremental payments. For example, Labor plans to stop counting the days elapsed if it finds problems with an application, and Labor's proposed guidelines do not establish a timeliness goal for incremental payments. Little is known on a national level about how national emergency grant funds are used because of weaknesses in two primary data sources. Because of the lack of clear guidance, states report inconsistent data in progress reports, and some states have not reported data on national emergency grants to a national database covering Workforce Investment Act (WIA) programs. To address these problems, Labor is implementing a standardized electronic form for grantees to submit progress reports, issued guidance requiring states to submit data on national emergency grant participants to the national WIA database, and checked states' latest submissions to identify if data were missing. However, Labor's guidance still is not sufficiently clear to ensure that states will report data in progress reports consistently, and Labor does not have specific plans to continue checking states' data submissions to ensure that data are complete."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Between 2000 and 2002, almost 60,000 mass layoffs of 50 or more workers  occurred, resulting in nearly 7 million workers losing their jobs. The  Workforce Investment Act (WIA) of 1998 authorizes the Department of  Labor (Labor) to award national emergency grants to states and local  areas to provide employment and training assistance to workers whose  jobs were lost because of major economic dislocations, such as plant  closures, or major disasters, such as floods and hurricanes. Grantees,  typically the state or local agency responsible for administering WIA, apply  for national emergency grants when their dislocated worker formula funds  are insufficient to assist the affected workers. Between July 1, 2000, and  June 30, 2003, Labor awarded about $600 million in national emergency  grants. The majority of these funds were used for grants to provide  assistance, called regular grants, to workers who lost their jobs because of  layoffs or plant closures. National emergency grants can be funded in  whole or in increments. For grants that are funded incrementally, grantees  are required to submit supplemental information to request additional  payments. Although national emergency grants are intended to be a timely  response to unexpected events, questions arose during congressional  hearings in April 2003 about whether national emergency grant funds were  getting to states and local areas quickly enough to help workers when they  needed them the most.", "In November 2003, we reported that services to dislocated workers were  being affected because of delays in Labor\u2019s awarding of national  emergency grants. We also found that Labor was initiating actions to  improve the grant award process. Because of your continued interest in  Labor\u2019s process for awarding national emergency grants, you asked us to  determine (1) the effectiveness of the overall process for awarding  national emergency grant funds, (2) whether the changes being  implemented by Labor will improve the grant award process, and (3) what  is known about how grant funds are being used. To respond to these  questions, we interviewed Labor officials at both headquarters and  regional offices, reviewed Labor files for all grants awarded during  program years 2000 through 2002, and surveyed officials in the 39 states  that had received at least one regular national emergency grant during that  period. We received responses from 38 states. We also reviewed Labor\u2019s  two data sources that contain information on use of national emergency  grants. We conducted our work from March 2003 to March 2004 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards (see  app. I for a detailed discussion of our scope and methodology)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["WIA specifies separate funding streams for each of the act\u2019s main client  groups\u2014adults, youths, and dislocated workers. A dislocated worker is an  individual who (1) has been terminated or laid off, or who has received a  notice of termination or layoff, from employment; is eligible for or has  exhausted entitlement to unemployment insurance; or who is not eligible  for unemployment insurance but has been employed for a sufficient  duration to demonstrate attachment to the workforce and who is unlikely  to return to his or her previous industry or occupation; (2) has been  terminated or laid off, or who has received a notice of termination or  layoff, from employment as a result of any permanent plant closure of, or  substantial layoff at, a plant, facility, or enterprise; (3) was self-employed  but is unemployed as a result of general economic conditions in the  community in which the individual resides or because of natural disasters;  or (4) is a displaced homemaker.", "Under WIA, dislocated workers can receive three levels of service\u2014core,  intensive, and training. Core services include job search and placement  assistance, the provision of labor market information, and preliminary  assessment of skills and needs. These services are available to anyone  seeking such assistance, whether or not that person is a dislocated  worker. Intensive services are provided to dislocated workers needing  additional services to find a job. Intensive services include comprehensive  assessments, development of an individual employment plan, case  management, and short-term prevocational services. Dislocated workers  can also receive training services, including occupational skills training,  on-the-job training, skill upgrading, and entrepreneurial training.", "The Secretary of Labor retains 20 percent of dislocated worker funds in a  national reserve account to be used for national emergency grants,  demonstrations, and technical assistance and allots the remaining funds to  each of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico according  to a specific formula. In a previous report, GAO identified several issues  with the formula to allocate dislocated worker funds that limit Labor\u2019s  ability to allocate funds to states according to their need.  For example,  one problem we identified is that the formula allocates funds based on  factors, such as the number of long-term unemployed in each state, that  are not clearly aligned with the program\u2019s target population. During  program years 2000-2002, Labor was allotted about $4.7 billion for  dislocated worker activities. For program year 2003, approximately   $1.4 billion was allotted for dislocated worker activities, of which about  $272 million was reserved by the Secretary of Labor. Of the amount  reserved by the Secretary in any program year, not more than 10 percent  can be used for demonstrations and pilot projects relating to the  employment and training needs of dislocated workers. Such projects can  include those that promote self-employment, promote job creation, and  avert dislocations. In addition, not more than 5 percent can be used for  technical assistance to states that do not meet performance measures  established for dislocated worker activities. At least 85 percent of the  Secretary\u2019s 20 percent funds must be used for national emergency grants  (see fig.1).", "National emergency grant funds are used for several different types of  grants, including    Regular grants. These provide employment and training assistance to  workers who lost their jobs because of layoffs and plant closings.", "Disaster grants. These provide temporary employment to workers  affected by natural disasters and other catastrophic events.", "Dual enrollment grants. These provide supplemental assistance to  workers who have been certified by Labor to receive services under the  Trade Adjustment Assistance Reform Act of 2002. Workers eligible  under dual enrollment grants are typically workers who have lost their  jobs because of increased imports from, or shifts in production to,  foreign countries.", "Grantees apply for national emergency grants when their dislocated  worker formula funds are insufficient to meet the needs of affected  workers. Entities that are eligible to receive regular national emergency  grants are:  the designated state WIA program agency,    a local workforce investment area agency,    a consortium of local workforce investment boards for adjoining areas,    a designated organization receiving funds through the Native American  program provision of WIA.", "For regular national emergency grants covering more than one state,  eligible grantees are limited to a consortium of local workforce investment  boards for adjoining local areas or a consortium of states. For disaster and  dual enrollment grants, eligible grantees are limited to states. For national  emergency grants awarded from program years 2000 to 2002, 241 grants  were awarded to states and 6 grants were awarded to local areas.", "National emergency grants are discretionary awards by the Secretary of  Labor that are intended to temporarily expand service capacity at the state  and local levels by providing time-limited funding assistance in response  to major layoffs. National emergency grant funds may be used to provide  core, intensive, and training services.  For disaster-related projects, funds  may be used for temporary employment assistance on projects that  provide food, clothing, and shelter, as well as on projects that perform  demolition, cleaning, repair, renovation, and reconstruction. According to  Labor, projects funded by national emergency grants must be designed to  achieve performance outcomes that support the performance goal  commitments by the Secretary under the Government Performance and  Results Act. Labor will provide target performance levels for national  emergency grant projects through separate policy guidance. Beginning  July 1, 2004, national emergency grant projects will be subject to the  common measures for employment and training programs, including  entered employment, job retention, and earnings increase. Participants in  temporary disaster projects are expected to receive necessary assistance  to return to the workforce.", "Between July 1, 2000, and June 30, 2003 (covering program years 2000,  2001, and 2002), Labor distributed about $600 million from the dislocated  worker reserved funds for national emergency grants to 46 states, the  District of Columbia, Guam, and the Federated States of Micronesia (see  fig. 2). California, Massachusetts, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas,  Virginia, Washington, and Wisconsin received the largest amount of grant  funds, at least $20 million each.", "Appendix II lists the amount of funds Labor distributed to each state for  regular, disaster, and dual enrollment national emergency grants between  July 1, 2000, and June 30, 2003. Nearly two-thirds of the 247 grants  awarded and about 60 percent of the funds awarded were for regular  grants (see fig. 3). According to Labor officials, no grant applications  received between July 1, 2000, and June 30, 2003 are still pending.", "In any program year, the Secretary can only award national emergency  grants from funds available for that program year. That is, funds reserved  for national emergency grants in program year 2002 must be awarded by  June 30, 2003\u2014the last day of program year 2002.", "The current system for submission and review of grant applications is  manual and paper-based. States and local areas submit an application via  mail or fax. Each national emergency grant application generally contains  information on key aspects of the proposed project, such as amount of  funds requested, planned number of participants, planned starting and end  dates, planned expenditures by type of program activity, and expected  performance outcomes, including how many participants they believe will  become employed and what they believe their new wages will be. Labor  officials review the application and draft a decision memorandum that  contains their recommendation as to whether the grant should be awarded  and, if so, at what amount. The decision memorandum is forwarded to the  Secretary, who makes the final award decision. After the Secretary\u2019s  award decision, Labor notifies the appropriate congressional office and  issues the award letter to the grantee. National emergency grant awards  can be disbursed in a single payment or in increments. In most cases, the  initial increment will be for 6 months to enable a project to achieve full  enrollment. For grants disbursed in more than one payment, grantees are  required to submit supplemental information along with their requests for  future incremental payments. This information generally includes the  actual number of participants, performance outcomes, and expenditures.", "Grantees provide information to Labor on their use of grant funds through  periodic progress reports. Grantees submit periodic progress reports on  their use of national emergency grant funds to Labor regional offices that  monitor and oversee the grants. Grantees are required to submit the  reports on a quarterly basis for regular and dual enrollment grants and on  a biweekly basis for disaster grants. Progress reports generally contain  information on the number of participants who registered for the program  and received various services.

First, the way Labor has defined its 30- day goal allows the agency to stop counting the number of days elapsed if  it finds problems with the grant application. For example, if Labor finds a  major problem, such as with a planned expenditure for a program activity,  it will stop the electronic system\u2019s counting of days elapsed and ask the  state or local area to revise the application. After the state or local area  submits a revised application, Labor will start the counting at day one (see  fig. 10). However, if Labor finds a minor problem with the application,  such as insufficient justification in the narrative explanation for the  proposed number of dislocated workers to be enrolled, it will stop the  counting and, once the state or local area submits a revised application,  will restart the counting from the day it left off. Because of Labor\u2019s ability  to stop its counting of days elapsed, its tracking system may not accurately  reflect the number of days it takes Labor to award grants or allow Labor to  identify how long particular steps in the process contribute to the amount  of time it takes to award grants.", "A second problem is that Labor\u2019s timeliness goal still only includes the  days up to the Secretary\u2019s award decision, leaving the agency unable to  identify delays that occur after the award decision. Labor\u2019s proposed  guidelines specify a goal to approve or disapprove applications within   30 business days from receipt of a complete and responsive application.   As stated, the goal would not include the steps between the Secretary\u2019s  approval and the issuance of the award letter, such as the notification of  congressional offices of the award, the preparation of the award letter, and  the preparation for the disbursement of funds. With some grants awarded  in program years 2000 to 2002, 20 or more calendar days passed between  the date the Secretary approved the grant by signing the decision  memorandum and the date Labor issued the award letter to the grantee.  For example, for a grant awarded to Missouri, 34 days passed between the  date the Secretary signed the decision memorandum and the date the  award letter was sent. Such delays can interfere with a state or local area\u2019s  ability to take steps necessary to begin to provide services such as  entering into contracts with training providers or hiring staff.", "A third weakness is that Labor\u2019s proposed guidelines do not establish a  timeliness goal for awarding incremental payments, despite stating that  most grants will be awarded incrementally. Labor has stated that the  amount of time to approve incremental payments should be no longer than  the time required to review the original application\u201430 business days.  However, this goal has not been formally documented in the proposed  guidelines.

For example, according to Labor regional officials, states vary in how they  define \u201centered employment.\u201d Some states use the WIA definition, which  calculates entered employment using quarterly unemployment insurance  wage reports that may not be available until several months after the  person has started a job. Other states use the definition under the Job  Training Partnership Act (JTPA) program that WIA replaced, which  calculates the number using information gathered by the caseworker at  the time the person is placed in employment.

In its  review of state-reported WIA performance data, Labor\u2019s Office of  Inspector General (OIG) concluded that little assurance exists that the  data are accurate or verifiable because of inadequate oversight of data  collection and management at the federal, state, and local levels.

A standard reporting form is likely to increase the  consistency of grantee-reported data by ensuring that grantees submit  information on the same data elements. However, Labor has not yet issued  guidance informing grantees how to define data elements such as the  number of participants who have entered employment. Without common  definitions, grantees may submit inconsistent data based on their different  interpretations of data elements. In addition, Labor\u2019s electronic system for  managing the grant application process will enable grantees to submit  their progress reports electronically. The system will compile the data into  an electronic dataset, facilitating analysis of the data.", "Labor is also taking steps to improve the completeness and accuracy of  WIASRD data on national emergency grant participants. In guidance  issued on November 13, 2003, for the submission of program year 2002  data, Labor specified that states are required to include participants who  exited from national emergency grant programs. According to Labor  officials, the agency also plans to clarify the WIASRD reporting  requirements for national emergency grants in new guidance on  performance measures to be issued by July 2004. In addition, for the  program year 2002 WIASRD, Labor checked states\u2019 submissions to  determine whether data had been submitted for all grants awarded. For  states whose submissions were missing data, Labor requested that they  send in a revised submission that included data on national emergency  grants. However, managers of the WIASRD database said that some states  were not able to send in data on national emergency grant participants,  and as a result, the program year 2002 WIASRD will not have complete  data. Although Labor does not have specific, written plans to check states\u2019  future WIASRD submissions to identify missing data, a Labor official  believes the agency will continue to check submissions. Labor is also  planning to implement a data validation program to ensure the accuracy of  state-reported data on national emergency grant participants.

When major layoffs and disasters  occur, states and local areas need to respond quickly to ensure that  workers facing unemployment receive the services they need to re-enter  the workforce at a comparable wage. Unfortunately, their dislocated  worker formula funds are often insufficient to adequately meet the needs  of the large number of workers losing their jobs. In previous work, we  found that the formula used to allocate dislocated worker funds does not  always result in states receiving the amount of funds they need.  Accordingly, states and local areas turn to Labor for additional funds, such  as those reserved by Labor for national emergency grants.", "Timely awarding of national emergency grants is imperative for states and  local areas to provide services when they are most needed. Therefore, it is  important that Labor consider the length of time it takes to complete the  full process for awarding grants. Although Labor is making changes to the  award process, some concerns remain. Labor does not have a timeliness  goal for the full award process or for incremental payments. In addition,  the proposed guidelines do not require the continuous counting of days  from the time the application is received until the grant is awarded\u2014Labor  can stop the clock if officials feel the application is incomplete. As a result,  Labor may appear to meet its timeliness goal even though, from a grantee\u2019s  perspective, the grant funds were received months after the application  was filed.", "Neither of the two primary data sources on the national emergency grants  provides reliable national-level information on how these funds are used.

In its comments, Labor took issue with the report\u2019s  methodology, said it believes that the report makes assertions not  supported by empirical evidence, and disagreed with our conclusions.  Labor stated that timeliness of national emergency grants has been a  concern dating back to JTPA and that the current administration set a goal  of 30 working days to provide states with an answer to a complete  application. Labor also contends that the weaknesses in the improvements  being undertaken in the grant award process that we cite in the report are  subjective and inaccurate. Finally, Labor listed reforms that are under way  or have been implemented, including business process mapping, an  electronic application tool, policy guidance, regional forums, and technical  assistance to states.", "We disagree with Labor\u2019s characterization of the report\u2019s methodology and  conclusions.  As stated in the report, our analysis looked at the complete  application process from a grantee\u2019s perspective. We reviewed files for  every regular grant that was awarded between July 1, 2000, and June 30,  2003, for which complete information was available and compared the  date that Labor received the application with the date Labor issued an  award letter to the grantee. States and local areas apply for national  emergency grants when a major layoff occurs, and it is imperative that  grantees receive funds in a timely manner to provide assistance when it is  most needed. Accordingly, we believe that the date the application is  received is an appropriate starting point for the grant award process.  If  applications are incomplete, then this issue should be addressed and the  application moved forward in a timely manner. We recognize a shared  responsibility to ensure that grant applications are complete and accurate,  and as pointed out in our report, Labor has taken steps to assist grantees  in submitting applications that are as close to being complete as possible.  We also believe that the ending date should be when the grantee is notified  of the award rather than at an interim departmental approval point. As we  reported, the final steps after Labor has stopped the clock on the award  process have taken an additional 20 or more days in some cases. Delays in  grant awards have had effects on the ability of local areas to provide  services to workers who have lost their jobs, as reported by 25 states that  responded to our survey on national emergency grants. For Labor to have  set a goal for the award process is commendable, but the emphasis needs  to be on awarding national emergency grants as quickly as possible to  allow local areas to meet the needs of dislocated workers.", "We also disagree that the stated weaknesses in the improvements being  undertaken in the grant award process are subjective and inaccurate.   Rather these weaknesses are based upon Labor\u2019s proposed guidelines and  discussions with Labor officials. First, Labor\u2019s proposed guidelines state  that Labor is committed to making a decision to approve or disapprove an  application within 30 working days of receiving a complete application.   As pointed out in our report, there are steps that follow this decision that  have taken another 20 days in some cases, and Labor\u2019s counting of days  elapsed may not always be continuous.  We believe the 30-day goal should  include the entire process.  Second, the proposed guidelines do not relate  the 30-day goal to incremental payments, and Labor officials confirmed  that incremental payments are not yet included in the new electronic  system. Third, while the proposed guidelines provide a form for progress  reports, Labor officials acknowledged that data element definitions have  not yet been developed. Finally, while a Labor official speculated that  checking the completeness of states\u2019 submissions to the WIASRD database  would continue, no such plans have been documented.  We believe that to  better manage the national emergency grant award process, these  additional actions should be implemented.", "In regard to the reforms cited by Labor in its comments, our report  identified all of these efforts except for the proposed technical assistance.   We have added a statement to the report to indicate that Labor plans to  provide technical assistance and work with states on an individual basis to  help them fully integrate services available to dislocated workers through  the one-stop service delivery system.
