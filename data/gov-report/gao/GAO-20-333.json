TBML schemes can rely on misrepresenting the price, quantity, or type of goods in trade transactions, but other methods are also used. For example, some drug trafficking organizations from Latin America have used a type of TBML scheme known as the Black Market Peso Exchange (BMPE) to launder funds. BMPE schemes involve merchants who\u2014wittingly or not\u2014accept payment in illicitly derived funds, often from third parties to a trade transaction, for exports of goods. In carrying out TBML schemes, criminal and terrorist organizations use various goods, including precious metals and automobiles (see fig.). U.S. officials and other sources have identified a number of countries as being at particular risk for TBML schemes. Available evidence indicates that the amount of TBML occurring globally is likely substantial. However, specific estimates of the amount of TBML occurring around the world are not available.", "Officials and reporting from relevant international bodies and selected partner countries, and knowledgeable sources recommended various practices for countries to consider to combat TBML, which GAO grouped into five categories: (1) partnerships between governments and the private sector, (2) training, (3) sharing information through domestic interagency collaboration, (4) international cooperation, and (5) further research on challenges to combating TBML.", "The U.S. government's key international effort to counter TBML is the Trade Transparency Unit (TTU) program under the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). ICE set up TTUs in 17 partner countries with the goal of exchanging and analyzing trade data to identify potential cases of TBML. While TTUs have played a role in some TBML investigations, the TTU program has experienced various challenges, including lapses in information sharing between ICE and the partner TTUs, differing priorities between ICE and partner TTUs in pursuing TBML investigations, and limitations in the data system that ICE and the TTUs use. However, ICE has not developed a strategy to increase the effectiveness of the TTU program or a performance monitoring framework to assess the results of its work with partner TTUs. As a result, ICE does not have a clear guide on how best to operate the TTU program and cannot make management decisions based on program results. In addition to the TTU program, the U.S. government collaborates with partner countries and international bodies through a range of other activities, such as developing international anti-money laundering standards, providing training and technical assistance, establishing information-sharing methods, and providing ongoing law enforcement cooperation."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DHS develop (1) a strategy to maximize TTU program effectiveness and (2) a performance monitoring framework for the TTU program.

In misrepresentation schemes, the  parties involved in the trade transaction may under or over invoice goods  or services; issue multiple invoices for the same goods or services;  provide more or less goods or services than the declared amount,  including in some cases providing no goods or services; or falsely  describe the types of goods or services provided. Through these types of  misrepresentation, value can be transferred from one party to another  and the illicit origins of criminal proceeds obscured.", "In a hypothetical TBML scheme involving the misrepresentation of the  price of goods, a criminal organization in Country A needs to launder the  proceeds from its criminal activity and move these proceeds to Country B.  To accomplish this, the criminal organization will use the illicit proceeds to  purchase 100,000 cell phones worth $100 each. The criminal  organizations will then make arrangements to export the 100,000 cell  phones to a co-conspirator in Country B. However, the criminal  organization in Country A, will fraudulently invoice the cell phones at $10  each rather than $100 each. Thus, the co-conspirator in Country B pays a  total of $1 million for the cell phones, rather than their true value of $10  million. The co-conspirator then sells the cell phones at their true market  value of $10 million in Country B resulting in the criminal organization  having successfully transferred $9 million in value from Country A to  Country B through TBML. Figure 1 illustrates how such a price  misrepresentation scheme works.", "Similarly, the criminal organization can transfer value through  misrepresentation of the quantity or type of goods being exported. For  example, the criminal organization can invoice its co-conspirator for  50,000 cell phones, but actually ship 100,000 phones, or it can claim that  it is shipping different, lower value items such as USB flash drives.", "Under a hypothetical Black Market Peso Exchange scheme, a criminal  organization operating in Country A, which uses dollars, will take the  dollar proceeds of its criminal activities to a currency broker\u2019s  representative that has access to currency reserves from Country B  (pesos). At the same time, in Country B, an import company will contact  the currency broker seeking dollars to pay for goods that it wishes to  import from Country A. The currency broker uses the dollars provided by  the criminal organization to pay exporters in Country A on behalf of the  importer in Country B. The importer receives and sells the goods in  Country B and pays the currency broker in pesos. The currency broker  then pays the criminal organization in Country B in pesos, completing the  transfer of its proceeds. Thus, the criminal organization has successfully  shifted the value of its proceeds from Country A to Country B without  having to physically move money, or transfer funds through the banking  system, from Country A to Country B.

Organizations and individuals involved in TBML exploit  vulnerabilities in international trade to move value across international  borders in an attempt to disguise the origin, nature, or source of illicit  proceeds, which may derive from a variety of predicate crimes.  According to Treasury officials, while offenses like smuggling and fraud  may resemble TBML, they differ in purpose. For example, smugglers  attempt to evade detection or the payment of custom fees, duties or taxes  while moving legitimate, illicit, or restricted goods across borders.  Similarly, in frauds involving the (purported) purchase or sale of goods,  one of the parties to the transaction seeks to deceive another one for  financial gain. In TBML, the scheme may be accomplished using  fraudulent documents, such as false invoices, but this is not a necessary  part of the scheme, nor does it alone represent TBML.

Through this TBML scheme, the criminal organizations are able to  move their proceeds to China without going through the financial  system.", "Finally, in Benin, Lebanese financial institutions linked to Hezbollah  were involved in schemes that used TBML to launder funds and move  criminal proceeds through West Africa and back to Lebanon,  according to State reporting in its 2015 International Narcotics Control  Strategy Report. The criminals using these schemes wired funds from  Lebanon to the United States to buy used cars, which were then  shipped to Benin and sold throughout West Africa.

More recently, in 2019, HSI  identified Mexico, China, Colombia, the United Arab Emirates, Ecuador,  Peru, Venezuela, and the United Kingdom as its key countries of TBML  concern.", "In addition to identifying different countries that are vulnerable to money  laundering, the U.S. government and FATF, among others, have  identified free trade zones as particular areas of risk for TBML. In a  2010 report on money laundering vulnerabilities in free trade zones, FATF  identified approximately 3,000 free trade zones located in 135 countries  and noted they had systemic weaknesses making them susceptible to  money laundering and terrorist financing. These weaknesses included  less stringent AML/CFT reporting requirements, relaxed oversight by  responsible government authorities, and weak procedures for inspecting  goods, among other things. Similarly, the 2019 INCSR notes that the 114  free trade zones in Colombia are vulnerable to TBML due to inadequate  regulation, supervision, and transparency."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Specific Estimates of the Amount of TBML Globally Are Unavailable, but Evidence Suggests It Is Likely Substantial and Has Increased in Recent Years", "paragraphs": ["Available evidence from the U.S. government, international bodies, and  knowledgeable sources suggests that the amount of TBML occurring  globally is substantial and has increased in recent years. State has  reported that the amount of money laundered through TBML schemes  may potentially be up to hundreds of billions of dollars globally, every  year. Some U.S. officials and knowledgeable sources believe that, based  upon available evidence, TBML is likely one of the largest forms of money  laundering. In addition, as countries have strengthened their controls to  combat other forms of money laundering, various U.S. government  reports and officials, as well as knowledgeable sources have stated that  there are indications that criminal organizations and terrorist  organizations have increased their use of TBML to launder their funds.  For example, FinCEN has reported that since the Mexican government  increased restrictions on U.S. dollar cash deposits at Mexican financial  institutions in 2010, Mexican drug cartels appear to have increasingly  turned to TBML as an alternative means of repatriating profits from U.S.  drug sales. Similarly, in Australia, as controls on large cash deposits at  ATMs have increased since 2017, criminals have increased their use of  TBML to hide their profits, according U.S. officials at Embassy Canberra.  In addition, the 2020 National Strategy for Combating Terrorist and Other  Illicit Financing notes that there has been a steady decrease in seizures  related to bulk cash smuggling from 2012 through 2018 and states that  this decrease could indicate that criminal organizations are increasingly  turning to other means to move illicit money, including TBML.", "Although various observers believe the magnitude of TBML is large,  specific estimates of the amount of TBML occurring around the world are  unavailable. A number of academic studies have sought to quantify  various aspects of illicit financial flows and money laundering. Although  the results of such studies can shed light on the potential volume of  TBML, none of those we identified in our literature review sought to  develop estimates of TBML specifically. In addition, the studies we  reviewed all had certain methodological limitations.", "We found, based upon our review of relevant literature, that academic  studies seeking to quantity potential illicit financial flows do not provide  the exact extent of TBML. These studies capture activities that are  generally broader than TBML, such as tax avoidance, trade price  manipulation, or trade misinvoicing, which demonstrates the difficulty in  estimating the exact magnitude of TBML activity. For example, one  academic researcher analyzed U.S. Census Bureau trade data over time  to estimate money moved in and out of the United States through trade  price manipulation, which involves prices showing up outside of an  expected range. The stated objectives of trade price manipulation in this  study include not only TBML, but also income tax avoidance or evasion,  among other things. Therefore, measurement of trade price manipulation  is generally broader than that of TBML. For 2018 alone, this researcher  estimated that trade price manipulation accounted for approximately $278  billion moved out of and $435 billion moved into the United States.", "Global Financial Integrity, a nonprofit organization dedicated to studying  the cross-border flow of illegal money, has analyzed International  Monetary Fund and United Nations data to develop an estimate of  potential trade misinvoicing between developing and advanced  economies. In a 2019 report, it calculated the illicit financial flows to and  from 148 developing countries from 2006 to 2015. For 2015, it estimated  that potential trade misinvoicing to and from these 148 developing  countries were between $0.9 trillion and $1.7 trillion. Global Financial  Integrity defines trade misinvoicing as a method for moving money illicitly  across borders that involves the deliberate falsification of the value,  volume, or type of commodity in an international commercial transaction  of goods or services by at least one party to the transaction. Therefore,  measurement of trade misinvoicing is generally broader than that of  TBML. Appendix II provides additional details on our literature review  and efforts to quantify illicit financial flows, including TBML.", "Certain international bodies, such as UNODC, and other organizations  have produced estimates on the amount of criminal proceeds and the  volume of money laundering more broadly. For example, in 2011,  UNODC conducted a meta-analysis of the results of various studies and  estimated that in 2009 the amount of funds available for laundering,  including TBML, was likely around 2.7 percent of global gross domestic  product, or $1.6 trillion. However, the report\u2019s authors noted that the  studies reviewed in the meta-analysis contained a range of  methodological issues and information gaps.", "FinCEN data on SARs related to TBML can also provide an indication of  the potential volume of TBML activity that financial institutions have  detected. In 2010, FinCEN issued an advisory on TBML that found that  financial institutions had filed over 17,000 SARs related to potential TBML  between January 2004 and May 2009, involving over $276 billion worth of  transactions. In addition, we analyzed FinCEN data from more recent  years, using a different methodology, and found financial institutions had  filed 7,044 SARs related to TBML from 2014 to 2018, including 1,673 in  2018. FinCEN officials noted that the number of TBML-related SARs is  a small portion of the total of 9.6 million SARs it received over this period.  However, FinCEN officials also acknowledged that financial institutions  may not have enough information on many trade transactions to  determine whether there is suspicious activity and whether that  suspicious activity is potentially related to TBML schemes.

For example, FATF\u2019s  guidance paper Best Practices on Trade Based Money Laundering  stated that governments should consider conducting periodic joint  meetings with the private sector to discuss emerging TBML trends.  Governments can also provide feedback to private sector entities on what  information is helpful as they conduct investigative work.

For  example:", "U.S. example: In 2017, FinCEN publicly launched the \u201cFinCEN  Exchange\u201d to enhance information sharing between FinCEN, law  enforcement agencies, and financial institutions. FinCEN invites  financial institutions to voluntarily participate. As of December 2018,  FinCEN had convened more than a dozen briefings with law  enforcement agencies across the country, involving more than 40  financial institutions. According to FinCEN officials, through the  FinCEN Exchange, the U.S. government and the private sector are  able to exchange information on priority illicit finance threats, including  TBML. For example, according to Treasury officials, FinCEN  convened a FinCEN Exchange focused on TBML in San Antonio,  Texas in April 2018. According to Treasury\u2019s 2018 National Strategy  for Combating Terrorist and Other Illicit Financing, the information  provided by financial institutions through the FinCEN Exchange  briefings has assisted FinCEN in targeting TBML networks.", "Other country example: In 2015, the United Kingdom established  the Joint Money Laundering Intelligence Task Force as a collaborative  mechanism between the U.K. government and the private sector to  share and collectively analyze information on money laundering and  economic crime threats. The task force brings together a range of  private and public sector organizations, including law enforcement  agencies and financial institutions. According to U.K. officials, TBML is  one of the four priority areas of the task force. The task force has  established six expert working groups led by representatives of the  financial sector, including a TBML expert working group. Among other  things, the TBML expert working group offers experts witness  statements on TBML to support criminal prosecutions.", "In addition to sharing information with and providing feedback to financial  institutions, several knowledgeable sources and reports from international  bodies stated that these partnerships should also include a broad range  of private sector entities involved in international trade. Several  knowledgeable sources have highlighted the need for other private sector  entities involved in international trade, such as shipping companies,  freight forwarders, and customs brokers, to play a role in working with  governments to identify TBML activities. One knowledgeable source  noted that broader partnerships are important because banks and other  financial institutions have a limited ability to detect indicators of potential  TBML in a majority of trade transactions. For example, according to the  Wolfsberg Group, 80 percent of international trade is conducted through  open-account trade. With open-account trade, the transaction is not  financed by a bank. Banks are generally not involved beyond processing  the buyer\u2019s payment to the seller and do not typically receive supporting  documentation related to the transaction. Thus, financial institutions have  limited visibility over open-account transactions and thus limited ability to  identify suspicious activity.", "Several knowledgeable sources and reports from certain partner  countries also acknowledged that challenges exist to creating  partnerships with the private sector. They emphasized that for these  partnerships to be successful, governments should ensure all participants  trust that any information they share will be handled appropriately. For  example, one knowledgeable source noted that countries could develop  standards for information sharing between banks, while providing  assurances about data security, privacy, and confidential commercial  information.

HSI officials  noted that one limitation in the TTU program is that partner TTUs  frequently focus on revenue collection issues and place less priority on  disrupting TBML schemes than HSI does. For example, partner TTUs  may seek to identify instances of customs fraud, which can reduce duties  collected by customs agencies on imported goods, but they may not  pursue the investigation further to disrupt the criminal organizations  involved in the scheme.", "Limited authorities and lack of interagency coordination in TTU  partner countries. Partner TTUs generally operate within their countries\u2019  custom agencies, which frequently do not have their own law  enforcement authorities, according to HSI and other U.S. officials. As a  result, they must coordinate with law enforcement partners within their  countries to be effective. However, HSI officials noted that such  coordination does not always take place. For example, HSI officials in  Mexico stated that the Mexico TTU has had limited effectiveness because  of a lack of sufficient cooperation between Mexican customs and law  enforcement officials. Similarly, in Brazil, HSI officials noted information  sharing with that country\u2019s TTU has been delayed because the TTU lacks  ready access to trade data and must purchase it from a different Brazilian  government agency.", "Data sharing and connectivity. HSI and partner government officials  have also noted issues about uploading partner trade data into DARTTS  and ensuring these data are in a compatible format. For example, an HSI  official in the United Kingdom described a delay of several months in  uploading data from the United Kingdom into DARTTS because of data  formatting issues. In addition, U.S. officials at Embassy Canberra noted  that the Australian TTU has frequently experienced connectivity problems  with DARTTS that have challenged the TTU\u2019s ability to upload its data to  the system.", "In addition, HSI and partner TTU officials noted that there are certain  limitations in DARTTS, including difficulties in working with cross-border  data, that reduce its effectiveness as a tool for HSI and partner TTUs to  use in identifying potential cases of TBML. DHS noted that details on  these limitations are sensitive and we did not include the specifics in this  report."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "HSI Has Not Taken Key Management Steps Related to the TTU Program", "paragraphs": ["Although the TTU program has faced a number of challenges, HSI has  not taken key management steps that could help guide its efforts,  including developing a strategy and a performance monitoring framework.  Because the TTU program involves partnerships between HSI and  foreign governments, HSI has varying levels of ability to address these  challenges through independent action. However, by developing a  strategy and a performance monitoring framework, HSI could assess how  best to plan for and address these challenges in order to maximize the  program\u2019s effectiveness.", "HSI officials stated that they have not produced any sort of planning or  strategy documents specifically for the TTU program. HSI has produced a  strategic plan for fiscal years 2016 through 2020 that references the TTU  program. For example, the strategy notes that HSI plans to, \u201ccontinue to  provide operational, analytical, technical, and targeting support on trade- based money laundering and illicit funding investigations being conducted  by HSI field offices and partner TTUs.\u201d However, the strategy includes  only limited references to the TTU program\u2019s operations. According to  HSI officials, for the TTU program specifically, they only conduct informal,  periodic planning, such as identifying countries that they would like to  prioritize for inclusion in the TTU program. DHS Directive 101-01  establishes requirements for planning, budgeting, programming, and  executing for the department and its component agencies. Among other  things, the directive requires agency heads, including the Director of ICE,  to establish planning processes and methods to oversee program  management and risk management activities for the programs and  operations under their purview. HSI officials noted that in addition to the  HSI strategic plan, they have used some documents, such as FATF\u2019s  2008 report on best practices for combating TBML, to guide the TTU  program, but have not prioritized the development of a strategy for the  TTU program because of resource constraints. Without such a strategy,  however, HSI lacks an important tool to guide its operations, including  how best to work with its partner TTUs to identify potential cases of  TBML, prioritize potential cases for further investigation, and successfully  conduct these investigations. In addition, without a strategy, HSI cannot  effectively plan how to grow the TTU program, where appropriate, and  establish TTUs in additional priority countries. Although developing a  strategy would require an investment of resources, a strategy would help  ensure HSI is utilizing its limited resources effectively to achieve the TTU  program\u2019s goals over the long term.", "According to HSI officials, the HSI TTU tracks some information on the  results of domestic investigations, including the number of TTU-related  cases initiated and arrests made, but it does not have a performance  monitoring framework, with specified metrics, that allows it to track the  results of its work with partner TTUs. HSI officials also stated they have  not conducted any evaluations of the factors that increase or decrease  the TTUs\u2019 effectiveness. As part of its requirement on planning,  programming, budgeting, and execution, DHS Directive 101-01 states  that, among other things, the objective of the execution phase is to  account for cost and performance to determine if value has been  delivered to stakeholders. The directive also notes that annual analysis  and reporting of financial expenditures and performance measure results  are key deliverables during the execution phase. HSI officials  acknowledged that a performance monitoring framework would be  beneficial, but they have prioritized other operational issues because of  limited resources. In addition, they noted designing a performance  monitoring framework that would allow HSI to measure and evaluate the  results achieved through its work with partner TTUs would be challenging  because, among other things, enforcement efforts of partner TTUs are  not within their control and they do not have access to all partner country  information. According to HSI officials, they instead rely on measures  such as the number of trade records uploaded into DARTTS and the  number of foreign users of DARTTS, among other things. However,  without a performance monitoring framework for the TTU program, HSI  lacks important information on what successes the program has achieved  and how to replicate them with other partner TTUs. In addition, HSI lacks  key information on areas where the program is not achieving its intended  results and what adjustments to make in response. As with the  development of a strategy, working to establish a performance monitoring  framework would entail an investment of resources, but once completed it  could help HSI in assessing how to maximize the impact of its resource  investments in the TTU program. In addition, the performance monitoring  framework could help demonstrate results to other stakeholders, such as  State, that may wish to consider providing support to the TTUs in partner  countries."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "U.S. Agencies Have Worked With International Bodies to Develop International Anti-Money Laundering Standards, Share Information, and Strengthen Countries\u2019 Ability to Combat TBML FATF", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. government has worked with FATF, the Egmont Group,  UNODC, and the WCO to combat TBML.

However, Treasury officials from the U.S. government\u2019s delegation to  FATF stated that the standards are designed to provide a robust  framework to help competent authorities prevent, detect, and mitigate  against the misuse of global trade and combat all forms of money  laundering, including TBML. For example, the officials noted that FATF\u2019s  third recommendation identifies the need for countries to criminalize  money laundering, which would include TBML activity.", "The U.S. government also works with FATF to conduct mutual  evaluations of member countries. FATF designed these evaluations,  which are periodic peer reviews for each country, to provide a detailed  assessment of a country\u2019s technical compliance with the FATF standards  and the effectiveness of its AML/CFT systems. These evaluations may at  times highlight issues related to TBML in countries. For example, FATF\u2019s  2014 mutual evaluation of Spain found a significant number of cases  involving TBML, particularly those associated with value added tax or  other tax fraud schemes.", "The U.S. government has also supported FATF\u2019s development of several  reports on TBML, including a 2006 report on types of TBML schemes and  a 2008 report on best practices for detecting TBML. More recently, FATF  published various other reports addressing issues relevant to combating  TBML, including the 2010 Money Laundering Vulnerabilities of Free  Trade Zones, the 2015 Money Laundering/Terrorist Financing Risks and  Vulnerabilities Associated with Gold, and the 2018 Professional Money  Laundering.

According to FinCEN officials, Egmont Group membership is critical to  information sharing in support of FinCEN analysis and U.S. law  enforcement cases because it provides assurances that members have  the appropriate policies and procedures in place to respond to and protect  sensitive information. FinCEN and its FIU counterparts follow the Egmont  Group\u2019s Principles for Information Exchange Between Financial  Intelligence Units, in addition to the law of each jurisdiction, to foster  cooperation while sharing information securely. Generally, Egmont  Group members use a dedicated computer system that the organization  has developed, the Egmont Secure Web, to share information securely.  FinCEN officials stated that they respond to about 1,000 information  requests a year from other Egmont Group members. For example, at the  request of a foreign FIU, FinCEN conducted research on an import/export  company suspected of involvement in TBML, summarizing relevant SARs  and identifying other relevant information on the subjects. FinCEN\u2019s  assessment determined the potential use of a TBML scheme and use of  shell companies to obfuscate the flow of funds.", "FinCEN has also supported the Egmont Group\u2019s efforts to provide training  to member FIUs on issues related to money laundering and terrorism  financing. For example, FinCEN has helped develop and deliver Egmont  Group-sponsored training to FIU analysts on how to understand complex  financial data. However, Treasury officials stated that the Egmont Group  has not provided any TBML-specific training. Although the Egmont Group  has not sponsored TBML-specific training for FIUs, FinCEN officials noted  that FinCEN has hosted officials from several partner FIUs at the TBML  conferences it held in 2018 and 2019 and has provided its own TBML- related training to partner FIUs. For example, in October 2019, FinCEN  provided TBML-related training to Mexico\u2019s FIU.", "Finally, FinCEN has supported the Egmont Group\u2019s development of  relevant guidance documents. For example, the Egmont Group  developed, in partnership with FATF, a 2013 report called Money  Laundering and Terrorist Financing through Trade in Diamonds.  According to the report, the two bodies decided to undertake the research  because they had (1) never conducted in-depth research on the diamond  trade and associated money laundering and terrorist financing risks and  (2) a number of participants in the bodies had noted indications that the  diamond trade was being exploited for money laundering and terrorist  financing purposes.

Through  the program, UNODC has provided training and technical assistance to a  range of member states throughout the world. For example, as part of the  program, UNODC places AML experts in countries for up to a year to  serve as mentors. These mentors provide a range of support, such as  helping countries establish functioning FIUs. UNODC also conducts  shorter-term workshops and training sessions, such as mock trial training  for law enforcement officers, prosecutors, and judges to enhance their  ability to investigate and prosecute money laundering cases.

Criminal and terrorist organizations use TBML schemes to disguise the  origins of billions of dollars in funds generated by their illicit activities.  Given the national security threat that TBML poses, it is crucial that the  U.S. government develop an effective response to combat it. Because  TBML is international in nature and frequently involves complex, difficult  to detect schemes that cut across international borders, it is important  that the U.S. government respond through domestic efforts and  collaborate with partner countries and international bodies to address the  problem. As the U.S. government\u2019s primary partnership program focused  on combating TBML, the TTU program plays a key role in these efforts to  collaborate with other countries. Although the TTU program has achieved  some successes, it has also faced a number of challenges. However, HSI  has not taken key management steps to address those challenges and to  strengthen the TTU program. HSI, for example, has not established a  strategy for the TTU program. Because HSI does not have such a  strategy, it lacks an important guide for its efforts to maximize the  effectiveness of its existing TTU partnerships and to prioritize efforts to  expand the program to other countries. HSI also does not have a  performance monitoring framework that tracks the results of its work with  partner TTUs.

DHS, State, and Treasury provided technical comments, which we  incorporated as appropriate. DOJ noted that it had no comments on the  draft. DHS also provided written comments, which are reproduced in  appendix III. In its comments, DHS stated it concurred with our  recommendation that the Secretary of Homeland Security direct the  Director of ICE develop a strategy for the TTU program, but did not  concur with our recommendation to develop a performance monitoring  framework for the program. In its response to our recommendation  regarding a strategy for the TTU program, DHS noted that HSI has a  strategic plan for fiscal years 2016 through 2020 that addresses the TTU  program. However, it stated that the TTU program would develop, as a  complement to the HSI strategic plan, a document that outlines emerging  threats and challenges, as well as existing metrics that are used to track  program results for the TTU.", "In noting it did not concur with our recommendation to develop a  performance monitoring framework for the TTU, DHS stated the TTU  program already collects a number of statistics each fiscal year related to  its program results and can use these statistics to demonstrate program  results. DHS also stated that while the TTU program\u2019s primary mission is  to establish partnerships and provide foreign law enforcement with  information tools to facilitate the exchange of data between TTUs, HSI  has limited ability to track the activities of partner TTUs and cannot dictate  the enforcement actions partner countries take. In our report, we  acknowledge that the HSI TTU tracks some information on the results of  domestic investigations, as well as other information, such as the number  of records in DARTTS. We also acknowledge that because the TTU  program involves partnerships between HSI and foreign governments,  HSI does not have the ability to independently control all aspects of the  program\u2019s performance. However, we believe that further action by HSI to  establish a performance monitoring framework is warranted for the  following reasons. First, although HSI has noted examples of statistics it  can use to measure the performance of the TTU program, it does not  have a formally documented framework or process for measuring its  performance or reporting performance results. Second, while the TTU  program has identified a few indicators it uses in assessing performance,  it has not established any indicators with goals for which to measure its  results against, making it challenging to assess whether HSI is making  progress to achieve the program\u2019s goals. Third, even though HSI has  some measures, such as the number of TTU-related cases it has initiated  or arrests made, HSI officials acknowledged that the agency does not  track information on what role the TTU actually played in these cases. As  a result, HSI cannot establish the extent to which the TTU, rather than a  different HSI office, has contributed to any of the measures. Fourth,  although we recognize that HSI does not have the ability to dictate what  actions partner TTUs will take and may not have access to all relevant  partner country information, HSI does have opportunities to take further  action to monitor the outputs of its work with partner TTUs. For example,  HSI could work with partner TTUs to collect information more  systematically on successful cases that they have initiated. HSI could  also collect information on factors that reduced the ability of partner TTUs  to successfully pursue cases. Other U.S. agencies have conducted  performance monitoring and evaluations on programs that rely on  partnership and collaboration with foreign governments.", "We continue to believe in the need for a rigorous performance monitoring  framework for the TTU program, a key U.S. government effort in  combatting TBML. We note that HSI could potentially integrate a  performance monitoring framework into the strategy it plans to develop in  response to our first recommendation.

We considered  existing studies from peer-reviewed journals, conference papers,  dissertations, government reports, industry articles, and think-tank  publications identified through searches the GAO librarian conducted of  various databases, such as EconLit, Social SciSearch, and Scopus. We  also asked for recommendations on relevant publications as part of our  initial meetings with U.S. agencies and knowledgeable sources. After  conducting the searches and relying on recommendations, we started the  review with 82 studies. To assess the methodological quality of the  studies, we relied on generally accepted social science standards. We  examined summary level information about each piece of literature, and  then from this review, identified 14 articles that sought to quantify  potential illicit financial flows, including TBML. A GAO economist  evaluated the methods used in the research, eliminated some research if  the methods were not appropriate or not rigorous, and then summarized  the research findings. In addition, a GAO methodologist performed a  secondary review and confirmed our reported analysis of the finding. We  further eliminated four studies and eventually identified 10 studies  published between 2009 and 2019 that were relevant to our research  objective on what the available evidence indicates about the extent of  international TBML activities. We also identified one additional article  published in 1999, which other articles frequently cited as a pioneer  method of measuring money laundering, and included it in our review.  See table 3 below for the list of studies included in our analysis.", "We found that estimating the extent of money laundering is a challenging  task given that criminals seek to hide their illegal activities. Still, economic  and statistical models have been developed that attempt to quantify the  extent of such activities using various published datasets. However, none  of the studies we identified in our literature review sought to develop  estimates of TBML specifically and all the studies we reviewed capture  activities that are generally broader than TBML to include tax avoidance,  trade price manipulation, or trade misinvoicing, which demonstrates the  difficulty in estimating the magnitude of TBML activity. In addition,  according to the literature we reviewed, the studies we identified all had  certain methodological limitations.", "We found that studies seeking to quantify potential money laundering  activities, including TBML, have typically relied on one of four methods:  (1) Walker gravity model, (2) unit price analysis, (3) trade mirror analysis,  or (4) a theoretical model."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Walker Gravity Model", "paragraphs": ["One of the first researchers that attempted to measure money laundering  is John Walker. In a paper published in 1999, he used what became  known as the Walker gravity model to estimate the amount of money  laundering globally. The gravity model states that the amount of trade  from place A to place B depends on the size of the population in A, the  \u201cattractiveness\u201d of B to people based in A, and the distance between the  two places. The Walker model based the \u201cattractiveness\u201d of a place on  four assumptions: (1) foreign countries with a tolerant attitude towards  money laundering will attract a greater proportion of the funds than more  vigilant countries; (2) high levels of corruption or conflict will deter money  launderers, because of the risks of losing their funds; (3) countries with  high levels of gross national product per capita will be preferred by money  launderers, since it would be easier to \u201chide\u201d their transaction; and (4)  other things being equal, geographic distance, and linguistic or cultural  differences, work as deterrents to money launderers.", "According to the literature we reviewed, the Walker gravity model has  several limitations. First, because the flows of money laundering are  unobservable, it is not possible to assess the quality of the formula.  Second, although some factors in the attractiveness indicators are  plausible, they are still arbitrary. Third, the researcher acknowledged that  these figures represent only an interim set of results to show the types of  output that would be derived from a fully developed model. These  estimates are not his best and final estimates of money laundering  around the world. Because of these limitations and considering the  estimates are based on data that date to 1995, we did not present the  estimates in the report. However, considering the importance of the  Walker gravity model in the literature on measuring money laundering, we  discussed this model in the report to provide context on methods used to  quantify potential money laundering activities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Unit Price Analysis", "paragraphs": ["A researcher used the unit price analysis to analyze U.S. trade data to  quantify the magnitude of suspicious trade transactions. The database  contains information at the transaction level that is reported to the U.S.  Census Bureau from Shipper\u2019s Export Declarations and U.S. Customs  Service Entry Summary forms. The model follows the International  Revenue Service\u2019s definition of suspicious prices, which, according to the  researcher, is defined as prices that are outside of the upper- or lower- quartile price range for each commodity in each country. He then  aggregated the total dollar amount to come up with an estimate of the  amount of suspicious trade. The researcher found that in 2018, total  money moved out of United States through under-valued exports and  over-valued imports was approximately $278 billion. Total money moved  into the United States through over-valued exports and under-valued  imports was approximately $435 billion.", "According to the literature we reviewed and information we received from  the Census Bureau, we found that the unit price analysis approach has  several limitations. First, the Census Bureau edits raw trade data received  from Customs and Border Protection by automatically correcting unit  prices that fall outside of its price parameters, which it establishes using  industry analysis, input from public and private entities, and trend data. Of  the total amount of export and import records in a specific month, roughly  18 percent to 22 percent contain some type of editing, according to the  Census Bureau. The edited data with some extreme unit prices (those  that fall outside of price parameters set by the Census Bureau) already  \u201ccorrected\u201d creates issues for the unit price analysis, which relies on  identification of extreme unit prices.", "Second, the use of lower- or upper-quartile as price filters is somewhat  arbitrary. For example, another study noted a fundamental weakness is  that unit price analysis depends on the existence of a benchmark against  which \u201cabnormality\u201d can be assessed. A lower benchmark would, in most  product categories, produce more prices flagged as suspicious.", "Moreover, estimates from the unit price analysis also include other types  of illicit activities in addition to TBML, such as income tax avoidance or  evasion, among others. Therefore, this measurement of suspicious trade  is generally broader than that of TBML. In addition, because of their focus  on identifying suspicious prices, these estimates exclude other types of  TBML that may not utilize over- or under-invoicing techniques, such as  the Black Market Peso Exchange."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Trade Mirror Analysis", "paragraphs": ["The third approach, adopted by Global Financial Integrity and several  other scholars, uses trade mirror analysis to estimate the amount of trade  misinvoicing. This approach compares what country A reports as an  export to country B and what B reports as an import from A (or vice  versa).

First, Global Financial Integrity relied on the  International Monetary Fund\u2019s (IMF) Direction of Trade Statistics and  selected bilateral trade reports for 148 developing countries trading with  36 advanced economies from 2006 to 2015. Global Financial Integrity  calculated potential trade misinvoicing as the import and export gaps,  netted of the insurance and freight costs differentials. Second, Global  Financial Integrity used United Nations Comtrade data to calculate trade  gaps, where Comtrade gaps are calculated for each of the Harmonized  System six-digit commodity classes available. Global Financial Integrity  found that over the 10-year period of this study, potential trade  misinvoicing amounted to between 19 and 24 percent of developing  country trade on average. For 2015, it estimated that potential trade  misinvoicing to and from these 148 developing countries were between  $0.9 trillion and $1.7 trillion.", "According to the literature we reviewed, the Trade Mirror Analysis  approach also has several limitations. First, alternative, legitimate reasons for import and export gaps may exist. For example, a researcher  noted that \u201cprice volatility, transit and merchant trade, and the use of  bonded warehouses can result in large trade data discrepancies arising  from legitimate trade.\u201d Another researcher also noted that major  differences in customs import valuation methodologies and customs  administration fees could contribute to trade data discrepancies.  Moreover, accurate records may not always exist, especially in  developing economies.", "Second, according to one researcher, the IMF and the United Nations,  whose data these studies draw on, warn that the statistics cannot be  reliably used in this way. The IMF says, \u201cwe caution against attempting to  measure  by using discrepancies in macroeconomic  datasets\u2026. fficial estimates of trade misinvoicing cannot be derived by  transforming trade data from the IMF Trade Statistics and/or United  Nations Comtrade, either by individual country or in aggregate.\u201d", "Moreover, Global Financial Integrity defines trade misinvoicing as the  fraudulent manipulation of the price, quantity, or quality of a good or  service to shift money across international borders. Therefore, this  measurement of trade misinvoicing is generally broader than that of  TBML. However, certain types of TBML schemes are likely not included in  the estimate of trade misinvoicing. For example, Black Market Peso  Exchange schemes are likely not included because they do not require  falsification of the price, quantity, or quality of a good or service.", "Another study sought to account for various factors that may lead to  simple import-export discrepancies. The analysis focuses on under- reporting of Italian exports and over-reporting of Italian imports. The  authors used a linear mixed model, where the dependent variable is the  discrepancy in mirror statistics. The authors adopted a \u201cresidual  approach,\u201d in which the model controls for the main legal determinants of  mirror statistics gaps, and the estimate residuals are proxy measures of  the illegal component of such discrepancies.

They face transaction costs in the legal sector and costs  of being detected in the illegal sector. Two types of firms produce with two  different technologies a legal good and an illegal good. The government  sets fines, can influence the probability of detection, and can influence the  liquidity of the economy. There is a liquidity constraint. If households want  more liquid funds, they must engage in the illegal sector.
