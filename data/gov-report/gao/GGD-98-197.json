To recover the costs of providing services to asylum applicants, INS charges all other immigration and naturalization applicants a surcharge.", "In subsequent years, according to INS officials, Congress directed that additional services that traditionally had been paid from appropriated accounts were to be paid from the IEFA. For example, in fiscal year 1996, Congress directed that the costs of the Cuban-Haitian Entrant Program from the Community Relations Service Appropriation be borne by the IEFA. INS officials said that this transfer required the IEFA to absorb $10 million in unreimbursed services.

Starting in the spring of 1996, the fee study team was comprised of INS personnel and contracted technical staff from McNeil Technologies, Inc., and Coopers & Lybrand L.L.P. INS identified which fees should be revised by studying all types of applications with an annual adjudicated volume of 10,000 or more (26 large-volume applications).

On the basis of interviews and observations at INS service centers and district offices, the study team identified the activities that made up the application process and diagrammed the flow of applications from receipt through their adjudication process. For example, the study identified six common activities (e.g., receive application/petition, manage records, and respond to inquiry) and two unique activities (i.e., adjudicate application and issue end product). Each activity included a number of identified tasks. For example, the activity referred to as \u201creceive application/petition\u201d would include various tasks, such as get the mail, open the mail, and affix the date stamp.

Using this calculation, INS derived the total estimated cycle time to be spent processing a single application type. By adding the total cycle times for each of the 26 large-volume application types, INS determined the total time spent by staff processing all applications.", "Using the above information, INS then calculated the percentage of total time needed to process each application type to the total processing time for all application types. INS then applied the resultant percentages for each application type against the IEFA budget, which had been adjusted to include certain unfunded items. The application of the percentages to the budget determined the total cost for processing an application by type. By dividing the result by the estimated number of applications to be received, INS determined a unit cost for each application by type. To this amount, INS added a pro rata cost for processing waivers and asylee applications (i.e., applications for which fees are not charged) to develop a fee for each application type.", "According to Circular A-25, the fees charged are to be reviewed every 2 years and adjusted as costs change or as more precise cost determination processes become available. In August 1998, on the basis of the 1997 fee study, INS published its new fees in the Federal Register. Except for the Application for Naturalization fee, the implementation of which is being delayed until January 15, 1999, the application fees are scheduled to become effective on October 13, 1998.

We also examined INS\u2019 sampling plan and how it was implemented to select application processing sites and personnel for observation. We compared the sampling plan to sound social science procedures. Such procedures included (1) the identification of a known universe of application processing sites and the use of unbiased sampling procedures to randomly select sites from this universe, (2) full disclosure of study procedures and limitations, and (3) procedures to ensure the statistical validity of the data used and appropriate generalization on the basis of the data gathered and analyzed.", "Moreover, we interviewed key officials from the INS Office of Budget, Fee Policy and Rate Setting Branch.

According to them, the best data source INS had available for its analysis was the President\u2019s Fiscal Year 1998 Budget for the IEFA. To recognize certain costs that were not covered in the estimated IEFA portion of the budget, INS adjusted that amount by adding to it estimates of certain unfunded costs, including unused annual leave carryover, contingent liabilities, and bad debt expenses. However, INS was not able to calculate other cost items typically included in determining full costs. These cost items included unfunded pension liability and postretirement life insurance and health benefits costs; depreciation expenses; support service costs from other INS functions (e.g., supply costs, utilities, insurance, travel, and rents); and some inter-entity costs, which did not include reimbursable agreements (e.g., services provided to INS by other government agencies, i.e., the Department of State).", "INS\u2019 fee study recognizes that these costs were not included and attributes their omission to such factors as the lack of an adequate financial management information system, time and cost constraints to develop certain information, or the lack of Office of Personnel Management and OMB guidance on how certain costs are to be incorporated into the fees. Had INS been able to calculate these amounts and include them in its fee calculations, the unfunded pension liability and postretirement life insurance and health benefits costs, depreciation expenses, support service costs, and inter-entity costs could have increased the fees.

According to the memorandum, OMB believes that significant progress toward the full cost accounting standard can be made by recognizing several major categories of costs that are paid by one agency but reported by another agency. Among those costs that OMB is asking agencies to recognize are costs funded by the Office of Personnel Management, such as employees\u2019 pension, health and life insurance, and other benefits for retired employees. For information needed to calculate these items, OMB directs agencies, where applicable, to consult with the Office of Personnel Management. Moreover, OMB asks agencies not to recognize any other inter-entity costs until OMB can provide further guidance.

INS judged that offices in the Eastern Region were underrepresented. To compensate for this situation, INS randomly selected the Boston District Office from a pool of district offices in the northeast and added it to the large district office selections. In addition, it removed the Honolulu District Office from the sample, because of the high costs of travel to Hawaii, and randomly selected the Philadelphia District Office from the remaining offices in the medium district office stratum to replace Honolulu. Moreover, INS added the Baltimore District Office to the sample because the district office was piloting an automated application processing system that it plans to roll out over time to other offices. INS wanted to determine how this system would affect the processing of applications.", "During the study, INS for various reasons made additional sampling adjustments, some of which affected the randomness of the sample.

For example, Hawaii was excluded from the initially drawn sample due to travel costs. It is not clear whether INS would have excluded other offices, such as Anchorage, AK, or San Juan, PR, due to high travel costs had they been selected. To have precluded this problem, INS should have specified before its initial selections which offices were eligible for data collection and which were not. INS then should have specified that its projections only referred to eligible offices.", "Second, even if INS had defined a universe of sites, its timings of employee activities cannot be adjusted to adequately represent all employees who process applications, because of the judgmental changes made in the way employees were selected for observation.", "Additionally, the data collection database did not provide sufficient information about the observations or the sample design to enable calculation of sampling errors or to evaluate the accuracy of the fees. For example, observations cannot be distinguished by individual employees in the database, nor can the times for specific work tasks be separated.
