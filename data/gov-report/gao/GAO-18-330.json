Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) guidance, issued in September 2017 to implement congressional direction, required the military departments to include in their submissions, at a minimum, purchases of services with a total contract value of $3 million or more, and in four services acquisition portfolio groups\u2014logistics management, equipment-related, knowledge-based, and electronics and communications.", "As permitted under OSD's inventory guidance, the military departments varied somewhat in how they reported their contracted services data to OSD. For example, the Army and Air Force included purchases both over and under $3 million and the Air Force also identified purchases by the four portfolio groups. The Navy submitted summary data of contracted services but did not provide a list of purchases in time to be included in an inventory summary for Congress. An OSD official said, however, that the information provided was sufficient to prepare the inventory summary, which OSD submitted to Congress in February 2018. The Navy subsequently provided a list of its fiscal year 2016 service purchases to OSD in March 2018.", "Military departments generally have not developed plans to use the inventory for workforce and budget decisions, as statutorily required. This is consistent with what GAO found in November 2014 and October 2016. GAO's analysis found that the military departments' guidance generally does not require using the inventory in workforce and budget decisions (see table).", "Army manpower officials told GAO that inventory information such as the number of contractor full-time equivalents and the functions performed can be used to inform workforce mix decisions. However, workforce and budget officials at the Army, Navy, and Air Force stated they make limited use of the inventory to inform decision-making, in part because by the time the inventory is available, the data reflected are often too outdated to inform strategic decisions. GAO has previously recommended ways to improve use of the inventory. In November 2014, for example, GAO found that a lack of officials at the military departments who are accountable for integrating the use of the inventory leaves the department at continued risk of not complying with the legislative requirement to use the inventory to support management decisions. This issue persists, as the military departments have not made final designations for accountable officials responsible for developing plans and enforcement mechanisms to use the inventory."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is not making new recommendations in this report.

DOD relies on  contractors to provide a wide array of services, including support for  management, information technology, and weapon systems. There are  benefits to using contractors to perform services for the government, but  the government can become overly reliant on contractors and risk  contractors performing inherently governmental functions. This risk is  increased for certain types of services, including program evaluation,  systems engineering, and information technology support services, as the  Office of Federal Procurement Policy and our prior work has found.", "Beginning in 2001, Congress enacted legislation to improve DOD\u2019s ability  to manage its acquisitions of contracted services, to make more strategic  decisions about the appropriate workforce mix, and to better align  resource needs through the budget process to achieve that mix. As part  of these efforts, section 2330a of title 10 of the U.S. Code requires DOD  to conduct certain activities, including: establishing a data collection system to provide management  information with regard to service purchases by the military  departments and defense agencies; and annually compiling an inventory of services contracted for or on behalf  of DOD during the preceding fiscal year. This inventory is intended, in  part, to help provide better insight into the number of contractor full- time equivalents (FTE) providing services to the department and the  functions they are performing.", "Further, this section requires the military departments and defense  agencies to undertake certain actions using the inventory, including:  reviewing the contracts and activities in the inventory for which the  secretary or agency head is responsible to ensure that personal  services contracts in the inventory are performed under applicable  statutes and regulations and to identify contracted functions that DOD  should consider for conversion to government performance, also  known as insourcing; and developing a plan, including an enforcement mechanism and approval  process, to use the inventory for strategic workforce planning,  workforce mix determinations, and budget decisions.", "Section 812 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal  Year 2017 amended these requirements by changing the scope of the  data to be collected and the type of activities to be reported to Congress.  Specifically, section 812 increased the minimum value of service  purchases for which information is to be collected from those in excess of  $150,000 to those in excess of $3 million, reduced the types of services  included, and changed DOD\u2019s reporting requirements. Section 812 also  contained a provision for us to report on the status of data collection and  assess DOD\u2019s efforts to develop a plan and enforcement mechanism to  use the inventory. This report addresses how DOD (1) collected data on  its service purchases to create an inventory of fiscal year 2016 contracted  services and (2) used the inventory to inform workforce planning,  workforce mix, and budget decisions.", "To determine how DOD collected data to create an inventory of fiscal  year 2016 contracted services (fiscal year 2016 inventory), we reviewed  relevant legislation and the Office of the Secretary of Defense\u2019s (OSD)  Fiscal Year 2016 Guidance Related to the Inventory and Tracking of  Contracted Services (OSD\u2019s inventory guidance), issued in September  2017. We focused on the fiscal year 2016 inventory because it was the  most recent inventory at the time of our review and is the inventory to  which the September 2017 guidance pertains. We interviewed officials at  the Under Secretary of Defense offices for Personnel and Readiness  (USD(P&R)); Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (USD(AT&L)); and  the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) about their roles in  establishing OSD\u2019s inventory guidance for fiscal year 2016 and other  aspects of the inventory process. We focused our review of the process  for compiling data for the inventory on the military departments because  they represented about 79 percent of overall service contract obligations  in fiscal year 2016, though other DOD components, such as combatant  commands and defense agencies, are also responsible for creating  inventories under OSD\u2019s inventory guidance. We interviewed officials at  the military departments\u2014Army, Navy, and Air Force\u2014to understand  their approach to collecting contracted services data, including their use  of data systems, and compiling their inventories.", "To understand the potential impact on data collection of the recent  statutory changes, as implemented in OSD\u2019s inventory guidance, we  reviewed and analyzed information from USD(AT&L)\u2019s Defense  Procurement and Acquisition Policy (DPAP) office. Specifically, we  analyzed the contracted services data from the Federal Procurement  Data System-Next Generation (FPDS-NG) that DPAP posted on its  website in sets showing fiscal year 2016 service purchases before and  after scope changes were applied. To ascertain the reliability of the  data, we replicated USD(AT&L)\u2019s process for extracting data from FPDS- NG based on officials\u2019 descriptions of that process and compared the  results with the data on USD(AT&L)\u2019s website. We found minimal  differences (0.4 percent or less) in the number of and amounts of fiscal  year 2016 obligations for service purchases between the two data sets  and determined the data were reliable for estimating the potential  changes in the amount of data reported. We also reviewed the military  departments\u2019 inventory submissions to OSD to determine how they  incorporated key aspects of OSD\u2019s inventory guidance, such as the dollar  value and types of contracts included.", "To determine how DOD used the inventory for workforce planning,  workforce mix, and budget decisions, we updated the information we  collected for our October 2016 report on this issue to establish the extent  to which each military department\u2019s strategic workforce planning,  workforce mix, and budgeting guidance and processes required or cited  the use of the inventory of contracted services, as of February 2018. To  do so, we interviewed and obtained information from manpower and  budget officials at the military departments about the status of their efforts  to develop plans and to use the inventory, confirmed whether the  guidance identified in our October 2016 report remained current as of  February 2018, and, as appropriate, obtained and reviewed any new or  revised guidance issued after our October 2016 report. In responding to  our draft report, the Navy provided additional information about its  guidance in March 2018. In addition, we interviewed USD(P&R),  USD(AT&L), and Comptroller officials regarding their department-wide  perspectives on the utility of the inventory to inform management  decisions.", "We conducted this performance audit from June 2017 to March 2018 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

Congress amended section 2330a in 2008 to add a requirement for the  Secretary of Defense to submit an annual inventory of the activities  performed pursuant to contracts for services on behalf of DOD during the  preceding fiscal year.", "The inventory is to include a number of specific data elements for each  identified activity, including:  the function and missions performed by the contractor;  the contracting organization, the military department or defense  agency administering the contract, and the organization whose  requirements are being met through contractor performance of the  function;  the funding source for the contract by appropriation and operating  agency;  the fiscal year the activity first appeared on an inventory;  the number of contractor employees (expressed as FTEs) for direct  labor hours and associated cost data collected from contractors; a determination of whether the contract pursuant to which the activity  is performed is a personal services contract; and a summary of the contracted services data required to be collected in  subsection 2330a(a) of title 10 of the U.S. Code.", "The secretaries of the military departments and heads of the defense  agencies are required to review the contracts and activities in the  inventory for which they are responsible to ensure that personal services  contracts were performed appropriately and that the activities listed do  not include inherently governmental functions, among other factors.

This, in turn, left the  department at risk of not complying with legislative requirements. We  recommended that secretaries of the military departments identify an  accountable official within their departments with responsibility for  leading and coordinating efforts across their manpower, budgeting,  and acquisition functional communities, and, as appropriate, revise  guidance, develop plans and enforcement mechanisms, and establish  processes. DOD concurred with the recommendation, but as of  January 2018, the Army and Navy still had not identified accountable  officials. The Air Force has identified an interim accountable official in  its Program Executive Office for Combat and Mission Support,  according to an Air Force official.", "In November 2015, we found that DOD\u2019s effort to establish an office to  implement and support a common, enterprise-wide contractor  manpower data system had encountered a number of challenges and  lacked clearly defined roles and responsibilities for the office. DOD  had not outlined the relationships between the support office, military  departments, and other stakeholders in exploring the longer-term  solution to collect contractor manpower data and integrate inventory  data within the military departments\u2019 decision-making processes. We  recommended DOD clearly identify the longer-term relationships  between the support office, military departments, and other  stakeholders. DOD concurred and has since stood up the support  office (now called the Total Force Management Support Division) and  implemented the Enterprise-wide Contractor Manpower Reporting  Application (ECMRA) department-wide. However, DOD has not yet  fully identified longer-term relationships. By doing so, DOD would help  ensure that efforts to integrate contracted services data into decision- making processes will meet user needs and expectations.", "Most recently, in October 2016, we found that DOD components  (which include the military departments) continued to improve their  reviews of the inventory compared to prior years, but that they may  continue to underreport contractors providing services that are closely  associated with inherently governmental functions. Specifically, our  analysis found that in fiscal year 2014 DOD obligated about $28 billion  for contracts in the product service codes that the Office of Federal  Procurement Policy and GAO identified as more likely to include  closely associated with inherently governmental functions. In  comparison, the components identified a total of $10.8 billion in  obligations or dollars invoiced for contracts that included such work.

For example, the guidance  required that the inventory submissions include, at a minimum, all  purchases of services with a total contract value of $3 million or more and  in the following service acquisition portfolio groups: logistics management  services; equipment-related services; knowledge-based services; and  electronics and communications services. It did not, however, preclude  the military departments from submitting additional information beyond  the minimum threshold. In addition, under the guidance, military  departments were encouraged to augment FPDS-NG data with data from  ECMRA, as has been the process in the past. We analyzed the effect of  the recent statutory changes, as implemented in OSD\u2019s inventory  guidance, on fiscal year 2016 contracted services data reported in FPDS- NG and compiled by USD(AT&L). We found that the number of service  purchases reported under the inventories across the department would  be reduced to about 2 percent of the total service purchases if the  components reported only the minimum information required under  OSD\u2019s guidance. This approach would capture about 30 percent of the  total service contract dollars.", "Officials responsible for overseeing the data collection effort within each  of the three military departments stated that for fiscal year 2016 they  collected data captured in FPDS-NG and ECMRA, as they have done for  previous inventories.

The Army reported that its fiscal year 2016 inventory  accounts for $31 billion in invoiced amounts and 157,000 contractor  FTEs.", "Navy officials stated that they captured nearly all of their inventory  data for fiscal year 2016 from FPDS-NG and combined it with ECMRA  data. Navy officials estimated that approximately 75 percent of the  Navy services contracts that it believed should have been reported in  ECMRA were reported during fiscal year 2016. The Navy submitted  summary data, including fiscal year 2016 obligations and contractor  FTEs by command and in total, to OSD in December 2017.

Although program offices generally kept track of their  future service contract needs and estimated costs for 5 years out,  they were not required to identify planned service contract spending  beyond the budget year. We recommended that the military  departments revise their programming guidance to collect information  on how contracted services will be used to meet requirements beyond  the budget year. DOD partially concurred with our recommendation,  but noted that the volatility of requirements and each budget cycle  constrain the department\u2019s ability to accurately quantify service  contract requirements beyond the budget year. We agreed that  requirements and budgets change over time, but our work showed  that the needed data already exists and is not captured in such a way  to inform senior leadership on future service contract spending.
