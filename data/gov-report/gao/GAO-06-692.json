Primarily, key buildings on the site have fallen behind schedule due to difficulties working with Russian subcontractors. Such delays have been costing DOD more than $3 million per month since October 2005 and will continue until the award of a crucial subcontract, possibly in June 2006. Uncertain progress of Russian construction on the site, unpredictable Russian regulatory requirements, and various technical issues, such as testing the facility, could cause further schedule delays and increase costs. Also, DOD lacks a reliable earned value management (EVM) system to record, predict, and monitor the project's progress. DOD allocated $6.7 million to the project's contractor in September 2004 to establish an EVM system and expected to have a validated EVM system in place by March 2005. DOD cannot use the current EVM system to assess the final schedule and cost for completing the Shchuch'ye facility because it contains flawed and unreliable data. In addition, the contractor has not yet conducted an IBR of the Shchuch'ye project. Furthermore, it remains uncertain whether the Russian government can destroy its entire chemical weapons stockpile by the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) extended deadline of 2012. As of March 2006, Russia had destroyed about 3 percent of its 40,000 metric tons of chemical weapons at two completed destruction facilities. To eliminate the remainder of its chemical weapons over the next six years, the Russian government must construct and operate five additional destruction facilities, including Shchuch'ye.

As of March 2006, Russia had destroyed about 1,158 metric tons of blister agents, about 3  percent of its stockpile. Under the CWC, Russia must destroy all of its  chemical weapons by the extended deadline of 2012. The CWC is a  multilateral arms control treaty that bans the development, production,  stockpiling, transfer, and use of chemical weapons and requires the  destruction of existing chemical weapons stocks. Until destroyed,  chemical weapons remain a proliferation threat.", "In 1992, the United States agreed to assist the Russian government in  eliminating its chemical weapons stockpile. The United States has  committed to fund the design, construction, equipment acquisition and  installation, systems integration, training, and start-up of the Shchuch\u2019ye facility. When completed, the facility will house about 100 buildings and  structures, including the destruction buildings where chemical munitions  are destroyed; the administration building where the destruction process  is controlled; and support buildings such as the boiler house, which provides heat to the entire facility. As originally planned, the facility\u2019s  construction was expected to begin in March 2001 and to be completed in  2005.

Contracts are  executed, managed, and reviewed in accordance with DOD and Federal  Acquisition Regulations (FAR). Subcontractors submit bids in response to  Requests for Proposal (RFP) issued by Parsons. Parsons then awards the  subcontract on the basis of safety records, past performance, quality of  work, price, and other factors. After awarding these contracts, Parsons  works with the subcontractors to conduct technical evaluations of the  schedule and cost of the work. CTR assistance will finance the  construction of all buildings and structures on site, except for one.

We also observed piping and wiring being installed above ground for site  wide electrical, heat, and water utilities.", "Despite such progress, the CWDF project has not met scheduled  milestones, primarily because of a delay in awarding the contract for the  completion of the CTR-funded destruction building (Building 101),  pictured in figure 4. In January 2005, DOD estimated that the CWDF would cost $1.039 billion and be transferred to the Russian Federation by July  2009. However, in March 2006, DOD officials stated that they were unable  to estimate when the entire facility will be completed and at what cost  until they award a contract for the completion of Building 101. As of  February 2006, DOD estimated that the construction of the entire CWDF  was about 40 percent complete, compared with the more than 52 percent scheduled for completion at that time. As indicated in figure 5, the construction of certain key structures is behind schedule, including the  destruction building (Building 101), the control building (administration  building), the boiler house, and the water circulation building.", "Building 101 is on the \u201ccritical path\u201d, that is, delays in finishing the building  will prolong construction on other parts of the Shchuch\u2019ye facility.

Parsons had planned to award the subcontract for the balance of the building in June 2005, but it may not be awarded until summer 2006.  Since October 2005, Parsons has incurred costs for personnel salaries,  rent, and transportation of more than $3 million per month, which will  continue until the subcontract is awarded. Where possible, Parsons has  reduced or delayed recruitment of personnel planned for management of  Building 101. Construction activity is still ongoing at other buildings  throughout the site.", "The delay in awarding the contract for the remainder of Building 101 has  impacted the overall schedule for completing the facility\u2019s construction. As  part of its program management, DOD estimates dates for key project  milestones at Shchuch\u2019ye. These include a milestone schedule with  objective (ideal) completion dates, threshold (latest acceptable) dates, and estimated completion dates for key activities. As of May 2006, however, DOD does not expect to meet key milestone dates for the CWDF.  According to this schedule (as shown in fig. 6), construction of the facility will be delayed by about 1 year, testing using simulated nerve agent will  begin some 15 months later than planned, and live agent demonstration will be delayed by about 8 months. While DOD estimates that it will turn  over the Shchuch\u2019ye facility to the Russian government in December 2009, such an estimate appears optimistic given the construction and other  unknown delays that DOD may encounter in testing the facility with  simulated and live nerve agent. DOD officials stated that these milestones  may slip even further."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Shchuch\u2019ye CWDF Delayed Due to Difficulties Working with Russian Subcontractors", "paragraphs": ["The delays in constructing key buildings at the CWDF result from  problems Parsons and DOD have had with Russian subcontractors,  including the bankruptcy of one major subcontractor, problems in  soliciting adequate bids, and difficulty maintaining a competitive-bidding process.", "First, the 2005 bankruptcy of the Russian construction subcontractor  Magnitostroy delayed construction of key buildings. This company was  cited during the initial source selection process during 2000 to 2001 for its technical abilities, logistical capability, competitive pricing, and financial  responsibility and was the first construction subcontractor to work on the  Shchuch\u2019ye project. According to DOD and Parsons officials, Magnitostroy  enjoyed the strong support of the Russian government. However, it was  discovered in 2005 that a senior executive embezzled millions of dollars  from the company in 2003. As a result, the company was unable to afford sufficient labor to complete its work at the site, according to DOD and  Parsons officials. The most serious delay involved the construction of the  administration building\u2014the command building that will control the  destruction process. Although scheduled to be complete at the time of our visit in November 2005, construction of the administration building was  only about 36 percent complete. By January 2006, Parsons had assumed  direct responsibility for the construction of the building and had divided  most of the remaining work among Magnitostroy\u2019s subcontractors.  Similarly at that time, two other Magnitostroy buildings were behind  schedule, requiring Parsons to extend their completion dates. Given these delays, Parsons has not provided Magnitostroy with RFPs on any new  construction packages.", "Second, DOD and Parsons officials stated that Russian subcontractors had  not provided detailed cost and scheduling information in their bids.  Although Parsons cited incomplete bids as the cause of the delay, DOD  criticized Parsons for a \u201clack of urgency\u201d in resolving the Building 101 bid  issue. Parsons had particular difficulty soliciting adequate bids on the  construction package for the work remaining on Building 101. This  construction package will complete the building\u2019s physical structure and  install the equipment and processing systems needed to destroy the  chemical munitions. According to DOD and Parsons officials, it is the  largest, most complex construction package of the CWDF project. After  Magnitostroy\u2019s bankruptcy, two other contractors, Spetztroy and  Stroytransgaz, bid on the remaining Building 101 construction package. According to DOD officials, their bids arrived after the June 2005 deadline and did not include adequate cost and schedule data. Despite a deadline extension, neither subcontractor submitted a complete bid until the end of December 2005. At that time, only Spetzstroy submitted a responsive bid.  Its bid price, however, was $239 million over DOD\u2019s budget.", "Third, the small pool of approved Russian subcontractors has made it  difficult to maintain a competitive-bidding process. According to DOD, the  subcontractors for the CWDF are selected through a series of joint selection committees. The Russian government develops a list of approved companies that Parsons and a joint commission comprising DOD and  Russian government officials examine. In the initial round of  subcontractor selections in 2000 to 2001, Magnitostroy was the first CWDF  subcontractor chosen. A second round of selections in 2003 added four  more subcontractors: Promstroy, Spetztroy, Stroyprogress, and  Stroytransgaz. According to DOD officials, before Magnitostroy\u2019s 2005  bankruptcy, Magnitostroy, Stroytransgaz, and Spetztroy were the only  subcontractors that were capable of completing larger construction  efforts. The small number of Russian contractors discouraged effective competition and limited the number of construction packages that could  be awarded.", "In March 2005, DOD requested that the Russian Federation expand the  subcontractor pool to ensure completion of the Shchuch\u2019ye facility on  time and within budget. The Russian government added one small  specialty subcontractor, Vneshstrojimport, but did not restart the selection process to find a replacement for Magnitostroy. In December 2005, Stroytransgaz withdrew from competition, and the sole remaining  contractor, Spetztroy, submitted a bid for $310 million to complete  Building 101. However, DOD had budgeted only $71 million for the  construction package. To reconcile the cost difference, DOD paid for an  independent cost analysis that validated the original Parsons estimate of  $56 million. Parsons and DOD also sought the assistance of the Russian  government to negotiate with Spetzstroy to lower its bid. When negotiations failed to produce a compromise, Parsons canceled the RFP  for the balance of Building 101 on March 2, 2006.", "In March 2006, DOD resubmitted a request for more subcontractors and  provided the Russian government with a list of five potential companies, three of which were added to the pool. In April 2006, Parsons issued a new RFP for the remainder of Building 101. According to DOD officials, Parsons has and will continue to conduct weekly meetings with the  bidders and make personnel available for questions and clarifications regarding the RFP."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Cost and Schedule Subject to Uncertain Progress of Russian Construction, an Unpredictable Russian Operating Environment, and System Testing Issues", "paragraphs": ["The cost and schedule of the Shchuch\u2019ye facility are subject to continuous  risks.

According to DOD officials, the Russian government\u2019s method  of construction scheduling contains few itemized tasks, making it difficult to accurately gauge construction progress and uncover issues that could  cause delays. Although DOD and Parsons monitor Russian Federation  construction progress through monthly progress reports and project site  visits, the Russian government has not always followed jointly agreed upon schedules. DOD and Parsons officials remain concerned that  systemization timelines could be affected if both destruction buildings are not completed at the same time. Furthermore, Russian progress in  constructing utilities for the CWDF and the local community has produced  mixed results. For instance, we observed that the Russian government has  installed only one of three power lines needed to operate the CWDF. According to Parsons and DOD officials, although the Russian government  completed the new water line to the CWDF and the town of Shchuch\u2019ye in 2004, the more water the CWDF uses, the less the town has available. This  may lead to a competition for water when the facility begins consuming substantially more water when testing of the facility\u2019s systems begins, and during operation. Furthermore, when the Russian government constructed  a new gas line to the CWDF and through the town of Shchuch\u2019ye, it did not connect the line to local homes as promised. A local Shchuch\u2019ye official stated that most local residents cannot afford to pay for connection to the main gas line and expressed concerns that the Russian government will  not fulfill its obligations to the local population. To allay public concerns that may impact the CWDF, DOD uses public outreach offices to conduct opinion polls and educate the local populace on the CWDF."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Russia\u2019s Operating Environment Is Unpredictable", "paragraphs": ["DOD and Parsons must contend with an unpredictable Russian business  environment that can affect cost and schedule through unexpected changes in Russian legal, technical, and administrative requirements.New regulatory requirements have impacted the CWDF; in one case, stopping work on a building until it could be redesigned to comply with  new Russian electrical codes. In November 2005, a new Russian regulatory agency\u2014-the Federal Service for Ecological, Technological and Nuclear  Oversight (Rostekhnadzor)\u2014-performed a surprise audit at the Shchuch\u2019ye CWDF. The agency cited Parsons with noncompliance in several areas, including environmental and industrial safety reviews, permits, licenses, and certifications. While Parsons and DOD officials were  not aware of these requirements, they agreed to implement corrective  actions. As of March 2006, Parsons had resolved 82 percent of the  Rostekhnadzor audit findings and was working to mitigate the remainder. DOD continues to negotiate with Rostekhnadzor to meet the requirements of Russian law and is working with the Russian government to identify  feasible solutions. Additionally, Parsons has contracted with consultants that specialize in helping companies conform to Russian fire, ecological, and industrial safety regulations at the local and national levels.", "Furthermore, DOD and Parsons must review new technical requirements raised by Russian government officials. According to DOD officials, some  new requirement requests are justified as they relate to the operation of  the CWDF, while most others are attempts to transfer cost and risk from  Russia to the United States. For example, as a result of code and space deficiencies, DOD accepted the Russian requirement for an additional laboratory building on site, construction of which will increase the  project\u2019s cost by an additional $12 million. However, DOD officials have  resisted approving Russian requests that they believe are unnecessary or  that fall within Russian responsibilities at the site. DOD refused to allow  the Russian government to incorporate a new machine into the destruction process, which would have required significant redesign and testing of the process, and led to schedule delays and increased project  costs.", "Russian requirements for long-term visas and value added tax (VAT)  exemptions for equipment have affected cost and schedule. The Russian  government provides most DOD and Parsons personnel with only 6-month  visas, requiring workers to temporarily leave the country while their visas  are reissued. One DOD official estimated that transportation costs  associated with this practice totaled approximately $3 million as of  November 2005. However, DOD officials have noticed improvement in  how quickly the Russian Federation processes visas. In addition, when the Russian government reorganized in early 2004, the office in charge of  Russian customs was dissolved, leaving no agency able to approve the  VAT exemptions for more than 6 months. During that time, all equipment  shipped from the United States was halted, causing a 3-month slip in the  CWDF construction schedule. In late 2004, the Russian Federation eventually reestablished a new VAT office, and equipment delivery was  resumed. Since that time, DOD has encountered no VAT-related delays."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Testing Issues Could Delay Destruction Process", "paragraphs": ["Issues associated with the testing of the CWDF\u2019s utilities and automated destruction system (systemization) could further delay the schedule and  increase costs.

Such  testing could be delayed if either destruction building (101 or 101A) or  essential utilities are not completed on time. The automated destruction process is complex, involving the drilling, draining, and decontamination  of various sizes and types of munitions, and the neutralization of the nerve  agent they contain. Ensuring that this system works and interfaces properly with the rest of the facility will require the testing and calibrating  of roughly 1,000 different processes, according to a DOD official. DOD  officials noted that U.S. experiences with destroying chemical weapons  found that systemization often encounters difficulties and delays and has the potential to increase costs. Furthermore, DOD and Parsons must  compete the systemization contract between two Russian subcontractors, Redkino and Giprosintez, selected by the Russian government. Given  previous difficulties working with subcontractors, Parsons may  experience delays in obtaining adequate and reasonably priced bids.", "DOD is attempting to mitigate systemization risk by exploring options to test the CWDF\u2019s systems using Russian rather than U.S. methods.  Although the Shchuch\u2019ye facility is a Russian design, it is currently planned to undergo testing procedures similar to those DOD uses in the  United States. According to DOD officials, Russian systemization methods  are less involved than U.S. processes, which must adhere to stringent environmental and operating regulations and can take 16 to 18 months to  complete. The Russian government, however, systemized its CWDF at  Kambarka within 6 to 9 months. While DOD officials caution that each  CWDF is unique, given the types of munitions to be destroyed, they have begun exploring whether Russian methods may allow for streamlining and  compression of the systemization schedule at Shchuch\u2019ye, while still  maintaining acceptable safety levels.

Such mistakes underestimate the true cost of the CWDF project by  ignoring cost variances that have already occurred. Cost variances compare the earned value of the completed work with the actual cost of  the work performed. Until Parsons fixes its accounting system, manual  adjustments will have to be made monthly to ensure that costs are  properly aligned with the correct budget. Such continuous adjustments mean that the system is consistently reflecting an inaccurate status of the  project for Parsons and DOD managers. (For specific examples of our  findings regarding Parsons\u2019 EVM data, see app. II.)", "EVM guidance states that surveillance of an EVM system should occur  over the life of the contract to guarantee the validity of the performance data provided to the U.S. government. Initial surveillance activities involve  performing an IBR of a project within 6 months of awarding a contract and  as needed throughout the life of a project. DOD and Parsons have not yet conducted an IBR for the Shchuch\u2019ye project. Program managers are  expected to use EVM reports that have been validated by an IBR. Without  verifying the baseline, monthly EVM reporting, which tracks project work  against a set budget and schedule, is neither meaningful nor valid. Parsons and DOD officials explained that while an IBR has been discussed, one  will not be conducted until Parsons awards a contract for completing  Building 101. DOD officials estimate that the award process for this  contract may not be completed until summer 2006, approximately a year later than planned. According to Parsons, as of January 2006, about $66  million of scheduled work has not been completed as planned, due to the  delay in awarding the subcontract for the balance of Building 101. DOD  officials stated that while they recognize the importance of conducting  surveillance over an EVM system, they currently are focused on the  immediate need of establishing a usable EVM system on which to perform  surveillance.", "Furthermore, DOD requires all EVM systems to undergo a compliance audit or \u201cvalidation\u201d conducted by the Defense Contract Management  Agency (DCMA) with assistance from the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA). DCAA found that Parsons\u2019 accounting process was inadequate. A  DCAA official on the validation team stated that Parsons is relying on an  outdated accounting system that has difficulty capturing actual costs for  the Shchuch\u2019ye project and placing them into appropriate cost categories. The DCAA official stated that Parsons management should have  discovered such accounting errors before the EVM report was released to DOD. DCAA therefore questioned whether Parsons can generate correct  accounting data and recommended that Parsons update its accounting  system. As of April 2006, DCMA and DCAA had not yet validated Parsons\u2019  EVM system.

The October 2005 plan calls for using seven destruction  facilities to eliminate the entire chemical weapons stockpile. Destruction  of the chemical weapons stockpile at Gorniy was completed in December  2005. As of March 2006, only the facility at Kambarka is operational. The plan outlines the construction of the remaining five sites, including Shchuch\u2019ye, where nerve agent is to be eliminated.", "According to the Russian plan, the blister agents stored at Gorniy and  Kambarka were to be destroyed first. In December 2005, the Russian government completed its destruction efforts at Gorniy and began destroying chemical weapons at Kambarka. In accordance with the plan, destruction will next be focused on nerve agents. The storage sites near  Leonidovka, Maradykovskiy, and Pochep house large nerve-agent  munitions, while those near Shchuch\u2019ye and Kizner store smaller  munitions.

Furthermore, the Russian government\u2019s priority is  to destroy nerve agents contained in large munitions, because destroying the larger-sized munitions first would allow Russia to meet its CWC  destruction deadlines faster. Accordingly, the destruction of smaller  munitions at Shchuch\u2019ye may become less of a priority for the Russian government.", "However, the Russian government\u2019s destruction plan to eliminate all  chemical weapons by 2012 may be unrealistic. It depends on the construction of seven facilities, but only two have been built, two are  under construction, and three have not been started. Although the CWDF  at Maradykovskiy may be operational in mid-2006, the Shchuch\u2019ye facility is still under construction, and only minimal work has begun at the three  remaining sites of Kizner, Leonidovka, and Pochep. According to its CWC  destruction schedule, Russia must eliminate 20 percent of its chemical  weapons stockpile by April 2007. As of March 2006, it had eliminated about 3 percent at Gorniy and Kambarka. Between April 2007 and April  2012, Russia must eliminate the remainder of its chemical weapons  stockpile (about 80 percent) at five destruction facilities that have yet to  be completed. It will be extremely difficult for the Russian government to  complete and operate the last three facilities by its proposed schedule and meet its CWC commitment to destroy all stockpiles at these sites by the  extended deadline of April 2012.", "Similarly, as of April 2006, DOD announced that the United States will not  be able to meet the CWC extended destruction deadline of 2012. DOD  estimates indicate that about 66 percent of the U.S. declared chemical weapons stockpile will be destroyed by April 2012.
