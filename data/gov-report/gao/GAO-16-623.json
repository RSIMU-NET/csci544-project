For example, the projects fully met the best practice of establishing a process for taking corrective actions if issues are identified, but they did not fully meet the practice of identifying significant performance deviations. Until project officials implement missing practices, they will be limited in their abilities to monitor and control costs, schedules, and performance.", "The 2020 Census program is heavily dependent upon CEDCAP to deliver the key systems needed to support the 2020 Census redesign. However, while the two programs have taken steps to coordinate their schedules, risks, and requirements, they lacked effective processes for managing their interdependencies. Specifically:", "Among tens of thousands of schedule activities, the two programs are expected to manually identify activities that are dependent on each other, and rather than establishing one integrated dependency schedule, the programs maintain two separate dependency schedules. This has contributed to misalignment in milestones between the programs.", "The programs do not have an integrated list of interdependent program risks, and thus they do not always recognize the same risks that impact both programs.", "Among other things, key requirements have not been defined for validating responses from individuals who respond to the census using an address instead of a Bureau-assigned identification number, because of the Bureau's limited knowledge and experience in this area. The lack of knowledge and specific requirements related to this critical function is concerning, given that there is about a year remaining before the Census end-to-end test begins in August 2017 (which is intended to test all key systems and operations to ensure readiness for the 2020 Census).", "Officials have acknowledged these weaknesses and reported that they are taking, or plan to take, steps to address the issues. However, until these interdependencies are managed more effectively, the Bureau will be limited in understanding the work needed by both programs to meet milestones, mitigate major risks, and ensure that requirements are appropriately identified.", "While the large-scale technological changes for the 2020 Decennial Census introduce great potential for efficiency and effectiveness gains, they also introduce many information security challenges. For example, the introduction of an option for households to respond using the Internet puts respondents at greater risk for phishing attacks (requests for information from authentic-looking, but fake, e-mails and websites). In addition, because the Bureau plans to allow its enumerators to use mobile devices to collect information from households that did not self-respond to the survey, it is important that the Bureau ensures that these devices are adequately protected. The Bureau has begun efforts to address many of these challenges; as it begins implementing the 2020 Census design, continued focus on these considerable security challenges will be critical."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making eight recommendations to the Department of Commerce in the areas of project monitoring and control and in managing interdependencies related to schedule, risk, and requirements.

These design decisions are expected to significantly  transform how the Bureau conducts the Decennial Census, in an effort to  save approximately $5.2 billion. The redesign largely depends on  implementing new technology and systems to modernize and automate  many parts of the census. Accordingly, concurrent with the overhaul of  the 2020 Census, the Bureau is significantly redesigning the information  technology (IT) systems that support each of its surveys, including the  2020 Decennial Census, American Community Survey (ACS), and  Economic Census.", "Specifically, for the 2020 Decennial Census, the Bureau plans to  significantly change the methods and technology it uses to count the  population, such as offering an option for households to respond to the  survey via the Internet, providing mobile devices for field enumerators to  collect survey data from households, and automating the management of  field operations. The Bureau\u2019s redesign of the census relies on the  acquisition and development of many new and modified IT systems.  Several of these systems are expected to be provided by an enterprise- wide initiative called Census Enterprise Data Collection and Processing  (CEDCAP). This initiative is a large and complex modernization program  intended to deliver a system-of-systems for all the Bureau\u2019s survey data  collection and processing functions, rather than continuing to rely on  unique, survey-specific systems with redundant capabilities.", "Given CEDCAP\u2019s importance to achieving the 2020 Decennial Census  redesign, you asked us to review the Bureau\u2019s efforts to implement it.

(See fig. 1 below.)", "Examples of decisions that have been made include the following:  Internet response\u2014For the first time on a nationwide scale, the  Bureau will allow individuals/households to respond to the census on  the Internet from a computer, mobile device, or other devices that  access the Internet.", "Non-ID processing with real-time address matching\u2014The Bureau  will provide each household with a unique ID by mail. However, users  may also respond to the online survey without the unique ID by  entering their address. This operation includes conducting real-time  matching of respondent-provided addresses.", "Non-response follow-up\u2014If a household does not respond to the  census by a certain date, the Bureau will send out employees to visit  the home. These enumerators will use a census application, on a  mobile device provided by the Bureau, to capture the information  given to them by the in-person interviews. The Bureau will also  manage the case workload of these enumerators using an operational  control system that automatically assigns, updates, and monitors  cases during non-response follow-up.", "Administrative records\u2014As we reported in October 2015, the  Bureau is working on obtaining and using administrative records from  other government agencies, state and local governments, and third- party organizations to reduce the workload of enumerators in their  non-response follow-up work. For example, the Bureau plans to use  administrative records to identify vacant housing units to remove from  enumerators\u2019 workloads, count households that did not return census  questionnaires, predict best times to complete non-response follow- up, and help process responses it receives either on paper or over the  Internet that do not have a census ID number on them (non-ID  processing).", "Mobile devices\u2014The Bureau plans to award a contract that would  provide commercially available mobile phones and the accompanying  service contract on behalf of the Census Bureau to enumerators, who  will use these devices to collect census data.

However, as we  testified in March 2008, the program was experiencing significant  problems, including schedule delays and cost increases from changes in  requirements. Due in part to these technology issues the Bureau was  facing, we designated the 2010 Census a high-risk area in March 2008.", "In April 2008, the Bureau decided not to use the handheld devices for  nonresponse follow-up. Dropping the use of handheld devices for  nonresponse follow-up and replacing them with a paper-based system  increased the cost of the census by up to $3 billion. Although the Bureau  worked aggressively to improve the paper-based system that replaced  the handheld computers, we reported in December 2010 that the paper- based system also experienced significant issues when it was put in  operation.", "Since the 2010 Census, we have issued additional reports and  testimonies on weaknesses in the Bureau\u2019s efforts to institutionalize IT  and program management controls for the 2020 Census. Relevant  reports include the following:  In September 2012, we reported that the Bureau had taken steps to  draft new processes to improve its ability to manage IT investments  and system development, and to improve its IT workforce planning.  However, we found that additional work was needed to ensure that  these processes were effective and successfully implemented across  the Bureau, such as finalizing plans for implementing its new  investment management and systems development processes across  the Bureau, conducting an IT skills assessment and gap analysis, and  establishing a process for directorates to coordinate on IT workforce  planning. The Bureau has fully addressed our recommendations to  address these weaknesses by, for example, finalizing its investment  management process, conducting an enterprise-wide IT competency  assessment and gap analysis, and developing action plans to address  the identified gaps.", "As we reported in November 2013, the Bureau was not producing  reliable schedules for two efforts related to the 2020 Census: (1)  building a master address file and (2) 2020 Census research and  testing. For example, the Bureau did not include all activities and  required resources in its schedules, or logically link a number of the  activities in a sequence. We recommended that the Bureau take  actions to improve the reliability of its schedules, including ensuring  that all relevant activities are included in the schedules, complete  scheduling logic is in place, and a quantitative risk assessment is  conducted. We also recommended that the Bureau undertake a  robust workforce planning effort to identify and address gaps in  scheduling skills for staff that work on schedules. The Bureau has  taken steps to implement these recommendations, but has not fully  implemented them.", "In April 2014 and February 2015 we reported on the Bureau\u2019s lack of  prioritization of IT decisions related to the 2020 Census.

Accordingly, we recommended that the Bureau prioritize its IT-related  research and testing projects. The Bureau had taken steps to address  this recommendation, such as releasing a plan in September 2014  that identified research questions intended to inform the 2020 Census  operational design decisions. In February 2015, however, we reported  that the Bureau had not determined how key IT research questions  that were identified in the September 2014 plan would be answered\u2014 such as the expected rate of respondents using its Internet response  option or the IT infrastructure that would be needed to support this  option. We recommended that the Bureau, among other things,  develop methodologies and plans for answering key IT-related  research questions in time to inform design decisions. The Bureau  has taken steps to implement the recommendations, such as  releasing a preliminary 2020 Census Operational Plan that documents  many key IT-related decisions; however, many other IT-related  questions, including the ones that were identified in our report, are to  remain unanswered until 2016 through 2018.", "As a result of the Bureau\u2019s challenges in key IT internal controls and  its looming deadline, we identified CEDCAP as an IT investment in  need of attention in our February 2015 High-Risk report.", "Further, we testified in November 2015, that key IT decisions needed  to be made soon because the Bureau was less than 2 years away  from end-to-end testing of all systems and operations to ensure  readiness for the 2020 Census and there was limited time to  implement it. We emphasized that that Bureau had deferred key IT- related decisions, and that it was running out of time to develop,  acquire, and implement the systems it will need to deliver the redesign  and achieve its projected $5.2 billion in cost savings. In addition, we  stated that while the Bureau had made improvements in some key IT  management areas, it still faced challenges in the areas of workforce  planning and information security because it had yet to fill key  positions\u2014most concerning was the lack of a permanent chief  information officer.", "We have also reported extensively on the increasing security risks facing  federal agencies\u2019 systems and data. These risks were recently  illustrated by the data breaches at the Office of Personnel Management,  which affected millions of current and former federal employees.

However, the  projects\u2019 planning documents lacked sufficient detail against which to  monitor progress because their plans did not include details about the  full scope of their projects for their entire life cycles. For example,  while project officials have provided key information, such as when  build-or-buy decisions were to be made, when the production systems  are to be initially released, and when the final systems are to be  released to support the 2020 Census, project planning documents for  the three projects do not consistently include this information.

For example, the Internet  and Mobile data collection project had a cost variance of 20 percent in  September 2015 and the Survey (and Listing) Interview Operational  Control project had a cost variance of 25 percent in September 2015,  which were flagged by the projects as exceeding the significant  deviation threshold.", "However, the projects do not have up-to-date cost estimates with  which to accurately identify significant deviations in cost performance.  Specifically, the projects are measuring whether there are significant  deviations in costs against their budgeted amounts, which are based  on a 2013 CEDCAP program office estimate.

For example, program requirements were  finalized in May 2015.", "Program officials recognized that the program office estimate needs to  be updated and stated that they planned to update their estimate once  the program and its projects are better understood and more complete  information is available, including the recently completed build-versus- buy decisions. However, until the program cost estimate is updated,  the program lacks a basis for monitoring true cost variances for these  three projects.", "Taking corrective actions to address issues when necessary\u2014 Each of the three selected projects met this practice. Specifically, the  CEDCAP program has established a process for taking corrective  actions to address issues when needed and, as of April 2016, Bureau  officials stated they have not needed to take any corrective actions to  address CEDCAP program issues. For example, while we found  several significant deviations in cost and schedule for the three  projects in the monthly progress reports, these did not require  corrective actions because they were due to, for example, delays in  contract payments, contract awards, and other obligations for  hardware and software outside the control of the CEDCAP program  office.", "Monitoring the status of risks periodically\u2014One project (the  Centralized Operational Analysis and Control project) fully met this  practice and the other two projects partially met this practice.  Specifically, the three projects monitor the status of their risks in bi- weekly project status meetings and monthly risk review board  meetings, have established risk registers, and regularly update the  status of risks in their registers. However, while according to Bureau  officials the projects are to document updates on the status of their  risks in their respective risk registers, the Internet and Mobile Data  Collection and Survey (and Listing) Interview Operational Control  projects do not consistently document status updates. For example as  of April 2016, all four of the Internet and Mobile Data Collection  project\u2019s medium-probability, medium-impact risks had not been  updated in its risk register in 9 months. Also as of April 2016, two of  five of the Survey (and Listing) Interview Operational Control project\u2019s  medium-probability, medium-impact risks had not been updated in the  risk register in 4 months.", "Bureau officials recognized the need to document updates in the risk  registers more consistently and stated that efforts were under way to  address this. In May 2016, Bureau officials provided updates on the  Internet and Mobile Data Collection project risk list that showed  improvement in documenting the status of risks for that project for 1  month. In June 2016, Bureau officials stated that they had taken  additional steps to improve how risk registers are updated by, for  example, conducting training sessions for project managers on the  CEDCAP program\u2019s expectations for monitoring and updating the  status of risks, and reviewing project risk registers monthly to ensure  compliance. Bureau officials also stated that they planned to release  an updated version of the CEDCAP Risk Management Plan that more  clearly outlines the process and expectations for monitoring and  updating project risk registers by the end of August 2016. While the  officials have taken positive steps, until actions are fully implemented  to ensure that the projects are consistently documenting updates to  the status of risks in a repeatable and ongoing manner, they will not  have comprehensive information on how risks are being managed.", "Implementing risk mitigation plans\u2014Each of the three selected  projects partially met this practice. As of October 2015, the three  projects had developed basic risk mitigation steps for each of the risks  associated with the projects that required a mitigation plan. However,  contrary to industry best practices and the Bureau\u2019s risk management  guidance, these risk mitigation plans lacked important details.  Specifically, none of the mitigation plans for the three projects  contained start or completion dates. Additionally, the Centralized  Operational Analysis and Control and the Internet and Mobile Data  Collection projects did not have any trigger events for their risks that  require risk triggers (e.g., those risks that exceed a predefined  exposure threshold). For example, the Centralized Operational  Analysis and Control project had an active issue in March 2016 that if  late requirements were given to the project, it would face delays in  delivering for the 2016 Census test. This risk did not contain a  detailed risk mitigation plan or a trigger date or description.", "In February 2016, Bureau officials recognized that there were issues  with their risk management process and stated that they were working  on addressing them. In April 2016, Bureau officials stated that they  had revised their risk management process to increase the threshold  for requiring risk mitigation plans and trigger events. However, the  April 2016 risk registers did not contain any risks that exceeded the  new risk threshold and, therefore, none of the risks required risk  mitigation plans and trigger events. As a result, it is unclear to what  extent the Bureau has improved its practices in developing detailed  risk mitigation plans and assigning trigger events when required.

Moreover, constantly updating a schedule manually defeats the  purpose of a dynamic schedule and can make the schedule particularly  prone to error. According to best practices, if manual schedule  reconciliation cannot be avoided, the parties should define a process to  preserve integrity between the different schedule formats and to verify  and validate the converted data whenever the schedules are updated.", "About half of CEDCAP\u2019s major product releases (7 of 13) are intended to  align with and support the major tests and operations of the 2020 Census.

Consequently, the two programs have been manually  identifying activities within their master schedules that are dependent on  each other, and rather than establishing one dependency schedule, as  best practices dictate, the programs have each developed their own  dependency schedule and meet weekly with the intent of coordinating  these two schedules. In addition, the programs\u2019 dependency schedules  only include near-term schedule dependencies, and not future milestones  through 2020 Census production. For example, as of February 2016, the  dependency schedules only included tasks associated with the CEDCAP  product release in support of the 2020 Census program\u2019s 2016 Census  Test through July 2016.

For example, development of CEDCAP release 7,  which was intended to support the 2017 Census Test, was not  scheduled to begin until almost a month after the 2017 Census Test  was expected to begin (December 2016), and was not planned to be  completed until about 2 months after the 2017 Census Test was  expected to end (July 2017).

This is especially problematic as the  2020 Census program recently experienced a notable setback  regarding cloud implementation. Specifically, the 2020 Census  program was originally planning to use a commercial cloud  environment in the 2016 Census Test, which would have been the  first time the Bureau used a cloud service in a major census test to  collect census data from residents in parts of the country. However,  leading up to the 2016 Census Test, the program experienced stability  issues with the cloud environment.

Common vulnerabilities include a failure to enable password  protection and operating systems that are not kept up to date with the  latest security patches. In addition, because of their small size and  use outside an office setting, mobile devices are easier to misplace or  steal, leaving their sensitive information at risk of unauthorized use or  theft.", "In 2012 we reported on key security controls and practices to reduce  vulnerabilities in mobile devices, protect proprietary and other  confidential business data that could be stolen from mobile devices,  and ensure that mobile devices connected to the organization\u2019s  network do not threaten the security of the network itself. For  example, we reported that organizations can require that devices  meet government specifications before they are deployed, limit  storage on mobile devices, and ensure that all data on the device are  cleared before the device is disposed of. Doing so can help protect  against inappropriate disclosure of sensitive information that is  collected on the mobile devices. Accordingly, we recommended,  among other things, that the Department of Homeland Security, in  collaboration with the Department of Commerce, establish measures  about consumer awareness of mobile security.

Potential information security  benefits include the use of automation to expedite the implementation  of secure configurations on devices, reduced need to carry data on  removable media because of broad network access, and low-cost  disaster recovery and data storage. However, the use of cloud  computing can also create numerous information security risks for  federal agencies, including that cloud service vendors may not be  familiar with security requirements that are unique to government  agencies, such as continuous monitoring and maintaining an  inventory of systems. Thus, we reported that, to reduce the risks, it is  important for federal agencies to examine the specific security  controls of the provider the agency is evaluating when considering the  use of cloud computing.", "In addition, in April 2016, we reported that agencies should develop  service-level agreements with cloud providers that specify, among  other things, the security performance requirements\u2014including data  reliability, preservation, privacy, and access rights\u2014that the service  provider is to meet. Without these safeguards, computer systems  and networks, as well as the critical operations and key infrastructures  they support, may be lost; information\u2014including sensitive personal  information\u2014may be compromised; and the agency\u2019s operations  could be disrupted.", "Adequately considering information security when making  decisions about the IT solutions and infrastructure supporting  the 2020 Census\u2014Design decisions related to the 2020 Census will  have security implications that need to be considered when making  decisions about future 2020 Census design features.

The Chief Information Security Officer echoed these  concerns, stating that any schedule slippage can affect the time  needed to conduct a comprehensive security assessment. As key  design decisions are deferred and the time to make such decisions  becomes more compressed, it is important for the Bureau to ensure  that information security is adequately considered and assessed when  making design decisions about the IT solutions and infrastructure to  be used for the 2020 Census.", "Making certain key IT positions are filled and have appropriate  information security knowledge and expertise\u2014As our prior work  and leading guidance recognize, having the right knowledge and skills  is critical to the success of a program, and mission-critical skills gaps  in such occupations as cybersecurity pose a high-risk to the nation.  Whether within specific federal agencies or across the federal  workforce, these skills gaps impede federal agencies in cost- effectively serving the public and achieving results. Because of this,  we added strategic human capital management, including  cybersecurity human capital, to our High Risk List in 2001, and it  remains on that list today. These skills gaps are also a key  contributing factor to our high-risk area of ensuring the security of  federal information systems.

However, it has faced longstanding vacancies in key IT  positions, such as the Chief Information Officer (vacant from July  2015 to June 2016) and the CEDCAP Chief Security Engineer (vacant  since October 2015). Ensuring that key positions are filled with staff  who have the appropriate expertise will be important to ensure that  security controls are adequately designed in the systems used to  collect and store census data.", "Ensuring that contingency and incident response plans are in  place that encompass all of the IT systems to be used to support  the 2020 Census\u2014Because of the brief time frame for collecting data  during the Decennial Census, it is especially important that systems  are available for respondents to ensure a high response rate.  Contingency planning and incident response help ensure that if  normal operations are interrupted, network managers are able to  detect, mitigate, and recover from a service disruption while  preserving access to vital information. Implementing important  security controls including policies, procedures, and techniques for  contingency planning and incident response helps to ensure the  confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information and systems,  even during disruptions of service.", "However, we have reported on weaknesses across the federal  government in these areas. Specifically, in April 2014 we estimated  that federal agencies (including the Department of Commerce) had  not completely documented actions taken in response to detected  incidents reported in fiscal year 2012 in about 65 percent of cases.  We made a number of recommendations to improve agencies\u2019 cyber  incident response practices, such as developing incident response  plans and procedures and testing them.", "Adequately training Bureau employees, including its massive  temporary workforce, in information security awareness\u2014The  Census Bureau plans to hire an enormous temporary workforce  during the 2020 Census activities, including about 300,000 temporary  employees to, among other things, use contractor-furnished mobile  devices to collect personal information from households that have not  yet responded to the Census. Because uninformed people can be one  of the weakest links when securing systems and networks,  information security awareness training is intended to inform agency  personnel of the information security risks associated with their  activities and their responsibilities in complying with agency policies  and procedures designed to reduce these risks. However, ensuring  that every one of the approximately 300,000 temporary enumerators  is sufficiently trained in information security will be challenging.  Providing training to agency personnel, such as this new and  temporary staff, will be critical to securing information and systems.", "Making certain security assessments are completed in a timely  manner and that risks are at an acceptable level\u2014According to  guidance from NIST, after testing an information system, authorizing  officials determine whether the risks (e.g., unaddressed  vulnerabilities) are acceptable and issue an authorization to operate.  Each of the systems that the 2020 Census IT architecture plans to  rely on will need to undergo a security assessment and obtain  authorization to operate before it can be used for the 2020 Census.", "Properly configuring and patching systems supporting the 2020  Census\u2014Configuration management controls ensure that only  authorized and fully tested software is placed in operation, software  and hardware are updated, information systems are monitored,  patches are applied to these systems to protect against known  vulnerabilities, and emergency changes are documented and  approved. We reported in September 2015 that for fiscal year 2014,  22 of the 24 agencies in our review (including the Department of  Commerce) had weaknesses in configuration management controls.  Moreover, in April 2015, US-CERT issued an alert stating that cyber  threat adversaries continue to exploit common, but unpatched,  software products from vendors such as Adobe, Microsoft, and  Oracle. Without strong configuration and patch management, an  attacker may exploit a vulnerability not yet mitigated, enabling  unauthorized access to information systems or enabling users to have  access to greater privileges than authorized.", "The Bureau\u2019s acting Chief Information Officer and its Chief Information  Security Officer have acknowledged these challenges and described the  Bureau\u2019s plans to address them. For example, the Bureau has developed  a risk management framework, which is intended to ensure that proper  security controls are in place and provide authorizing officials with details  on residual risk and progress to address those risks. In addition, the  Bureau has also embedded three security engineers in the 2020 Census  program to provide assistance and guidance to project teams. Bureau  officials also stated that they are in the process of filling\u2014or plan to fill\u2014 vacancies in key positions and intend to hire staff with expertise in key  areas, such as cloud computing. To minimize the risk of phishing, Bureau  officials note that they plan to contract with a company to monitor the  Internet for fraudulent sites pretending to be the Census Bureau.  Continued focus on these considerable challenges will be important as  the Bureau begins to develop and/or acquire systems and implement the  2020 design.", "We have previously reported on Census Bureau weaknesses that are  related to many of these information security challenges. Specifically, we  reported in January 2013 that the Bureau had a number of weaknesses in  its information security controls due, in part, to the fact that it had not fully  implemented a comprehensive information security program. Thus, we  made 13 public recommendations in areas such as security awareness  training, incident response, and security assessments. We also made 102  recommendations to address technical weaknesses we identified related  to access controls, configuration management, and contingency  planning.", "As of June 2016, the Bureau had made significant progress in addressing  these recommendations. Specifically, it had implemented all 13 public  recommendations and 92 of 102 technical recommendations. For  example, the Bureau developed and implemented a risk management  framework with a goal of better management visibility of information  security risks; this framework addressed a recommendation to document  acceptance of risks for management review.", "We have work under way to evaluate whether the 10 remaining  recommendations have been fully addressed. These recommendations  pertain to access controls and configuration management, and are related  to two of the security challenges we previously mentioned\u2014ensuring  individuals gain only limited and appropriate access, and properly  configuring and patching systems. The Bureau\u2019s progress toward  addressing our recommendations is encouraging; however, completing  this effort is necessary to ensure that sensitive information is adequately  protected and that the challenges we outline in this report are overcome."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The CEDCAP program\u2019s 12 projects have the potential to offer numerous  benefits to the Bureau\u2019s survey programs, including the 2020 Census  program, such as enabling an Internet response option; automating the  assignment, controlling, and tracking of enumerator caseloads; and  enabling a mobile data collection tool for field work. While the Bureau has  taken steps to implement these projects, considerable work remains  between now and when its production systems need to be in place to  support the 2020 Census end-to-end system integration test\u2014in about a  year.", "Although the three selected CEDCAP projects had key project monitoring  and controlling practices in place or planned, such as producing monthly  progress reports, gaps exist in other important ways to monitor and  control projects, such as the lack of detailed project plans, documentation  of risk status updates, and complete risk mitigation plans. While officials  plan to update the project plans with more detail, until the program and  the selected projects address these other gaps, they are at risk of not  adequately monitoring these projects.", "Given the numerous and critical dependencies between the CEDCAP and  2020 Census programs, their parallel implementation tracks, and the  2020 Census\u2019 immovable deadline, it is imperative that the  interdependencies between these programs are effectively managed.  However, this has not always been the case. While actions such as  weekly meetings to discuss the programs\u2019 respective schedules  demonstrate that the programs are trying to coordinate, additional actions  would help better align the programs. Specifically, until the two programs  establish schedules that are completely aligned, develop an integrated list  of all interdependent risks, and finalize processes for managing  requirements, both programs are at risk of not delivering their programs  as expected.", "Finally, while the large-scale technological changes for the 2020  Decennial Census introduce great potential for efficiency and  effectiveness gains, it also introduces many information security  challenges, including educating the public to offset inevitable phishing  scams. Continued focus on these considerable security challenges and  remaining open recommendations will be important as the Bureau begins  to develop and/or acquire systems and implement the 2020 Census  design."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To ensure that the Bureau is better positioned to deliver CEDCAP, we are  recommending that the Secretary of Commerce direct the Director of the  Census Bureau to take the following eight actions:", "Update the CEDCAP program office cost estimate to reflect the  current status of the program as soon as appropriate information  becomes available.", "Ensure that updates to the status of risks are consistently  documented for CEDCAP\u2019s Internet and Mobile Data Collection and  Survey (and Listing) Interview Operational Control projects.", "Ensure that CEDCAP\u2019s Internet and Mobile Data Collection, Survey  (and Listing) Interview Operational Control, and Centralized  Operational Analysis and Control projects establish detailed risk  mitigation plans on a consistent basis and that the Internet and Mobile  Data Collection and Centralized Operational Analysis and Control  projects establish trigger events for all relevant risks.", "Define, document, and implement a repeatable process to establish  complete alignment between CEDCAP and 2020 Census programs  by, for example, maintaining a single dependency schedule.", "Establish a comprehensive and integrated list of all interdependent  risks facing the CEDCAP and 2020 Census programs, and clearly  identify roles and responsibilities for managing this list.", "Finalize documentation of processes for managing requirements for  CEDCAP.", "Identify when the 74 requirements related to redistricting data  program and data products and dissemination will be tested.", "Make developing a better understanding of and identifying  requirements related to non-ID response validation a high and  immediate priority, or consider alternatives to avoid late definition of  such requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We received written comments on a draft of this report from the  Department of Commerce, which are reprinted in appendix II. In its  comments, the department agreed with all eight of our recommendations  and indicated that it will be taking actions in response to our  recommendations. The department also stated that for several of the  recommendations it believed that some additional context should be  included in our report, which we discuss below.", "First, the department reported that the Census Bureau decided on May  25, 2016, to use a commercial off-the-shelf solution in combination with  in-house solutions for the data collection component of the 2020 Census,  which is to be delivered by the CEDCAP program. We updated relevant  statements in our report to reflect this recent decision.", "In response to our first recommendation to update the CEDCAP program  office cost estimate to reflect the current status of the program as soon as  appropriate information becomes available, the department agreed and  noted that with the recent May 2016 decision, the Bureau has begun work  on new program life cycle cost estimates. This is a positive step forward,  and it will be important that the Bureau prepares a reliable estimate in a  timely manner in order to have a basis for monitoring true cost variances  for the three selected CEDCAP projects we reviewed.", "The department agreed with our fourth recommendation to define,  document, and implement a repeatable process to establish complete  alignment between CEDCAP and the 2020 Census program by, for  example, maintaining a single dependency schedule. Specifically, the  department stated that the Bureau must maintain schedule alignment  between the 2020 Census and CEDCAP programs through a single  integrated schedule. The department further stated that the 2020 Census  is the program of interest and, as such, it must and will drive the schedule  for all solutions that support it, including CEDCAP solutions. The  department also stated that the 2020 Census manages its master  schedule through the Primavera software package, as recommended  earlier in the decade by GAO.", "However, GAO does not make recommendations on the use of specific  software packages, and thus did not make such a recommendation to the  Bureau. The Bureau\u2019s selection of a software tool should have been  based on an assessment of the costs, benefits, and risks associated with  alternative solutions. Regardless of the software packages used, the  2020 Census schedule is dependent on the delivery of CEDCAP  solutions and, as we state in the report, the process for integrating the  schedule dependencies between these two programs is ineffective. Thus,  we maintain that until the Bureau modifies its current process to ensure  complete alignment between the 2020 Census and CEDCAP programs  by, for example, maintaining a single dependency schedule, it will be  limited in its ability to ensure that both programs are planning and  measuring their activities according to the same agreed-upon time  frames.", "In response to our fifth recommendation to establish a comprehensive  and integrated list of all interdependent risks facing the CEDCAP and  2020 Census programs, the department agreed and stated that the 2020  Census program should better monitor interdependent risks through an  integrated risk register. The department further stated that it uses an  enterprise risk management tool to enable access to an integrated list of  all active risks, including interdependent risks. It also stated that linkages  between the two programs\u2019 risk registers can be flagged and tracked  using these processes and then used to ensure the same process for  responding to emerging risks are followed. However, although the  Bureau\u2019s comments discuss capabilities of its enterprise risk  management tool that could help address our recommendation, during  our review the two programs\u2019 interdependent risks were not being linked  or tracked in an integrated manner, and we have not received additional  evidence to demonstrate that further actions had been taken by the  Bureau to address this.", "The department agreed with our seventh recommendation to identify  when the 74 requirements related to redistricting data program and data  products and dissemination will be tested. In its letter, the department  stated that the Bureau had been conducting research on the highest- priority areas and activities relative to core operational and cost-efficiency  requirements due to budget limitations this decade, but that planning and  requirements development for these two areas are now under way. The  Bureau intends to ensure that any testing needs are prioritized for  inclusion in the 2018 end-to-end census test. Full implementation of our  recommendation should help ensure that the requirements are sufficiently  tested prior to the 2020 Census.", "In response to our eighth recommendation to make identifying  requirements related to non-ID response validation a high and immediate  priority, or consider alternatives to avoid late definition of such  requirements, the department agreed that non-ID response requirements  should continue to receive attention and priority. The department also  noted that non-ID response validation operations have been conducted  for several censuses, using a paper process, and that they validated  these responses prior to tabulating the data to ensure that the response  was legitimate and not duplicative.", "However, while the Bureau has prior experience conducting non-ID  response validation operations in a controlled, small-scale paper-based  environment, 2020 will be the first decennial census that the Bureau  introduces an Internet response option on a wide scale, as well as the  first time the Bureau attempts non-ID response collection via the Internet.  According to Bureau officials, the use of the Internet to collect non-ID  responses introduces the potential for a much higher volume of  responses that will need to be validated than if the Bureau were to use a  paper-based non-ID approach. The Bureau has also reported that  Internet-based non-ID response collection increases the likelihood of  fraudulent responses. Given that the Bureau is in the early stages of  conducting research and developing requirements in this area and there  is only a year remaining before the 2018 Census end-to-end test begins,  we maintain that the lack of experience and specific requirements related  to non-ID response validation is highly concerning, and our  recommendation to make this a high and immediate priority or consider  alternative approaches needs to be implemented.", "The department also stated that the Bureau has a long history of and  demonstrated commitment to ensuring the confidentiality of the  information provided by the public. It stated that implementing strong  protections for all of its solutions and conforming to leading cybersecurity  and fraud prevention best practices will be paramount for the self- response and field data collection operations.

For assessing schedule dependencies  between the CEDCAP and 2020 Census programs, we reviewed both  programs\u2019 master schedules and other program planning documents that  contained major milestones and compared the dates against each other.  We identified any potential misalignment in major milestones between the  two programs and discussed these with CEDCAP and 2020 Census  program officials.
