These are characterized by the use of random  selection and control groups. All individuals have an equal chance of being  assigned to either the intervention group or the control group. The  intervention group contains individuals who will receive the intervention,  or program\u2019s services, while the control group does not receive the  intervention or services. This research design produces findings that allow  conclusions about the effectiveness, or impact, of the intervention to be  made. However, conducting experimental designs may be problematic  because of the need to treat intervention and control groups differently.  For example, to determine the impact of a training program on workers\u2019  wages, a program would need to randomly provide services to some and  randomly deny services to others, and track subsequent earnings for both  groups of people. This approach requires services to be denied to some  workers who qualify for training. Due to these difficulties, as well as the  amount of time and money it takes to conduct experimental designs, quasi- experimental research designs are often preferable for their practicality.", "Quasi-experimental designs. These designs are characterized by  comparison groups that are not randomly selected.

For example, Louisiana used $1.3 million to create an  emergency medical services training program at a local community college  after one of the state\u2019s largest providers of paramedics and emergency  medical care staff reported needing to hire most of its staff from out of  state due to a lack of qualified workers. Similarly, to increase the supply of  elder care providers, California funded training to certified nurses\u2019  assistants so that they could become vocational nurses.", "In addition, other states noted that their employment placement and  training programs address service and eligibility gaps in federally funded  workforce programs. For example, Rhode Island officials said that  because federal funds could not be used to provide training to employed  workers prior to the passage of WIA, their employer tax-funded program  provided employers with training funds specifically to improve employed  worker skills. New Jersey and Washington officials also noted that their  states used employer tax funds to provide employment placement and  training services that are not offered through federally funded workforce  programs. Other states, such as Louisiana, used employer taxes to fund  training services for individuals who do not meet the income eligibility  requirements used in WIA programs.", "Most states focused on certain industries, particularly manufacturing,  because of their overall benefit to the state\u2019s economy. California\u2019s worker  training program specifically targets manufacturing industries because  these industries tend to offer high-paying, stable employment. Other  industries that were also frequently targeted for training include:  information; health care or social assistance; professional, scientific, or  technical; and construction. Our earlier study examining how states and  local areas are training employed workers found similar results:  manufacturing along with health care and social assistance are two of the  most commonly targeted economic sectors for training workers. Our  survey of employer tax-funded state programs also showed that industries  that were least often targeted included wholesale and retail trade, finance  and insurance, and accommodation and food service (see fig. 5).", "States also targeted their services to certain employers as part of their  workforce and economic development strategies. Over 11,000 employers  were provided training services, and most states provided services for  employers with 100 or fewer employees (see fig. 6). Rhode Island, for  example, offered employers with 100 or fewer employees training grants  of up to $10,000. Rhode Island officials said that they targeted smaller  employers because these employers often do not have the resources to  provide their workers with training and that smaller employers make up  the majority of the companies in the state.", "States provided services in a variety of ways. States reported providing  worker training either directly or through grants awarded to employers or  training providers. For example, Louisiana generally awarded grants in  amounts that covered an employer\u2019s entire training costs. Employers could  use these funds to provide training themselves, hire private training  contractors, or contract with public training providers. Funded training  could occur either during normal working hours or off the clock.  Louisiana officials noted that they encouraged employers to use public  training providers, most often the state\u2019s technical colleges. On the other  hand, California required employers to contribute to training-related costs.  Employers were expected to match up to 100 percent of the training grant  to pay for related expenses, such as worker wages during training or  training materials. Officials from California reported that most training  grants are awarded contingent upon workers being trained on the job, as  opposed to off the clock.

States  spent approximately $202 million on worker training services; this  represents 72 percent of the total funds spent on employment placement  and training services (see fig. 8). States used these funds to provide a  variety of training services. For example, in Louisiana funds were used to  provide training related to automobile services and repairs, welding,  painting, and sandblasting. Funds were also used in Louisiana to purchase  training equipment, such as a Bridge Resource Management Simulator,  which was used for river navigation training. States reported providing  training services to about 200,000 people and were more likely to focus on  the provision of training services to employed workers as opposed to  dislocated workers or those receiving UI benefits (see fig. 9).

Officials from Louisiana said that they focus on job-specific training  because this type of training contributes to increased worker productivity  and company growth. State officials also noted that fostering company  growth creates new jobs that can lower state unemployment rates.", "States were less likely to use employer taxes to provide nonjob-specific  training, including conflict resolution, team building, or how to dress  appropriately for the workplace. Twelve of the 23 states reported  providing this type of training. These findings echo our previous study on  worker training that found similar trends: states were more likely to focus  state and federal funds on occupational training as compared to nonjob- specific training. Basic skills training\u2014such as math, GED preparation,  and English as a second language\u2014is least often provided, with only 10  states reporting they used employer tax revenues to fund this type of  training.", "Fewer state employer tax-funded programs emphasized employment  placement services, such as career counseling, skill assessments, and self- access employment services like Internet job listings and career planning  videos. Eight states reported that employment placement was their  primary focus, and 6 of these states funded employment placement  services exclusively. States reported spending approximately $77 million  to provide employment placement services to approximately 1.17 million  individuals. Despite the fact that fewer states reported emphasizing  employment placement services, the total number of individuals receiving  employment placement services is approximately six times as great as the  total number of individuals receiving training services. The difference in  the number of people served may be attributed to the time and resource  intensity of training services compared with employment placement  services. For example, Louisiana awards training grants that are up to 2  years in length. In comparison with training services, many of the  employment placement services that states reported providing are far less  time- and resource-intensive."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Most States with Employment Placement and Training Programs Funded through Employer Taxes Reported Some Coordination with Federal Workforce Programs", "paragraphs": ["Twenty-one of the 23 states with employment placement and training  programs funded through employer taxes reported some coordination  with federal workforce programs in 2002. The most common coordination  activity reported by states was the joint promotion of state and federally  funded workforce programs through outreach or referrals (see fig. 11).  These promotion activities occurred in various ways. For example, in  California, a local workforce investment board and its one-stop center  hired staff to make cold calls to companies advertising the benefits of  participating in the state-funded training program. In Louisiana, on the  other hand, state officials provided information packets to employers  about how to upgrade their employees\u2019 skills or fill job openings using  state and federally funded workforce programs.", "In addition, many states reported that they coordinated with federal  workforce programs by sharing technical assistance and administrative  resources. Technical assistance involves the exchange of program  information to improve program practices. For example, in California,  staff from both state and federally funded workforce programs worked  together on a task force and provided each other with technical assistance  to improve services to small businesses. Sharing administrative resources,  on the other hand, can involve activities such as using a common  management information system, or sharing office space or staff. In Rhode  Island, for example, staff at the local workforce investment boards were  responsible for administering some of the training grants funded by the  state program. Fewer states reported co-funding employment and training  services or jointly developing policies with federal workforce programs.", "The number of partnerships between employer tax-funded programs and  the federal workforce system varied from state to state. Some state  programs coordinated with only one federal partner. For example, New  Hampshire\u2019s program chose to coordinate exclusively with its state  workforce investment board. Other state programs coordinated with many  federal partners. For example, Delaware\u2019s program coordinated with a  one-stop center, TANF, the H1-B technical skill grants program, and other  federal workforce programs. (For additional information on each state\u2019s  partnerships with federal programs, see app. IV.)", "Although state employer tax-funded programs vary in their relationships  with federal workforce programs, some patterns are evident regarding the  most common federal partners. The majority of the states (19) reported  coordinating with at least one one-stop center during 2002. However,  several one-stop centers can operate in a state, and we do not know if  states coordinated with more than one of these centers. Thus, it is difficult  to gauge the degree of coordination between state-funded programs and  one-stop centers within each state. Nevertheless, we do know that many  states also reported coordinating with state workforce investment boards,  of which there is only one per state (see fig. 12). The number of federal  partners that state employer-funded programs have does not seem to be  closely associated with the number of years that the state programs have  operated. Although Delaware\u2019s program is older than New Hampshire\u2019s  and coordinated with more federal workforce programs, this is not a  consistent pattern across the country. For example, Kansas reported fewer  federal partners than Louisiana, despite the fact that Kansas\u2019s employer  tax-funded program has been in existence for about a decade longer.", "As a result of their various partnerships with workforce investment boards  and one-stop centers, almost all states reported an increase in awareness  of their employer tax-funded programs. In addition, some state officials  noted that coordination had improved service quality and availability. For  example, officials from Michigan and New Jersey\u2019s state programs, as well  as an official from an Oregon workforce investment board, noted that co- locating staff from the state-funded programs at the one-stop centers  improved the services delivered to individuals. By co-locating these  programs, state officials said that they can help these individuals learn  about a broader range of employment and training services and job  opportunities. The Oregon official also pointed out that such co-location  can reduce transportation and child care barriers for clients. Coordination  can also assist states in improving services to employers. For example, a  state official from Idaho reported that having staff members who are  knowledgeable about both the state-funded program and WIA programs  enables them to better meet the needs of employers looking to expand  their businesses or move to the state. Although many state officials noted  that coordination had improved services, they were less likely to report  increases in funding for employment and training services as a result of  these collaborative relationships (see fig. 13)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Almost All States Reported Regularly Assessing the Performance of Their Programs, but Program Impact Cannot be Determined", "paragraphs": ["Twenty-two of the 23 states with employer-funded employment placement  and training programs reported assessing the performance of their  programs in 2002, though program impacts could not be determined.

We then conducted a follow-up survey with  the 23 states that reported using employer taxes to fund their own  programs during state fiscal year 2002. Specifically, we surveyed the state  programs that reported receiving the largest portion of employer tax  revenues collected in their state to provide employment placement and  training services. To gain a perspective on service coordination with  federally funded workforce programs, we surveyed staff from workforce  investment boards in 6 states that began to fund their employment  placement and training programs through employer taxes in the 1980s. We  also requested recent assessments from the 23 states we surveyed and  reviewed the assessments from the 18 states that could provide them to  us.

This  structured survey was administered via e-mail and the telephone and had a  100 percent response rate. Twenty-three states reported that they used  employer tax revenues to fund their own employment placement and  training programs in state fiscal year 2002.", "To determine the types of employment placement and training services  states offered, we conducted a second survey of the 23 states that reported  using employer taxes to fund these services in our first survey. This survey  was designed to obtain information related to program mission, services  provided, populations served (individuals and industries), budget size, and  expenditures. To determine if states assessed their programs, we also  asked questions related to the frequency of program performance  assessments and the types of methods used to measure program  performance. In addition, we requested copies of recent program  assessment reports.", "To determine the extent to which state programs coordinated with federal  workforce programs, we also asked states to report how their employment  placement and training programs worked with federal organizations and  programs, including workforce investment boards, one-stop centers,  TANF, Welfare-to-Work, H1-B grants, employment placement and training  programs administered by the U.S. Department of Education, and other  federally funded programs.  In addition, we asked states how these  coordination efforts affected program awareness, quality of service,  available funding, and the amount of employment placement and training  services available.", "To gain the perspective of officials from federally funded programs on  coordination with these state programs, we administered a structured  telephone survey to representatives from workforce investment boards  operating in 6 states that began their employer tax-funded employment  placement or training programs during the 1980s (see table 4). We chose  these states with older programs, because we believed that they would  have more established partnerships with federal programs and would be  able to provide in-depth information on coordination. We surveyed  representatives from 5 of the state workforce investment boards. We also  surveyed a total of 10 purposively and randomly selected local workforce  investment boards. At least one local workforce investment board was  surveyed from each state that began operating its employer tax-funded  program during the 1980s.", "We included steps in both the survey data collection and data analysis  stages to account for and minimize the variability that occurs when  respondents interpret questions differently or have different information  available to them. For example, survey specialists along with subject  matter specialists designed each questionnaire, and we pre-tested each  questionnaire with the appropriate target audience to ensure that  questions were clear. We pre-tested our workforce investment board  survey with representatives from state workforce investment boards and a  local workforce investment board. We also reviewed survey questionnaire  responses for consistency and in several cases contacted respondents to  resolve inconsistencies. However, we did not otherwise verify the  information provided in the responses. In order to increase our response  rate for each survey, we followed up with program officials through e-mail  and telephone contact.
