FHA uses the actuarial reviews to assess whether the MMI Fund's capital ratio (economic value divided by insurance obligations) meets the 2 percent requirement and how fund components would perform under alternative economic scenarios. While the actuarial assessment does not directly determine the need for additional budget authority, it evaluates the fund's ability to absorb unexpected losses and may prompt changes in FHA policies and insurance premiums.", "Capital requirements and stress testing practices\u2014tools for managing financial risks\u2014for the MMI Fund are not consistent with all elements of a framework GAO developed to help assess these tools in the context of FHA's single-family mortgage insurance programs. In accordance with the framework, FHA's capital assessments and stress tests are transparent and incorporate a number of relevant risk factors. However, areas of inconsistency include the following:", "Scenario-based requirement . The statutory capital requirement is intended to help ensure the fund can absorb unexpected losses but is not based on a specified risk threshold, such as an adverse economic scenario the fund would be expected to withstand without requiring supplemental funds.", "Accountability mechanisms . The capital requirement also does not include accountability mechanisms, such as a set of steps FHA would have to take if the capital ratio again fell below the 2 percent minimum.", "Fund-wide stress tests . FHA has conducted separate stress tests\u2014projections of financial condition under adverse scenarios\u2014of its forward (traditional) and reverse mortgage (loans against home equity available to seniors) portfolios, but has not performed tests on a fund-wide basis.", "Stress test objectives . FHA has not defined specific objectives for its stress tests such as determining the amount of additional capital, if any, that would be needed to withstand conditions similar to the last housing crisis.", "Strengthening FHA's capital requirement and stress testing practices could help ensure that the MMI Fund is able to withstand economic downturns and that stress test results are as relevant and useful as possible for risk management.", "Including reverse mortgages in the fund's capital assessment has advantages and disadvantages. Unlike for stress tests, FHA jointly assesses forward and reverse mortgages to calculate a combined capital ratio. Subjecting the reverse mortgage portfolio to capital assessment has made its financial condition more transparent. But, the portfolio's sensitivity to changes in economic assumptions makes the combined ratio more unpredictable. Alternative approaches also pose trade-offs. For example, a separate reverse mortgage capital requirement may help ensure the financial transparency of both portfolios, but requiring FHA to hold more capital to account for the volatility of the reverse mortgage portfolio could compel FHA to raise insurance premiums or lower borrowing limits."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["Congress should consider specifying the economic conditions the MMI Fund would be expected to withstand without supplemental funds, and FHA should conduct stress tests on a fund-wide basis and specify the objectives of its stress tests.

These programs have  helped millions of households achieve homeownership or benefit from  home equity while living in their homes. FHA insures almost all of its  single-family mortgages under its Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund (MMI  Fund).

Therefore, FHA must  manage the fund such that, on average, the inflows exceed the outflows  by enough to maintain the required capital reserve. However, in fiscal  year 2009, in the midst of the 2007\u20132011 housing crisis, the MMI Fund\u2019s  capital ratio fell below 2 percent and did not meet the statutory  requirement again until fiscal year 2015, according to independent  actuarial reviews.

In fiscal year 2016, FHA  insured roughly 1.3 million single-family mortgages with total initial  balances of approximately $260 billion.

These included programs for  insuring mortgages on condominium units, mortgages that simultaneously  finance home purchase and rehabilitation costs, and reverse  mortgages.", "A reverse mortgage is a type of loan against the borrower\u2019s home equity.  With a reverse mortgage, borrowers do not need to repay the loan as  long as they meet certain conditions. These conditions, among others,  require the borrower to live in the home, pay property taxes and  homeowners\u2019 insurance, maintain the property, and retain the title in his  or her name. Unlike forward mortgages, where the borrower makes  monthly payments to the lender, increasing equity and decreasing the  loan balance over time, reverse mortgages typically are \u201crising debt,  falling equity\u201d loans. For reverse mortgages, the loan balance increases  and the home equity decreases over time. As the borrower receives  payments from the lender, the lender adds the principal and interest to  the loan balance, reducing the homeowner\u2019s equity. FHA insures reverse  mortgages under its Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM)  program, which serves eligible borrowers aged 62 or older. Congress  established the HECM program in 1988 as a way to alleviate economic  hardship caused by the increasing costs of health care, housing, and  subsistence needs at a time in life when income is reduced, while  protecting reverse mortgage lenders and borrowers from financial  losses.", "The MMI Fund is supported by insurance premiums paid by borrowers.  For forward mortgages, FHA has the authority to establish and collect a  single up-front premium (in an amount not to exceed 3.0 percent of the  amount of the original insured principal of the mortgage) and annual  premiums of up to 1.5 percent of the remaining insured principal balance,  or 1.55 percent for borrowers with down payments of less than 5.0  percent. As of September 2017, FHA charged a 1.75 percent up-front  premium and either a 0.80 percent or 0.85 percent annual premium,  depending on the size of the down payment.

FHA uses the results of the actuarial review to determine  whether the MMI Fund is meeting the act\u2019s requirement that it maintain a  capital ratio of at least 2 percent. Each year, an independent actuarial  contractor conducts two separate actuarial reviews\u2014one for forward  mortgages and one for HECMs\u2014to estimate the economic value of the  two portfolios. In a separate annual report to Congress, FHA combines  the findings of the forward mortgage and HECM actuarial reviews to  determine the capital ratio for the MMI Fund as a whole.

FHA estimates and reestimates the net lifetime  costs\u2014known as credit subsidy costs\u2014of the mortgages it insures as part  of the MMI Fund\u2019s annual budgetary review. Under the Federal Credit  Reform Act of 1990 (FCRA), FHA and other federal agencies must  estimate the credit subsidy costs of their direct loan or loan guarantee  programs in their annual budgets. Credit subsidy costs represent the  present value of estimated cash flows to the government minus the  present value of estimated cash flows from the government over the life  of the loan, excluding administrative costs. For a mortgage insurance  program, cash inflows consist primarily of insurance premiums charged to  borrowers and proceeds from sales of foreclosed properties, and cash  outflows consist mostly of insurance claim payments to lenders. Annually,  agencies estimate credit subsidy costs for new loan cohorts\u2014the loans  agencies commit to guarantee in a given fiscal year. When estimated  cash inflows exceed expected cash outflows, a cohort is said to have a  negative credit subsidy cost, meaning that the cohort is estimated to  generate income. When the opposite is true, the cohort is said to have a  positive credit subsidy cost.", "Generally, agencies also are required to produce annual updates of their  subsidy estimates\u2014known as reestimates\u2014for each loan cohort on the  basis of information on actual performance and estimated changes in  future loan performance. Each additional year provides more historical  data on loan performance that may influence estimates of the amount and  timing of future claims. Additionally, economic assumptions (such as  house prices and interest rates) also can change from year to year, which  would affect estimates of future loan performance. In recognition of the  difficulty in making credit subsidy estimates that mirror actual loan  performance, FCRA provides permanent and indefinite budget authority  for reestimates that reflect increased credit subsidy costs (upward  reestimates). While FHA has had a number of upward reestimates, the  only year in which the MMI Fund has needed to draw on permanent and  indefinite budget authority was fiscal year 2013, when it received $1.69  billion. All other upward reestimates were covered by funds held in the  MMI Fund\u2019s capital reserve account.", "Financial accounting review. The preparation of FHA\u2019s financial  statements also provides a review of the MMI Fund. FHA is required to  prepare financial statements in accordance with generally accepted  accounting principles for the federal government (federal GAAP). The  financial statements provide information on the overall financial position of  the MMI Fund, including its assets, liabilities, and actual cash flows during  the year.

The MMI Fund plays a key role during such periods by helping to  maintain the flow of mortgage credit to areas that may be underserved by  the private sector. As previously noted, the MMI Fund is statutorily  required to maintain at least a 2 percent capital ratio. It also is the only  federal credit program with a capital requirement. Because the MMI  Fund can draw on permanent and indefinite budget authority, if  necessary, it has greater ability to weather adverse economic conditions  than a private entity. However, the capital requirement is intended to help  ensure that the fund remains self-sufficient by creating a reserve for  unexpected losses. The size of the MMI Fund\u2019s capital reserve can be  expected to fluctuate depending on economic conditions and other  factors. For example, the reserve may tend to grow when the economy is  strong (limiting borrower defaults and FHA insurance losses), and may  tend to shrink when the economy is weak (increasing borrower defaults  and FHA insurance losses).", "Stress tests are a risk management tool used by banks and other  financial institutions. The International Actuarial Association defines  stress testing as a projection of the financial condition of an institution  under a specific set of adverse conditions.

The financing account is designed to hold  sufficient funds to cover anticipated net future costs on outstanding  insurance. The capital reserve account holds additional funds that could  be used to cover unexpected losses (for example, due to higher-than- anticipated mortgage defaults). If the capital reserve account had  insufficient funds to cover an upward credit subsidy reestimate (that is, an  increase in expected lifetime costs), FHA would draw on permanent and  indefinite budget authority. As previously noted, this has occurred one  time (fiscal year 2013) since the implementation of FCRA. Drawing on  permanent and indefinite budget authority means that the MMI Fund is  not self-sufficient under FCRA requirements. However, it does not  indicate that the fund is unable to pay insurance claims in the near-term  without supplemental funding, because the fund\u2019s financing account holds  balances to cover the anticipated net future costs on claims expected in  the near-term and over the long-term for the existing insurance portfolio.", "In contrast, the actuarial reviews do not directly determine the need for  additional budget authority; rather, they are used to assess whether the  MMI Fund is in compliance with the requirement to maintain at least a 2  percent capital ratio. Additionally, the reviews are statutorily required to  be conducted by an independent actuary rather than by FHA. As  previously noted, the actuarial reviews estimate the economic value of the  forward mortgage and HECM portfolios separately, and FHA combines  these estimates to calculate the capital ratio (that is, the economic value  divided by the insurance-in-force) for the MMI Fund as a whole. The  economic value of each portfolio consists of existing net capital resources  (assets less liabilities) plus the net present value of anticipated future  cash inflows and outflows on outstanding insurance.", "To determine existing net capital resources, FHA\u2019s actuarial contractor  uses information on the assets and liabilities of the financing and capital  reserve accounts previously discussed. Beginning with the fiscal year  2012 actuarial review and continuing through the fiscal year 2016 review  (the most recently completed one), FHA\u2019s actuarial contractor has  estimated the net present value of cash flows using Monte Carlo  simulation\u2014a methodology that involves running simulations of multiple  economic paths. Specifically, for the forward mortgage and HECM  portfolios separately, the contractor generated 100 economic paths,  centered around Moody\u2019s Analytics\u2019 baseline economic scenario, and  computed a net present value of future cash flows for each of these  paths. The contractor added the average of these 100 numbers to the  existing net capital resources to produce the economic value used to  assess compliance with the MMI Fund\u2019s 2 percent capital requirement.  Table 1 shows the fiscal year 2016 economic value, insurance-in-force,  and capital ratio for the forward mortgage and HECM portfolios, as well  as for the MMI Fund as a whole.", "Under the independent actuarial reviews, an economic value of zero\u2014 and therefore a capital ratio of zero\u2014for the MMI Fund as a whole  indicates that estimated resources are enough to cover anticipated net  future costs and no more. Specifically, if the capital ratio is zero, the MMI  Fund\u2019s existing net capital resources (for example, cash and Treasury  investments) and the net present value of future cash inflows (for  example, premium revenue and proceeds from sales of foreclosed  homes) are estimated to be equal to the net present value of future cash  outflows (for example, insurance claim payments and costs to maintain  foreclosed properties). Therefore, in concept, a positive economic value is  similar to a positive balance in the capital reserve account under the  budget process\u2014that is, it projects the availability of funds above what is  needed to cover expected net future costs on outstanding insurance.", "However, the independent actuarial reviews have used different  estimation models and economic assumptions from those used in FHA\u2019s  budgetary assessment to estimate the present value of future cash flows;  therefore, the actuarial and budgetary reviews have not produced  identical capital estimates. (See app. II for more information on the  related components of the budgetary and actuarial reviews.) A capital  ratio below 2 percent, or even below zero, does not directly determine the  need for permanent and indefinite budget authority. However, it indicates  that according to the models and assumptions of the actuarial reviews,  the MMI Fund\u2019s ability to absorb unexpected losses may be limited and  that premium and policy changes designed to bolster the fund\u2019s capital  position may be needed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Actuarial Reviews Also Include Stress Tests of the MMI Fund and Other Insights", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the capital assessment, the actuarial reviews also have  projected the MMI Fund\u2019s performance under alternative economic  scenarios, including stress scenarios.

Specifically, the fiscal  year 2016 reviews estimated the 10th best and worst, 25th best and  worst, and worst economic values produced by the Monte Carlo  simulation, along with the economic values resulting from Moody\u2019s  Analytics\u2019 baseline and protracted slump scenarios. In addition, the  fiscal year 2016 reviews included a low-interest-rate scenario, which  assumes that low interest rates persist for 2 years, before resuming on  the path of the Moody\u2019s Analytics\u2019 baseline scenario.

This, in turn, reduces the MMI Fund\u2019s estimated  economic value and makes it more difficult for the fund to meet the 2  percent capital requirement.

When the  post-2008 HECM portfolio became part of the MMI Fund, it also was  included in the MMI Fund\u2019s capital ratio assessment and became subject  to annual actuarial review requirements. These changes have had some  advantages. First, subjecting HECMs to the annual actuarial review  requirements has improved the transparency of the program\u2019s financial  condition. For example, the actuarial reviews have included estimates of  the HECM portfolio\u2019s economic value and performance under alternative  economic conditions, which were not available prior to 2009.", "Second, jointly considering the forward mortgage and HECM portfolios in  the MMI Fund\u2019s capital assessment mitigates the potential difficulty of  independently holding the HECM portfolio to a specified capital ratio. The  economic value of the HECM portfolio is more sensitive to changes in  economic conditions and inputs to the models than the forward mortgage  portfolio. As a result, the capital ratio for the HECM portfolio is more  volatile, and requiring HECMs to independently meet a capital ratio would  be difficult. Specifically, it could be difficult to manage HECM insurance  premiums, loan limits, and other program requirements to ensure that a  capital requirement is consistently met. Estimates of HECM capital ratios  under alternative economic scenarios from the fiscal year 2016 actuarial  review illustrate the sensitivity of this portfolio\u2019s economic value\u2014and  therefore its capital ratio\u2014to changes in economic conditions (see fig.1).  While the capital ratio for forward mortgages ranged from negative 3.3  percent to positive 4.17 percent under all of the economic scenarios, the  corresponding range for HECMs was negative 38.74 percent to positive  3.07 percent.", "Under the current approach of jointly considering the HECM and forward  mortgage portfolios in the capital assessment, both portfolios in  combination are subject to the capital requirement, but the volatility of the  HECM portfolio\u2019s economic value is mitigated by the relative stability of  the forward mortgage portfolio. More specifically, because the forward  mortgage portfolio is substantially larger than the HECM portfolio (with the  HECM portfolio accounting for roughly 10 percent of the MMI Fund\u2019s  insurance-in-force in fiscal year 2016), the combined capital ratio more  closely follows the generally less volatile capital ratio for forward  mortgages (see fig. 2). As a result, the combined capital ratio is less  uncertain than the HECM capital ratio, and managing the HECM portfolio  within that combined framework is more feasible than managing it to a  separate capital requirement.", "Finally, another possible advantage of the joint assessment is some  degree of risk diversification. The cash inflows and outflows of the forward  mortgage and HECM portfolios do not necessarily rise and fall in tandem  in response to changes in macroeconomic conditions. For example, all  other things being equal, rising mortgage interest rates tend to increase  the economic value of the forward mortgage portfolio but tend to  decrease the economic value of the HECM portfolio. Because the cash  flows of the two portfolios are not fully correlated, the amount of capital  needed for the two portfolios in combination may be less than the sum of  the amount of capital needed for each portfolio separately."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Disadvantages of Including HECMs in the MMI Fund Include More Uncertainty about the MMI Fund\u2019s Financial Condition", "paragraphs": ["Joint assessment of the forward mortgage and HECM portfolios in  determining compliance with the capital requirement also has some  disadvantages. First, including HECMs in the MMI Fund can result in  more uncertainty about the Fund\u2019s expected performance. As previously  discussed, the economic value of HECMs is more volatile and sensitive to  economic conditions than the economic value of forward mortgages. As a  result, estimates of the MMI Fund\u2019s economic value and capital ratio and  its potential performance under alternative economic scenarios are less  predictable and more difficult to interpret with the inclusion of HECMs.", "Although the combined capital ratio generally tracks with the forward  mortgage capital ratio, the inclusion of HECMs in the assessment can  affect the combined capital ratio. For example, in fiscal year 2015, a high  HECM capital ratio (6.44 percent) pulled the combined capital ratio above  2 percent (2.07 percent), even though the forward mortgage capital ratio  was below 2 percent (1.63 percent). In this case, the inclusion of the  HECM portfolio in the capital ratio resulted in the MMI Fund meeting the 2  percent capital requirement for the first time in 6 years. In its fiscal year  2014 report to Congress, FHA concluded that the HECM portfolio was  over 10 times more volatile than the forward mortgage portfolio, noting  that small changes to the HECM program can affect the overall value of  the MMI Fund. Further, in its fiscal year 2015 report to Congress, FHA  noted that because the HECM portfolio is projected to continue growing at  a faster rate than the forward portfolio, year-to-year HECM volatility is  likely to contribute more uncertainty to future actuarial valuations of the  MMI Fund. In recent years, HECMs have accounted for an increasing percentage of the MMI Fund\u2019s insurance-in-force, rising from 4.01 percent  in fiscal year 2009 to 9.42 percent in fiscal year 2016.", "Second, relying on a combined capital ratio to assess the MMI Fund\u2019s  compliance with the capital requirement could mask the financial  condition of the individual portfolios. Information on the performance of  each portfolio is available in separate actuarial reports, but differences  between the financial health of the two portfolios may be overlooked  because compliance with the 2 percent capital requirement is determined  by the combined capital ratio. For example, in fiscal year 2013, the  combined capital ratio was below 2 percent (negative 0.11 percent), while  the HECM capital ratio was 7.50 percent. In contrast, in fiscal year 2016,  the combined ratio was above 2 percent (2.32 percent), while the HECM  capital ratio was below 2 percent (negative 6.90 percent). In those years,  the substantial difference between the financial condition of the HECM  portfolio and the overall MMI Fund would not have been evident from the  combined capital ratio.", "Even in years when the capital ratios of both the forward mortgage and  HECM portfolios are above or below the 2 percent level, the combined  capital ratio may still hide important differences between the two. For  example, in fiscal year 2014, the capital ratios for both the forward  mortgage and HECM portfolios were below 2 percent. However, the  forward mortgage capital ratio was positive (0.56 percent), while the  HECM capital ratio was negative (-1.20 percent). This difference may be  important to policymakers because a positive capital ratio indicates that  the portfolio has some capital cushion to absorb unexpected losses, even  if it is small. In contrast, a negative ratio suggests the portfolio may not  have sufficient capital to independently cover all expected net losses on  outstanding insurance, and may essentially be financially supported by  the other portfolio in the MMI Fund.", "Finally, in certain circumstances, the joint capital assessment could  create pressure to raise insurance premiums or tighten underwriting  standards in one program to compensate for the weaker financial  performance of another program. For example, if the forward mortgage  capital ratio were above 2 percent, but the HECM capital ratio pulled the  combined ratio below 2 percent, raising insurance premium rates for  forward mortgages could be the quickest way to regain a 2 percent capital  ratio. In this example, a portion of the premiums paid by the forward  mortgage borrower would essentially support the HECM program. While  this situation would benefit HECM borrowers (because their insurance  premiums would not increase), it would potentially create a burden for  forward mortgage borrowers and could reduce the number of prospective  borrowers who are able to afford FHA mortgage insurance.

Policy decisions about these trade-offs could have  significant implications for the management of FHA\u2019s programs and for  potential FHA borrowers.", "If Congress wishes to place additional emphasis on the financial self- sufficiency of the HECM program, it may be appropriate to hold the  HECM portfolio to a capital requirement separate from that of forward  mortgages. Under this option, future HECMs could either remain in the  MMI Fund or be placed under a different insurance fund. The capital  requirement could be set at the same congressionally defined level as the  one for forward mortgages, or it could be tailored to the risks and volatility  of the HECM portfolio. A separate HECM capital requirement would help  ensure that the forward mortgage portfolio is not supporting the HECM  portfolio, or vice versa. Decisions about premiums and other program  requirements could be based solely on each portfolio\u2019s financial condition  and would not be influenced by a need to keep a combined capital ratio  sufficiently high.", "In addition, a separate HECM capital requirement would help ensure that  for future loan cohorts, the financial conditions of the individual portfolios  are not masked by a combined capital ratio. However, if the HECM  portfolio was required to independently meet a minimum capital ratio, the  volatility of the portfolio\u2019s economic value could make it difficult for FHA to  consistently meet the requirement without targeting a capital level  substantially above the minimum requirement. Doing so may require FHA  to raise insurance premiums or place greater restrictions on the amount  seniors can borrow, which would limit the program\u2019s ability to serve its  goal of alleviating economic hardship.", "In comparison, if Congress wishes to place greater emphasis on  maximizing the benefits of the HECM program for seniors, another option  may be to exempt the HECM portfolio from a capital requirement. Under  this option, future HECMs would not be part of the MMI Fund and would  not be subject to the MMI Fund\u2019s capital requirement. As with a separate  HECM capital requirement, this option would help ensure that the  financial condition of future loan cohorts in the forward mortgage portfolio  is not masked by a combined capital ratio. But, the financial condition of  the HECM portfolio would not be as transparent, unless FHA continued to  conduct HECM actuarial assessments. In addition, FHA could set  premiums and program limits without consideration for building a capital  buffer, which might decrease the likelihood that the HECM program would  operate on at least a break-even basis over the long run. Some industry  participants we spoke with did not think that HECMs should be exempted  from a capital requirement, noting that the increased transparency and  accountability of HECMs were important.

We  compared the types of information available in the actuarial reviews with  the types of information in the budgetary and financial accounting reviews  of the fund, as well as in FHA\u2019s quarterly reports to Congress, focusing on  information that could help inform whether the MMI Fund is likely to  remain self-sufficient.

For the stress testing framework, we reviewed articles on  principles and practices from financial regulators and institutions,  including the Bank for International Settlements, the Board of Governors  of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve), and the International  Monetary Fund. We included in our frameworks key common elements in  designing capital requirements and stress tests that could apply to the  MMI Fund, assuming the fund would continue to operate under federal  accounting standards and budgeting requirements.", "In addition to FHA, we shared the draft frameworks with FHFA, the  National Association of Insurance Commissioners, and the American  Academy of Actuaries and interviewed officials from these organizations  to obtain their input on the frameworks. We chose these organizations  based on their expertise in financial assessments of housing finance and  mortgage insurance institutions.

For  example, the actuarial analysis of the MMI Fund\u2019s economic value  includes an existing capital resources component, which can be  calculated from information on assets and liabilities presented in the  budgetary review. In addition, both reviews include a calculation of the  present value of future cash flows on outstanding insurance, though the  two reviews use different models and economic assumptions to perform  these calculations. Both reviews also provide estimates of the amount of resources the MMI Fund has, in excess of what is needed to cover  estimated credit subsidy costs (that is, the net present value of expected  future cash flows on outstanding insurance).

(Under the direction  of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the housing enterprises Fannie  Mae and Freddie Mac incorporated the Federal Reserve scenario into  financial criteria that private mortgage insurance companies must meet to  be an approved insurer of mortgages acquired by the housing  enterprises.) Our analysis focused on scenarios used in the fiscal year  2016 actuarial review of the MMI Fund\u2019s forward mortgage portfolio (the  most recently completed review) and the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2016  supervisory stress tests, because these scenarios all used projections of  economic variables beginning in calendar year 2016.

For example, the  Federal Reserve stress scenarios last 3 years and one quarter, whereas  the MMI Fund scenarios last nearly 12 years.

On the other hand, if  coupled with conditions that increase foreclosure risk (such as low house  price growth), higher interest rates can negatively affect the fund by  reducing prepayments, resulting in more mortgages remaining in the fund  that could lead to foreclosures and insurance claims.", "As shown in figure 5, the three scenarios exhibit differences in the  severity and timing of interest rate changes and the overall volatility of the  interest rate path. The mortgage interest rate under the Federal  Reserve\u2019s severely adverse scenario increases by about 1 percentage  point over the first year, then essentially levels off through the end of the  scenario in the fourth year. In contrast, the MMI Fund protracted slump  scenario projects an initial 1.5 percentage point decline in the interest rate  over about the first 2 years, followed by an extended increase that leaves  the interest rate almost 2 percentage points higher at the end of the 12- year scenario than it was at the start. The MMI Fund worst simulation  path features the most dramatic interest rate changes of the three  scenarios.
