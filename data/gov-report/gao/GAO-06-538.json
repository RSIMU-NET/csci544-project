While the legislation stated that the pilot program is exempt from procedural requirements of current Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) regulations, to a large extent two of the three programs were designed and are operating within existing EEOC requirements, with a specific emphasis on alternative dispute resolution (ADR) as encouraged in DOD's memo soliciting pilot program proposals. ADR techniques include, but are not limited to, conciliation, facilitation, mediation, or arbitration and usually involve the intervention or facilitation by a neutral third party. After the first year, program officials reported low case activity and stated that they plan to request approval from the Secretary to continue their respective programs for a third year. To carry out the programs, officials used similar strategies--outreach to inform eligible staff about the pilot programs, staff training, and the use of electronic data collection--but implemented them differently. Our assessment of DOD's evaluation plan for the pilot program found both strengths and limitations. A sound evaluation plan contains such features as criteria for determining program performance and measures that are directly linked to program objectives. Such key features increase the likelihood that the evaluation will yield sound results, thereby supporting effective program and policy decisions. Lacking these key features, DOD is limited in its ability to conduct an accurate and reliable assessment of the program's results, and Congress is limited in its ability to determine whether features of the overall program have governmentwide applicability.

DLA officials said the PECP process has three steps. The first step  occurs when an employee who believes he or she has been discriminated  against makes initial contact with DLA\u2019s EEO office. An EEO Intake  Specialist collects specific information about the employee\u2019s concerns and  drafts an intake report, which includes a description and basis of the claim.

In the first step, a trained DeCA facilitator  attempts to resolve a claim before the start of the informal stage of the  current process. Employees at stores participating in ERO can call a toll- free number to discuss their concerns with a trained facilitator. For  example, an employee could call about perceived discrimination over  schedule changes, and the facilitator may discuss what had occurred and  rationale for schedule changes (e.g., to cover absences).

According to a DeCA official, ERO seeks to reduce the processing time of  the formal stage. To help achieve this goal, DeCA reduces processing times  for two phases of the formal stage of the complaint process: (1) after a  complainant files a formal complaint, DeCA has set a goal in ERO of   14 days to accept, partially accept, or dismiss it; and (2) after the report of  investigation is completed, DeCA sends a notice informing the complainant  that he or she has 7 days to either request a hearing or a final agency  decision, reducing the time from 30 days under EEOC regulations.

In addition, although authorized to operate outside of  current EEOC regulations, to a large extent, two of the three programs  have been designed by DOD to operate within the requirements of current  regulations. While sharing common strategies in such areas as electronic  data collection, the pilot programs implemented them differently. As the  challenges of the 21st century grow, it will become increasingly important  for DOD to consider how it can maximize performance and results through  the improved collaboration of its organizations. Officials from the  programs and DOD\u2019s EEO pilot program oversight entities have indicated  their willingness to share information and strategies.", "To better ensure that it will provide useful results, DOD needs to make  changes to its evaluation plan. Although DOD\u2019s evaluation plan had some  strengths, the plan\u2019s shortcomings may impede DOD\u2019s ability to produce  sound results that can inform both program and policy decisions regarding  the overall pilot program. The lack of key evaluation features, such as clear  and measurable objectives, measures linked to these objectives, and  established criteria for determining pilot program performance may limit  confidence in pilot program results."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To improve the performance and results of the pilot program, we  recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct the Deputy  Undersecretary of Defense for Civilian Personnel Policy, the Deputy  Undersecretary for Equal Opportunity, and the Civilian Personnel  Management Service to take the following actions: Establish regular intra-agency exchanges of information on outreach  strategies, training, and electronic data collection from which the pilot  programs could achieve potential benefits that would not be available if  working separately.", "Develop a sound evaluation plan to accurately and reliably assess the pilot  programs\u2019 results, including such key features as  well-defined, clear, and measurable objectives;  measures that are directly linked to the program objectives;  criteria for determining pilot program performance;  a way to isolate the effects of the pilot programs;  a data analysis plan for the evaluation design; and  a detailed plan to ensure that data collection, entry, and storage are  reliable and error-free."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Secretary of Defense for his review  and comment. The Principal Deputy Undersecretary of Defense provided  written comments, which are included in appendix II.", "DOD generally agreed with our recommendations. Regarding the  establishment of regular intra-agency exchanges of information among the  pilot programs to leverage potential benefits, DOD stated that it will hold  quarterly meetings with pilot program managers. Concerning the  development of an evaluation plan that accurately and reliably assesses the  pilot programs\u2019 results, DOD partially concurred with the recommendation  and stated that it would consider and incorporate the recommended key  features into the evaluation plan as appropriate. However, DOD also stated  that the purpose of the plan was to assist pilot program evaluators in their  work by specifying those procedures, tools, and objectives that would be  unique to the pilot programs. In its comments, DOD reasons that because  all pilot program officials agreed on a particular objective, which was  common to both the pilot and traditional EEO complaint procedures, that it  was not necessary to link data collection efforts to that objective or  incorporate either the objective or the data collection effort in the  evaluation plan. Because the plan is the long-term guide for the pilot  program evaluation process and because staff changes occur, it is  important that DOD include all objectives and methods they intend to use  in the plan, allowing the evaluation process to be more transparent and  provide clearer guidance to the pilot program officials on evaluation  procedures.", "In its response, DOD also commented on our observation that to a large  extent two of the three pilot programs were designed and are operating  within existing EEOC requirements. DOD noted that this was due in large  part to a presidential memorandum issued when the legislation was signed.  The memorandum, which addressed the implementation of the pilot  program, required that a complaining party be allowed to opt out of the  pilot program at any time. According to DOD, adhering to this requirement  necessitated using a similar design to the current EEO process so that  complaining parties who decided to opt out would not be penalized by  having to start at the very beginning of the current EEO complaint process.  It is not clear to us that ensuring the ability to opt out at any point  necessitates returning the complaining party to the very beginning of the  current EEO process in all cases. Rather, the complaining party would be  returned to the current EEO process at an appropriate point based on what  was achieved through the pilot program process. Overall, we see nothing in  the presidential memorandum that would limit DOD\u2019s legitimate use of the  procedural flexibility granted by Congress through the pilot program  authority.", "We will send copies of this report to other interested congressional parties,  the Secretary of Defense, and the Chair of EEOC.

The Age Discrimination in Employment Act of  1967, as amended, prohibits employment discrimination against individuals  who are 40 years of age or older. Sections 501 and 505 of the Rehabilitation  Act of 1973, as amended, prohibit discrimination against qualified  individuals with disabilities who work or apply to work in the federal  government. Federal agencies are required to provide reasonable  accommodation to qualified employees or applicants for employment with  disabilities, except when such accommodation would cause an undue  hardship.

The EEOC has established regulations providing for the  processing of federal sector employment discrimination complaints. This  complaint process consists of two stages, informal, or precomplaint  counseling, and formal. Before filing a complaint, the employee must  consult an EEO counselor at the agency in order to try to informally resolve  the matter. The employee must contact an EEO counselor within 45 days of  the matter alleged to be discriminatory or, in the case of a personnel action,  within 45 days of the effective date of the action.

If ADR is chosen, the  parties have 90 days in which to attempt resolution. If the matter is not  resolved within these time frames, the counselor is required to inform the  employee in writing of his or her right to file a formal discrimination  complaint with the agency. The written notice must inform the employee of  the (1) right to file a discrimination complaint within 15 days of receipt of  the notice, (2) appropriate agency official with whom to file a complaint,  and (3) duty to ensure that the agency is informed immediately if the  complainant retains counsel or a representative.", "After a complainant files a formal discrimination complaint, the agency  must decide whether to accept or dismiss the complaint and notify the  complainant. If the agency dismisses the complaint, the complainant has 30  days to appeal the dismissal to EEOC. If the agency accepts the complaint,  it has 180 days to investigate the accepted complaint and provide the  complainant with a copy of the investigative file. Within 30 days of receipt  of the copy of the investigative file, the complainant must choose between  requesting (1) a hearing and decision from an EEOC administrative judge  (AJ) or (2) a final decision from the agency.
