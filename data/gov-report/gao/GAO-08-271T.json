Facility officials verify the information used in the credentialing process and query certain databases that contain information on disciplinary actions that have been taken against a physician's state medical license and have information about a physician's professional competence. Each physician also must complete a written request for clinical privileges that is reviewed by the physician's supervisor who considers whether the physician has the appropriate professional credentials, training, and work experience. In addition, every 2 years, the supervisor is to consider information on a physician's performance, such as a physician's surgical complication rate, when deciding whether to renew a physician's clinical privileges. In a May 2006, GAO examined compliance with VA's physician credentialing and privileging requirements at seven VA medical facilities it visited and made three recommendations designed to improve aspects of privileging and oversight of the process. The three recommendations were (1) to provide guidance to medical facilities on how to collect individual physician performance information in accordance with VA's credentialing and privileging policy to use in medical facilities' privileging process, (2) to enforce the requirement that medical facilities submit information on paid VA medical malpractice claims to VA within 60 days after being notified that the claim is paid, and (3) to instruct medical facilities to establish internal controls to ensure the accuracy of their privileging information.

VA  has over 36,000 physicians working at more than 1,300 facilities in its  health care system. To help ensure the quality of the health care these  physicians deliver and the safety of veterans, VA is responsible for  determining that its physicians have the appropriate professional  credentials and clinical experience to provide health care to VA\u2019s patients.  To do this, VA requires physicians to undergo credentialing and  privileging. VA\u2019s credentialing process is used to determine whether a  physician\u2019s professional credentials, such as licensure, education, and  training, are valid and meet VA\u2019s requirements for employment. VA\u2019s  privileging process is used to determine which health care services or  clinical privileges, such as surgical procedures or administering  anesthesia, a VA physician is qualified to provide to veterans without  supervision. VA physicians must be credentialed and privileged when they  apply to work in VA\u2014which is known as initial appointment\u2014and at least  once every 2 years thereafter when they must reapply for a position on the  facility\u2019s medical staff.

Although we cannot generalize  from our findings, we found that these facilities were complying with  credentialing requirements. However, they were not complying with  aspects of certain privileging requirements. For example, VA medical  facilities were not submitting information on paid medical malpractice  claims within the 60-day required time frame to VA\u2019s office that reviews  the claims information and makes a determination about whether  physicians involved in the claims delivered substandard care to veterans.  VA generally agreed with our findings, conclusions, and recommendations.", "Today, I will discuss the progress VA has made in implementing our May  2006 recommendations to address noncompliance with VA\u2019s privileging  requirements. Specifically, I will discuss (1) how VA credentials and  privileges physicians working in its medical facilities and (2) the extent to  which VA has implemented the three recommendations made in our May  2006 report that address VA\u2019s privileging requirements.", "To perform our 2006 review, we selected four of VA\u2019s credentialing  requirements for review because they are requirements that\u2014unlike  others\u2014address information about physicians that can change or be  updated with new information periodically. As a result, VA requires that  this information be verified by medical facility officials when a physician  initially applies for employment at VA and at least every 2 years thereafter.  Under the four requirements we reviewed, VA medical facility officials  must  1.  verify that all state medical licenses held by physicians are valid;  2.  query the Federation of State Medical Boards (FSMB) database to  determine whether physicians had disciplinary action taken against  any of their licenses, including expired licenses;  3.  verify information provided by physicians on their involvement in  medical malpractice claims at a VA or non-VA facility; and  4.  query the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) to determine  whether a physician was reported to this data bank because of  involvement in VA or non-VA paid medical malpractice claims, display  of professional incompetence, or engagement in professional  misconduct.", "Of the privileging requirements in VA\u2019s credentialing and privileging  policy, we selected four requirements that VA identifies as general  privileging requirements. In addition, we selected another privileging  requirement about the use of individual performance information because  of its importance in the renewal of clinical privileges. The five VA  privileging requirements we selected were as follows:  1.  verify that all state medical licenses held by physicians are valid;  2.  verify physicians\u2019 training and experience;  3.  assess physicians\u2019 clinical competence and health status;  4.  consider any information provided by a physician related to medical  malpractice allegations or paid claims, loss of medical staff  membership, loss or reduction of clinical privileges at a VA or non-VA  facility, or any challenges to a physician\u2019s state medical license; and  5.  use information on a physician\u2019s performance when making decisions  about whether to renew the physician\u2019s clinical privileges.", "Two of the five privileging requirements\u2014verify all state medical licenses  and consider medical malpractice information\u2014are also VA credentialing  requirements we reviewed.", "To update our work, we reviewed VA\u2019s policies, procedures, and  correspondence related to physician privileging and interviewed VA  central office officials to determine if the recommendations we made in  our May 2006 report were implemented.

VA requires its medical  facility officials to credential and privilege facility physicians periodically  so that they can continue to work at VA. We reported in May 2006 that the  seven VA medical facilities we visited complied with the four credentialing  requirements we reviewed and all but one of the five privileging  requirements we reviewed. However, during our review, we found that  medical facility officials did not have all of the information they needed on  physicians involved in paid VA medical malpractice claims, because the  facilities had not submitted such information in a timely manner to VA\u2019s  office that reviews the claims information and makes a determination  about whether physicians involved in the claims delivered substandard  care to veterans. We also found during our review that VA did not require  its medical facilities to establish internal controls to help ensure the  accuracy of their privileging information. Without internal controls VA  medical facility officials did not know if they properly renewed clinical  privileges, thereby allowing physicians to practice with expired clinical  privileges. Since our 2006 review, VA reports that it has implemented all  three of our recommendations to improve VA\u2019s physician privileging  process.

State medical licenses are issued by state licensing boards, which  generally establish state licensing requirements governing their licensed  practitioners. To keep licenses current, physicians must renew their  licenses before they expire and meet renewal requirements established by  state licensing boards, such as continuing education. Renewal procedures  and requirements vary by state. When state licensing boards discover  violations of licensing practices, such as the abuse of prescription drugs or  the provision of substandard care that results in adverse health effects,  they may place restrictions on licenses or revoke them.

In general, the medical  staff specialist at each VA medical facility manages the accuracy of  VetPro\u2019s credentialing data. The medical staff specialist verifies, with the  original source of the information, the accuracy of the credentialing  information entered by the physicians. This type of check is known as  primary source verification. For example, the medical staff specialist  contacts state licensing boards in order to verify that physicians\u2019 state  medical licenses are valid and unrestricted.", "At initial appointment only, VA requires medical staff specialists to query  FSMB, which contains information from state licensing boards. This query  enables officials to determine all the state medical licenses a physician has  ever held, including those not disclosed by a physician to VA, and whether  a physician has had any disciplinary actions taken against these licenses.  VA does not require this query at reappointment because VA headquarters  regularly receives reports from FSMB on any VA physician whose name  appears on FSMB\u2019s list, indicating that disciplinary action has been taken  against the physician\u2019s state medical license. When VA headquarters  receives a report from FSMB, it notifies the appropriate VA medical  facility.", "VA\u2019s credentialing process requires VA medical staff specialists to verify  medical malpractice claims at initial appointment and at reappointment.  These claims may be verified by contacting a court of jurisdiction or the  insurance company involved in the medical malpractice claims, or by  obtaining a statement of claims status from the attorney representing the  physician in the medical malpractice claim. In addition, VA requires  medical staff specialists to query NPDB, which contains reports by state  licensing boards, hospitals, and other health care entities on  unprofessional behavior on the part of physicians or adverse actions taken  against them. This query enables officials to determine whether physicians  fully disclosed to VA any involvement they might have had in paid medical  malpractice claims. Once a physician\u2019s credentialing information has been  verified, the medical staff specialist sends the information to the  physician\u2019s supervisor, who is known as a clinical service chief.

When deciding to recommend clinical privileges, a clinical service  chief considers whether the physician has the appropriate professional  credentials, training, and work experience to perform the privileges  requested. For reappointment only, a clinical service chief is to consider  observations of the physician\u2019s delivery of health care to veterans, and  VA\u2019s policy requires that information on a physician\u2019s performance, such  as a physician\u2019s surgical complication rate, be used when deciding  whether to renew a physician\u2019s clinical privileges.

A medical facility professional standards board or  the medical executive committee reviews the recommendations of the  clinical service chief and recommends to the facility director whether the  physician should be appointed to the facility\u2019s medical staff and which  clinical privileges should be granted to the physician. The 2-year time  period for renewal of clinical privileges and reappointment to the medical  staff begins on the date that the privileges are approved by the medical  facility\u2019s director.

VA\u2019s policy is based on a federal law that restricts the disclosure  of documents produced in the course of VA\u2019s quality assurance program.  In general, documents created in connection with such a program are  confidential and may not be disclosed except in limited circumstances.  Individuals who willfully disclose documents that they know are protected  quality assurance documents are subject to fines up to $20,000. Although  the law states that it is not intended to limit the use of documents within  VA, VA\u2019s policy expressly prohibits the use of such documents in  connection with the privileging process. VA\u2019s use of separate information  sources for quality assurance and privileging decisions is intended to  maintain the confidential status of documents produced in connection  with quality assurance programs.

The Office of Medical- Legal Affairs is responsible for convening a panel of clinicians to  determine whether a VA facility physician involved in the claim delivered  substandard care. The Office of Medical-Legal Affairs notifies the medical  facility director of the results of its review. If it is determined that the  physician delivered substandard care to veterans, the medical facility must  report the physician to NPDB within 30 days of being notified of the  decision.

However, we found that there  were problems complying with a fifth privileging requirement\u2014to use  information on a physician\u2019s performance in making privileging decisions.  We also found during our review that three of the seven medical facilities  we visited did not submit to VA\u2019s Office of Medical-Legal Affairs  information on paid VA medical malpractice claims within 60 days after  being notified that a claim was paid, as required by VA policy. Further, VA  had not required its medical facilities to establish internal controls to help  ensure that privileging information managed by medical staff specialists is  accurate. Internal controls are important because at one facility we visited  we found 106 physicians whose privileging process had not been  completed by facility officials for at least 2 years because of inaccurate  information. As a result, these physicians were practicing at the facility  with expired clinical privileges. None of the VA medical facilities we  visited for our 2006 report had internal controls in place that would  prevent a similar situation from occurring.

Physician performance information is to be used to  assist VA medical facility clinical service chiefs in determining the  appropriate clinical privileges that should be granted based on a  physician\u2019s clinical competence. VA implemented our recommendation by  issuing a policy on October 2, 2007, that elaborated on the sources of  physician performance information and the types of information that  could be collected outside of VA medical facilities\u2019 quality assurance  programs. In addition, in July 2007, VA officials told us that they were in  the process of implementing online training programs on physician  performance information to help implement our recommendation. The  training will be mandatory for all VA medical facility clinical service chiefs  and medical staff leaders responsible for the assessment and oversight of  the privileging process and must be completed by January 31, 2008.", "VA also implemented our recommendation that it enforce its requirement  that VA medical facilities report information on any paid VA malpractice  claims involving their physicians to VA\u2019s Office of Medical-Legal Affairs  within 60 days after being notified of a paid claim. In June 2006, VA\u2019s  Office of Medical-Legal Affairs began notifying network and VA medical  facility directors of delinquencies in reporting this information by the  medical facilities. If a medical facility\u2019s delinquency in reporting extends  longer than 90 days, VA requires the Office of Medical-Legal Affairs to  inform not only network and VA medical facility directors but also VA\u2019s  central office of the delinquency. Because VA\u2019s Office of Medical-Legal  Affairs reviews information on paid malpractice claims involving VA  physicians to determine whether the physicians delivered substandard  care, when VA medical facilities do not submit relevant malpractice claim  information to this office, medical facility clinical service chiefs may make  privileging decisions without complete information about substandard  care provided by physicians.", "Further, VA implemented our recommendation that it instruct VA medical  facilities to establish internal controls to ensure the accuracy of their  privileging information. Internal controls help ensure that VA medical  facility officials have accurate clinical privileging information and that  physicians are not practicing at the facility with expired clinical privileges.  To address our recommendation, VA first asked network directors to  report on how they tracked the privileging status of VA physicians. In  response to a VA memorandum sent on May 16, 2006, network directors  provided a report indicating that their medical facilities had one or more  mechanisms in place to identify physicians who were currently privileged  at their facilities and to track whether their privileges have expired. In  addition, VA instructed its network directors to monitor the internal  controls at their facilities that ensure that VA medical facilities have  accurate clinical privileging information and that physicians are not  practicing with expired clinical privileges.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes my prepared remarks.
