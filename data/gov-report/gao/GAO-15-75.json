Stakeholders agree to idea: key stakeholders from relevant State  and DOD offices are to gather to discuss whether the project proposal  addresses a high-priority national security interest without duplicating  efforts, the partner nation\u2019s receptivity to the project proposal, and  whether existing State or DOD authorities are available to address the  need.3.

State\u2019s response also noted that this flexibility enables  them to maximize their use of the authority, to include the ability to  provide assistance across ministries in partner nations. In addition, DOD  noted that GSCF guidance addresses general near- to mid-term  conditions that would warrant submission of a project proposal, but that  defining specific time frames would restrict the program\u2019s ability to  develop detailed plans that address emergent needs.", "We understand and agree with the desire for flexibility in the GSCF  program. We initially drafted the recommendation for State and DOD to  clearly define the time frames associated with near- to mid-term GSCF  projects. However, because we agree with State and DOD about the  importance of flexibility, we modified our recommendation to clarify our  intent and specify that State and DOD should define a range of time for  GSCF projects. Defining a range of time for GSCF projects would not limit  the departments\u2019 flexibility for developing detailed plans that address  emergent needs, would still address the need for time frames for GSCF  projects, and would give key stakeholders a clear expectation of how long  GSCF projects should take. As noted in the report, all of the GSCF  projects planned in fiscal year 2012 have experienced delays, and it is  difficult to independently assess the severity of these delays because the  GSCF guidance does not set overall expectations about how long these  projects should take. Moreover, the uncertainty around GSCF time  frames has impacted key stakeholders trying to use the program. As  noted in the report, officials from the three geographic combatant  commands with GSCF projects told us that the uncertain time frames  have inhibited the usefulness of GSCF to date and the lengthy time  frames associated with the program caused them to be reluctant to  propose GSCF projects in the future. Finally, the lack of time frames for  GSCF projects creates financial risks because GSCF funds do not expire  after Congress approves the transfer of funds and initiation of activities.  As noted in the report, funds transferred into the GSCF account remain  available indefinitely. Without defining a range of time for GSCF projects,  State and DOD may lack reasonable assurance that GSCF activities are  conducted and funds expended in a timely manner. Therefore, we believe  that defining a range of time associated with near- to mid-term GSCF  projects is needed so the departments and stakeholders can manage and  assess the program and ensure accountability. Thus, we believe that  State and DOD should fully implement our modified recommendation.", "With respect to the report\u2019s second recommendation, State and DOD  agreed that the departments should track GSCF projects against  established time frames. State and DOD said that the departments plan  to track the projects against the congressional notification timelines and  plan to continue holding biweekly calls with project implementers to  identify and address implementation considerations. However, as noted in  the report, these biweekly calls discuss the status of projects and do not  track the time frame from project proposal to the beginning of project  execution. In its response, State also noted that it does not believe it  would be appropriate to track projects according to the near- to mid-term  time frame that we recommend. However, we continue to believe that  tracking projects against established time frames, as discussed above,  will be crucial for ensuring accountability. Until the departments track  projects against established time frames, they are limited in assessing  whether the program is meeting its goal of providing timely assistance.", "We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, and the  Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
