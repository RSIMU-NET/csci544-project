TRICARE offers three basic options. Beneficiaries who choose TRICARE Prime, an option that uses civilian provider networks, must enroll. TRICARE beneficiaries who do not enroll in this option may obtain care from nonnetwork providers under TRICARE Standard or from network providers under TRICARE Extra. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 directed GAO to evaluate various aspects of beneficiaries' access to care under the TRICARE Standard and Extra options. This report examines (1) impediments to TRICARE Standard and Extra beneficiaries' access to civilian health care and mental health care providers and TMA's actions to address the impediments; (2) TMA's efforts to monitor access to civilian providers for TRICARE Standard and Extra beneficiaries; (3) how TMA informs network and nonnetwork civilian providers about TRICARE Standard and Extra; and (4) how TMA informs TRICARE Standard and Extra beneficiaries about their options. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed and analyzed TMA and TRICARE contractor data and documents. GAO also interviewed TMA officials, including those in its regional offices, as well as its contractors."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Reimbursement rates and provider shortages have been cited as the main impediments that hinder TRICARE Standard and Extra beneficiaries' access to civilian health care and mental health care providers. Providers' concern about TRICARE's reimbursement rates--which are generally set at Medicare rates--has been a long-standing issue and has more recently been cited as the primary reason civilian providers will not accept TRICARE Standard and Extra beneficiaries as patients, according to TMA's surveys of civilian providers. TMA can increase reimbursement rates in certain instances, such as when it determines that access to care is being affected by the level of reimbursement. Shortages of certain provider specialties, such as mental health care providers, at the national and local levels may also impede access, but these shortages are not specific to the TRICARE program and also affect the general population. As a result, there are limitations as to what TMA can do to address them. TMA has primarily used feedback mechanisms, including surveys of beneficiaries and civilian providers, to gauge TRICARE Standard and Extra beneficiaries' access to civilian providers. More recently, in February 2010, in recognition that TRICARE has had no established measures for monitoring the availability of civilian network and nonnetwork providers for these beneficiaries, TMA directed the TRICARE Regional Offices to develop a model to help identify geographic areas where they may experience access problems. GAO's review of the initial models found their methodology to be reasonable. However, because the regional models were recently developed, it is too early to determine their effectiveness. TMA's contractors educate civilian providers about TRICARE program requirements, policies, and procedures. Contractors also conduct outreach to increase providers' awareness of the program, and while TMA's provider survey results indicate that civilian providers are generally aware of the program, this does not necessarily signify that providers have an accurate understanding of the TRICARE program and its options. Similarly, TMA's contractors educate beneficiaries on all of the TRICARE options and maintain directories of network providers to facilitate beneficiaries' access to care. When the new TRICARE contracts are implemented, TMA will also require its contractors to include information on nonnetwork providers in their provider directories. In commenting on a draft of this report, DOD concurred with GAO's overall findings."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal year 2010, the Department of Defense (DOD) offered health care  to almost 9.7 million eligible beneficiaries through its TRICARE program.   Under TRICARE, beneficiaries may choose among three basic options\u2014 TRICARE Prime (a managed care option), TRICARE Extra (a preferred  provider organization option), and TRICARE Standard (a fee-for-service  option). TRICARE is different from other health care plans because not  all of the options require eligible beneficiaries to enroll to use their  benefits. Beneficiaries who choose TRICARE Prime are required to enroll  in this option. Beneficiaries who decide not to use TRICARE Prime may  still obtain health care through the TRICARE program by using either the  TRICARE Standard or Extra options, or they may choose not to use their  TRICARE benefits at all. Consequently, DOD does not have complete  information on which beneficiaries intend to use their benefits, and it  cannot accurately predict the health care demands of beneficiaries who  have not enrolled, including how to ensure adequate access to care.", "Under TRICARE, beneficiaries can obtain care either from providers at  military hospitals and clinics, referred to as military treatment facilities, or  from civilian providers. DOD\u2019s TRICARE Management Activity (TMA),  which oversees the program, contracts with managed care support  contractors (contractors) to develop networks of civilian providers and to  perform other customer service functions, such as processing claims and  assisting beneficiaries with finding providers. Contractors are required to  establish adequate networks of civilian providers to serve all TRICARE  beneficiaries regardless of enrollment status in geographic areas called  Prime Service Areas. Contractors use estimates of the number of  TRICARE users, among other factors, to develop provider networks and  ensure adequate access to care for beneficiaries. Although some network  providers may be located outside of Prime Service Areas, contractors are  not required to develop networks in these areas (which we refer to as non- Prime Service Areas).", "All beneficiaries may obtain care at military treatment facilities, although  priority is given to active duty personnel and then to beneficiaries enrolled  in TRICARE Prime. Beneficiaries who enroll in TRICARE Prime can also  obtain care from the civilian providers who have joined the provider  network established by the TRICARE contractors\u2014referred to as network  providers. Beneficiaries who do not enroll in TRICARE Prime may receive  care either from network providers, in which case they are considered to  be using TRICARE Extra, or from nonnetwork providers (those outside  the network), in which case they are considered to be using TRICARE  Standard. The choices that beneficiaries have in selecting TRICARE  options and providers vary depending on their location. Beneficiaries  living in Prime Service Areas can choose between TRICARE Prime,  TRICARE Standard, and TRICARE Extra. Beneficiaries living in non-Prime  Service Areas can choose between TRICARE Standard and TRICARE  Extra. According to a TMA official, about 19 percent of beneficiaries  eligible for TRICARE Standard and Extra resided in non-Prime Service  Areas in fiscal year 2010.", "Since TRICARE\u2019s inception in 1995, beneficiaries using the TRICARE  Standard and Extra options have reported difficulties finding civilian  providers who will accept them as patients. In response to these concerns,  the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2004  directed DOD to monitor access to care for TRICARE beneficiaries who  were not enrolled in TRICARE Prime through a multiyear survey of  civilian providers. According to TMA, which administered the survey,  results indicated that nationally, about 81 percent of physicians who were  accepting new patients would accept TRICARE beneficiaries as patients,  although the results varied by state and by provider specialty. The act also  directed us to review the processes, procedures, and analysis used by  DOD to determine the adequacy of the number of network and  nonnetwork civilian providers and the actions DOD has taken to ensure  access to care for beneficiaries who were not enrolled in TRICARE Prime.  In December 2006, we reported that TMA and its contractors used various  methods to monitor access to care, and these methods indicated that  access was generally sufficient for users of TRICARE Standard and Extra.", "Nonetheless, beneficiaries using the TRICARE Standard and Extra options  have continued to express concerns about access to civilian providers. To  better understand the adequacy of access to care for this population, the  NDAA for Fiscal Year 2008 directed DOD to conduct two surveys\u2014 another multiyear survey of civilian providers as well as a multiyear survey  of beneficiaries, which includes nonenrolled beneficiaries who were  eligible to use the TRICARE Standard and TRICARE Extra options as well  as TRICARE Reserve Select\u2014an option similar to TRICARE Standard and  Extra that is available to certain members of the Reserves and National  Guard. The NDAA for Fiscal Year 2008 directed us to review these surveys,  and in March 2010, we reported that the methodology for DOD\u2019s surveys of  civilian providers and nonenrolled beneficiaries was sound, and we  provided an analysis of the first year\u2019s results for each of the surveys.", "Furthermore, access to mental health care providers is of particular  concern for all TRICARE beneficiaries, including those who use TRICARE  Standard and Extra, because the exposure to combat and the stress of  deployment and redeployment have increased beneficiaries\u2019 demand for  mental health services. From fiscal year 2006 through 2010, TRICARE  Standard and Extra beneficiaries\u2019 visits to civilian mental health care  providers increased over 27 percent. A June 2007 report by DOD\u2019s Task  Force on Mental Health stated that TRICARE\u2019s provider networks have  been tasked with providing an increasing volume and proportion of mental  health services for families and retirees. In assessing the oversight of the  mental health network at one location, the task force discovered that out  of 100 network mental health providers contacted from a list on the  contractor\u2019s Web site, only 3 would accept new TRICARE patients.", "The NDAA for Fiscal Year 2008 directed us to evaluate issues related to  TRICARE Standard and Extra beneficiaries\u2019 access to health care and  mental health care, including the identification of access impediments and  education and outreach efforts directed at civilian providers and these  beneficiaries. This report identifies and examines: (1) the impediments to  TRICARE Standard and Extra beneficiaries\u2019 access to civilian health care  and mental health care providers and TMA\u2019s actions to address the  impediments; (2) TMA\u2019s efforts to monitor access to civilian providers for  TRICARE Standard and Extra beneficiaries; (3) how TMA informs  network and nonnetwork civilian providers about TRICARE Standard and  Extra; and (4) how TMA informs TRICARE Standard and Extra  beneficiaries about their options and facilitates their access to network  and nonnetwork civilian providers.", "To address these objectives, we met with officials in each of the three  TRICARE Regional Offices (North, South, and West) and with officials for  each of the three contractors to discuss access impediments in their  respective regions, how access to network and nonnetwork providers is  monitored, and their efforts to educate civilian providers and TRICARE  Standard and Extra beneficiaries. We also interviewed TMA officials  responsible for program operations, medical benefits and reimbursement,  contract performance evaluation, contract management, data quality,  communication and customer service, and program analysis and  evaluation. We also obtained documentation on the contractors\u2019  performance in meeting network adequacy and education related  requirements. Lastly, we met with representatives of military beneficiary  organizations as well as two national provider organizations to obtain their  perspectives about access to civilian providers for TRICARE Standard and  Extra beneficiaries.", "To identify and examine impediments to TRICARE Standard and Extra  beneficiaries\u2019 access to civilian health care and mental health care  providers and TMA\u2019s actions to address them, we obtained and reviewed  relevant reports and studies. Specifically, we reviewed TMA\u2019s reported  results from its multiyear survey of civilian providers, conducted from  2005 through 2007, as well as the first 2 years of its subsequent surveys of  these providers during fiscal years 2008 and 2009. We assessed the  reliability of these data by speaking with knowledgeable officials and  reviewing related documentation, and we determined that the survey  results were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report. We also  reviewed a 2008 report prepared by CNA on the current participation of  civilian providers in the TRICARE program. To examine how TMA  addresses access impediments, we reviewed TMA\u2019s reimbursement  policies, studies that assessed TRICARE\u2019s reimbursement rates, TMA\u2019s  procedures for increasing reimbursement rates, and TMA\u2019s procedures for  offering bonus payments to physicians in areas identified as having  physician shortages. We obtained TMA\u2019s reported data on adjustments to  reimbursement rates that it issued between January 2002 and January  2011. However, we did not assess the appropriateness of TMA\u2019s decision  to make these adjustments or the extent to which these adjustments  improved civilian providers\u2019 acceptance of TRICARE beneficiaries as  patients. Additionally, we reviewed DOD\u2019s 2009 Report to Congress:  Access to Mental Health Services, and spoke with TMA and contractor  officials about access to mental health care and actions to improve access.", "To identify and examine the mechanisms that TMA uses to monitor  TRICARE Standard and Extra beneficiaries\u2019 access to civilian providers,  we reviewed various efforts, including feedback mechanisms, that TMA  and its contractors use to solicit and gauge beneficiaries\u2019 concerns,  including difficulties with access to civilian providers. These feedback  mechanisms included TMA\u2019s surveys of civilian providers and nonenrolled  beneficiaries (TRICARE Standard, TRICARE Extra, and TRICARE Reserve  Select), as well as data collected on beneficiaries\u2019 inquiries and complaints  by TMA and its contractors during either fiscal or calendar years 2008  through 2010. We spoke with TMA officials and obtained information from  its contractors about the reliability of their data on beneficiaries\u2019 inquiries  and determined them to be sufficiently reliable for the purpose of our  report, but we did not independently verify these data. We also reviewed  TMA\u2019s 2010 memorandum that directed the TRICARE Regional Offices to  implement a new approach for monitoring access to civilian providers  under the TRICARE Standard and Extra options, and we obtained and  reviewed information about each regional office\u2019s monitoring  methodology.", "To identify and examine how TMA informs network and nonnetwork  civilian providers and beneficiaries about TRICARE Standard and Extra  and how it facilitates access to civilian providers, we reviewed TMA\u2019s  requirements of its contractors as related to educating providers and  beneficiaries in each TRICARE region under the second generation of  TRICARE managed care support contracts (contracts). We also reviewed  each contractor\u2019s marketing and education plans to identify their specific  education efforts. Additionally, we obtained and reviewed TRICARE  provider and beneficiary educational materials to gain an understanding of  the information that TMA and the contractors use to educate providers  and beneficiaries. However, we did not assess the quality and effectiveness  of TMA\u2019s or the contractors\u2019 education efforts and materials. Finally, we  reviewed TMA\u2019s 2010 memorandum and related documentation regarding  TMA\u2019s effort to facilitate access to care through provider directories for  TRICARE Standard and Extra beneficiaries.", "We conducted this performance audit from July 2010 through June 2011 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

For example, in 2006, we reported that both network  and nonnetwork civilian providers said that TRICARE\u2019s reimbursement  rates tended to be lower than those of other health plans, and as a result,  some of these providers had been unwilling to accept TRICARE Standard  and Extra beneficiaries as patients. More recent studies by TMA and  others have cited TRICARE\u2019s reimbursement rates as the primary reason  civilian providers may be unwilling to accept these beneficiaries as  patients, for example:    TMA\u2019s first multiyear survey of civilian providers (2005 through 2007)  showed that TRICARE\u2019s reimbursement rates were the primary reason  cited by providers for not accepting TRICARE Standard and Extra  beneficiaries as new patients.", "Similarly, results from the first 2 years (2008 and 2009) of TMA\u2019s second  multiyear provider survey showed that the responding providers cited  TRICARE\u2019s reimbursement rates as one of the primary reasons that they  would not accept new TRICARE patients even though they would accept  new Medicare patients.", "In a 2008 study on civilian providers\u2019 acceptance of TRICARE Standard  and Extra beneficiaries, CNA reported that the medical society officials  and physicians they interviewed cited low reimbursement as the primary  reason for limiting their acceptance of TRICARE beneficiaries as  patients. The providers who were interviewed as part of this study noted  that while they could accept more TRICARE beneficiaries as patients,  there are services for which the reimbursement was so low that accepting  more TRICARE beneficiaries as patients hurt rather than helped them.", "In addition to these studies, officials from each of the TRICARE Regional  Offices and two of the contractors, as well as a national provider  organization, told us that reimbursement rates were civilian providers\u2019  primary concern about TRICARE.", "Concerns about TRICARE\u2019s reimbursement rates\u2014which generally mirror  the Medicare program\u2019s physician fee schedule\u2014have increased by the  uncertainty surrounding the annual update to these Medicare fees. All of  the contractors expressed concerns about the proposed decreases to  Medicare rates and how that would affect providers\u2019 acceptance of  TRICARE patients. One contractor told us that providers already were  expressing concerns about the Medicare rate decreases and that some  providers said they would no longer accept TRICARE beneficiaries as  patients if the rates were reduced. Furthermore, as of September 2010, this  contractor noted that one provider had stopped accepting TRICARE  beneficiaries as patients because of concerns about potential Medicare  reimbursement reductions.", "TMA has the authority to adjust TRICARE reimbursement rates under  certain conditions to increase beneficiaries\u2019 access to civilian providers,  and has done so in some instances. In response to various concerns about  providers\u2019 willingness to accept TRICARE patients, TMA contracted with a  consulting firm to conduct a number of studies about TRICARE  reimbursement rates, and some of these studies have resulted in increases  to reimbursement amounts for certain procedures. (See app. II for a  summary of the studies.) For example, in response to civilian obstetric  providers\u2019 concerns about TRICARE reimbursement rates, TMA  conducted an analysis of historical TRICARE claims data and made  nationwide changes to its physician payment rates for obstetric care in  2006. These changes included an additional payment for ultrasounds for  uncomplicated pregnancies that is likely to result in overall higher  payments for civilian physicians who perform one or more ultrasounds  during the course of pregnancy.", "TMA also has the authority to adjust reimbursement rates through the use  of waivers in areas where it determines that the rates have had a negative  impact on TRICARE beneficiaries\u2019 access to civilian providers. TMA can  issue three types of reimbursement waivers, depending on the type of  adjustment that is needed:    Locality waivers may be used to increase rates for specific medical  services in specific areas where access to civilian providers has been  severely impaired and are applicable to both network and nonnetwork  providers.", "Network waivers may be used to increase reimbursement rates for  network providers up to 15 percent above the TRICARE reimbursement  rate in an effort to ensure an adequate number and mix of primary and  specialty care network civilian providers in a specific location.", "TMA can restore TRICARE reimbursement rates in specific localities to  the levels that existed before a reduction was made to align TRICARE  reimbursement rates with Medicare rates for both network and  nonnetwork providers.", "Waivers can be requested by providers, beneficiaries, contractors, military  treatment facilities, or TRICARE Regional Office directors, although all  requests must be submitted through the TRICARE Regional Office  directors.

Ultimately, the TRICARE  Regional Office director reviews and analyzes the requests. If the  TRICARE Regional Office director agrees with the request, they make a  recommendation to the Director of TMA that the waiver request be  approved.

Under Medicare, providers who provide  services to beneficiaries located in Health Professional Shortage Areas\u2014 geographic areas that the Department of Health and Human Services has  identified as having shortages of primary health, dental, or mental health  care providers\u2014receive 10 percent bonus payments.

However,  TMA officials noted that some providers may not be receiving this bonus  because they do not include the specific code on their claims. TMA  officials noted the process will become easier once the third generation of  managed care support contracts is implemented. Once this occurs, the  contractors will rely on the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services\u2019  public database of zip codes to determine a provider\u2019s eligibility for these  bonus payments instead of requiring the provider to include a code on  each claim.

This can be frustrating for TRICARE beneficiaries who seek mental health  care only to discover that providers cannot relate to their specific  concerns.", "Over the years, Congress has required DOD to report on TRICARE  beneficiaries\u2019 access to mental health care providers. Specifically, the  NDAA for Fiscal Year 2008 required DOD to report on the adequacy of  access to mental health services under the TRICARE program. In 2009,  DOD reported that it believed access to mental health care providers for  TRICARE beneficiaries was adequate due to a dramatic increase in both  inpatient and outpatient mental health care provided in 2008. DOD also  cited increases in the numbers of mental health providers from May 2007  to May 2009 in both the direct care system of military treatment facilities  (1,952) and in the civilian provider network (10,220), while acknowledging  that there may still be some areas where access to mental health care  providers is inadequate. However, in the same report, DOD noted that  TRICARE Standard and Extra beneficiaries reported more problems  finding civilian mental health care providers than beneficiaries who use  other health care coverage, and that psychiatrists have the lowest  acceptance rates of new TRICARE Standard and Extra beneficiaries  compared with other providers.", "In its 2009 Access to Mental Health Services report, DOD noted that two  reasons most cited by civilian mental health providers, including  psychiatrists, for not accepting new TRICARE patients were \u201cnot aware of  TRICARE\u201d and \u201creimbursement.\u201d DOD also reported that TMA would  increase outreach to mental health providers in selected locations to  improve awareness of the program. In addition to the increased outreach,  DOD also reported two initiatives designed to enhance beneficiaries\u2019  access to mental health care\u2014the Telemental Health Program and the  TRICARE Assistance Program. The Telemental Health Program connects  TRICARE beneficiaries in one office to civilian mental health providers in  another medical office through an audiovisual link. The TRICARE  Assistance Program is a Web-based program that enables certain  beneficiaries to contact licensed civilian counselors 24 hours a day for  short-term, nonmedical issues. Also, in recognition that mental health is  an issue of concern for its beneficiaries, each of the TRICARE Regional  Offices and contractors has established staff positions that focus  specifically on mental health issues, including access to care.", "More recently, the NDAA for fiscal year 2010 required DOD to report on  the appropriate number of personnel to meet the mental health care needs  of servicemembers, retired members, and dependents and to develop and  implement a plan to significantly increase the number of DOD military and  civilian mental health personnel, among other requirements. In response  to this requirement, DOD reported in February 2011 that it has identified  criteria for the military services to use in determining the appropriate  number of mental health personnel needed to meet the needs of their  beneficiaries. However, DOD also noted that the military services are still  testing and validating these criteria to determine how effective they would  be in gauging adequate mental health staffing numbers. Therefore,  although DOD reported increases in the number of mental health  providers employed at military treatment facilities or contracted to join  TRICARE\u2019s network of providers, it did not specifically estimate the  appropriate number of mental health care providers needed. DOD also  reported that initiatives are under way to increase the number of mental  health providers in military treatment facilities, including increasing the  number of Public Health Service providers serving in military treatment  facilities as well as recruitment and retention incentives. These initiatives,  if successfully implemented, could reduce the demand for civilian mental  health providers in those locations."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Although TMA Has Typically Used Feedback Mechanisms to Gauge TRICARE Standard and Extra Beneficiaries\u2019 Access to Civilian Providers, It Is Developing a New Method for Monitoring Access", "paragraphs": ["TMA and its contractors have used various feedback mechanisms, such as  surveys, to gauge beneficiaries\u2019 access to care under TRICARE Standard  and Extra.

Additionally, TMA and its  contractors use feedback from beneficiaries\u2019 inquiries and complaints to  help identify problems with access, among other issues.", "In fiscal year 2005, TMA implemented its first multiyear survey of civilian  providers (network and nonnetwork) as required by the NDAA 2004.  TMA\u2019s survey was supposed to assess beneficiaries\u2019 access to civilian  providers under the TRICARE Standard and Extra options by determining  whether civilian providers would accept these beneficiaries as new  patients. In 2006, we reported on TMA\u2019s survey methodology, among other  issues, and reported that it was sound and statistically valid. TMA\u2019s results  for this first multiyear survey of civilian providers, which was fielded  through 2007, showed that about 8 of 10 physicians and behavioral health  providers accepted TRICARE beneficiaries as new patients, if they  accepted any patients at all. However, while these results appear  favorable, as we reported in 2006, there is no benchmark with which to  compare them.", "Subsequently, the NDAA 2008 required TMA to conduct two multiyear  surveys\u2014one of civilian providers and one of nonenrolled beneficiaries\u2014 to determine the adequacy of access to health care and mental health care  for these beneficiaries. In March 2010, we reported that the methodology  for both of TMA\u2019s surveys was sound and generally addressed the  methodological requirements outlined in the law. TMA has completed the  first 2 years (2008 and 2009) of these surveys.", "TMA and its contractors also use feedback collected from beneficiaries\u2019  inquiries and complaints to identify and gauge potential problem areas,  including issues with access to care. However, this type of feedback is not  representative because not every beneficiary who has a question or  complaint will contact TMA or its contractors. TMA uses its Assistance  Reporting Tool to collect and analyze information on the beneficiary  inquiries that it receives, including inquiries on access to care from  beneficiaries who use TRICARE Standard and Extra. During fiscal years  2008 through 2010, data from the Assistance Reporting Tool showed that  only about 5 percent of closed cases on all TRICARE-related beneficiary  inquiries and complaints were from TRICARE Standard and Extra  beneficiaries. Further, of the total inquiries and complaints received from  these beneficiaries, TMA reported that 313 cases were access-to-care  related (2 percent).", "The contractors separately receive feedback from beneficiaries through  some or all of the following methods: (1) telephone, (2) e-mail, (3) in- person at a TRICARE Service Center, or (4) in writing. Each contractor  collects and reports information on their beneficiary feedback differently.  In reviewing contractors\u2019 data on beneficiary inquiries or complaints  received, we found:    During fiscal year 2009, TMA\u2019s contractor in the North region reported  receiving 11,176 (less than 1 percent) access-to-care inquiries out of a total  of more than 5 million inquiries.

While access to  care did not represent a top reason for their complaints in 2009, this  contractor reported that 15 of the complaints received were related to  beneficiary appointment and wait times. This contractor also reported that  it received a total of 7,927 complaints in calendar year 2010.

(The new approach will  also apply to beneficiaries using the TRICARE Reserve Select option.) In  recognition that the military health system had no established measures  for determining the adequacy of network and nonnetwork providers for  these beneficiaries, in February 2010, TMA\u2019s Office of Policy and  Operations directed the TRICARE Regional Offices to develop a model to  identify geographic areas where they may experience access problems as  well as areas of provider shortages for the general population. The model  is intended to help the TRICARE Regional Offices and their contractors  identify geographic areas where additional efforts to increase access to  civilian providers may be warranted.", "To implement this approach, TMA recommended that each regional office  adapt and standardize the model that had originally been developed by its  West regional office in 2008. This model applies a specific provider-to- beneficiary ratio based on the Graduate Medical Education National  Advisory Committee\u2019s recommended standards for health care services  to different provider specialties to determine whether there are sufficient  numbers and types of providers for the nonenrolled beneficiary population  in certain locations. To identify locations for analysis, West regional office  officials used zip codes to identify locations with populations of 500 or  more nonenrolled beneficiaries. According to officials in the West regional  office, they then identified the network and nonnetwork providers who  practiced and had previously accepted a TRICARE patient in these same  locations and applied a specific provider-to-beneficiary ratio against each  provider specialty included in the model for the locations assessed. Each  regional office has developed a model that generally follows the same  methodology and includes similar data as the West regional office\u2019s model,  although variations exist. For example, while one regional office includes  provider data that represents 15 provider specialties, another regional  office includes 40 provider specialties in its model. Officials at one  regional office told us they have plans to update their model to reflect  changes in the beneficiary population, and an official at another regional  office said that staff were already in the process of updating their model,  which may include additional provider demographic factors.", "TMA directed each TRICARE Regional Office to apply the model at least  semiannually beginning on May 1, 2010. According to officials in TMA\u2019s  South region, they plan to apply the model semi-annually as directed while  TMA\u2019s regional offices in the North and West apply the model as needed.  More specifically, since TMA\u2019s office in the North region implemented the  model, it has assessed 20 locations, and now applies the model as needed  in response to specific concerns. Meanwhile, officials from TMA\u2019s office in  the West region told us that they initially applied the model to over 50  locations and that they now apply the model as needed, such as in  response to a specific inquiry about access to care in a particular location.  Officials in the North regional office noted that their model\u2019s data are used  in conjunction with other indicators to assess if further analysis of civilian  provider availability is needed. Officials in the West region said that they  plan to reach out to providers in the community or use the contractor to  help recruit additional providers to the TRICARE network if the model  identifies an area that is short of their targeted number of providers in a  given specialty.", "Based on our review of each regional office\u2019s initial approach, we found  this methodology to be reasonable. However, because the regional models  were recently developed, it is too early to determine their effectiveness.  And, while the regional offices provided us with examples of their models,  they did not provide documentation of how they applied a provider-to- beneficiary ratio as criteria to determine the adequacy of access in these  locations or any documentation of their results, although they told us that  they did not identify any access problems."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "TMA\u2019s Contractors Educate Civilian Providers about TRICARE and Surveys Indicate That Providers Are Generally Aware of the Program", "paragraphs": ["TMA\u2019s contractors educate civilian providers about TRICARE program  requirements, policies, and procedures.

These efforts vary because  contractors have some flexibility in how they achieve outcomes and  because the contractors may include additional performance standards in  their contracts. Under the second generation of TRICARE contracts,  contractors have added performance standards related to provider  education. For example, one contractor must visit high-volume network  and nonnetwork providers in its region annually, while another contractor  must conduct annual seminars for the network and nonnetwork providers  in its Prime Service Areas.

For example, one  contractor used its Twitter account to provide a link to information on  how to become a network or TRICARE-authorized provider in its region.

For  example, representatives of an association representing current and  former servicemembers told us that providers do not always understand  the differences between the TRICARE Standard and TRICARE Prime  options. Similarly, in a November 2008 report, CNA stated that the  providers they interviewed were often confused about the differences  between TRICARE Standard and TRICARE Prime. One provider, a  former president of a local medical society, said many providers are under  the misconception that TRICARE Standard is the same as TRICARE Prime  and that when providers have had bad experiences with TRICARE Prime,  which generally pays network providers less than Medicare, they end up  refusing to accept any TRICARE patients because they \u201cdon\u2019t want to deal  with\u201d a health maintenance organization.

This  electronic newsletter included articles on topics such as how beneficiaries  may save money by using TRICARE Extra and how they can stay informed  about TRICARE. Two of the contractors told us that it is difficult to  communicate with TRICARE Standard and Extra beneficiaries because  they do not necessarily have ready access to the beneficiaries\u2019 residential  or e-mail addresses as these beneficiaries are not required to enroll. This  lack of information can make communicating with these beneficiaries  challenging, and as a result, TRICARE Standard and Extra beneficiaries  may not receive all the available information on their TRICARE benefit.

The study also  noted that some pediatricians may pay more than the average acquisition  price, and some network pediatricians may receive TRICARE  reimbursement rates below the average acquisition cost if they have  agreed to reimbursement discounts as a condition of belonging to the  TRICARE provider network. The study also compared TRICARE\u2019s  reimbursement rates to those of Medicare and Medicaid. The study noted  that TRICARE uses the same vaccine prices and administration prices as  Medicare for vaccine codes for which Medicare sets a price (which is  mostly at 106 percent of the average sales price of the vaccine as of 2005\u2014 determined by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services). For those  vaccines for which Medicare does not have a set price, TRICARE  reimbursement rates are set at 95 percent of average wholesale price\u2014 which is essentially a \u201clist price\u201d set by the manufacturer. When compared  to Medicaid\u2019s rates, TRICARE\u2019s reimbursement rate for the administration  of a vaccine or immunization was higher than Medicaid\u2019s in every state in  2008.", "Analysis of TRICARE Payment Rates for Maternity/Delivery  Services, Evaluation and Management Services, and Pediatric  Immunizations, March 2006  TMA\u2019s consultant compared TRICARE\u2019s reimbursement rates for 14  specific maternity/delivery services and a pediatrician office visit with  Medicaid and commercial payment rates. It found the following:    For these specific maternity/delivery services, TRICARE\u2019s reimbursement  rates were higher than Medicaid rates in 35 of the 45 states reviewed.  Additionally, in 27 of the 35 states, the Medicaid payment rate for  deliveries was less than 90 percent of TRICARE\u2019s reimbursement rates.  TRICARE\u2019s reimbursement rates for deliveries were less than the median  commercial rates in all but one of the 50 markets studied (they were  equivalent in the remaining market). Overall, the median commercial rates  for deliveries were 24 percent higher than TRICARE\u2019s reimbursement  rates in 2005.", "For pediatric care, TRICARE\u2019s reimbursement rate for a mid-level office  visit for an established patient (the most commonly billed code by  pediatricians) was higher than the state Medicaid reimbursement rate in 41  of the 45 states in 2005. However, the median commercial reimbursement  rates were 10 percent higher than TRICARE\u2019s reimbursement rates in the  50 TRICARE markets examined.", "TRICARE\u2019s reimbursement for pediatric vaccines and injectable drugs  generally appeared to be reasonable when derived from Medicare pricing,  based on an analysis of private sector costs, average wholesale prices, and  average sales prices for top volume CPT codes. However, TRICARE\u2019s  reimbursement rate for the pediatric and adolescent dose of the hepatitis  A vaccine was found to be 22 percent lower than estimated private sector  costs to obtain the vaccine in 2005. Specifically, the TRICARE  reimbursement rate for this vaccine dose was $22.64, while pediatricians  were paying between $27.41 and $30.37 for the vaccine. Based on the  results of this study, TMA used its general authority to deviate from  Medicare rates (upon which TRICARE rates are based), and starting May  1, 2006, TMA instructed the contractors to reimburse pediatric hepatitis A  vaccines nationally at a new reimbursement rate of $30.40."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: TMA\u2019s Use of Waivers", "paragraphs": ["TMA has the authority to increase TRICARE reimbursement rates for  network and nonnetwork civilian providers to ensure that all beneficiaries,  including TRICARE Standard and Extra beneficiaries, have adequate  access to civilian providers.

The resulting rate increase would be applied to both  network and nonnetwork civilian providers for the medical services  identified in the areas where access is impaired.

On two occasions previously,  TMA has used this authority in Alaska to encourage both network and  nonnetwork civilian providers to accept TRICARE beneficiaries as  patients in an effort to ensure adequate access to care. In 2000, TMA used  this waiver authority to uniformly increase reimbursement rates for  network and nonnetwork civilian providers in rural Alaska, and in 2002,  TMA implemented this same waiver for network and nonnetwork civilian  providers in Anchorage. However, in 2007 TMA implemented a  demonstration project in Alaska that increased reimbursement rates to  match those of the Department of Veterans Affairs.

In 2010, the Department of Health and  Human Services reported that about 14 percent of the population in Alaska  had received health care from either DOD\u2019s TRICARE program or from the  Veterans Health Administration. According to a 2009 study by the Alaska  Center for Rural Health, Alaska has a shortage of providers that has been  further impacted by its remoteness, harsh climate, and scarce training  resources. Workforce shortages in urban areas range from a complete  lack of certain specialists in Fairbanks and other towns, to a relative  shortage of primary care providers and many specialists in Anchorage.  Moreover, rural areas have far more difficulty attracting qualified  candidates than more heavily populated areas, such as Anchorage or  Fairbanks. TRICARE officials have identified this overall shortage of  providers and providers\u2019 reluctance to accept TRICARE reimbursement  rates as the main impediments to TRICARE beneficiaries\u2019 access to  civilian providers in Alaska\u2014regardless of which option they use.", "Alaska is part of TRICARE\u2019s West region, and until recently, Alaska was  the only state for which TMA administered and managed TRICARE  directly as well as being the only state that did not have Prime Service  Areas with networks of civilian providers. In a November 2010 Federal  Register notice, DOD announced that the responsibility for administering  and managing TRICARE in Alaska would transfer from TMA to the  contractor for the West region. Additionally, the notice required the  contractor to develop networks of civilian providers in two Prime Service  Areas to be established around the military treatment facilities located at  Fort Wainwright and Eielson Air Force Base, near Fairbanks, Alaska. This  transition of responsibility took place in January 2011, and TMA expects  these Prime Service Areas to be developed by July 2011. Additionally, the  West region contractor noted that it expects to receive authorization to  develop a third Prime Service Area around Elmendorf Air Force Base in  Anchorage in late summer 2011.", "TMA has taken actions to address TRICARE beneficiaries\u2019 access to  civilian providers in Alaska by (1) increasing TRICARE\u2019s reimbursement  rates through the use of waivers and a demonstration project and   (2) participating in a federal task force on the delivery of health care in  Alaska. Specifically, in areas where access is impaired, TMA has increased  reimbursement rates to encourage civilian providers to accept TRICARE  beneficiaries through TMA\u2019s reimbursement waivers. Of the 24 waivers in  place as of January 2011, 13 are for locations in Alaska.", "In addition, TMA began a demonstration project in Alaska in February  2007\u2014originally expected to end in December 2009\u2014that raised  reimbursement rates for physicians and other noninstitutional  professional providers so that on average, they matched those of the  Department of Veterans Affairs. Specifically, TRICARE\u2019s 2007  reimbursement rates were increased approximately 35 percent. In July  2009, TMA conducted a preliminary assessment of the demonstration  project and found mixed results. Specifically, TMA\u2019s analysis determined  that three of seven measures of access to care indicated that access had  improved since the beginning of the project, while the other four measures  did not show an improvement in access. Despite this inconclusive  assessment, TMA officials in the West region said that the demonstration  project and the use of waivers have increased access to care, as the  number of providers accepting TRICARE\u2019s reimbursement rates increased.  According to these officials, the number of providers that have accepted  TRICARE\u2019s reimbursement rate went from under 300 before the  demonstration project to almost 800, as of July 2010.

In  September 2010, the Task Force issued its report recommending that,  among other things, federal agencies providing health care reimbursement  in Alaska should support current projects to develop a budget-neutral,  uniform provider reimbursement rate for similar services for Medicare,  TRICARE, and the Veterans Health Administration.
