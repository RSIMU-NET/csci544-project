For example, in April 2016, HHS designated an autism coordinator to oversee national autism research, services, and support activities. In 2013, GAO reported that there was limited coordination among agencies. This was especially concerning because GAO also found that 11 federal agencies funded autism research in the same areas\u2014resulting in the potential for unnecessary duplication.

Information on CDC\u2019s website states that autism can sometimes  be detected at 18 months or younger, and a diagnosis by an experienced  professional can be considered very reliable at age 2. The Autism  Collaboration, Accountability, Research, Education, and Support Act of  2014 (Autism CARES Act) continues ongoing federal activities related to  autism, including research and health care provider training. A  congressional committee report accompanying the Autism CARES Act  strongly encourages federal agencies to focus on early diagnosis and  intervention in children ages 5 or younger when implementing the  programs and research initiatives authorized by the act. States also play  a role in early diagnosis and intervention through the federal education  and health care programs that they administer.

These research objectives are  found in the strategic plan published by the Interagency Autism  Coordinating Committee (IACC)\u2014a federal advisory committee charged  with monitoring and coordinating federal autism research. To enhance  coordination and monitoring of federal autism activities, we recommended  that HHS take specific actions to improve the usefulness of the data it  collects on these activities.

For federal education programs, we reviewed documentation  on early intervention programs and special education programs that  provide services to children with special needs, including autism, under  the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), as amended. We  also interviewed officials from the Department of Education (Education),  the agency that oversees the administration of IDEA programs. To learn  how children with autism are served through these two IDEA programs,  we collected documentation and interviewed officials responsible for  administering the programs at the state level, as well as officials from  DOD, which administers the IDEA programs for children of  servicemembers that are served by DOD schools. We selected a non- probability sample of five states\u2014California, Massachusetts, North  Carolina, Ohio, and Texas\u2014to include in our review. We selected states  that represented different geographic regions of the United States and  that served a large number of children in their early intervention and  special education programs. Two states\u2014California and Texas\u2014were  selected because they are large states, and perhaps consequently, the  number of children identified with autism served in their special education  programs was especially large when compared to other states based on  state data reported to Education. The remaining three states\u2014 Massachusetts, North Carolina, and Ohio\u2014were selected because they  were conducting autism-specific activities aimed at young children. Our  findings for these five states are not generalizable to other states; further,  due to our selection criteria, the states in our review may be conducting  more autism-specific activities than other states across the country.  Lastly, we reviewed Education data on the number of children ages 3 to 5  in the disability category of autism that were served in states\u2019 special  education programs in school year 2014-2015. To assess the reliability of  these data, we reviewed documentation from Education on the  completeness, accuracy, and limitations of these data, as well as  interviewed Education officials.

Specifically,  we examined military treatment facility and purchased care claims data  from fiscal year 2014. For both datasets, we analyzed children ages 1  through 5 whose claims indicated they had an autism diagnosis. We  analyzed the intervention services these children received by age using a  set of procedure codes we selected based on interviews we held with  professional associations involved in providing interventions to children  with autism, among other information. To assess the reliability and  usability of the claims data for our purposes, we reviewed related  documentation, such as studies that assessed the reliability of the data,  interviewed knowledgeable CMS and DOD officials, and performed  checks of the data for consistency and completeness.

During developmental screening, a doctor might  ask the parent some questions or talk and play with the child to observe  whether the child plays, learns, speaks, acts, and moves as expected. A  delay in any of these areas could be a sign of a problem. The American  Academy of Pediatrics recommends that all children be screened for  developmental delays and disabilities during regular well-child doctor  visits and specifically for autism at 18 and 24 months. If a doctor identifies  any signs of a problem, a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation, which  provides a thorough review that may include looking at the child\u2019s  behavior and development, should be performed and parents interviewed.

Speech and language  therapy can help improve a child\u2019s communication skills, such as verbal  skills or gestures. There are many types of behavioral therapies used to  treat children diagnosed with autism. For example, applied behavior  analysis (ABA) is a commonly used framework to provide intervention  services to children with autism.

Further, while we  appreciate HHS\u2019s comment that it is taking steps to avoid clear and  obvious unnecessary duplication, this is not sufficient given the  substantial federal investment in this area. From fiscal years 2008  through 2012, agencies awarded funds of about $1.2 billion for autism  research, and many funded research in the same areas. Autism is an  important and complex public health concern affecting a large number of  individuals, which makes it all the more important that scarce federal  resources be used efficiently and strategically. Prudent stewardship  requires a careful assessment and coordinated effort to look for  unnecessary duplication that may be less than obvious.", "Lastly, HHS stated that our draft report was incorrect in stating that the  Web Tool was the primary tool by which potentially duplicative autism  research is to be identified. The department stated that IMPAC II  database is used by NIH program officers when evaluating research grant  applications. Our draft report did not state that the Web Tool was the  primary tool used to identify potentially duplicative autism research;  however, we revised the report to clarify information presented on the  Web Tool.", "In its comments, Education also stated that the draft report properly  acknowledged the health care and educational programs that provide  intervention services to young children with autism. Further, the  department stated that it stands ready to work with HHS as HHS  implements the Autism CARES Act and that a significant body of  research is still needed to better understand and address the  developmental academic needs of students with autism, especially given  the great variations across the autism spectrum and the range of student  learning needs.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.

More specifically, to do this  we analyzed fiscal year 2013 fee-for-service claims and managed care  encounter data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services\u2019  (CMS) Medicaid and Statistical Information System (MSIS) for five select  states. We also analyzed fiscal year 2014 Department of Defense (DOD)  TRICARE military treatment facility and purchased care claims data. At  the time we began our review, these were the most recent fiscal years for  which CMS\u2019s and DOD\u2019s data were available. Our analysis consisted of  the following three steps: (1) state selection for CMS data, as well as  assessing data reliability for both our selected states\u2019 and DOD\u2019s data; (2)  identification of children with autism; and (3) identification of intervention  services for children with autism.

Specifically, at the time we began our review, there were 35 states  that had validated fiscal year 2013 MSIS data from which we could  choose. To determine which of these 35 states to include in our review,  we reviewed reports with information on states use of managed care  organizations and the completeness and reliability of states\u2019 managed  care encounter data in MSIS. Similarly, we reviewed reports on states\u2019  use of behavioral health organizations to provide certain services\u2014since  those organizations may be used to provide some of the intervention  services included in our review\u2014and the extent to which states\u2019 data in  MSIS on services provided by behavioral health organizations is reliable  and complete.

Therefore, we developed a list of procedure codes that could  closely reflect the provision of intervention services to young children with  autism. To do this, we took the following four steps.  1.  We reviewed documentation and interviewed federal agency officials,  as well as officials from non-federal entities, such as the American  Academy of Pediatrics, to gather general information on typical  interventions for young children with autism.  2.  We identified the procedure codes found on claims with an autism  diagnosis code in our dataset and examined the definitions of these  codes.  3.  We discussed procedure codes relevant to providing interventions to  children with autism with representatives from the following seven  professional associations: American Academy of Child & Adolescent  Psychiatry; American Physical Therapy Association; American  Occupational Therapy Association; American Psychiatric Association;  American Psychological Association; American Speech, Hearing, and  Language Association; and Association of Professional Behavioral  Analysts.  4.  In recognition of variations in the practice of medicine across  geographic regions, we gathered information from all five selected  states about their use of certain procedure codes to determine if the  use of these codes typically reflected the delivery of an intervention  service for autism in their respective states.", "Based on the information gathered, we identified a list of procedure codes  that appeared to reflect common autism-related interventions. The  intervention services in our review also include related diagnostic or  evaluation services. When generating the list of procedure codes, it was  not possible for us to parse out intervention services from assessment- type services because, in general, an assessment is needed in order to  determine the best intervention approach and to adjust that approach  over time. Further, we heard from the association officials we interviewed  that providers are frequently assessing at the same time they are  providing an intervention.", "For reporting purposes, we categorized the procedure codes we identified  into five broad categories.  1.  Behavioral, which includes psychiatry services, health and behavioral  assessments and intervention services, and applied behavior  analysis.  2.  Evaluation and management, which includes central nervous  system tests, office or other outpatient visits or consultations, and  medical team conferences to diagnose and develop intervention  strategies.  3.  Home care and skills training, which includes teaching skills to the  child and the child\u2019s family to promote the child\u2019s development and  independent living.  4.  Physical and occupational therapy, which includes the provision of  therapies to, for example, teach a child how to develop movements  involved with walking, eating, or communicating.  5.  Speech, language, and audiology, which includes evaluation and  treatment of speech, language, voice, communication, and auditory  processing.", "To the extent possible, we based our categorization on the American  Medical Association\u2019s Current Procedural Terminology codebook,  although our categories are broader than those found in this codebook.  We asked experts from each of the seven professional associations to  comment on our categorization. We received responses from five of the  seven associations. Three of the five associations\u2014American Academy  of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry, American Physical Therapy Association  and Association of Professional Behavioral Analysts\u2014agreed with our  categorization. The other two\u2014American Occupational Therapy  Association, and American Speech-Hearing-Language Association\u2014were  concerned that putting a procedure code in the \u201cbehavioral\u201d category, for  example, might imply that the code cannot appropriately be used by  professionals, such as speech and language pathologists or occupational  therapists. This is not the intention of our categorization, nor should our  categories be considered as billing advice to be associated with or used  for billing purposes. In fact, we found that four of the seven associations  stated that their professionals used codes that fall within our \u201cbehavioral\u201d  category, and five of the seven used codes that fall with our \u201cevaluation  and management\u201d category, among others.

Based on our methodology, we  believe the list of procedure codes is appropriate and fairly represents  interventions provided to children with autism. Because we included all  claims of children identified with autism (with relevant procedure codes)  due to the potential for inconsistency in the diagnosis codes included on a  claim, some of the services in our review may not have been provided for,  or relate to, the treatment of autism.
