Questions have been raised about the focus of RA reviews because of the incentives associated with the contingency fees.", "GAO was asked to examine the review activities of the different Medicare claim review contractors. This report examines (1) differences between prepayment and postpayment reviews and the extent to which contractors use them; (2) the extent to which the claim review contractors focus their reviews on different types of claims; and (3) CMS's cost per review and amount of improper payments identified by the claim review contractors per dollar paid by CMS. GAO reviewed CMS documents; analyzed CMS and contractor claim review and funding data for 2013 and 2014; interviewed CMS officials, claim review contractors, and health care provider organizations; and assessed CMS's oversight against federal internal control standards."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) uses different types of contractors to conduct prepayment and postpayment reviews of Medicare fee-for-service claims at high risk for improper payments. Medicare Administrative Contractors (MAC) conduct prepayment and postpayment reviews; Recovery Auditors (RA) generally conduct postpayment reviews; and the Supplemental Medical Review Contractor (SMRC) conducts postpayment reviews as part of studies directed by CMS. CMS, its contractors, and provider organizations identified few significant differences between conducting and responding to prepayment and postpayment reviews. Using prepayment reviews to deny improper claims and prevent overpayments is consistent with CMS's goal to pay claims correctly the first time and can better protect Medicare funds because not all overpayments can be collected. In 2013 and 2014, 98 percent of MAC claim reviews were prepayment, and 85 percent of RA claim reviews and 100 percent of SMRC reviews were postpayment. Because CMS is required by law to pay RAs contingency fees from recovered overpayments, the RAs can only conduct prepayment reviews under a demonstration. From 2012 through 2014, CMS conducted a demonstration in which the RAs conducted prepayment reviews and were paid contingency fees based on claim denial amounts. CMS officials considered the demonstration a success. However, CMS has not requested legislation that would allow for RA prepayment reviews by amending existing payment requirements and thus may be missing an opportunity to better protect Medicare funds.", "The contractors focused their reviews on different types of claims. In 2013 and 2014, the RAs focused their reviews on inpatient claims, which represented about 30 percent of Medicare improper payments. In 2013 and 2014, inpatient claim reviews accounted for 78 and 47 percent, respectively, of all RA claim reviews. Inpatient claims had high average identified improper payment amounts, reflecting the costs of the services. The RAs' focus on inpatient claims was consistent with the financial incentives from their contingency fees, which are based on the amount of identified overpayments, but the focus was not consistent with CMS's expectations that RAs review all claim types. CMS has since taken steps to limit the RAs' focus on inpatient claims and broaden the types of claims being reviewed. The MACs focused their reviews on physician and durable medical equipment claims, the latter of which had the highest rate of improper payments. The focus of the SMRC's claim reviews varied.", "In 2013 and 2014, the RAs had an average cost per review to CMS of $158 and identified $14 in improper payments per dollar paid by CMS to the RAs. The SMRC had an average cost per review of $256 and identified $7 in improper payments per dollar paid by CMS. GAO was unable to determine the cost per review and amount of improper payments identified by the MACs per dollar paid by CMS because of unreliable data on costs and claim review savings. Inconsistent with federal internal control standards, CMS has not provided written guidance on how the MACs should calculate savings from prepayment reviews. Without reliable savings data, CMS does not have the information it needs to evaluate the MACs' performance and cost effectiveness in preventing improper payments, and CMS cannot compare performance across contractors."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that CMS (1) request legislation to allow the RAs to conduct prepayment claim reviews, and (2) provide written guidance on calculating savings from prepayment reviews.

Our  analysis found that RA claim reviews for inpatient services had higher  average identified improper payment amounts per postpayment claim  review relative to other claim types in 2013 and 2014 (see Table 4). For  example, in 2013, the RAs identified about 10 times the amount per  postpayment claim review for inpatient claims compared to claim reviews  for physicians.", "Although CMS expects the RAs to review all claim types, CMS\u2019s oversight  of the RAs did not ensure that the RAs distributed their reviews across  claim types in 2013 and 2014. According to CMS officials, the agency\u2019s  approval of RA audit issues is the primary way in which CMS controls the  type of claims that the RAs review. However, the officials said they  generally focus on the appropriateness of the review methodology when  determining whether to approve the audit issues, instead of on whether  the RA\u2019s claim review strategy encompasses all claim types. The RAs  generally determine the types of audit issues that they present to CMS for  approval, and based on our analysis of RA audit issues data, we found  that from the inception of the RA program to May 2015, 80 percent of the  audit issues approved by CMS were for inpatient claims. Additionally,  CMS generally gives RAs discretion regarding the claims that they select  for review among approved audit issues.", "Effective October 1, 2013, CMS changed the coverage requirements for short inpatient  hospital stays. As a result, CMS prohibited RA claim reviews related to the  appropriateness of inpatient admissions for claims with dates of admission between  October 1, 2013 and September 30, 2014. In April 2014 and April 2015, Congress  enacted legislation directing CMS to continue the prohibition of RA claim reviews related  to the appropriateness of inpatient admissions for claims with dates of admission through  September 30, 2015, unless there was evidence of fraud and abuse.

To encourage the RAs to review DME claims\u2014 which had the highest rates of improper payments in fiscal years 2012  and 2013\u2014CMS officials stated that they increased the contingency fee  percentage paid to the RAs for DME claims. Further, in the requests for  proposals for the next round of RA contracts, CMS included a request for  a national RA that will specifically review DME, home health agency, and  hospice claims. CMS officials told us that they are procuring this new RA  because the existing four regional RAs reviewed a relatively small  number of these types of claims. Although DME, home health agency,  and hospice claims combined represented more than 25 percent of  improper payments in both 2013 and 2014, they constituted 5 percent of  RA reviews in 2013 and 6 percent of reviews in 2014."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "MAC Claim Reviews Focused on Physician and DME Claims", "paragraphs": ["In 2013 and 2014, the MACs focused their claim reviews on physician  and DME claims.

CMS officials also told us that they direct MAC claim review  resources to DME claims in particular because of their high improper  payment rate. Further CMS officials told us that the MACs\u2019 focus on  reviewing physician and DME claims was in part due to how CMS  structures the MAC claim review workload. CMS official noted that each  A/B MAC is responsible for addressing improper payments for both  Medicare Part A and Part B, and MAC Part B claim reviews largely focus  on physician claims. Additionally, 4 of the 16 MACs are DME MACs that  focus their reviews solely on DME claims. CMS officials also noted that  MAC reviews of inpatient claims were likely lowered during this period  because of CMS\u2019s implementation of new coverage policies for inpatient  admissions.

For example, one SMRC  study involved reviewing nearly 50,000 DME claims for suppliers deemed  high risk for having improperly billed for diabetic test strips. In 2014, the  claim reviews for this study accounted for all of the SMRC\u2019s DME claim  reviews and nearly half of all the SMRC claim reviews.
