Through November 16, 2009, in the 16 states and the District, $11.9 billion (76 percent) of Recovery Act highway funds had been obligated for nearly 4,600 projects and $1.9 billion (16 percent) had been reimbursed. Nationally, $20.4 billion (77 percent) had been obligated for over 8,800 projects and $4.2 billion (20 percent) had been reimbursed. Almost half of Recovery Act obligations nationally have been for pavement improvements--resurfacing, rehabilitating, and reconstructing roadways. Of the $7.5 billion in Recovery Act formula funding made available nationally for transit projects, $6.7 billion (88 percent) had been obligated through November 5, 2009. Most of these obligations are being used to upgrade transit facilities, improving bus fleets and light rail systems, and conducting preventive maintenance. As of November 6, 2009, of the Recovery Act funds available to them, the 16 states and the District had drawn down about $8.4 billion (46 percent) in SFSF; $735 million (11 percent) in Elementary and Secondary Education Act Title I, Part A funds; and $755 million (10 percent) in Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), Part B funds. GAO surveyed a sample of local educational agencies about their planned uses of Recovery Act funds and found (1) retaining jobs is the primary planned use, with 63 percent planning to use over 50 percent of their SFSF funds to retain jobs; (2) other planned uses include nonrecurring items such as equipment; and (3) most report placing great importance on educational goals and reform. The Department of Housing and Urban Development has entered into funding agreements with 3,121 public housing agencies and made available nearly all of the almost $3 billion in public housing formula grant funds provided under the Recovery Act. As of November 14, these agencies had reported obligating about half of the funds HUD had made available. Housing agencies GAO visited are using funds to replace roofs, windows, and floors; upgrade kitchens and baths, and renovate rental units. Regarding the Weatherization Assistance Program, nationally, the states reported that, as of September 30, 2009, they had spent about $113 million (2 percent) of the $5 billion in Recovery Act funding and had completed weatherizing about 7,300 (1 percent) of the 593,000 housing units planned for weatherization. The Recovery Act also included a $100 million appropriation for the Emergency Food and Shelter Program. Local recipient organizations in the 16 states and the District were awarded almost $66.2 million and plan to use the funds primarily for \"other food\" services such as food banks and pantries, food vouchers, and rent and mortgage assistance."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["States\u2019 and localities\u2019 use of Recovery Act funds continues as the nation  responds to the most serious economic crisis since the Great Depression.

Individual  summaries for this core group are compiled into an electronic supplement,  GAO-10-232SP, and are also accessible through GAO\u2019s Recovery Act page  at www.gao.gov/recovery/. Our reviews examine how Recovery Act funds  are being used and whether they are achieving the stated purposes of the  act. These purposes include  to preserve and create jobs and promote economic recovery;  to assist those most impacted by the recession;  to provide investments needed to increase economic efficiency by  spurring technological advances in science and health;  to invest in transportation, environmental protection, and other  infrastructure that will provide long-term economic benefits; and  to stabilize state and local government budgets, in order to minimize  and avoid reductions in essential services and counterproductive state  and local tax increases.", "The states selected for our bimonthly reviews contain about 65 percent of  the U.S. population and are estimated to receive collectively about two- thirds of the intergovernmental federal assistance funds available through  the Recovery Act.

Actual federal Recovery Act  outlays reported on www.recovery.gov (Recovery.gov) show that about  $53 billion was outlayed to states and localities in fiscal year 2009, about  $4 billion more than estimated. Nonetheless, a greater amount of Recovery  Act funding is estimated to be outlayed in fiscal year 2010. For fiscal year  2010, as of November 27, 2009, the federal Treasury had paid out  approximately $16.2 billion to states and localities.

As noted, these reports  solely reflect direct employment arising from the expenditure of less than  one third of Recovery Act funds. Therefore, both the data reported by  recipients and other macroeconomic data and methods are necessary to  gauge the overall employment effects of the stimulus.

Distressed areas are  defined by the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965,  as amended. According to this act, to qualify as an economically  distressed area, the area must (1) have a per capita income of 80  percent or less of the national average; (2) have an unemployment rate  that is, for the most recent 24-month period for which data are  available, at least 1 percent greater than the national average  unemployment rate; or (3) be an area the Secretary of Commerce  determines has experienced or is about to experience a \u201cspecial need\u201d  arising from actual or threatened severe unemployment or economic  adjustment problems resulting from severe short-or long-term changes  in economic conditions. In response to our recommendation, FHWA,  in consultation with the Department of Commerce, issued guidance on  August 24, 2009, that provided criteria for states to use for designating  special needs areas for the purpose of Recovery Act funding.", "Certify that the state will maintain the level of spending for the types of  transportation projects funded by the Recovery Act that it planned to  spend the day the Recovery Act was enacted. As part of this  certification, the governor of each state is required to identify the  amount of funds the state plans to expend from state sources from  February 17, 2009, through September 30, 2010.", "The first Recovery Act requirement is that states have to ensure that all  apportioned Recovery Act funds\u2014including suballocated funds\u2014are  obligated within 1 year. Over seventy-five percent of apportioned  Recovery Act highway funds had been obligated as of November 16, 2009,  both nationwide and among the 16 states and the District. Nine states and  the District have higher obligation rates than the national average,  including Iowa and the District\u2014for which FHWA has obligated 96  percent and 86 percent of funds, respectively. Conversely, Arizona,  Massachusetts, Ohio, and Texas have obligation rates of between 52  percent and 62 percent of apportioned funds. Officials at FHWA and state  department of transportation officials in the states we reviewed generally  believe that these states are on track to meet the March 2010 1-year  deadline.", "However, two factors may affect some states\u2019 ability to meet the 1-year  requirement. First, many state and local governments are awarding  contracts for less than the original estimated cost. This allows states to  use the savings from lower contract awards for other projects, but  additional projects funded with deobligated funds must be identified  quickly. In order to use the savings resulting from the lower contract  awards, a state must request FHWA to deobligate the difference between  the official estimate and the contract award amount and then obligate  funds for a new project.", "Our analysis of contract award data shows that for the 10 states and the  District, the majority of contracts are being awarded for less than the  original cost estimates. While there is a variation in the number of  contracts being awarded for lower than their original estimates, every  state we collected information from awarded at least half of its contracts  for less than the original cost estimates. Some states had an extremely  high number of contracts awarded at lower amounts. For example,  California, Georgia, and Texas awarded more than 90 percent of their  contracts for less than their cost estimates. We also found a significant  variation in both the average amount and the range of the savings from  contracts awarded at lower amounts. For example, in the District and  Georgia, such contracts averaged more than 30 percent less than original  state estimates, while in Colorado and Massachusetts, such contracts  averaged under 15 percent less than original state estimates. In addition,  there is also a significant range in individual projects, with the savings  ranging from less then 1 percent under estimates in a number of states to  almost 55 percent under estimates in New York and over 90 percent under  in Illinois.", "Federal regulations require states to promptly review and adjust project  cost estimates on an ongoing basis and at key decision points, such as  when the bid is approved. Many state officials told us that their state has  already started the process of ensuring funds are deobligated and  obligated to other highway programs and projects by the 1-year deadline.  For example, in Colorado, officials are planning to use Recovery Act funds  that are being deobligated by FHWA for 5 new projects, while in  California, FHWA deobligated approximately $108.5 million and the state  has identified 16 new state projects for Recovery Act funding. FHWA  officials told us they recognize the need to develop a process to monitor  and ensure deobligation of Recovery Act funds from known savings before  the 1-year deadline.", "A second factor that may affect some states\u2019 ability to meet the 1-year  requirement is that obligations for projects in suballocated areas, while  increasing, are generally lagging behind obligations for statewide projects  in most states and lagging considerably behind in a few states. In the 16  states and the District, 79 percent of apportioned statewide funds had  been obligated as of October 31, 2009, while 65 percent of suballocated  funds had been obligated. Figure 7 shows obligations for statewide and  suballocated areas in the 16 states and the District.", "As shown in figure 7, and as we reported in September 2009, FHWA has  obligated substantially fewer funds suballocated for metropolitan and  local areas in three states. While the national average for obligations of  Recovery Act funds for suballocated areas is 63 percent, as of October 31,  New Jersey, Massachusetts, and Arizona had obligation rates of 34  percent, 31 percent, and 18 percent of these funds, respectively. Officials  in these three states cited a number of reasons for this\u2014including lack of  familiarity by local officials with federal requirements and increased staff  workload associated with Recovery Act projects\u2014and reported they were  taking a number of actions to increase obligations, such as imposing  internal deadlines on local governments to identify and submit projects.  As of October 2009, Arizona had awarded four contracts (one more than it  had as of September 2009) representing $29 million of the $157 million of  suballocated funds. This represents 18 percent of suballocated funds\u2014\u2013a  decline from the 21 percent of suballocated funds that had been obligated  when we reported in September 2009. Arizona Department of  Transportation officials told us that although one new contract had been  awarded, the state\u2019s total obligation of suballocated funds had declined  because some suballocated funds were deobligated after more contracts  were awarded for less than the estimated amount. Officials also told us  that if local governments are not able to advertise contracts for  construction in suballocated areas prior to the March 2010 deadline, the  state would use Recovery Act funds on \u201cready-to-go\u201d statewide highway  projects in those areas. Similarly, officials in two localities told us that if  projects intended for Recovery Act funds were in danger of not having  funds obligated by the deadline, they would use those funds on projects  now slated to be funded with state dollars and use state funding for other  projects.", "Although states are working to have all of their suballocated funds  obligated before March 2010, failure to do so will not prohibit them from  participating in the redistribution of Recovery Act funds after March 2,  2010. The Secretary of Transportation is to withdraw highway funds,  including suballocated funds, which are not obligated before March 2,  2010. States that have obligated all of the funds that were apportioned for  use by the state (those that were not suballocated) are eligible to  participate in this redistribution, regardless of whether all of the state\u2019s  suballocated funds have been obligated. FHWA is in the process of  developing guidance on the redistribution of any Recovery Act funding  that remains unobligated one year after apportionment. According to DOT  officials, consistent with the Recovery Act, FHWA currently plans to  model this redistribution after the process used each year in the regular  federal-aid highway program to redistribute obligation authority, allowing  Recovery Act funds redistributed to the states to be available for any  qualified project in a state.", "The second Recovery Act requirement is to give priority to projects that  are project to be completed in three years or are located in economically  distressed areas. In July and September 2009, we identified substantial  variation in the extent to which states prioritized projects in economically  distressed areas and how they identified these areas. For example, we  found instances of states developing their own eligibility requirements for  economically distressed areas using data or criteria not specified in the  Public Works and Economic Development Act. State officials told us they  did so to respond to rapidly changing economic conditions. In response to  our recommendation, FHWA, in consultation with the Department of  Commerce, issued guidance to the states in August 2009 on identifying and  giving priority to economically distressed areas and criteria to identify  \u201cspecial need\u201d economically distressed areas that do not meet the  statutory criteria in the Public Works Act. In its guidance, FHWA directed  states to maintain information as to how they identified, vetted, examined,  and selected projects located in economically distressed areas and to  provide FHWA\u2019s division offices with documentation that demonstrates  satisfaction of the \u201cspecial need\u201d criteria. FHWA issued additional  questions and answers relating to economically distressed areas in  November 2009.", "Widespread designations of special needs areas give added preference to  highway projects for Recovery Act funding; however, they also make it  more difficult to target Recovery Act highway funding to areas that have  been the most severely impacted by the economic downturn. Three of the  states we reviewed\u2014Arizona, California, and Illinois\u2014had each developed  and applied its own criteria for identifying economically distressed areas,  and in two of the three states, applying the new criteria increased the  number of areas considered distressed.  In California, the number of  counties considered distressed rose from 49 to all 58 counties, while in  Illinois, the number of distressed areas increased from 74 to 92 of the  state\u2019s 102 counties. All 15 counties in Arizona were considered distressed  under the state\u2019s original determination and remained so when the state  applied the revised criteria. FHWA officials told us they expected the  number of \u201cspecial needs\u201d distressed areas to increase when the new  guidance was applied. We plan to continue to monitor the states\u2019  implementation of DOT\u2019s economically distressed area guidance.", "The third Recovery Act requirement is for states to certify that they will  maintain the level of state effort for programs covered by the Recovery  Act. As we reported in September 2009, most states revised the initial  explanatory or conditional certifications they submitted to DOT after  DOT\u2019s April 22, 2009, guidance required states to recertify without  conditions. All states that submitted conditional certifications submitted a  second maintenance of effort certification to DOT without conditions, and  DOT concluded that the form of each state certification was consistent  with its April guidance. In June 2009, FHWA began to review each state\u2019s  maintenance of effort calculation to determine whether the method of  calculation was consistent with DOT guidance and the amounts reported  by the states for planned expenditures for highway investment was  reasonable. For example, FHWA division offices evaluated, among other  things, whether the amount certified (1) covered the period from February  17, 2009, through September 30, 2010, and (2) included in-kind  contributions. FHWA division staff then determined whether the state  certification needed (1) no further action, (2) further assessment, or (3)  additional information. In addition, according to FHWA officials, their  assessments indicated that FHWA needed to clarify the types of projects  funded by the appropriations and the types of state expenditures that  should be included in the maintenance of effort certifications. As a result  of these findings, DOT issued guidance in June, July, and September 2009  and plans to issue additional guidance on these issues.", "In August 2009, FHWA staff in headquarters reviewed the FHWA division  staff findings for each sate and proceeded to work with each FHWA  division office to make sure their states submit revised certifications that  will include the correct planned expenditures for highway investment\u2014 including aid to local agencies. FHWA officials said that of the 16 states  and the District that we reviewed for this study, they currently expect to  have 12 states submit revised certifications for state highway spending,  while an additional 2 states are currently under review and may have to  revise their certifications. DOT officials stated they have not determined  when they will require the states to submit their revised consolidated  certification. According to these officials, they want to ensure that the  states have enough guidance to ensure that all programs covered by the  Recovery Act maintenance of effort provisions have completed their  maintenance of effort assessments and that the states have enough  guidance to ensure that this is the last time that states have to amend their  certifications.", "Most state officials we spoke with are committed to trying to meet their  maintenance of effort requirements, but some are concerned about  meeting the requirements. As we have previously reported, states face  drastic fiscal challenges. States\u2019 fiscal year 2009 revenue collections fell  below fiscal year 2008 collections and revenue collections are expected to  continue their decline in fiscal 2010. Although the state officials we spoke  with are committed to trying to meet the maintenance of effort  requirements, officials from seven state departments of transportation told  us the current decline in state revenues creates major challenges in doing  so. For example, Iowa, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania transportation  officials said their departments may be more difficult to maintain their  levels of transportation spending if state gas tax and other revenues, which  are used to fund state highway and state-funded transportation projects,  decline. In addition, Georgia officials also stated that reduced state gas tax  revenues pose a challenge to meeting its certified level of effort. Lastly,  Mississippi and Ohio transportation officials stated that if their state  legislatures reduce their respective department\u2019s budget for fiscal year  2010 or 2011, the department may have difficulty maintaining its certified  spending levels."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FTA Reports That the Majority of Transit Funds Have Been Obligated, with Most Funding Being Used for Transit Facilities, Bus Fleets, and Preventive Maintenance", "paragraphs": ["The Recovery Act appropriated $8.4 billion to fund public transit  throughout the country mainly through three existing Federal Transit  Administration (FTA) grant programs, including the Transit Capital  Assistance Program and the Fixed Guideway Infrastructure Investment  program. The majority of the public transit funds\u2014$6.9 billion (82  percent)\u2014was apportioned for the Transit Capital Assistance Program,  with $6 billion designated for the urbanized area formula grant program  and $766 million designated for the nonurbanized area formula grant  program. Under the urbanized area formula grant program, Recovery Act  funds were apportioned to large and medium urbanized areas\u2014which in  some cases include a metropolitan area that spans multiple states\u2014 throughout the country according to existing program formulas. Recovery  Act funds were also apportioned to states for small urbanized areas and  nonurbanized areas under the formula grant programs using the program\u2019s  existing formula. Transit Capital Assistance Program funds may be used  for such activities as facilities renovation or construction, vehicle  replacements, preventive maintenance, and paratransit services. Up to 10  percent of apportioned Recovery Act Transit Capital Assistance funds may  also be used for operating expenses. The Fixed Guideway Infrastructure  Investment program was appropriated $750 million, of which $742.5  million was apportioned by formula directly to qualifying urbanized  areas.

FTA reviews the project  sponsors\u2019 grant applications to ensure that projects meet eligibility  requirements and then obligates Recovery Act funds by approving the  grant application. Project sponsors must follow the requirements of the  existing programs, which include ensuring the projects funded meet all  regulations and guidance pertaining to the Americans with Disabilities Act  (ADA), pay a prevailing wage consistent with federal Davis-Bacon Act  requirements, and comply with goals to ensure disadvantaged businesses  are not discriminated against in the awarding of contracts.", "In March 2009, $6.9 billion was apportioned to states and urbanized areas  in all 50 states, the District, and five territories for transit projects and  eligible transit expenses under the Recovery Act\u2019s Transit Capital  Assistance Program and $750 million was apportioned to qualifying  urbanized areas under the Recovery Act\u2019s Fixed Guideway Infrastructure  Investment program. As of November 5, 2009, almost $6 billion of the  Transit Capital Assistance Program funds had been obligated nationwide  and $738 million of the Fixed Guideway Infrastructure Investment  program funds has been obligated nationwide.", "Almost 88 percent of Recovery Act Transit Capital Assistance Program  obligations are being used for upgrading transit facilities, improving bus  fleets, and conducting preventive maintenance. As we reported in  September 2009, many transit agency officials told us they decided to use  Recovery Act funding for these types of projects since they are high- priority projects that support their agencies short- and long-term goals,  can be started quickly, improve safety, or would otherwise not have been  funded. This continues to be the case. In particular:    Transit infrastructure facilities: $2.8 billion, or 47 percent, of these  funds obligated nationally have been for transit infrastructure  construction projects and related activities, which range from large- scale projects, such as upgrading power substations, to a series of  smaller projects, such as installing enhanced bus shelters. For  example, in Pennsylvania, the Lehigh and Northampton Transportation  Authority will implement a new passenger information technology  system, install enhanced bus shelters and signage, and fund a new  maintenance facility. Elsewhere, in North Carolina, the Charlotte Area  Transit System will renovate its bus operating and maintenance  facilities. In addition, in California, the San Diego Association of  Governments plans to upgrade stations on a light-rail line and replace a  section of a railroad trestle bridge.", "Bus fleets: $2 billion, or 33 percent, of Recovery Act Funds obligated  nationally have been for bus purchases or rehabilitation to replace  aging vehicles or expand an agency\u2019s fleet. For example, in  Pennsylvania, the Lehigh and Northampton Transportation Authority  plans to purchase 5 heavy-duty hybrid buses and the Southeastern  Pennsylvania Transportation Authority plans to purchase 40 hybrid  buses. In Iowa, the state\u2019s smaller transit agencies are combining bus  orders through the state\u2019s department of transportation for 160  replacement buses and 20 buses to expand bus fleets in areas of  growth around the state. In Colorado, both the Regional  Transportation District in Denver and the Fort Collins-Transfort  agency plan to purchase 6 buses each.", "Preventive maintenance: Another $515 million, or 9 percent, has been  obligated for preventive maintenance. FTA considers preventive  maintenance projects eligible capital expenditures under the Transit  Capital Assistance Program.", "The remaining funds have been used for rail car purchases and  rehabilitation, leases, training, financing costs, and, in some limited cases,  operating expenses\u2014all of which are eligible expenditures. In particular,  transit agencies reported using $5.2 million, or less than 1 percent, of the  Transit Capital Assistance Program funds obligated by FTA for operating  expenses. For example, the Des Moines transit agency has proposed to use  approximately $788,800 for operating expenses, such as costs associated  with personnel, facilities, and fuel.", "Funds from the Recovery Act Fixed Guideway Infrastructure Investment  program may also be used for transit improvement projects, which could  include fixed guideway transit facilities and equipment. Recipients may  use the funding on any capital purpose to include purchasing of rolling  stock, improvements to rail tracks, signals and communications, and  preventive maintenance. For example, in New York, FTA approved a  $254.4 million grant from Recovery Act Fixed Guideway Infrastructure  Investment funds to Metropolitan Transportation Authority for a variety of  maintenance and safety improvement projects, including the Jackson  Avenue Vent Plant Rehabilitation project in Long Island City. In addition,  the northeastern Illinois\u2019s Regional Transportation Authority is planning  on using $95.5 million that was obligated from the Fixed Guideway  Infrastructure Investment program to provide capital assistance for the  modernization of existing fixed guideway systems.

First, under section 1201(c) of  the Recovery Act, recipients of transportation funds must submit periodic  reports to DOT on the amount of federal funds appropriated, allocated,  obligated, and reimbursed; the number of projects put out to bid, awarded,  or for which work has begun or been completed; and the number of direct  and indirect jobs created or sustained, among other things. DOT is  required to collect and compile this information for Congress, and it  issued its first report to Congress in May 2009. Second, under section 1512,  recipients of Recovery Act funds, including but not limited to  transportation funds, are to report quarterly on a number of measures,  such as the use of funds and the number of jobs created or retained.", "To help recipients meet these reporting requirements, DOT and OMB have  provided training and guidance. For example, DOT, through FTA,  conducted a training session consisting of six webinars to provide  information on the 1201(c) reporting requirements, such as who should  submit these reports and what information is required. In addition, FTA  issued guidance in September 2009 that provided a variety of information,  including definitions of data elements. OMB also issued implementing  guidance for section 1512 recipient reporting. For example, on June 22,  2009, OMB issued guidance to dispel some confusion related to reporting  on jobs created and retained by providing, among other information,  additional detail on how to calculate the relevant numbers. Despite this  guidance, we reported in September that transit officials expressed  concerns and confusion about the reporting requirement, and therefore we  recommended that DOT continue its outreach to transit agencies to  identify common problems in accurately fulfilling reporting requirements  and provided additional guidance, as appropriate. In responding to our  recommendation, DOT said that it had conducted outreach, including  providing technical assistance, training and guidance, to recipients and  will continue to assess the need to provide additional information.", "Through our ongoing audit work, we continued to find confusion among  recipients about how to calculate the numbers of jobs created and saved  that is required by DOT and OMB for their reporting requirements. First, a  number of transit agencies continue to express confusion about  calculating the number of jobs resulting from Recovery Act funding,  especially with regard to using Recovery Act funds for purchasing  equipment, such as new buses. For the section 1201(c) reporting  requirement, transit agencies are not to report any jobs created or  sustained from the purchase of buses. However, for the section 1512  recipient reporting requirement, transit agencies were required to report  jobs created or retained from bus purchases, as long as these purchases  were directly from the bus manufacturers and not from dealer lots. FTA  held an outreach session in September 2009 with representatives from bus  manufacturers and the American Public Transportation Association in an  effort to standardize 1512 reporting methods and clarify recipient  responsibilities under the federal recipient reporting requirements. FTA,  the represented manufacturers, and American Public Transportation  Association discussed a standardized methodology that was established by  the Office of Management and Budget for calculating the number of jobs  created or retained by a bus purchase with Recovery Act funds. Under the  agreed-upon methodology, bus manufacturers are to divide their total U.S.  employment by their total U.S. production to determine a standard \u201cfull- time equivalents\u201d (FTE)-to-production ratio. The bus manufactures would  then multiple that FTE-to-production ratio by a standard full-time schedule  in order to provide transit agencies with a standard \u2018direct job hours\u201d-to- production ratio. This ratio is to include hours worked by administrative  and support staff, so that the ratio reflects total employment. Bus  manufacturers are to provide this ratio to the grantees, usually transit  agencies, which then the grantee can use to calculate the number of jobs  created or retained by a bus purchase. FTA officials told us that the  selected group of bus manufacturers and FTA agreed that this  methodology\u2014which allows manufacturers to report on all purchases,  regardless of size\u2014simplifies the job reporting process. According to  guidance, it is the responsibility of the transit agency to contact the  manufacturer and ask how many jobs were related to that order. The  manufacturers, in turn, are responsible for providing the transit agencies  with information on the jobs per bus ratio at the time when buses are  delivered. If the manufacturers cannot give the agencies a jobs estimate,  the transit agencies must develop their own estimate.", "While representatives from the bus manufacturers we interviewed were  using the agreed-upon methodology, there were a number of different  issues that were highlighted.", "Representatives from two bus manufacturers reported not knowing  about the FTA methodology and used their own measures for jobs  created or retained. For example, representatives from two  manufacturers told us that the labor-hours required to produce a bus  formed the basis for their calculation of FTEs and was then pro-rated  based upon the amount of production taking place in the United States  and the purchase amount funded by Recovery Act dollars.", "One bus manufacturer representative said it was difficult to pro-rate  the jobs calculation by the proportion funded by the Recovery Act, as  the agreed-upon methodology requires, since they did not always  receive this information from the transit agencies.", "According to FTA officials, the manufacturer is only responsible for  reporting the ratio of jobs created or retained per bus produced; the  purchasing transit agencies are responsible for the pro-rating and final  calculation of jobs created or retained. However, even bus  manufacturers that were otherwise aware of FTA guidance and  following FTA\u2019s methodology would sometimes calculate the total  number of jobs created or retained by a purchase.", "The second area of confusion we found involved the methodology  recipients were using to calculate full-time equivalents for the recipient  reporting requirements. As we reported in our November 2009 report on  recipient reporting, the data element on jobs created or retained expressed  in FTEs raised questions and concerns for some recipients. In section 5.2  of the June 22 guidance, OMB states that \u201cthe estimate of the number of  jobs required by the Recovery Act should be expressed as FTE, which is  calculated as the total hours worked in jobs retained divided by the  number of hours in a full-time schedule, as defined by the recipient.\u201d", "Further, \u201cthe FTE estimates must be reported cumulatively each calendar  quarter.\u201d In addition to issuing guidance, OMB and DOT provided several  types of clarifying information to recipients as well as opportunities to  interact and ask questions or receive help with the reporting process.  However, FTE calculations varied depending on the period of  performance the recipient reported on, and we found examples where the  issue of a project period of performance created significant variation in  the FTE calculation. For example, in Pennsylvania, each of four transit  entities we interviewed used a different denominator to calculate the  number of full-time equivalent jobs they reported on their recipients  reports for the period ending September 30, 2009. Southeastern  Pennsylvania Transportation Authority in Philadelphia used 1,040 hours as  its denominator, since it had projects under way in two previous quarters.  Port Authority of Allegheny County prorated the hours based on the  contractors\u2019 start date, as well as to reflect that hours worked from  September were not included due to lag time in invoice processing; Port  Authority used 1,127 hours for contractors starting before April, 867 hours  for contractors starting in the second quarter, and 347 hours for  contractors starting in the third quarter. Lehigh and Northampton  Transportation Authority in Allentown used 40 hours in the 1512 report  they tried to submit, but, due to some confusion about the need for  corrective action, the report was not filed. Finally, the Pennsylvania  Department of Transportation in the report for nonurbanized transit  agencies reported using 1,248 hours, which was prorated by multiplying 8  hours per workday times the 156 workdays between February 17 and  September 30, 2009. In several other of our selected states, this variation  across transit programs\u2019 period of performance for the FTE calculation  also occurred. Our November report provided additional detail and  recommendations to address the problems and confusion associated with  how FTEs were calculated in the October recipient report."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "As Many LEAs Are Facing Budget Cuts and Fiscal Pressures, Job Retention Is the Primary Planned Use of Education Recovery Act Funds", "paragraphs": ["GAO\u2019s review of states\u2019 use of Recovery Act funds covers three programs  administered by the U.S. Department of Education (Education)\u2014the State  Fiscal Stabilization Fund (SFSF); Title I, Part A of the Elementary and  Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA), as amended; and the Individuals  with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), as amended. As part of this  review, GAO surveyed a representative sample of local education agencies  (LEA)\u2014generally, school districts\u2014nationally and in 16 states and the  District of Columbia about their planned uses of Recovery Act funds for  each of these programs.", "State Fiscal Stabilization Fund. The State Fiscal Stabilization Fund  (SFSF) included approximately $48.6 billion to award to states by  formula and up to $5 billion to award to states as competitive grants.  The Recovery Act created the SFSF in part to help state and local  governments stabilize their budgets by minimizing budgetary cuts in  education and other essential government services, such as public  safety. Stabilization funds for education distributed under the  Recovery Act must first be used to alleviate shortfalls in state support  for education to LEAs and public institutions of higher education  (IHE). States must use 81.8 percent of their SFSF formula grant funds  to support education (these funds are referred to as education  stabilization funds) and must use the remaining 18.2 percent for public  safety and other government services, which may include education  (these funds are referred to as government services funds). For the  initial award of SFSF formula grant funds, Education awarded at least  67 percent of the total amount allocated to each state, but states had  to submit an application to Education to receive the funds. The  application required each state to provide several assurances,  including that the state will meet maintenance-of-effort requirements  (or will be able to comply with the relevant waiver provisions) and that  it will implement strategies to advance four core areas of education  reform, as described by Education: (1) increase teacher effectiveness  and address inequities in the distribution of highly qualified teachers;  (2) establish a pre-K-through-college data system to track student  progress and foster improvement; (3) make progress toward rigorous  college- and career-ready standards and high-quality assessments that  are valid and reliable for all students, including students with limited  English proficiency and students with disabilities; and (4) provide  targeted, intensive support and effective interventions to turn around  schools identified for corrective action or restructuring. In addition,  states were required to make assurances concerning accountability,  transparency, reporting, and compliance with certain federal laws and  regulations. After maintaining state support for education at fiscal year  2006 levels, states must use education stabilization funds to restore  state funding to the greater of fiscal year 2008 or 2009 levels for state  support to LEAs and public IHEs. On November 12, 2009, Education  published final requirements for Phase II applications for SFSF, which  states must submit by January 11, 2010. The Department also  published additional guidance for Phase II applications in December  2009.  According to the Phase II application, in order to receive the  remainder of their SFSF allocation, states must agree to collect and  publicly report on over 30 indicators and descriptors related to the  four core areas of education reform described above. Additionally,  states generally must, among other things, provide confirmation that  they maintained support for education in 2009 at least at the level of  such support in fiscal year 2006 and reaffirm or provide updated  information that they will maintain state support in 2010 and 2011.   When distributing these funds to LEAs, states must use their primary  education funding formula, but they can determine how to allocate  funds to public IHEs. In general, LEAs have broad discretion in how  they can use education stabilization funds, but states have some ability  to direct IHEs in how to use these funds.", "ESEA Title I, Part A. The Recovery Act provides $10 billion to help  LEAs educate disadvantaged youth by making additional funds  available beyond those regularly allocated through Title I, Part A of the  Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA), as  amended. The Recovery Act requires these additional funds to be  distributed through states to LEAs using existing federal funding  formulas, which target funds based on such factors as high  concentrations of students from families living in poverty. In using the  funds, LEAs are required to comply with applicable statutory and  regulatory requirements and must obligate 85 percent of the funds by  September 30, 2010. Education is advising LEAs to use the funds in  ways that will build the agencies\u2019 long-term capacity to serve  disadvantaged youth, such as through providing professional  development to teachers.", "IDEA, Parts B and C.

Prior to the influx of Recovery Act funding for  education from the federal government, LEAs, on average, derived about  48 percent of their fiscal year 2007 funding budget from state funds, 44  percent from local funds, and 9 percent from federal funds. These  percentages, however, likely shifted due to increased federal Recovery Act  funds and reductions in some state budgets for education. While the  federal role in financing public education has historically been a limited  one, the federal funds appropriated under the Recovery Act provide a  significant but temporary increase in federal support for education to  states and localities in part to help them address budget shortfalls.  According to CRS, the Recovery Act provided approximately $100 billion  for discretionary education programs\u2014elementary, secondary, and  postsecondary\u2014in fiscal year 2009, which, when combined with regular  appropriations, represents about a 235 percent increase in federal funding  compared to fiscal year 2008.", "According to our survey, however, even with the current infusion of  Recovery Act funding for education programs, the budget condition of  LEAs across the country is mixed. Based on our national survey results,  we estimate that approximately the same amount of LEAs\u201417 percent\u2014 face decreases of 5 percent or more in total education funding as face  funding increases for the current school year. On the other hand, an  estimated 57 percent of LEAs reported smaller or no funding changes for  the current school year.", "Changes to LEA budgets for the current school year varied substantially  depending on the source of the funding\u2014federal, state, or local  government. Figure 9 shows the estimated percentage of LEAs nationally  that are facing budget fluctuations of 5 percent or more by funding source.  For the current school year, we estimate that 50 percent of LEAs  nationwide received such funding increases from the federal government.  By contrast, however, state funding cuts of 5 percent or more were  common for many LEAs across the country. According to our survey, an  estimated 41 percent of LEAs across the country are seeing state funding  cuts of 5 percent or more for education. By contrast, an estimated 6  percent of LEAs report similar decreases from the federal government for  the current school year. Regarding local funds, an estimated 9 percent of  LEAs reported increases of 5 percent or more and 17 percent reported  decreases of the same magnitude. For LEAs, a cut in state or local funds  may only be partially offset by an increase in federal funds because LEAs,  on average, receive a much higher proportion of their funds from state and  local governments than from the federal government.", "While the national results of our survey show a mixed budgetary picture  for LEAs, sizable funding cuts to LEA overall budgets were concentrated  in a few of the states on which we are focusing our Recovery Act review\u2014 California, North Carolina, and Georgia (see fig. 10). In California, for  example, a majority of LEAs in the state\u2014an estimated 67 percent\u2014are  experiencing declines of 5 percent or more in their overall education  budgets this year. We previously reported that, in California, the state  legislature authorized substantial budget cuts in order to balance the fiscal  year 2009-2010 budget, with funding for education making up a large part  of the reduction\u2014$6.5 billion was cut from K-12 and community college  funding in July alone. According to officials at Los Angeles Unified School  District\u2014the largest LEA in the state\u2014the LEA faces steep drops in state  revenue in education in fiscal year 2009-2010. In addition to California, we  estimate that nearly 40 percent of LEAs in both Georgia and North  Carolina face overall funding cuts of 5 percent or more, well above the  national average of 17 percent. According to the Department of Public  Instruction in North Carolina, the economic recession has resulted in  significant declines in state revenues for education, with federal Recovery  Act funding offsetting only a portion of the state cuts. For example, one  North Carolina LEA reported that the current year budget process was  difficult, with federal Recovery Act funding \u201csoftening the blow\u201d of state  and local funding cuts but not completely compensating for the  reductions. In other states, however, many LEAs report total funding  increases for education of 5 percent or more for the current school year.  According to our survey, about 30 percent of LEAs in Texas, Mississippi,  and New Jersey reported total education funding increases of 5 percent or  more.", "Our survey results indicate that much of the Recovery Act funds for  education are being used by LEAs to retain staff. An estimated 64 percent  of LEAs nationally reported giving very great or great importance to  retaining jobs when deciding how to spend Recovery Act funds. Because  employee-related expenditures are the largest category of school  expenditures\u2014with salaries and benefits accounting for more than 80  percent of local school expenditures, according to Education\u2019s most  recent estimates \u2014it is understandable that LEAs would use some of  their Recovery Act funds for staff salaries. Also, given the fiscal  uncertainty and substantial budget shortfalls facing states, federal funds  authorized by the Recovery Act provide LEAs with additional support for  the retention of education staff. Overall, the impact of Recovery Act  education funds on job retention may be significant because K-12 public  school systems employ about 6.2 million staff, based on Education\u2019s  estimates, and make up about 4 percent of the nation\u2019s workforce.", "Retaining Jobs Was LEAs\u2019 Top Use for Recovery Act Funds across  Three Education Programs  Job retention was the top planned use for Recovery Act funds for LEAs  across the three federal Education programs GAO reviewed. Figure 11  shows the national results of the estimated percentages of LEAs that  reported planning to use more than 50 percent of their Recovery Act funds  under SFSF, IDEA, Part B, and ESEA Title I, Part A to retain and create  education jobs. An estimated 63 percent of LEAs, the highest percentage  among the 3 programs we reviewed, plan to use Recovery Act SFSF funds  to retain jobs. In contrast, an estimated 25 percent and 19 percent of LEAs  said they planned to use over half of their Recovery Act funds on job  retention under ESEA Title I, Part A and IDEA, Part B, respectively.  Overall, the percentages of LEAs that reported planning to use Recovery  Act funds to create jobs were lower than the percentages planning to  retain jobs, with an estimated 11 percent under ESEA Title I, 7 percent  under IDEA, and 3 percent under SFSF planning to create jobs.", "State education officials reported a variety of factors that may help explain  why LEAs reported planning to use Recovery Act funds to retain jobs. In  particular, officials noted that SFSF funds provided flexibility in how they  could be used. For example, one state education official noted that LEAs  have more flexibility in spending SFSF funds for general education  expenses because ESEA Title I and IDEA programs target special  populations---disadvantaged youth and students with disabilities,  respectively. This official said that because funding levels for general  education programs in his state have decreased while federal funding  levels for ESEA Title I and IDEA programs have increased, LEAs have  used SFSF funds to shore up funding for general education and, in  particular, preserve jobs.", "The percentage of LEAs reporting they planned to use over 50 percent of  their Recovery Act education funds to retain jobs varied considerably by  state. In particular, Georgia, Michigan, Florida, New Jersey, New York and  North Carolina were among the states with the highest percentages of  LEAs that reported planning to use over half their SFSF funds for job  retention (see fig. 12). North Carolina, Iowa, New York, Georgia, Florida  and Michigan were among the states with the highest percentages of LEAs  that reported they planned to use over half of their ESEA Title I or IDEA  Recovery Act funds for this purpose (see fig. 12).", "LEA officials described the use of Recovery Act funds to retain staff in the  context of decreasing state and local education funds. For example,  education officials in New York City told us that Recovery Act funds  helped the city reduce a total education budget gap of nearly $1.46 billion  to $400 million for the current school year and avoid teacher layoffs. In the  small, rural school district of Jasper-Troupsburg in upstate New York,  district officials told us they were facing a budget gap of $250,000. They  said they would use 95 percent of their Recovery Act funds to retain jobs.  Without these funds, the district would have been forced to cut teachers\u2019  salaries and reduce work hours, as well as lay off 8 to 10 teachers out of 60  teachers, according to LEA officials. Similarly in Charlotte-Mecklenburg,  North Carolina, LEA officials told us that Recovery Act funds allowed the  district to compensate for reductions in state aid and local funds and that  a large portion of these funds enabled the district to retain education jobs.  In another LEA in Arizona, officials explained that with Recovery Act  funds, they were able to offer contracts to all teachers who were returning,  but without these funds the extent to which they would have had to  reduce staff positions is unclear. They speculated that, absent Recovery  Act funds, other cost-cutting measures might have included decreasing  staff salaries and benefits.", "Some LEAs used Recovery Act funds to hire new staff. When planning how  to spend Recovery Act funds, an estimated 17 percent of LEAs nationally  reported creating jobs as of very great or great importance during the  decision-making process. Officials at the Arlington Elementary School  District, a rural LEA in Arizona containing a single school, said that IDEA  Recovery Act funds would help the district add a special education teacher  to the one they currently have. They said the timing of the Recovery Act  funds was important to their district because of the addition of three new  students with disabilities to the school. Without the IDEA Recovery Act  funds they received, they said they would have had to draw funds away  from general education needs, which would have meant combining classes  and eliminating a position. Similarly, in Weldon City Schools in North  Carolina, officials reported that IDEA Recovery Act funds allowed the LEA  to create teaching and teaching assistant positions for severely  emotionally disturbed students. Without these funds, officials said they  would have had to lay off two special education staff and would have been  unable to provide the intensive support for students with disabilities.  Education officials in some states said they are concerned about funding  cliffs if LEAs use Recovery Act funds to create new positions. For  example, an official at one LEA in New York state said district officials are  concerned that using Recovery Act Title I funds may lead to a funding cliff  and that the district may be unable to retain teachers hired with those  funds once they expire.", "About a Third of LEAs Expected to Lose Jobs, Even with SFSF  Funds  An estimated 32 percent of LEAs nationally expected to lose jobs, even  with SFSF funds, but the percentage of LEAs expecting to lose jobs  varies by state. (See fig. 13.) Among the states with higher percentages of  LEAs expecting job losses even with SFSF funds were Georgia, Florida,  North Carolina, and California. According to our analysis, in all of these  states except for Florida, the proportion of LEAs that experienced  decreases of 5 percent or more in total education funding from last year  was larger than the national average of 17 percent. For example, in  Georgia 65 percent of LEAs reported that they expected to lose jobs even  with SFSF funds, and 39 percent of LEAs also reported they experienced a  total decrease in funds of 5 percent or more. State education officials in  Georgia said that declining state and local revenues have forced many  LEAs to cut their budgets and eliminate programs, resulting in a loss of  jobs. Our analysis also found that the estimated percentage of the largest  LEAs that reported expecting to lose jobs even with SFSF funds was  higher than the national average. For example, officials at Charlotte- Mecklenburg Schools, the largest LEA in North Carolina, said the district  was facing an $87 million reduction in state and county funding and  sustained a net reduction of 769 positions after Recovery Act funds had  been applied. While budget gaps may help explain the loss of jobs in some  states and localities, there may be other factors that contribute to job loss.  For example, Florida state officials noted that Florida\u2019s declining student  enrollment has meant that LEAs are retaining fewer staff.", "In planning how to spend Recovery Act funds for their LEAs, most local  officials reported placing great importance on advancing educational goals  and reform set forth in Education\u2019s guidance on how best to use the funds  (see fig 14). Specifically, we estimate that most LEAs\u2014about 80  percent\u2014gave great or very great importance to \u201cimproving results for  students\u201d in deciding how to use Recovery Act funds for their school  districts. \u201cIncreasing educators\u2019 long term capacity\u201d was the next most  cited, with approximately 70 percent of LEAs giving very great or great  importance to this factor.

Overall, LEAs reported several nonrecurring items such as purchasing  technological equipment, including new computers; providing professional  development for instructional staff; and purchasing instructional materials  as among the highest uses of funds after job retention and creation. Figure  15 shows the national estimated percentages of LEAs that reported  planning to use more than a quarter of their Recovery Act funds for these  three nonrecurring budgetary items across the three education programs.", "Interviews with LEAs in a number of states illustrate the range of reform- oriented and capacity-building projects in these areas being supported  with Recovery Act funds. For example, in the Los Angeles Unified School  District, officials described using Recovery Act funds for a special  education leadership academy for assistant principals to instruct them on  compliance with special education requirements and working with  teachers to implement effective instructional programs. In Weldon City  Schools in North Carolina, LEA officials reported that IDEA Recovery Act  funds would enable the district to provide more technology for children in  their special education program, including updated computers and  transition kits for occupational course study classrooms. Without these  Recovery Act funds, officials said that technology funds for such a  program would have been unavailable. At Buckeye Elementary School  District in Arizona, officials said they used some of their IDEA Recovery  Act funds as seed money for acquiring software needed to implement an  educational initiative focusing on preventing the need for special  education interventions and serving approximately 600 students with  disabilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "In Part Because of Fiscal Pressures, Many Local Education Agencies Plan to Use IDEA Flexibility to Decrease their Local Spending on IDEA Activities This Year, Including a Majority of LEAs in Some States", "paragraphs": ["LEAs must budget at least the same total or per capita amount of local funds for the  education of children with disabilities as the LEA spent in the most recent prior year for  which information is available.", "LEAs. Overall, among the 15 states in our study that had made LEA  determinations related to their state performance plan this year, all but  New York, Georgia, and Texas had experienced an increase in the  number of LEAs that met requirements. State officials in states that  experienced such increases attributed these increases to training,  technical assistance and monitoring of indicators that were problematic  for LEAs to meet in previous years. However, officials in some states also  told us they had changed the criteria in their state performance plan this  year. Others changed the determinations process by increasing the  minimum number of students\u2014called an \u201cn\u201d size or cell size\u2014required for  making calculations related to the state performance plan, which could  effectively prevent some LEAs with small numbers of students from being  evaluated in certain areas. If an LEA has fewer than the minimum number  of special education students required for a particular target, the LEA\u2019s  data on that target would be considered \u201cnot applicable\u201d and would not  have bearing on the determination of whether the LEA met requirements.", "Officials in states that changed their determinations processes or criteria  said that doing so made their plans and targets comparable to other states\u2019  targets and helped ensure that expectations placed on LEAs were  reasonable. Three states changed their determinations criteria and  experienced large increases in the number of LEAs meeting  requirements\u2014Arizona, Michigan, and Ohio\u2014while two others that  increased their minimum \u201cn\u201d size also experienced large increases\u2014 California and Illinois. (See table 5.) Officials in Ohio told us that they  changed the determinations criteria with the goal of increasing the number  of LEAs that were determined to meet requirements, thereby giving most  LEAs in the state the option to reduce their local spending. States have  some discretion over their determinations process and criteria, but the  Secretary of Education issued a letter to state education officials in  October 2009 encouraging them to implement the LEA determinations  process in a rigorous manner, with a focus on improving results for  students with disabilities and ensuring that appropriate special education  and related services are provided.", "According to some state officials, some LEAs were hesitant to utilize the  reduced local expenditure flexibility in the past, because the increase in  their allocation\u2014and the amount of local or state funding that could be  \u201cfreed up\u201d\u2014was small. However, this year, the amount of funding that can  be \u201cfreed up\u201d is larger than in prior years, and using this flexibility will give  LEAs, some facing budgetary pressures, more flexibility in deciding how  to spend their local funds. According to state officials, LEAs that take  advantage of this flexibility will not necessarily reduce their local spending  by the entire 50 percent allowed under the law, but some state officials  said that some LEAs may reduce local spending because they have  concerns about creating unsustainable funding commitments for special  education, because services cannot be easily cut after Recovery Act funds  are gone. In Ohio and Colorado, state officials said that this flexibility will  allow LEAs to fund important services that will benefit both general  education and special education students. Another option for LEAs  seeking to benefit students in both general education and special  education settings is to set aside up to 15 percent of their IDEA funds for  Coordinated Early Intervening Services (CEIS), which can be used to  serve students who have not been identified as having a disability.  Mississippi state officials said that some of their LEAs plan to set aside  funds for CEIS instead of using the flexibility to decrease local spending.", "This year, according to our survey, an estimated 44 percent of LEAs plan  to use the reduced local expenditure flexibility to decrease local spending  on students with disabilities, although the percentages vary across states:  from 14 percent in New York to 72 percent in Iowa. (See fig. 16.) An  estimated 48 percent of the largest LEAs planned to do so. However,  officials in some states said they had advised LEAs about whether to use  the flexibility, and state education officials in Colorado, Iowa, and Georgia  said they expect many or all eligible LEAs to utilize the flexibility, whereas  officials in the District of Columbia, Arizona, Mississippi, and Texas said  they expect few, if any, to do so.", "As of November 6, 2009, states covered by our review had drawn down 46  percent ($8.4 billion) of the awarded education stabilization funds, 11  percent ($735 million) of Recovery Act funds for ESEA Title I, and 10  percent ($755 million) of Recovery Act funds for IDEA. Some states had  drawn down a much larger portion of their funds than other states. For  example, Arizona, California, Georgia, and Illinois had drawn down 83  percent or more of their awarded education stabilization funds, while the  District of Columbia and Pennsylvania had not drawn down any funds.  Pennsylvania had little time to draw down funds because it had just  received approval for its SFSF application a few days earlier. The District  of Columbia had not yet requested assurances from the LEAs that  education stabilization funds would be used in accordance with federal  requirements\u2014the District requires such assurances before the LEAs  obligate federal funds. In addition, the District of Columbia had not drawn  down any of its Recovery Act funds for ESEA Title I or IDEA, Part B, in  part, because it had not completed its review of LEA applications for these  funds, according to District of Columbia officials. Although New Jersey  had not drawn down any of its ESEA, Title I or IDEA Recovery Act funds  as of November 6, the state drew down funds later in November.", "Department of Education officials report they continue to work with  several states to provide clarification on the appropriate methods for  managing cash flows under the newly created SFSF program. However,  some state educational agencies (SEA) report that they need clarifying  guidance on cash management issues before moving forward with  guidance to LEAs. As we have reported, Recovery Act cash management  issues in a number of states have been a concern to Education and the  Education Office of Inspector General, and Education officials report that  they are monitoring drawdowns of Recovery Act funds to help ensure that  states are complying with federal requirements.", "In our recent discussions with Education officials regarding cash  management, they said their guidance to SEAs and LEAs is to minimize the  amount of time they hold federal funds before they need to spend them.  Department of Education regulations require states to minimize the time  elapsing between the transfer of the grant funds from the U.S. Treasury  and disbursement by the states, and similarly require LEAs to minimize the  time they hold funds before disbursing them. Regulations generally require  subgrantees to calculate and remit any interest earned on advance  payments made to them by states on at least a quarterly basis. In other  words, the goal is to draw down the funds when they are needed and  spend them immediately. Education officials told us that if LEAs retain  federal cash balances of SFSF or other federal funds in interest bearing  accounts, they are to calculate the interest due using the actual interest  the funds have earned. These officials stated, however, that Education  does not require LEAs to keep federal funds in interest bearing accounts.  Further, according to Education officials, regulations do not require that  LEAs calculate the interest due on each federal funding program  separately.", "However, as we have previously reported, several states do not have cash  management systems in place for SFSF funds that can disburse funds to  LEAs when they are needed and ensure the calculation and remittance of  any interest due.

However,  the state unexpectedly sent the funding all at one time, and the LEA  officials were concerned about having excess SFSF cash on hand at  month\u2019s end. LEA officials said they used the SFSF funds to pay all  district salaries for that month, in order to be able to expend all funds  in a timely manner. In our discussions with Education officials, they  acknowledged there could be a cash management issue if an SEA is  sending SFSF funds to LEAs in advance of the LEAs\u2019 needing it.  Education officials said they would need to look into this matter.", "As we previously reported, the California Department of Education  (CDE) has recently implemented a pilot program to monitor LEA cash  balances.

In addition, the program office responsible for IDEA ha been piloting a desk review tool specifically related to the Recovery Act  and shared an early draft with states to help inform them about h will be monitored. According to Education officials, to date, the  department has been monitoring the use of SFSF funds through its reviof SFSF applications, waiver applications, and quarterly Recovery Act reporting and through telephone calls with states.

As of  November 14, 2009, 2,598 public housing agencies (83 percent of the  housing agencies that entered into agreements with HUD for Recovery Act  funds) had reported to HUD that they had obligated a total of $1.46 billion,  an increase of over $500 million from the level reported as of September 5,  2009. In total, public housing agencies reported obligating about 49  percent of the total Capital Fund formula funds HUD allocated to them  (see fig. 19).

A majority of housing agencies that had  obligated funds\u20142,113 of 2,598 housing agencies\u2014had also drawn down  funds in order to pay for project expenses already incurred.

However, 1,055 housing agencies (34  percent) had reported obligating 100 percent of their funds as of  November 14, 2009, placing them well ahead of the Recovery Act\u2019s 12- month deadline. An additional 467 housing agencies (15 percent) had  reported obligating more than 75 percent of their funds as of November 14,  2009. The size of the grant and the number, size, and complexity of  projects that housing agencies selected may account for some of the  differences in obligation rates. Although HUD is making efforts to assist  housing agencies with meeting the deadline, officials expect some housing  agencies probably will not obligate all of their funds in time.", "HUD officials stated they have been emphasizing the 1-year deadline to  housing agencies, and they pointed to notices, frequently asked questions,  and Web seminars as evidence. In addition, they have stressed that the  Recovery Act does not provide HUD with any way to grant exceptions or  extensions. HUD will recapture any funds not obligated by March 17, 2010,  and will reallocate those funds to other housing agencies. According to  HUD officials, in November 2009 HUD field staff began contacting housing  agencies that had not obligated any Recovery Act funds by phone, by e- mail, or in person in order to understand where these housing agencies are  in the process of awarding contracts and obligating funds. They said they  will repeat the process for housing agencies below certain obligation  levels, such as 25 percent or 50 percent, beginning in early December.  Field staff will be preparing status reports for each housing agency, which  HUD will review in order to determine what additional steps HUD should  take to assist housing agencies in meeting the March 2010 deadline. HUD  headquarters staff are also preparing an e-mail notification to all housing  agencies that are below the level of obligations at which HUD expects  them to be at this point in the year. HUD officials said they will send these  notifications each month.

As they get closer to the March deadline, HUD officials expect more  housing agencies will achieve 100 percent obligations, allowing HUD to  better target its outreach efforts. While HUD\u2019s goal is that agencies achieve  100 percent obligations, officials said that realistically some housing  agencies probably will not obligate all of their funds in time. They said that  part of the process of reaching out to housing agencies with low  obligations is to identify which housing agencies do not expect to make  the deadline, so that HUD can begin planning for recapturing and  reallocating the funds. They hope to have an estimate of how much will  not be obligated in time by early February 2010. The officials stated HUD  has not yet determined how it will reallocate funds that are recaptured. It  will be important for HUD to follow through on these efforts to ensure  housing agencies obligate the funds in a timely manner.", "Of the 47 housing agencies in 16 states and the District of Columbia we  selected for in-depth review throughout our Recovery Act work, as of  November 14, 2009, 45 had reported obligating funds totaling $207 million,  or about 39 percent of the total Capital Fund formula funds HUD had  allocated to the agencies (see fig. 21).

As we previously reported, other  planned uses of Recovery Act funds include heating, ventilation, and air  conditioning (HVAC) system upgrades or replacements; interior  rehabilitation work, such as kitchen or bathroom renovations and flooring  or carpet replacements; and demolition and construction of new units. The  estimated costs for the projects we selected ranged from $4,500 for one  roof replacement to more than $32 million for the complete rehabilitation  of 172 rental units\u2014$28 million of which will be Recovery Act funds.

They said that, due to economic conditions,  contractors have little work and are submitting lower bids in order to have  projects and keep their staff employed. As a result, housing agencies may  have to identify additional projects on which to use Recovery Act funds in  order to obligate all their funds, although officials from these agencies did  not anticipate having difficulties in obligating all their Recovery Act funds  before the deadline.

As we reported in July 2009, housing agencies generally  selected projects that were on their 5-year plans. Others, such as Boston  Housing Authority, also selected projects that were already under way but  that could be expanded or accelerated with additional funds. Eighteen  housing agencies we visited were able to award at least one contract based  on bids within 120 days of the funds becoming available. For example,  Rahway Housing Authority in New Jersey awarded seven of its nine  contracts, representing 87 percent of its Recovery Act funds, within 120  days. In addition, two housing agencies each had only one project and one  contract for that project, which they were able to award within 120 days.  However, housing agencies with larger projects or a larger number of  projects were at times unable to meet this time frame due to extensive  design work that needed to be done first or to internal and external  policies and procedures that are not easily sped up. For example, officials  at Boston Housing Authority said that the design work to meet the  extensive and complex building codes takes time. In addition, housing  agencies that HUD put on \u201czero threshold\u201d or that were troubled  performers said they had difficulty meeting this priority because of the  additional monitoring steps HUD had put in place for them. Finally,  housing agencies reported having few vacant units and therefore did not  have many projects to rehabilitate vacant units. One exception was  Newark Housing Authority in New Jersey, which had rehabilitated 313  vacant units using Recovery Act funds and expected to rehabilitate 109  more. Newark Housing Authority officials said they had about 700 long- term vacant units, as well as 300 units vacant as a result of normal  turnover.", "The Recovery Act also required that housing agencies use Recovery Act  funds to supplement rather than supplant funds from other sources.  Housing agency officials we spoke with generally did not see supplanting  as a major challenge and thought they would have no trouble abiding by  the requirement. Officials at several housing agencies noted they had many  more projects that needed to be done than could be completed with only  their regular Capital Fund grants, so it was not difficult to identify projects  that did not have any other funding. In addition, housing agency officials  told us they were keeping track of their Recovery Act funds separately  from their regular Capital Fund grants in order to make clear that the  Recovery Act funds were not supplanting other funds that had already  been obligated. Other housing agency officials stated that annual  statements and 5-year plans are reviewed multiple times\u2014by the public,  by the housing agency\u2019s board, and by HUD\u2014and that these layers of  review serve as a check to ensure that supplanting does not occur."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HUD Continues to Monitor Troubled Housing Agencies\u2019 Use of Recovery Act Funds", "paragraphs": ["As we noted in our September 2009 report, HUD has designated 172  housing agencies as troubled under its Public Housing Assessment System  (PHAS) and has implemented a strategy for monitoring these housing  agencies.

Remote reviews are to focus on four main components: grant initiation,  environmental compliance, procurement, and grant administration.

For example, officials from a housing  agency in Illinois reported the number of people, by trade, who worked on  Recovery Act-related projects but did not apply the full-time equivalent  calculation outlined by OMB in the June 22 reporting guidance.

Only  one official was very dissatisfied, and another was somewhat dissatisfied,  and in both cases, their housing agencies were not awarded a competitive  grant. Both officials said they had not received feedback on why their  applications were not successful and thought the requirements may have  favored agencies with more resources. HUD officials said they recently  notified housing agencies that had unsuccessful applications why they  were not selected, the most common reason being insufficient funds. In  addition, officials from two housing agencies thought the competition was  not fair because housing agencies that had already made certain  improvements, such as increasing energy efficiency or completing lead- paint abatement, were not able to accumulate as many points for those  types of activities as housing agencies that had been less proactive.", "Capacity was a substantial barrier to applying for competitive grants for a  variety of agencies we visited, including at least one housing agency that  was awarded a competitive grant.

Officials from two other  housing agencies stated they did not apply because they did not have  enough time or staff to pull together the information required before the  deadline. Officials from another agency believed that larger housing  agencies were able to put together better applications that were more  likely to be awarded grants because they had professional staff in house to  put the applications together.

These improvements enable families to reduce energy bills,  allowing these households to spend their money on other needs, according  to DOE. The Recovery Act appropriation represents a significant increase  for a program that has received about $225 million per year in recent  years.", "DOE has approved the weatherization plan of each of the states, the  District, and seven territories and Indian tribes.

A key factor slowing the start of  weatherization activities is the act\u2019s requirement that all laborers and  mechanics employed by contractors and subcontractors on Recovery Act  projects be paid at least the prevailing wage, including fringe benefits, as  determined under the Davis-Bacon Act. Because the Weatherization  Assistance Program, funded through annual appropriations, is not subject  to the Davis-Bacon Act, the Department of Labor (Labor) had not  previously determined prevailing wage rates for weatherization workers.

Many representatives of the local agencies we  interviewed confirmed that these rates generally were about what they had  been paying for weatherization work.", "However, many weatherization contracts between states and local  agencies have been delayed because of concerns about complying with  Recovery Act requirements\u2014including Davis-Bacon Act requirements that  contractors pay workers weekly and submit weekly certified payroll  records\u2014and OMB\u2019s reporting requirements. Some state agencies have  delayed disbursing Recovery Act funds to local agencies because they  were not satisfied that local agencies had the proper infrastructure in  place to comply with these requirements. Pennsylvania officials told us  that delays occurred because some local agencies had initially submitted  management plans that had not included language describing how they  would comply with the Davis-Bacon Act. The state agencies of California  and the District of Columbia, which had not spent any Recovery Act funds  to weatherize homes, were finalizing Recovery Act weatherization  contracts with their local agencies as of November 30, 2009.

Only 2 of California\u2019s 35 local  agencies that have been awarded Recovery Act funds had accepted these  required amendments by the initial October 30, 2009, deadline. According  to California officials, many local agencies pursued negotiations due to  concerns about some provisions of these amendments.", "Several state and local agency officials expressed concern about the  administrative burden to state and local agencies of complying with  Recovery Act requirements, and many of these agencies were taking the  time to hire additional staff to better ensure compliance. For example,  Michigan officials told us their agency planned to add 22 staff, including a  Davis-Bacon analyst, to ensure compliance with Recovery Act  requirements. They also told us that federal administrative requirements,  such as a weekly certified payroll, required them to make technological  upgrades in their weatherization division. Ohio officials told us that  ensuring compliance with the Davis-Bacon Act documentation was a  significant undertaking. District officials told us that their agency had not  expended Recovery Act funds to weatherize homes because they have  been developing the infrastructure to administer the program by, for  example, hiring new staff. Local agencies in California, Michigan, New  York, and Ohio had also hired new staff to process Davis-Bacon  paperwork. Several state and local officials expressed concern about the  administrative burden on small contractors of complying with Recovery  Act requirements because these contractors generally have fewer  resources and less experience with accounting processes.", "According to DOE officials, some local agencies have been hesitant to use  Recovery Act funding to weatherize homes until they are certain they are  in compliance with the Davis-Bacon Act. The DOE officials had expected  to receive fewer questions from local agencies about Davis-Bacon Act  requirements after Labor had determined prevailing wages, but in fact they  continue to receive frequent questions about these requirements.

As a result, local  agencies conducting weatherization work on multifamily units in high rise  buildings must pay their workers wage rates that can be significantly  higher than what local agencies pay weatherization workers for residential  housing units. For example, in New York County (Manhattan), commercial  prevailing wages were three times more than the rates for residential  weatherization laborers. Representatives of two local agencies in New  York told us that they intend to subcontract out all weatherization work  conducted on buildings over four stories because they could not pay their  workers vastly different wages based on the type of building involved.  According to Ohio officials, some local agencies had delayed projects in  larger multifamily buildings until they could better estimate project costs.  In response to states\u2019 concerns, DOE\u2019s November 10, 2009, guidance states  that the wage rates for the new weatherization laborer category do not  apply to weatherization work performed on buildings of five or more  stories.

Although many local officials have collected  data about new hires, none could provide us with data on energy savings.  This lack of information about impacts exists primarily because most state  and local agencies either are just beginning to use Recovery Act funds to  weatherize homes or have not yet begun to do so.

To provide  additional leverage as an oversight tool for Recovery Act programs, we  recommended that OMB adjust the current audit process to, among other  things, provide for review of internal controls before significant  expenditures occurred. The statutory Single Audit reporting deadline is  too late to provide audit results in time for the audited entity to take action  on internal control deficiencies before significant expenditures of  Recovery Act funds.

Such additional costs can exacerbate states\u2019 existing fiscal stress.
