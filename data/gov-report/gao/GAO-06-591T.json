CBP does not yet have a comprehensive, integrated system in place to analyze security inspection results and incorporate them into ATS. CBP currently adjusts ATS based on intelligence information it receives and has initiated a process to track suggestions submitted by CBP targeting officers at the seaports for modifying ATS. However, CBP has not yet implemented plans to refine ATS based on findings from routine security inspections. Without a more comprehensive feedback system, CBP is limited in refining ATS, a fact that could hinder the overall effectiveness of the targeting strategy. CBP has taken steps to improve implementation of the targeting strategy at the seaports. It has implemented a testing and certification process for its officers who complete the Sea Cargo Targeting Course that should provide better assurance of effective targeting practices. CBP has also made a good faith effort to address longshoremen's safety concerns regarding radiation emitted by nonintrusive inspection equipment by taking actions such as working with longshoremen's unions and other maritime organization to develop public radiation tests on the nonintrusive inspection equipment.

Because of the large volume of  imported containers, CBP maintains that it is unable to physically inspect  all oceangoing containers without disrupting the flow of commerce. Thus,  CBP uses a multilayered strategy for addressing the threat posed by the  movement of oceangoing containers, of which ATS is a key component.  CBP uses ATS to review documentation and assign a risk score for all  containers destined for U.S. ports. CBP officers located at domestic ports  or at 1 of the 40 foreign ports that participate in the Container Security  Initiative (CSI) then use these scores to help them make decisions on the  extent of additional documentary review and possible physical inspection  that will be conducted at the seaport.", "We previously reported in February 2004 on the challenges CBP faced in  targeting oceangoing cargo containers for inspection and testified before  this Subcommittee in March 2004 about the findings in that report.

This  subcommittee and other congressional requesters asked that we ascertain  whether CBP had implemented the recommendations we made to improve  the targeting strategy. Our work, in response to this request, has been  under way since last October, and we expect to complete the work and  provide this subcommittee and our other requesters with a report on the  final results later this year. In this statement, I will discuss our preliminary  observations on the status of these recommendations as part of the  following questions:    What controls does CBP have in place to provide reasonable assurance  that ATS is effective at targeting oceangoing cargo containers with the  highest risk of smuggled weapons of mass destruction?", "How does CBP systematically analyze security inspection results and  incorporate them into ATS?", "What steps has CBP taken to better implement the rest of its targeting  strategy at the seaports?", "To address these questions, we interviewed CBP officials in headquarters  and visited six seaports: Baltimore, Charleston, Los Angeles-Long Beach,  Miami, New York-New Jersey, and Savannah.

Approximately 90 percent of the  world\u2019s trade is transported in cargo containers. In the United States  almost half of incoming trade (by value) arrives by containers aboard  ships. If terrorists smuggled a weapon of mass destruction into the nation  using a cargo container and detonated such a weapon at a seaport, the  incident could cause widespread death and damage to the immediate area,  perhaps shut down seaports nationwide, cost the U.S. economy billions of  dollars, and seriously hamper international trade.", "The Department of Homeland Security and CBP are responsible for  addressing the threat posed by terrorist smuggling of weapons in  oceangoing containers. To carry out this responsibility, CBP uses a layered  security strategy. One key element of this strategy is ATS. CBP uses ATS  to review documentation, including electronic manifest information  submitted by the ocean carriers on all arriving shipments, to help identify  containers for additional inspection. CBP requires the carriers to submit  manifest information 24 hours prior to a United States-bound sea  container being loaded onto a vessel in a foreign port. ATS is a complex  mathematical model that uses weighted rules that assign a risk score to  each arriving shipment in a container based on manifest information. As  previously discussed, CBP officers use these scores to help them make  decisions on the extent of documentary review or physical inspection to  be conducted.", "ATS is an important part of other layers in the security strategy. Under its  CSI program, CBP places staff at designated foreign seaports to work with  foreign counterparts to identify and inspect high-risk containers for  weapons of mass destruction before they are shipped to the United States.  At these foreign seaports, CBP officials use ATS to help target shipments  for inspection by foreign customs officials prior to departing for the  United States. Approximately 73 percent of cargo containers destined for  the United States originate in or go through CSI ports.", "ATS is also an important factor in the Customs-Trade Partnership Against  Terrorism (C-TPAT) program. C-TPAT is a cooperative program linking  CBP and members of the international trade community in which private  companies agree to improve the security of their supply chains in return  for a reduced likelihood that their containers will be inspected.  Specifically, C-TPAT members receive a range of benefits, some of which  could change the ATS risk characterization of their shipments, thereby  reducing the probability of extensive documentary and physical  inspection."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CBP Currently Does Not Have Reasonable Assurance That ATS Is Effective", "paragraphs": ["CBP does not yet have key controls in place to provide reasonable  assurance that ATS is effective at targeting oceangoing cargo containers  with the highest risk of containing smuggled weapons of mass destruction.

Additionally, we  reviewed CBP\u2019s manuals identifying the specific details of an inspection  completed and observed officers entering inspection results into the ATS  findings module during our site visits. Further, during these visits, we  discussed how CBP offices at the seaports may use inspection results to  enhance their targeting efforts. Last, we met with CBP officials and  reviewed CBP documentation on its current and planned findings module.", "To determine the status of recommendations from GAO\u2019s February 2004  report to (1) establish a testing and certification process for CBP staff who  complete the national targeting training to provide assurance that they  have sufficient expertise to perform targeting work and (2) work with  longshoremen\u2019s unions to address fully their safety concerns so that the  noninstrusive inspection equipment can be used to conduct inspections  efficiently and safely, we reviewed and analyzed data on the number of  officers trained and certified in sea cargo targeting. We also reviewed  CBP\u2019s Sea Cargo Training Manual as well as CBP evaluations assessing the  quality of its Sea Cargo Training course. We did not assess the quality of  this training. Regarding longshoremen\u2019s union concerns, we reviewed  scientific literature related to radiation safety and the Nuclear Regulatory  Commission guidelines on radiation levels. We also spoke with  longshoremen\u2019s representatives to discuss whether CBP had addressed  their concerns since we issued our 2004 report. Last, we also met with  CBP\u2019s Radiation Safety Officer to gain a further understanding of the  potential risks associated with CBP\u2019s inspection equipment and actions he  took to address longshoremen\u2019s concerns. We did not assess the  appropriateness of radiation safety levels used by CBP.", "We conducted our work from October 2005 through March 2006 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.", "This is a work of the U.S. government and is not subject to copyright protection in the  United States.
