With the end of the Cold War, DOD\u2019s logistics system must now support a smaller, highly mobile, high-technology force. Also, due to the pressures of budgetary limits, DOD must seek ways to make logistics processes as efficient as possible."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Air Force\u2019s Logistics System", "paragraphs": ["To provide reparable parts for its aircraft, the Air Force uses an extensive logistics system that was based on management processes, procedures, and concepts largely developed decades ago. As of September 1994, the Air Force had invested $33 billion in reparable parts for its fleet of more than 6,800 aircraft. Reparable parts are items that can be fixed and used again, such as hydraulic pumps, navigational computers, landing gear, and wing sections. The Air Force\u2019s logistics system, often referred to as a logistics pipeline, consists of a number of activities, including the purchase, storage, distribution, and repair of parts.", "The Air Force\u2019s reparable parts pipeline primarily exists to ensure that aircraft stationed around the world at Air Force installations can get the parts they need to keep them operational. It also exists to support aircraft overhaul activities, when aircraft are periodically taken out of service for structural repairs and parts replacements.", "The Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) is the organization that has primary responsibility for carrying out pipeline operations. Its tasks include determining how much inventory the Air Force needs to support its fleet, purchasing parts when necessary, and operating the facilities where major parts and aircraft repair are done. To carry out many of these tasks, AFMC has five air logistics centers (ALC) that are located in different regions throughout the United States. Each center is responsible for managing a portion of the reparable parts inventory, repairing certain parts, and overhauling specific types of aircraft. For fiscal year 1996, the Air Force estimates it will cost about $4.6 billion for maintenance of equipment and aircraft at the depot level.", "Other organizations also play a role in pipeline operations, including Air Force bases around the world, where Air Force aircraft are stationed. Although base maintenance personnel handle minor repairs, they send parts and aircraft to the ALCs for the heavier, more involved repairs. The bases, in turn, order replacement parts through the ALCs, where the bulk of Air Force inventory is stored.", "Another of these organizations is the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), which handles the warehousing and distribution operations at each of the five ALCs. In general, new and repaired parts are stored at each center in DLA warehouses until they are needed. When an order is placed for a part, DLA retrieves the part from warehouse shelves and ships it accordingly. DLA also receives the broken items being shipped from the bases and stores them until the ALC repair shops are ready to fix them.", "Figure 1.1 shows how the Air Force\u2019s inventory was distributed among Air Force bases and the ALCs (including DLA warehouses) as of September 1994. It also shows the amount of inventory in transit between the various locations.", "DLA plays another important role in pipeline operations; it provides expendable parts needed by the various Air Force repair activities. Expendable parts\u2014also known as consumables\u2014include items such as nuts, bolts, and rivets that are used extensively to fix reparable parts and aircraft. If these items are not readily available, repair operations can stall and lead to large quantities of unrepaired inventory. We have issued a series of reports on private sector practices that could be applied to DOD\u2019s expendable inventories. Each report recommended new techniques that would minimize DLA\u2019s role in storing and distributing expendable inventory."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Similarities Between Air Force and Commercial Airline Logistics Operations", "paragraphs": ["Although not as large as the Air Force, commercial airlines\u2019 operations resemble the Air Force\u2019s in several ways. First, airlines operate out of a number of different airports, and they must provide the aircraft at these locations with the parts they need. Second, airlines must periodically overhaul their aircraft and ensure that repair activities get the necessary parts. Third, the reparable parts pipeline that exists to fulfill these needs involves the purchase, storage, distribution, and repair of parts.", "In addition, for both the Air Force and commercial airlines, time plays a crucial role in the reparable parts pipeline. The amount of time involved in the various pipeline activities directly affects the responsiveness of logistics operations. For example, the longer it takes to deliver parts to a mechanic, the longer it will be before the aircraft can be repaired and ready for takeoff. Time also has a significant impact on cost. For example, the longer it takes to repair a part, the more inventory an organization must carry to ensure coverage while that part is out of service. Condensing pipeline times, therefore, simultaneously improves responsiveness and drives down costs.", "Complexity also plays an important role; it adds to costly overhead and pipeline time. For example, if an organization holds multiple layers of inventory at different locations, it must provide the space, equipment, and personnel to accommodate this inventory at each location, all of which contribute to overhead costs. Moreover, if a part must filter through each of these levels before finally reaching the end user, such as a mechanic, each stop along the way adds to pipeline time."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["As part of our continuing effort to help improve DOD\u2019s inventory management practices, the Ranking Minority Member, Subcommittee on Oversight of Government Management and the District of Columbia, Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs, requested that we compare the Air Force\u2019s management of its $33 billion reparable parts inventory with the operations of leading-edge private sector firms.

We also discussed specific Air Force logistics policies and operations and reviewed inventory records at AFMC, Dayton, Ohio.", "To examine Air Force repair facilities, other logistics operations, and the new logistics practices being tested in the Air Force, we visited the Sacramento ALC, McClellan AFB, California; San Antonio ALC, Kelly AFB, Texas; Oklahoma City ALC, Tinker AFB, Oklahoma; and Dyess AFB, Texas. At these locations, we discussed maintenance and repair activities and processes, inventory management practices, \u201cLean Logistics\u201d and reengineering program initiatives, and the potential application of additional private sector practices. We also contacted officials at the Warner Robins and Ogden ALCs to discuss and document the new business practices being tested and planned at those locations.", "Except where noted, our analysis reflects inventory valued at the last acquisition cost, as of September 1994. As highlighted in this report, the accuracy of Air Force inventory information is questionable. We did not test or otherwise validate the Air Force inventory data.", "During this review, we selected and physically examined a sample of items from the Air Force inventory that we believe highlighted the effect of the current and past DOD inventory management practices. This judgmental sample was drawn from E-3 and C-135 unique parts. Because we selected these items based on high dollar value, high levels of inventory on hand, and/or low demand rates, the results of our sample analysis cannot be projected to the total Air Force inventory.", "To identify best management practices being used by the private sector, we reviewed over 200 articles from various management and distribution publications, identified companies that were highlighted as developing innovative management practices, and visited the following organizations in the airline industry:", "American Airlines Maintenance Center, Tulsa, Oklahoma;", "British Airways Engineering, Heathrow Airport, United Kingdom;", "British Airways Avionics Engineering, Llantrissant, South Wales, United", "British Airways Maintenance Cardiff, South Wales, United Kingdom;", "United Airlines, San Francisco, California;", "United Airlines Maintenance Center, Indianapolis, Indiana;", "Boeing Commercial Airplane Group, Seattle, Washington;", "Federal Express, Memphis, Tennessee; and", "Tri-Star Aerospace Corporation, Deerfield Beach, Florida.", "At each company, we discussed and examined documentation related to the company\u2019s reengineering efforts associated with management, employees, information technology, maintenance and repair processes, and facilities.

Although the airline has reaped significant gains from improvements to date, it continues to reexamine operations and is making continuous improvements to its logistics system.", "British Airways has used an integrated approach to reengineer its logistics system. It laid out a clear corporate strategy, determined how logistics operations fit within that strategy, and tied organizationwide improvements directly to those overarching goals. With this approach, the various activities encompassed by the logistics pipeline were viewed as a series of interrelated processes rather than isolated functional areas. For example, when British Airways began changing the way parts were purchased from suppliers, it considered how those changes would affect mechanics in repair workshops.", "British Airways takes a significantly shorter time than the Air Force to move parts through the logistics pipeline.

For example, culture changes, improved data accuracy, and more efficient processes all lead to a reduction in inventories and complexity of operations. These reductions, in turn, improve an organization\u2019s ability to maintain accurate data, and they stimulate continued change in culture and processes, both of which fuel further reductions in inventory and complexity.", "Despite this integrated approach, British Airways\u2019 transformation did not follow a precise plan or occur in a rigid sequence of events.

Before reforms got underway in 1981, British Airways was an inefficient, over-staffed government organization on the brink of bankruptcy. By 1987, when privatization occurred, British Airways had substantially changed the culture that gave rise to these problems. Converting this culture has entailed appointing new top management from private industry to bring a better business focus to the organization and serve as champions of change; undertaking an initial round of drastic cost cuts, which included a 35-percent reduction in the workforce to eliminate redundant and unnecessary positions; adopting a new corporate focus and strategy in which improving customer service became the driving force behind all improvements; setting new performance measures that reflected customer service goals and corporate financial targets; instituting ongoing training and education programs to familiarize managers and employees with the new corporate philosophy; adopting total quality management principles to promote continual replacing managers who were unwilling or unable to adapt to the new negotiating agreements with employee unions to allow for a more flexible workforce."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Information Technologies", "paragraphs": ["British Airways officials said the airline could not have successfully reengineered its practices without having the right technological tools to plan, control, and measure operations.

These include the following:", "Use of third parties: The current Lean Logistics program does not include the use of third-party logistics services to store and distribute reparable parts between the bases and depot repair centers. As discussed in chapter 2, these services not only provide delivery of parts within 48 hours, they also alleviate information technology shortfalls by independently tracking parts through the storage and distribution process.", "Fast information system capability improvements: The Air Force expects the information technology improvements needed to expand Lean Logistics initiatives to come from two sources\u2014commercial software for interim solutions to its current needs and DOD-wide system improvements being managed by the Joint Logistics Systems Center (JLSC) for long-term solutions. These long-term solutions may not be available for 5 to 10 years. In contrast, British Airways fully implemented information system improvements within 3 years.", "Supplier partnerships and reduced supplier base: The Air Force has not incorporated the concept of an integrated supplier into the Lean Logistics program. As discussed in chapter 2, British Airways and some aircraft manufacturers have significantly improved their logistics systems using this concept. Improved availability of expendable parts is critical to reducing the amount of time it takes to repair component parts.", "Supplier distribution centers: Similar to the integrated supplier program, the supplier distribution center is a technique used by British Airways to minimize the amount of time it takes to receive parts from a suppler. Currently, the Lean Logistics program is not testing this concept.", "Cellular concept for repair processes: To minimize the amount of time it takes to repair parts, British Airways adopted the cellular concept that centralizes the functions and resources needed to repair a part (e.g., testing, cleaning, machining, tooling, and supplies) in one location. British Airways also applied this concept to the aircraft overhaul facilities. The Lean Logistics program has not planned to test this concept.", "Modernize existing or build new facilities to reflect new business practices: To adopt the cellular concept and improve the storage and distribution of parts, British Airways modernized existing facilities. To maximize the impact of their entire reengineered process and corporate culture, British Airways built green field site facilities and staffed them with employees selected for their technical competence as well as their flexibility for new processes and team orientation. Although new construction and modernization of logistics facilities is a very difficult aspect of reengineering for the Air Force because of base closures and funding limitations, this aspect of reengineering could be a consideration when future logistics decisions are made for supporting new weapon systems.", "A number of these additional initiatives would require new relationships between the Air Force and commercial suppliers, distributors, and other third parties.

Organizations often find changes in operations threatening and are unwilling to change current behavior until proposed ideas have been proven. This kind of resistance must be overcome if the Air Force is to expand its radical new concepts of operations.", "One of the largest obstacles to speeding up repair times is the lack of expendable parts needed to complete repairs. With a new approach to better serve its military customers, the role of DLA as the traditional supplier of consumable items and as a storage and distribution service is changing. However, at this point, DLA is still considering alternative approaches to manage expendable parts and is discussing these new concepts with contractors and the services. Until these new approaches are implemented, the Air Force\u2019s ability to improve the repair process may be limited.", "Some of the biggest gains available to the Air Force, such as improvements to outdated and unreliable inventory data systems, require management actions and funding decisions that must be made outside the responsibility of both Lean Logistics managers and the entire Air Force. In addition, some of these systems will not be fully deployed throughout the Air Force for 5 to 10 years.", "Changes in corporate culture must accompany efforts to transform operations if progress is to continue within the Air Force reengineering program. According to a Lean Logistics official, the current mindset may hinder Lean Logistics for several reasons. First, people find radical changes in operations threatening and, as is common in many organizations, resist efforts to change. Second, Lean Logistics is still a relatively new concept, and personnel lack a thorough understanding of what it is and how it will improve operations. As a result, they are unwilling to change current behaviors until Lean Logistics concepts are proven. Third, Lean Logistics does not yet have support from all of the necessary functional groups within AFMC, the Air Force, and DOD. This support will be needed if the full range of changes is to be carried out.", "In June 1994, we convened a symposium on reengineering that brought together executives from five Fortune 500 companies that have been successful in reengineering activities. The following principles for effective reengineering, reflecting panel members\u2019 views, emerged from the symposium:", "Top management must be supportive of and engaged in reengineering efforts to remove barriers and drive success.", "An organization\u2019s culture must be receptive to reengineering goals and principles.", "Major improvements and savings are realized by focusing on the business from a process rather than functional perspective.", "Processes should be selected for reengineering based on a clear notion of customer needs, anticipated benefits, and potential for success.", "Process owners should manage reengineering projects with teams that are cross-functional, maintain a proper scope, focus on customer metrics, and enforce implementation timelines.", "Panel members at the symposium expressed the view that committed and engaged top managers must support and lead reengineering efforts to ensure success because top management has the authority to encourage employees to accept reengineered roles. Also, top management has the responsibility to set the corporate agenda and define the organization\u2019s culture and the ability to remove barriers that block changes to the corporate mindset. For example, the Vice President of Reengineering at Aetna Life and Casualty Insurance Company said, \u201cTop management must drive reengineering into the organization. Middle management won\u2019t do it.\u201d", "The panelists agreed that a lack of top management commitment and engagement is the cause of most reengineering failures.", "According to the Corporate Headquarters Program Manager of Process Management at IBM, \u201cTo be successful, reengineering  embedded in the fiber of our people until it becomes a way of life.\u201d To develop a corporate culture that is receptive to reengineering, the panelists emphasized the importance of communicating reengineering goals consistently on all levels of the organization, training in skills such as negotiation and conflict resolution, and tailoring incentives and rewards to encourage and reinforce desired behaviors.", "One of the largest obstacles to speeding up repair times is the lack of expendable parts needed to complete repairs. Supplier-operated local distribution centers could help ensure quick availability of such parts. Similarly, integrated supplier programs, in which certain inventory management responsibilities are shifted to the supplier, are also aimed at improving expendable item support. We have strongly urged DLA to endorse the use of aggressive just-in-time concepts whose principal objectives are to transfer inventory management responsibilities to key distributors.", "Existing information systems are also an obstacle because they do not always provide the accurate, real-time information needed to expand current efforts beyond their limited scope. According to AFMC\u2019s deputy chief of staff for logistics, AFMC is working with systems that have not been significantly improved in 15 years. As a result, much of the data used to run the Lean Logistics demonstration projects have been collected manually, a task that project leaders said would be impossible under an Air Force-wide program.", "Improvements to material management and depot maintenance information systems\u2014key to success of the Lean Logistics initiatives\u2014are under the control of JLSC. JLSC is staffed with personnel from the military services and DLA, and is trying to standardize data systems across DOD. These systems, however, will not be fully deployed throughout the Air Force for 5 to 10 years. Currently, AFMC officials are working with JLSC officials to define Air Force requirements. They are also working to develop short-term solutions to enable the Lean Logistics program to move forward using commercial software.

The Air Force, however, could build on its reengineering effort by including additional practices pursued and successfully adopted by the private sector.", "In addition, current and future AFMC initiatives will be seriously hindered unless top-level DOD commitment and engagement is received, and all affected Air Force organizations and other DOD components\u2014specifically DLA and JLSC\u2014fully support AFMC\u2019s efforts. DLA\u2019s support will be critical for developing local distribution centers and integrated supplier programs to meet the Air Force requirements for expendable parts. JLSC officials may have to find ways that will allow the Air Force the flexibility to use existing commercial software to resolve existing information technology weaknesses and expand its reengineering initiatives.", "Without these logistics system improvements, the Air Force will continue to operate a logistics system that results in billions of dollars of wasted resources.

We also recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct the Secretary of the Air Force to incorporate additional leading-edge logistics concepts into the existing Lean Logistics program, where feasible. Specific concepts that have been proven to be successful and should be considered, but have not been incorporated in the current Air Force program include installing information systems that are commercially available to track inventory amounts, location, condition, and requirements; counting existing inventory once new systems are in place to ensure accuracy of the data; establishing closer relationships with suppliers; encouraging suppliers to establish local distribution centers near major repair depots for quick shipment of parts; using integrated supplier programs to shift to suppliers the responsibility for managing certain types of inventory; using third-party logistics services to manage the storage and distribution of reparable parts and minimize DOD information technology requirements; reorganizing workshops, using the cellular concept where appropriate, to reduce the time it takes to repair parts; and integrating successful reengineered processes and flexible, team-oriented employees in new facilities (like the green field sites) to maximize productivity improvements, as new facilities are warranted to meet changes in the types and quantities of aircraft.", "In addition, we recommend that the Secretary of the Air Force (1) prepare a report to the Secretary of Defense that defines its strategy to adopt these leading practices and expand the reengineering program Air Force-wide and (2) establish milestones for the report\u2019s preparation and issuance and identify at a minimum the barriers or obstacles that would hinder the Air Force from adopting these concepts; the investments (people, skills, and funding) required to begin testing these new concepts and the projected total costs to implement them Air Force-wide; the potential savings that could be realized; and the Air Force and other DOD components whose support will be needed to fully test these new concepts.", "We further recommend that the Secretary of Defense use the Air Force\u2019s report to set forth the actions and milestones to alleviate any barriers or obstacles (such as overcoming resistance to organizational change and improving outdated inventory information systems), provide the appropriate resources, and ensure the collaboration between the Air Force and other DOD components that would enable the Air Force to achieve an integrated approach to reengineering its processes. Once these steps are taken, we recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct the Secretary of the Air Force to institutionalize a reengineering effort that is consistent with successful private sector reengineering efforts. These efforts include communicating reengineering goals and explaining them to all levels of the organization, training in skills to enable employees to work across functions and modifying this training as necessary to support the reengineering process, and tailoring rewards and incentives to encourage and reinforce desired behaviors."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["In commenting on a draft of this report, DOD generally agreed with the findings, conclusions, and recommendations, and stated that the Air Force\u2019s Lean Logistics program should receive top-level DOD support in achieving its goals.

According to DOD, the Air Force will be asked to provide a report to the Secretary of Defense by July 1996 that will discuss the feasibility of including such additional practices in the Lean Logistics initiative and to address other concerns raised in this report. By October 1996, the Office of the Secretary of Defense will address how it plans to alleviate any barriers and obstacles identified in the Air Force\u2019s report.
