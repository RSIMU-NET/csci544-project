Self-referral occurs when a provider refers patients to entities in which the provider or the provider's family members have a financial interest. Services that can be self-referred under certain circumstances include IMRT, a common and costly treatment for prostate cancer. GAO was asked to examine Medicare self-referral trends among radiation oncology services. This report examines (1) trends in the number of and expenditures for prostate cancer-related IMRT services provided by self-referring and non-self-referring provider groups from 2006 through 2010 and (2) how the percentage of prostate cancer patients referred for IMRT may differ on the basis of whether providers self-refer. GAO analyzed Medicare Part B claims and developed a claims-based methodology to identify self-referring groups and providers.

Over this period, the number of prostate cancer-related IMRT services performed by self-referring groups increased from about 80,000 to 366,000. Consistent with that growth, expenditures associated with these services and the number of self-referring groups also increased. The growth in services performed by self-referring groups was due entirely to limited-specialty groups--groups comprised of urologists and a small number of other specialties--rather than multispecialty groups.", "Providers substantially increased the percentage of their prostate cancer patients they referred for IMRT after they began to self-refer. Providers that began self-referring in 2008 or 2009--referred to as switchers--referred 54 percent of their patients who were diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2009 for IMRT, compared to 37 percent of their patients diagnosed in 2007. In contrast, providers who did not begin to self-refer--that is, non-self-referrers and providers who self-referred the entire period--experienced much smaller changes over the same period. Among all providers who referred a Medicare beneficiary diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2009, those that self-referred were 53 percent more likely to refer their patients for IMRT and less likely to refer them for other treatments, especially a radical prostatectomy or brachytherapy. Compared to IMRT, those treatments are less costly and often considered equally appropriate but have different risks and side effects. Factors such as age, geographic location, and patient health did not explain the large differences between self-referring and non-self-referring providers. These analyses suggest that financial incentives for self-referring providers--specifically those in limited specialty groups--were likely a major factor driving the increase in the percentage of prostate cancer patients referred for IMRT. Medicare providers are generally not required to disclose that they self-refer IMRT services, and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) lacks the authority to establish such a requirement. Thus, beneficiaries may not be aware that their provider has a financial interest in recommending IMRT over alternative treatments that may be equally effective, have different risks and side effects, and are less expensive for Medicare and beneficiaries."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["Congress should consider directing the Secretary of Health and Human Services, whose agency oversees CMS, to require providers to disclose their financial interests in IMRT to their patients.

Policymakers have questioned whether some of the growth in spending  for Part B services may be attributed to self-referral, which occurs when  providers refer their patients to entities\u2014such as themselves or a group  practice\u2014in which they or a member of their families have a financial  relationship. While federal law generally prohibits self-referral under  Medicare, there are exceptions for certain services and arrangements.  Among the Medicare diagnostic and therapeutic services that may be  self-referred under one of these exceptions is intensity-modulated  radiation therapy (IMRT), a form of external beam radiation therapy  (EBRT) commonly used to treat prostate cancer. While there are multiple  effective treatments for prostate cancer, IMRT is one of the most costly  options. In 2010, expenditures for prostate cancer\u2013related IMRT services  accounted for about 55 percent of the $1.27 billion that Medicare paid for  all IMRT services under Medicare Part B.", "Questions have been raised about the effect of self-referral arrangements  on the utilization of IMRT services reimbursed under Medicare Part B.  Critics of such self-referral arrangements suggest that there may be a  financial incentive to overutilize IMRT because diagnosing providers can  earn more by self-referring IMRT services than if patients were referred  for other treatments. Other treatments for prostate cancer are often  considered equally appropriate, as experts have not established a \u201cgold  standard\u201d for the treatment of cancer that has not spread beyond the  prostate (i.e., localized prostate cancer), which represents a large  majority of newly diagnosed prostate cancers.arrangements contend that the self-referral of IMRT services does not  affect clinical decision making and that patients benefit from self-referral  through, for example, improved coordination among the providers who  diagnose and treat patients.", "You asked us to examine Medicare self-referral trends among radiation  oncology services.

Because there is no indicator or \u201cflag\u201d on the claim that identifies  whether services are self-referred or non-self-referred and the Centers for  Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the agency that administers  Medicare, has no other method for identifying whether a service was self- referred, we developed a claims-based methodology for identifying  provider group practices as self-referring or non-self-referring.  Specifically, we classified groups as self-referring if the providers who  administered IMRT for the group had a financial relationship with the  same entity as the provider who referred the IMRT service. Additionally,  in order to be considered self-referring, groups had to meet other volume- related criteria, such as self-referring at least half of the courses of IMRT  therapy the group provided. To ensure that how we defined our criteria  were reliable, we tested alternative thresholds for defining self-referring  groups and found that the observed patterns were similar regardless of  the threshold used. We also analyzed trends in the utilization of prostate  cancer\u2013related IMRT services by whether the service was performed by a  limited-specialty or multispecialty group. We defined groups as limited  specialty in a given year if more than 75 percent of its office visits were  performed by urologists, nonphysician practitioners (e.g., physician  assistants), or providers whose specialty was related to the diagnosis or  treatment of cancer, such as radiation oncologists. The remaining groups  were comprised of providers from a large number of different specialties  and were considered multispecialty groups. We examined the trends in  prostate\u2013cancer related IMRT services performed in hospital outpatient  departments for context.", "To examine how the percentage of prostate cancer patients referred for  IMRT may differ on the basis of whether providers self-refer, we  performed two separate analyses using the Medicare Part B Carrier and  hospital outpatient files. First, we compared the percentage of prostate  cancer patients that self-referring and non-self-referring providers referred  for IMRT and other treatments within a year of being diagnosed in 2007  or 2009. We classified referring providers as self-referring if they were the  performing provider on a claim that was paid to a self-referring provider  group in the year of, before, or after a beneficiary\u2019s prostate cancer  diagnosis. All other providers were considered non-self-referring. In  addition, we examined how, if at all, the referral patterns for non-self- referring and self-referring providers were affected by beneficiary  characteristics such as age, geographic location (i.e., urban or rural), and  beneficiary health. As part of our examination of beneficiary health, we  examined how, if at all, provider referral patterns were affected by clinical  characteristics of patients\u2019 prostate cancers, which were obtained from  the New York State Cancer Registry, for beneficiaries who lived in New  York and were diagnosed with prostate cancer in either 2007 or 2009.  The results of the New York analysis are not generalizable to the entire  Medicare population. We used clinical information from the New York  State Cancer Registry because such information is not available on  Medicare claims, and we determined that the geographic areas included  in another common source of such information\u2014Surveillance  Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) data\u2014did not sufficiently overlap  with areas in which IMRT self-referral was prevalent during our study  period. Second, we determined whether the percentage of providers\u2019  prostate cancer patients referred for IMRT and other treatments changed  after they began to self-refer. Specifically, we identified a group of  providers, which we called \u201cswitchers,\u201d that did not self-refer in 2006 or  2007 but began to self-refer in either 2008 or 2009. We then analyzed the  change in the percentage of switchers\u2019 newly diagnosed prostate cancer  patients referred for IMRT and other treatments before and after  switchers began to self-refer. We compared the change for this group of  providers to the change among providers who did not begin to self-refer  IMRT services during this period. For both analyses, we counted IMRT  and other treatments regardless of the setting in which they were  performed.", "We took several steps to ensure that the data used to produce this report  were sufficiently reliable.

Most men in the United States are diagnosed with  prostate cancer as a result of an abnormal digital rectal exam or prostate- specific antigen test. After an abnormal test result, beneficiaries often  undergo a prostate biopsy, during which a provider\u2014typically a  urologist\u2014removes small amounts of prostate tissue. Another provider  then examines the tissue to determine whether a beneficiary has prostate  cancer.", "IMRT is one of multiple treatment options available to patients with  prostate cancer. The type of treatment a prostate cancer patient chooses  depends on a number of different factors such as life expectancy, overall  health, personal preferences, provider recommendations, and the clinical  characteristics of a patient\u2019s prostate cancer. For many men, multiple  treatment options are considered equally appropriate. For instance,  IMRT, brachytherapy, and a radical prostatectomy are all among the  treatments considered appropriate for men with low-risk prostate  cancer. Even though such treatments are often considered equally  appropriate, the risks and side effects for each treatment are different.  Compared to IMRT, prostate cancer patients undergoing a radical  prostatectomy have a higher rate of short term urinary problems and  erectile dysfunction but do not face bowel-related side effects, which are  experienced by some men undergoing IMRT. Compared to IMRT,  prostate cancer patients undergoing brachytherapy have lower rates of  bowel-related side effects but about 1 in 10 patients undergoing  brachytherapy experience acute urinary retention.

The reimbursement rates for IMRT delivery services performed in  physician offices and hospital outpatient departments are not directly  comparable.

However, our review indicates that Medicare  providers that self-referred IMRT services\u2014particularly those practicing in  limited-specialty groups\u2014were substantially more likely to refer their  prostate cancer patients for IMRT and less likely to refer them for other,  less costly treatments, especially brachytherapy or a radical  prostatectomy, compared to providers who did not self-refer.

Despite the fact that several treatment  options are often considered equally appropriate, the higher use of IMRT  among providers who self-refer seems problematic because prostate  cancer treatments differ in terms of their risks and side effects, such as  the likelihood of developing sexual, urinary, or bowel-related side effects.  To the extent that providers\u2019 financial interests are shaping treatment  decisions, some patients may end up on a treatment course that does not  best meet their individual needs. Second, because IMRT costs more than  most other treatments, the higher use of IMRT by self-referring providers  results in higher costs for Medicare and beneficiaries. To the extent that  treatment decisions are driven by providers\u2019 financial interest and not by  patient preference, these increased costs are difficult to justify.", "Given self-referral\u2019s potential effect on both the Medicare program and  beneficiaries, it is imperative that CMS improve its ability to identify and  monitor the effects of such services. CMS is not currently well-positioned  to address self-referring providers\u2019 financial incentive to refer their  prostate cancer patients for IMRT, as CMS currently does not have a  method for easily identifying such services. Without a way to identify self- referred services, such as a self-referral flag on Medicare Part B claims,  CMS does not have the ongoing ability to monitor self-referral and its  effects on beneficiary treatment selection and costs to both Medicare and  beneficiaries.", "In addition, Medicare providers who self-refer IMRT services are  generally not required to disclose their financial interest in IMRT. Thus,  beneficiaries may not be aware that their provider has an incentive to  recommend IMRT over alternative treatments which may be equally  effective, have different risks and side effects, and are less expensive for  Medicare and beneficiaries. Beneficiaries need to select among different  prostate cancer treatment options, and beneficiary knowledge of a  referring provider\u2019s financial interest in IMRT may be an important  consideration in making these selections.

HHS stated that flagging self-referred  services and tracking their effects would not address overutilization that  occurs as a result of self-referral, would be complex to administer, and  may have unintended consequences, which HHS did not delineate. In  addition, HHS stated that the President\u2019s fiscal year 2014 budget  proposal includes a provision to exclude certain services from the in-office  ancillary services (IOAS) exception.

They said we should recommend that Congress close the  IOAS exception because the findings from the report, in combination with  previous self-referral research we and others have published, indicate the  necessity for such an action. An examination of the IOAS was beyond the  scope of our work. To the extent that IMRT self-referral is still permissible,  ASTRO representatives also said that inserting a self-referral flag would  not be an effective way to identify self-referral. Instead, they suggested  implementing reporting requirements similar to the financial transparency  requirements for physician-owned specialty hospitals under PPACA and  requiring self-referring providers to indicate on their Medicare provider  enrollment forms their financial interest in referrals. Further, ASTRO  representatives said that self-referring providers should be required to  notify patients that they may receive IMRT at alternative locations and  that other treatment options are available. We continue to believe that  inserting a self-referral flag on Medicare Part B claims would be an  effective way to track and monitor self-referral and that beneficiary  awareness of their providers\u2019 financial interests is important. However, to  the extent that other strategies exist that would allow CMS to increase  beneficiary awareness and monitor self-referral, such efforts would be  consistent with the intent of our recommendation and matter for  congressional consideration.", "AUA representatives said we did not have sufficient evidence to link  financial incentives to the increase in IMRT use among self-referring  providers and disagreed with our conclusion that financial incentives for  self-referring providers belonging to limited specialty groups were likely a  major factor driving the increase in the percentage of prostate cancer  patients referred for IMRT. Specifically, AUA representatives said the flat  trend in the utilization of prostate cancer-related IMRT services from 2007  through 2010 indicates utilization has simply shifted from hospital  outpatient departments to physician offices and that this trend  undermines our conclusion that financial incentives increase IMRT use.  As explained in our report, the trend in the percentage of patients newly  diagnosed with prostate cancer referred for IMRT was not flat; instead, it  increased over the study period. This increase occurred while the  utilization of IMRT services remained about the same in part because the  annual number of Medicare FFS beneficiaries who were diagnosed with  prostate cancer declined by about 20 percent over our study period. In  addition, we found that self-referring providers, which were predominantly  from limited-specialty groups, referred a higher percentage of their  Medicare FFS patients for IMRT than did other providers and that their  higher IMRT referral rate could not be explained by differences in age,  geographic location, or beneficiary health. As a result, we continue to  believe that financial incentives were likely a major factor driving the  higher IMRT referral rate of self-referring providers from limited-specialty  groups.", "AUA representatives had several other critiques of our report.  Specifically, they indicated that we did not put enough emphasis on the  patient\u2019s role in choosing a treatment and expressed concern that we did  not include more clinical information on patients\u2019 prostate cancer, such as  information on cancer stage and grade, or include Medicare Advantage  beneficiaries in our study population. We address two of these critiques in  the report. Specifically, we note that patient preference is one of many  factors that affect a beneficiary\u2019s treatment decision, and we include  clinical information on patients\u2019 prostate cancer for a subset of  beneficiaries from New York. However, we did not include Medicare  Advantage beneficiaries in our study population because Medicare  Advantage plans are not required to submit claims to CMS, and, thus, we  do not have detailed information on the services Medicare Advantage  beneficiaries receive or the providers who refer and perform those  services.", "Finally, AUA representatives stated that the declining percentage of self- referring providers\u2019 patients referred for brachytherapy from 2007 to 2009  could reflect a change in practice standards, as they said brachytherapy  is no longer recommended as a sole treatment for intermediate- and high- risk prostate cancer. While we note that brachytherapy use has declined  even among providers who do not self-refer, we do not believe that  changing guidelines or the possibility of differences in guideline  adherence between non-self-referring and self-referring providers could  explain in totality why self-referring providers refer a smaller percentage  of their patients for brachytherapy. First, self-referring providers referred a  substantially lower percentage of their patients for brachytherapy, even  after accounting for the decline in brachytherapy use for both non-self- referring and self-referring providers from 2007 to 2009. Second, among  those patients for whom we had clinical data, the biggest differences in  IMRT and brachytherapy use between self-referring and non-self-referring  providers were for patients with low-risk cancer, which would not be  affected by the change in practice guidelines for intermediate- and high- risk prostate cancer the AUA representatives referenced.", "LUGPA representatives disagreed with our conclusion that financial  incentives for self-referring providers\u2014specifically those in limited- specialty groups\u2014were likely a major factor driving the increase in the  percentage of prostate cancer patients referred for IMRT. Instead, they  said patient preference and an increase in the number of self-referring  providers explain the increase in IMRT utilization by self-referring  providers. While we did not perform our trend analysis at the provider  level, we do note in the report that the number of self-referring groups  increased substantially over our study period. This corresponds with a  shift in the location where patients received IMRT, from hospital  outpatient departments to physician offices. However, these trends that  we note do not negate our analysis of the referral patterns of self-referring  providers. Specifically, self-referring providers who belonged to a limited- specialty group referred a higher percentage of their newly diagnosed  prostate cancer patients for IMRT, and, thus, the increased number of   self-referring providers has also resulted in a higher percentage of  patients receiving IMRT. Also, LUPGA representatives said the increase  in the percentage of self-referring providers\u2019 patients referred for IMRT  could be due to such patients more frequently consulting with radiation  oncologists before initiating treatment, which one study indicated leads to  higher utilization of radiation therapy, defined as EBRT or  brachytherapy. We believe it is unlikely that access to a radiation  oncologist drove the differences in IMRT referrals between self-referring  and non-self-referring providers because self-referring providers who  belonged to a multispecialty group referred a substantially lower  percentage of their patients for IMRT compared to self-referring providers  who belonged to a limited-specialty group, despite the likelihood that  patients in both instances had access to a radiation oncologist within the  group practice.", "LUGPA raised several other points of concern about our review. First,  LUGPA representatives said our assertion that IMRT, brachytherapy, and  a prostatectomy are clinically equivalent treatments is inappropriate. We  disagree with LUGPA\u2019s characterization of our discussion of IMRT,  brachytherapy, and a prostatectomy as treatment options. We recognize  that these treatments are not equally appropriate for all men diagnosed  with prostate cancer and do not assert that in our report. Rather, we say  that these treatments are often\u2014not always\u2014considered equally  appropriate and give an example of when they are considered equally  appropriate\u2014men with low-risk prostate cancer. We also recognize that,  for any particular patient, a given treatment might not be appropriate due  to considerations such as age and comorbidities. Second, LUGPA  representatives said that we did not acknowledge that all sites of services  have essentially identical financial incentives to perform services for  which they receive compensation. They said our work showed the  percentage of newly diagnosed prostate cancer patients referred for  active surveillance was nearly equal between self-referring and non-self- referring providers and that this was evidence that self-referring providers  treat patients based on patient choice and sound clinical decision making.  We disagree with LUGPA's assertion that the percentage of newly   diagnosed prostate cancer patients referred for active surveillance was  nearly equal between self-referring and non-self-referring providers, as  self-referring providers were approximately 8 percent less likely to refer  their patients for active surveillance than were non-self-referring  providers. As we note in the report, IMRT is more costly than other  treatments for prostate cancer, resulting in a financial incentive for self- referring providers to refer their patients for IMRT over other treatments.  We found that self-referring providers referred a higher percentage of  their patients for IMRT than did non-self-referring providers and that the  difference in IMRT referral rates could not be explained by variations in  patient age, geographic location, or patient health status. As a result, we  continue to believe that self-referring providers\u2019 higher IMRT referral rates  are driven by a financial incentive for these providers to refer newly  diagnosed prostate cancer patients for IMRT. Third, LUGPA  representatives said we should have studied the use of IMRT for  conditions other than prostate cancer. The use of IMRT to treat other  conditions was outside the scope of our work. Finally, LUGPA  representatives indicated that our estimates of 3D-CRT utilization for  newly diagnosed prostate cancer patients are too low. We believe our  calculation of the percentage of patients who were newly diagnosed with  prostate cancer in 2009 and referred for 3D-CRT is accurate. We solicited  input from multiple physician associations, including members of LUGPA,  regarding the appropriate HCPCS codes to use to track 3D-CRT and  examined 100 percent of claims from the Medicare Carrier and hospital  outpatient department files to identify all 3D-CRT services received by  newly diagnosed prostate cancer patients.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.

We  identified IMRT services on the basis of Healthcare Common Procedure  Coding System (HCPCS) codes associated with the delivery of IMRT\u2014 77418 and 0073T. We classified IMRT services as related to prostate  cancer if the principal diagnosis code was 185 or 233.4\u2014malignant  neoplasm of the prostate or carcinoma in situ of prostate, respectively\u2014or  if one of these codes was billed on an IMRT claim and no other diagnosis  code related to another cancer was billed on the same claim.", "To determine whether prostate cancer\u2013related IMRT services from 2006  through 2010 were performed by self-referring or non-self-referring  provider groups, we first limited our analysis to only those IMRT services  in the Medicare Part B Carrier file. Because there is no indicator or \u201cflag\u201d on the claim that identifies whether services are self-referred or non-self- referred and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the  agency that administers Medicare, has no other method for identifying  whether a service was self-referred, we developed a claims-based  methodology for identifying provider group practices as self-referring or  non-self-referring. We classified groups, identified by taxpayer  identification numbers (TIN)\u2014an identification number used by the  Internal Revenue Service\u2014as self-referring in a given year if: (1) we  could identify a prostate biopsy for at least 50 percent of the prostate  cancer\u2013related IMRT episodes provided by groups, (2) at least   50 percent of these episodes were self-referred, and (3) a group had a  minimum number of 10 self-referred IMRT episodes. The remaining  groups were considered non-self-referring. To ensure that how we  defined our criteria were reliable, we tested alternative thresholds for  defining self-referring groups and found that, regardless of specification,  the rapid growth of services performed by self-referring groups persisted  and that the growth was due to limited-specialty groups. A patient\u2019s  episode of prostate cancer\u2013related IMRT was considered self-referred if  the provider who performed his prostate biopsy and the performing  provider(s) on the IMRT claim(s) billed to the same TIN in the year(s) the  IMRT services were performed, the year the biopsy was performed, or the   To find prostate biopsies for beneficiaries,  year between, if applicable.we searched through 2 years of their claims history to find the prostate  biopsy nearest to, but not after, the date of their first IMRT service. If a  beneficiary received multiple episodes of IMRT from 2006 through 2010,  we searched back 2 years from the date of the first IMRT service for each  episode. We further defined self-referring provider groups as either  limited-specialty or multispecialty groups. We defined groups as limited  specialty if more than 75 percent of its office visits in a given year were  performed by urologists, nonphysician practitioners, or physicians whose  specialty was related to the diagnosis or treatment of cancer, such as  radiation oncologists. The remaining self-referring groups were comprised  of providers from a large number of different specialties and were  considered multispecialty groups.", "To examine how the percentage of prostate cancer patients referred for  IMRT may differ on the basis of whether providers self-refer, we first  identified a list of Medicare beneficiaries who were newly diagnosed with  prostate cancer in 2007 or 2009. We used a Medicare claims-derived  date from the Chronic Condition Data Warehouse (CCDW), a CMS  database, that indicates the first occurrence of prostate cancer as a proxy  for the date on which a beneficiary was diagnosed with prostate cancer.  We further narrowed the list of prostate cancer patients we studied to  those who (1) were at least 66 years of age on their date of diagnosis,   (2) were continuously enrolled in Medicare Parts A and B in the year of,  before, and after they were diagnosed, and (3) received a prostate  biopsy on the same day as or within 1 year prior to their diagnosis. We  then analyzed prostate cancer\u2013related claims from the Medicare Part B  Carrier and hospital outpatient files to determine what types of treatments  these beneficiaries received from their diagnosis date through 1 year after  that date. We used the provider who performed a beneficiary\u2019s prostate  biopsy that was nearest to his date of diagnosis as a proxy for the  provider who referred the beneficiary for treatment. We classified referring  providers as self-referring if they were the performing provider on a claim  that was paid to a self-referring provider group in the year of, before, or  after a beneficiary\u2019s prostate cancer diagnosis. All other providers were  considered non-self-referring. Similarly, we classified providers as  belonging to a limited-specialty group if they were the performing provider  on a claim that was paid to a limited-specialty provider group in the year  of, before, or after a beneficiary\u2019s prostate cancer diagnosis. If a provider  did not belong to a limited-specialty group, we considered the provider to  belong to a multispecialty group.", "To assess the possibility that beneficiary characteristics affected the  types of treatments for which self-referring and non-self-referring  providers referred their prostate cancer patients, we examined  beneficiaries\u2019 (1) age at the time they were diagnosed with prostate  cancer, (2) geographic location (i.e., urban or rural), and (3) health,  including clinical characteristics of prostate cancers for a subset of  beneficiaries who lived in New York. We determined a beneficiary\u2019s age  at diagnosis using a beneficiary\u2019s date of birth and the date on which he  was diagnosed with prostate cancer. We defined urban settings as  metropolitan statistical areas, a geographic entity defined by the Office of  Management and Budget as a core urban area of 50,000 or more  population. We used rural-urban commuting area codes\u2014a Census tract\u2013 based classification scheme that utilizes the standard Bureau of Census  Urbanized Area and Urban Cluster definitions in combination with work- commuting information to characterize all of the nation\u2019s Census tracts  regarding their rural and urban status\u2014to identify beneficiaries as living in  metropolitan statistical areas. We considered all other settings to be  rural. We used CMS\u2019s risk score file to identify average risk score, which  serves as a proxy for beneficiary health status. For a subset of  beneficiaries who lived in New York, we obtained clinical information on  the beneficiaries\u2019 prostate cancer\u2014including information used to  determine whether the localized cancer was low, intermediate, or high  risk\u2014from the New York State Cancer Registry.prostate cancer was low, intermediate, or high risk, we used a  beneficiary\u2019s Gleason score, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and tumor   To establish whether a  stage from the New York State Cancer Registry.York analysis are not generalizable to the entire Medicare population.", "The results of the New  We also determined whether the percentage of a provider\u2019s prostate  cancer patients referred for IMRT changed after providers began to self- refer.
