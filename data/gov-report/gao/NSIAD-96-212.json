The economic and political leaders of the time developed these multilateral mechanisms to prevent a return to the destructive trade and investment isolationism of the 1930s. Among other concerns, these leaders feared that private capital markets would not provide the investment capital needed to stimulate growth, raise living standards, and promote political stability in war-torn and underdeveloped countries. Creation of a new public sector institution was deemed necessary to supplement private lending and investment in these countries. By guaranteeing the financial integrity of the institution, the member countries would enable it to borrow private capital on the open market to lend to needy countries at reasonable rates.", "To expand the potential impact of IBRD, the member countries subsequently created three affiliated institutions: the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), created specifically to encourage private investment in developing countries, and the International Development Association (IDA), which lends to the poorest countries in the world at concessional rates.", "Operationally, IBRD and IDA are one organization. Similar procedures are followed by the Bank\u2019s core staff to generate, administer, and evaluate IBRD and IDA loans.

The one exception is IDA, which has absorbed about 88 percent of the approximately $8 billion appropriated by the Congress for the Bank Group in fiscal years 1990-96.

Nonetheless, the Bank continued to receive support from the executive branch and the Congress through the Cold War era. The need to continue U.S. participation was challenged during the early 1980s. Even then, however, a comprehensive executive branch review of the World Bank and the regional development banks concluded that these banks continued to serve U.S. foreign policy interests and that the United States should, with some qualifications, continue to support them.

The U.S. contribution to support the Bank has declined substantially over the years as other member countries have increased their contributions and the Bank\u2019s financial dealings have diversified. For example, the U.S. share of donor contributions to IDA declined from about 42 percent when the association was formed to about 21 percent during the first half of the 1990s. Nonetheless, as of June 30, 1995, the United States still held the greatest share of the votes in each Bank Group institution\u2019s Board of Executive Directors.

One Bank official commented, for example, that because of U.S. concern about communist insurgency in the area, the Bank remained active in several sub-Saharan African countries long after the corrupt nature of these countries\u2019 governments became evident.", "The fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the subsequent collapse of the Soviet bloc have dramatically altered the international status quo. In the post-Cold War environment, the need to actively oppose communist expansionism no longer serves as an underlying rationale for U.S. foreign policy activities. Virtually all traditional U.S. foreign policy assumptions and instrumentalities, including support for the Bank, have come under increased scrutiny. Mounting government budget deficits in the United States (and other donor countries) have lent added urgency to scrutiny regarding the effectiveness of foreign operations spending.", "A variety of critics have opposed the continuation of traditional levels of U.S. support for the Bank, stressing that the Bank is not an effective agent for economic development. The critics argue that, good intentions aside, the Bank has not effectively facilitated real economic growth in the developing world or made progress toward reducing poverty. They point out, for example, that the number of impoverished persons in the world continues to rise despite the efforts of the Bank and other multilateral and bilateral assistance agencies. Some of the harshest criticism of Bank intervention has been leveled at the Bank\u2019s activities in sub-Saharan Africa, where the gross domestic product per capita continues to decline. Some critics argue that the availability of Bank financing permits developing countries to avoid tough choices that, if made, would lead to a better investment climate and, hence, increased private investment. Some critics point out that the Bank\u2019s own data show significant shortfalls in the ability of IBRD and IDA to achieve their objectives.

The Task Force\u2019s report concluded that the Bank needed to adopt a comprehensive plan of action to remedy problems with project design, management, and implementation. It emphasized that a contributing factor was the Bank staff\u2019s preoccupation with getting loan funds committed rather than with effectively managing existing projects.

However, we obtained broad access to Bank officials (including the President) and information through the staff of the U.S. member of the Bank\u2019s Board of Executive Directors. We also met with a number of other Executive Directors to broaden our understanding of member country views on Bank operations. We met with appropriate Bank officials, including representatives of IBRD, IDA, IFC, and MIGA, with a concentration on those offices that are particularly concerned with private sector development, such as the Vice-Presidency for Finance and Private Sector Development, the International Economics Department, and the Foreign Investment Advisory Service.", "To assist us in assessing the Bank\u2019s role in providing international financial flows to developing countries, we examined data on the composition of these flows compiled by the Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. To better understand the relationship between Bank operations and private sector flows, we interviewed 65 representatives of major commercial banks, investment houses, multinational corporations, and investment rating services that do business in developing countries and are familiar with the Bank\u2019s operations in these countries. These firms are listed in appendix II. To ensure that we obtained a broad perspective in this area, we interviewed representatives of such firms in four of the world\u2019s most important international financial centers\u2014New York, London, Tokyo, and Hong Kong\u2014and in Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, and San Francisco; and national financial centers in the developing countries that we visited.

While China, India, and Armenia are also eligible to borrow from IBRD (and are, therefore, known within the Bank as blend countries), all five of these countries are eligible for IDA assistance. We concentrated on IDA recipients because IDA absorbs most of the funds provided to the Bank Group by the United States and is the object of most of the discussion of reducing U.S. support to the Bank.", "We selected Kenya and Tanzania because some of the sharpest criticism has been directed at the Bank\u2019s operations in sub-Saharan Africa. We selected Armenia, formerly a part of the Soviet Union, to provide us with a better understanding of the utility of the Bank in facilitating a peaceful transition toward democracy and open markets among former Eastern bloc countries. We included the two largest blend countries for a number of reasons. China and India absorb a large portion of the Bank\u2019s annual lending. As of mid-1995, the two countries combined had received more than one-third of the IDA credits ever granted and about 16 percent of all IBRD loans. The two countries continue to absorb a significant share of IDA\u2019s concessional credits (over a billion and a half dollars in new commitments in fiscal year 1995) despite their recent success in attracting international private investment. Some critics have proposed that these countries, particularly China, be graduated from eligibility for IDA credits because of their increased access to international capital markets. Data on the portion of IDA, IBRD, and IFC resources directed to the countries we visited, as well as the portion of current foreign private investment in developing countries going to these countries, are displayed in table 1.4.", "Within the countries we visited, we discussed Bank operations with Bank field staff, U.S. embassy officials, officials of relevant national and local government bodies (e.g., ministries of finance and agencies using Bank funds in their operations), local representatives of the foreign assistance agencies of other major donor countries, concerned nongovernmental organizations, and the local business community.

The recent growth in private capital is clearly consistent with that goal.

Also, the presence of lower cost public money may enable recipient governments to delay necessary market reforms, further inhibiting the growth of the private sector.", "Public funding affects or distorts the underlying variables of a given market (e.g., prices and quantities demanded and supplied) when compared to a market that does not have public funding. This distortion can have either positive or negative consequences depending on the goals and effectiveness of the intended public policy, the initial conditions of a given market, the occurrence of any unintended consequences, and the impact of unforeseen external events, such as the subsequent collapse of commodity prices or the worsening of civil discord. This basic principle applies to the programs supported by the World Bank. However, measuring the impact of public funding can be quite speculative. Since public financing is available to developing countries from a wide variety of sources, both domestic and foreign (multilateral and bilateral), it is extremely difficult to establish the conditions that would have existed in the absence of public funding or to assess the amount of distortion directly attributable to the World Bank. The available aggregate data do not permit such an analysis, and thus we cannot establish a causal link between the Bank\u2019s efforts and the success or failure of a particular country\u2019s development effort.", "In lieu of such analysis, we obtained 65 private sector firms\u2019 views regarding their experiences with the World Bank and with private investment in developing countries.

Some private sector officials commented that IFC regularly takes equity positions in projects they are considering investing in. Such involvement acts as a disincentive for their firms\u2019 participation because they either prefer not to share equity or perceive that IFC exerts more influence than merited by its financial position in the project.", "We were also told that IFC\u2019s nonlending services (e.g., advisory services) have displaced commercial and investment banks that wanted to provide these services for development projects. A former U.S. Executive Director told us that during his tenure, he heard complaints from private sector officials that IFC competed with private companies in contracting for advisory services. Some business officials told us that IFC encourages borrowing entities to use IFC nonlending services or to have IFC review previously completed services, even when private partners do not see the need. Several commercial bank officials in Hong Kong and Japan also noted that IFC displaces the private sector by arranging financing, a service they would like to provide.", "Private sector officials provided several examples in which IFC displacement occurred in specific markets. One commercial bank official described a situation in which IFC displaced a small investment firm where he was formerly employed. The firm, which helped create local capital markets, had an opportunity to invest in a single-family housing project in a suburb of Jakarta, Indonesia. His firm was asked by local businessmen to participate as an equity holder and provide a medium-term loan for the project. Subsequently, IFC became involved in the project, offered a lower interest rate for the same services, and edged out the small firm. The commercial bank official said that he doubted that IFC should have been involved in the project because it already had sufficient commercial interest. In another instance, a commercial bank official told us that his bank wanted to arrange financing for a telecommunications project in Indonesia but lost out to the IFC. He said that the project\u2019s sponsors selected IFC to arrange financing for the project without going through a bidding process. He believed that the IFC typically obtained information about projects earlier than commercial banks, allowing it to outpace commercial banks that want to arrange financing.", "Problems with IFC stem, to some extent, from its somewhat contradictory mandate. According to a Managing Director of the Bank, IFC is supposed to achieve two goals: make profits and have a developmental impact (that is, catalyze investment where the private sector would otherwise be unwilling to go). He told us that Bank management had received complaints from World Bank board members that IFC is excessively oriented toward earning profits. IFC\u2019s Executive Vice President emphasized that IFC does not seek to maximize profit but instead to achieve an acceptable rate of return on its investments.

The Executive Vice President of IFC explained that both the IFC Board and the market are primary factors in directing where IFC financing goes. For example, he said that prior to the Mexican peso crisis, the IFC portfolio in that country was declining; however, after the crisis, due to the shortage of private sources of long-term financing, the Board decided IFC financing in Mexico should increase. He also said that both aggregate economic data and IFC\u2019s own experience can determine whether continuing IFC assistance is required in particular markets.

Partial risk guarantees cover risks associated with the borrowing government\u2019s contractual commitments to a project (also known as sovereign risk)\u2014for example, the stability of the regulatory regime, tariffs, and nonpayment by a publicly owned utility. Partial credit guarantees cover all events of nonpayment (both sovereign and noncommercial) for a designated period of financing.

These reform efforts rely on the active cooperation of the recipient country, and national leaders are often reluctant to accept the short-term economic and political costs of making many of these changes. These political realities often limit what the Bank can reasonably expect to accomplish. In one country, for example, Bank officials working to rationalize the inefficient, state-dominated banking system decided, out of political necessity, to retain a large number of superfluous bank employees. The likely alternative would have been intense labor union opposition.", "Effective implementation of improved management practices and concentration of resources on countries that display a greater commitment to reform may enhance the ability of Bank projects to achieve satisfactory outcomes. However, increased concentration on more challenging tasks and more challenging environments (e.g., implementing effective basic policy changes in sub-Saharan Africa) may make project success even more difficult to achieve in the future.

Bank managers and evaluators have judged 36 percent of the most recently evaluated projects to be unsatisfactory and, thus, having made an unacceptable contribution to development. The greatest rate of success of these projects has been in building physical infrastructure. The projects have had much more difficulty achieving policy and market reform objectives, which the Bank has shown to be crucial for economic development. Weak performance has been the result of a variety of shortcomings on the part of both the Bank and the borrowers as well as external factors.

However, we found in our discussions with Bank officials that investment lending has been a major tool for promoting sector policy reform, and the Bank provided us with additional data to support that this is the case. The principal focus of our discussion of development effectiveness is on the Bank\u2019s rate of success in achieving various types of objectives, including policy reform. As discussed in chapter 3, adjustment lending has had a somewhat better record in achieving policy reform objectives than investment projects have; however, the rate of success of adjustment lending is still relatively low.

Our report does point out regional differences in project success rates (see table 3.1), but our analysis of available data did not indicate that local conditions were necessarily a more important determinant of project success than other factors such as the adequacy of project design or implementation management. The Bank also considers factors other than local conditions to be critical, and several of its reform initiatives focus on them.", "Finally, Treasury emphasized that the Bank is making a serious effort at meaningful reform but that continued monitoring of the results of these reforms is important to ensure that they have a positive impact.
