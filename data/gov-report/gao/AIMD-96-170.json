Since then, IRS has performed an electronic filing marketing analysis at local levels; developed a marketing plan to promote electronic filing, and initiated a reengineering project with a goal to reduce paper tax return filing to 20 percent or less of the total tax return volume by 2000.

IRS has selected the locations for its customer service centers, developed a schedule for start-up operations, and formulated a plan for progressively expanding the workload of the new centers. Two prototype customer service centers (Nashville, TN, and Fresno, CA) are experimenting with new ways of providing customer service over the telephone.

Also, taxpayers would have access to interactive systems 24 hours a day.

Early in 1995, IRS installed automated call distributors that can send calls to other locations where IRS employees are available to answer questions. However, IRS currently routes calls using a \u201cbottom up\u201d approach\u2014i.e., the call site notifies the cognizant regional office when it is overloaded, and the regional office then notifies the National Office. On the basis of daily trend data, the National Office sends the calls to other call sites not thought to be busy. National Office staff manually log the change and log it into a terminal. However, by the time the National Office responds, the overload situation may have subsided or callers may have simply abandoned their calls. As part of its customer service vision, IRS hopes to have a \u201ctop down\u201d approach to call-routing using real-time data in 1997. This capability depends on certain technology and establishment of a National Command Center that has access to real-time call volumes for all customer service centers.", "Increasing the use of interactive systems is the third part of IRS\u2019 strategy to expand telephone service. Specifically, IRS expects that 45 percent of all taxpayers\u2019 calls will be resolved through interactive systems that would allow taxpayers to get answers to their questions and complete certain transactions, such as making tax payments or entering into installment agreements, without talking to an IRS employee. Overall, IRS expects to have 30 or more of these systems available to taxpayers by 2000. As of January 1996, IRS had developed and tested three such systems and had rolled out one of them to seven locations. Four more interactive telephone systems are scheduled to be tested in September 1996.", "We recently reported that the three interactive telephone systems that IRS has tested were difficult for taxpayers to use because IRS\u2019 telephone routing system (1) required taxpayers to remember up to eight menu options when the design guidelines called for no more than four options and (2) did not allow taxpayers to return to the main menu when they made a mistake or wanted to resolve other issues. We recommended that IRS assess the various menu options and take actions to overcome the problems caused by too many options, including using multiple toll-free numbers and providing taxpayers with a written step-by-step description of how to use the interactive systems\u2019 menus. In response to our recommendation, IRS plans to further test telephone menu options and interactive telephone systems to determine taxpayers\u2019 needs and their ability to use the system easily. The clarity of menu options will be even more critical as IRS plans to expand its use of interactive systems.", "The final part of IRS\u2019 strategy is to reduce the need for taxpayers to call IRS. IRS plans to do this in several ways. In the near term, demand on IRS\u2019 customer service centers is to be reduced by eliminating unnecessary notices. In that regard, as part of a recent notice reengineering project, IRS decided to eliminate certain notices. When the recommendations from the reengineering effort are fully effective in fiscal year 1997, IRS expects to be issuing almost 46 million fewer notices annually to taxpayers. By eliminating those notices, IRS expects to receive 9 to 10 million fewer telephone calls from taxpayers.", "In the longer term, IRS plans to reduce demand by successfully responding to more taxpayer issues with only one contact.

When an employee did not have access to the account information needed to respond to a taxpayer\u2019s question, the employee typically wrote down the question, mailed it to the location that had access to the information, and the staff of that location would then respond to the taxpayer.", "Early in 1995, IRS implemented a networking capability among the 10 service centers so that employees could have access to IDRS data nationwide. This networking capability is referred to as Universal IDRS. Although Universal IDRS gives IRS employees access to taxpayer account information nationwide, IDRS does not always contain complete information on a taxpayer\u2019s account. Other information needed to help the taxpayer may reside in systems that are not linked to IDRS. For example, an IRS employee using IDRS might know that a taxpayer was sent an underreporter notice, but would not have access to the actual notice. That notice is contained in IRS\u2019 Automated Underreporter System. Only by going into that system could an assistor find such information as the amount of unreported income and the source (e.g., an interest payment to the taxpayer that was reported to IRS by a financial institution but not by the taxpayer).", "To resolve these kinds of problems, IRS eventually intends to provide its employees with access to greater amounts of on-line taxpayer data in shorter time frames than those for the current IDRS data.

The fiscal year 1997 TSM funding levels proposed by the House and Senate\u2014which are more severe than the 1996 cuts\u2014will require even further reassessment.", "One of the managerial weaknesses discussed in our July 1995 report that has significant programmatic implications was a lack of integration of IRS\u2019 reengineering efforts and TSM projects. Specifically, we said that IRS\u2019 reengineering efforts were not tied to its TSM projects and that IRS lacked a comprehensive plan and schedule defining how and when to integrate these business reengineering efforts with ongoing TSM projects.", "The reengineering efforts we referred to in July 1995 were put on hold pending the outcome of IRS\u2019 reassessment of TSM. As a result of the recent reassessment, IRS decided to reengineer \u201cthe tax settlement process.\u201d IRS has defined that process as beginning at the point taxpayers collect information necessary for the filing of tax returns and ending when the current year tax account is satisfied or enforcement action is initiated. IRS has identified 18 high-level subprocesses within that process, one of which focuses on IRS\u2019 tax return processing activity that we mentioned earlier.", "We question IRS\u2019 ability to make sound investment decisions on TSM until reengineering of important processes, such as tax return processing, are sufficiently completed. Reengineering lags well behind the TSM effort, whereas it should be ahead of it\u2014defining and directing the technology investments needed to support new, more efficient business processes. Reengineering could result in new business requirements that are not addressed by planned TSM projects or that make those projects obsolete. For example, if IRS decides that it is cost effective to outsource paper tax return processing, it will not need the scanning and imaging technologies that are being designed as a TSM project.", "Until clearly defined business requirements drive TSM projects, there is no assurance that TSM projects will achieve the desired objectives and result in improved operations. IRS must clearly define its business needs and determine the most cost-effective means for meeting those needs to ensure that it makes effective use of funds provided for information technology projects.", "We look forward to working with the Commission as it examines IRS\u2019 organization and operations to identify and recommend actions to expedite the implementation of TSM and improve service to taxpayers. With the Commission, Congress has created an excellent opportunity to bring about long-term, fundamental organizational and management changes at IRS. The Commission\u2019s work could help provide the added impetus necessary to develop an effective implementation strategy for IRS\u2019 business vision, build a strong technical foundation for TSM, and ensure the reliability of financial information and systems.", "This concludes my statement.
